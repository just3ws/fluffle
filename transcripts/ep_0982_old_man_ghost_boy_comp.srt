1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 A man who does not believe the Mandela effect is a real phenomenon is confronted with information

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 that he may be the Mandela effect.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 It's not Nelson Mandela.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 He's not on this show.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 But you know what I mean?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 You're like, "I have no idea, Jason."

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then you'll find out when you listen to the episode.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And then we travel to Australia to meet a little boy and his imaginary friend.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 But is it possible that this little boy's imaginary playmate could unveil a dark secret

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 about the relationship between time and death today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 [Music]

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I hope you guys had an awesome Thanksgiving.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We are starting off season 20, the countdown to episode 1,000 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 That is amazing and I couldn't have done it without you guys.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Thank you so much for your support.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And someone who supported the show during the Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving livestream,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Everyone give it up for Ba June.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Woohoo!

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Yeah!

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Come on in.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Come on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 That Thanksgiving livestream was pretty fun.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We went for two hours and talked about a whole bunch of stuff.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Thanks everyone who showed up.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And if you couldn't show up, totally understand.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's Thanksgiving, right?

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 People have other stuff to do and they're driving around.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 They're hanging out with their friends and family.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I totally get it.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But Ba June made a very generous donation during our livestream.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So you're going to be our captain or our pilot this episode.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 That helps out so much.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Ba June lets dust off the Jason Jalopy and we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Drive us all the way out too.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 An elementary school.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 [Panting]

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Now I gotta say, before we get the story started, this story sounds...

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Even among the stuff we cover on this show, this story sounds super made up.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And it could be...

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Right?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 It could totally be made up.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 But if it's true...

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 What a story, man.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 What a story.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Now I'm sure if it isn't made up, at least one person is going to be laughing really loud and be like, "Oh what? I fooled them."

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I fooled Jason.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I hope it's not true.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Well, it's hard to say, right?

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Because if it's made up, then I've just wasted your time.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And I made myself look like a fool.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But if it's true, this could be one of the weirdest Mandela effects we've come across.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Then that'd be awesome.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We're hanging out at this elementary school.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It's back in 1984, around there.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 We're going to meet a young boy named Morris.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 He's sitting there on the playground, hands in his pockets, his Oshkosh bagosh overalls.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And these kids are like, "Hey Morris, what's going on?"

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And he's like, "Hey, buddy, how's life?"

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 He's a very deep thinker for an elementary school student.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 His friends are like, "Hey Morris, did you hear about that spooky movie?"

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "Heard about that really cool spooky movie that's out right now?"

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Morris is like, "No, not really.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I'm in elementary school. I don't watch a lot of spooky movies."

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And they go, "Well, we have big brothers, so we do. And there's a movie out right now."

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And the villains named Morris.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Morris, Morris, please don't kill us.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And he's like, "What? That's kind of a grim taunt."

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But it fits, because there was a horror movie that had just come out,

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 and the killer in it, the blood-soaked maniac in this movie, went by the name of Morris Knight.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And he goes, Morris goes, "Listen, you know, it was gentle-teasy, right?"

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I mean, they did say that I was going to murder them.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But he goes, "It wasn't anything too intense.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Like, they-I would get teased now, and then this movie came out.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 This guy named Morris Knight was killing all these teenagers.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And yeah, my name's Morris. I get it. It's probably their not most common name, sure."

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He said eventually he did see the movie for himself, and he was a kid.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And it was about this serial killer named Morris.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And they're trying to find out the identity of this killer, because they needed a clue to be able,

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 if they uncover his identity, it'll give them an idea of what they're up against.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 These teenagers are trying to figure out who's killing them one by one.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And they find out at the end, the killer's name is Morris Knight.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Morris was like, "That's kind of dumb. Like, there's nothing wrong with the name Morris!" Morris exclaimed.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But Morris Knight doesn't even make any sense. It's not like scary or anything like that, or whatever.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So now I know why people are, again, lightly ribbing me.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I wasn't a full-on bullying situation. They weren't afraid he was going to murder them one by one after all.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 He goes, "But I'd come to terms with the fact that I was named after a famous horror movie villain."

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And I have to say I'm going to interject myself here for a second.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 When I was a kid, the fact that there was a killer named Jason Vorhees-- I didn't think about this.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 I've read this story multiple times since I was typing the notes up.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I just remembered that my name's Jason, and growing up, there was a gentle ribbing.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 People would call me Jason Vorhees all the time and stuff like that.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And I hated it. I absolutely hated it. I don't mind it. Those movies scared me so bad.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I never really watched any of the Friday the 13th movies until I was much, much older.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 But they scared me so bad. But if someone called me Jason or Jason Vorhees or something like that, people still do that.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 They're like, "Hey, like the serial killer." Whatever. You do get it.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 There's worse things to be made fun of about, I guess, being compared to a 6'6" supernatural serial killer.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Yeah, you know. That's fine.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So I get where he's coming from. There is this weird-- and Jason's not the most uncommon name,

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 and people still make that connection between Jason Vorhees and Jason Carbner.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 But you just kind of go on with it, right?

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Well, he ends up at one point going, "You know what would be really funny?"

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Because now he's in high school, and now he's in high school, he goes, "You know what would be funny? I'm going to dress up as Morris Knight."

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And everyone will get it. Morris is dressed up as Morris Knight. It'll be really funny.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And he says, "Sure enough, that's what happened. He went to high school. He was dressed up as Morris Knight."

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And people are like, "Oh, dude, we totally get it. Your name's Warren."

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Well, let's fast forward now to just a couple months ago. It's October 2022.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 You know, Halloween time. People are getting ready to get scared.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And Morris goes, "You know what, actually, I should rewatch that horror movie from when I was a kid."

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Because it's been 20, 30, close to 40 years since the last time I saw it, right?

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 It was in elementary school in the 80s. I'm going to watch that horror movie.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 That famous horror movie about the killer Morris Knight.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So Morris puts it in, probably downloads it right-streaming it.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And he's watching it.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 But this is not the movie he remembers.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Sure, the plot elements are the same.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Pretty much it's all the same.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But the character's name is not Morris Knight.

125
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And he's watching this movie, and the further the movie goes along, the deeper the dread in Morris.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Because he's really starting to trip out now.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He knows for certain that this movie was about a serial killer named Morris.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And he knows it for certain because he experienced it throughout his life.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Morris says, "Listen, I have not been a huge believer in the Mandela Effect,

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 because I've always thought it was things that were so unrelated to somebody's existence,

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and they have a half-memory of it, that they just go, 'Oh, no, no, I remember it used to be the Berenstein Bears.'

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Or, 'I remember there used to be a cornucopia on Fruit of the Loom.'

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 When the fact of the matter is, like, when we were kids, first of all, none of us bought our own underwear, right?

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Our parents or your orphanage bought you the underwear.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And I never looked too closely at it. I'm pretty sure the cornucopia was in the Fruit of the Loom logo.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I'm pretty sure, but I'm going off memories of me being eight, opening a bag of underwear.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I mean, they were instantly faded, right? I went through underwear like a baby does diapers.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 But maybe, right? You could say a lot of the stuff when you get to things like Captain Crunch versus Captain Crunch.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You can go, 'Well, you know, these people, they weren't working on the boat of the captain himself.'

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They ate it maybe once every couple of weeks, and then they didn't think about it for 30 years, and then they see the logos change, and they're like, 'Ah.'

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Morris goes, 'But that's not the case with this one. This was part of my childhood.'

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 This character's name is Morris Knight. I know that for a fact, because I was teased about this in elementary school.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 When I dressed up as this character for Halloween as a teenager, people still got the joke.

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 This character's name is Morris Knight. This is not a Mandela Effect where it's just some vague recollection.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I know for a fact this character's name is Morris Knight, but as I'm sitting here and watching this horror movie titled A Nightmare on Elm Street,

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 this character's name is not Morris Knight. It's Freddy Krueger.

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And I know 100%. I know 100% of this character's name used to be Morris Knight.

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I have no idea who this Freddy Krueger dude is. I will admit that's a better name, but it used to be Morris Knight. I know that for a fact.

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So Morris ended up messaging one of his buddies, who is a big believer in the Mandela Effect.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 He messages one of his buddies and goes, 'Dude, listen, I know I've given you a bunch of grief. I know that I spray-painted Bernstein all over your house that one night.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I know I've given you a bunch of grief about believing in the Mandela Effect, but I actually found one that I know for certain got changed in the timeline.'

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You know that movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street? The movie starring Morris Knight. The character's name is Morris Knight.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And I know that because my name is Morris. And Morris begins to text out this entire story that I've just told you.

154
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Grew up getting teased. Morris... Now he's watching this movie in 2022 and the character's name is Freddy Krueger.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 What is going on? This doesn't make any sense. I know for a fact it was Morris because I got teased all the time and he's texting all of this stuff out.

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And his friend responds, 'Dude, what in the world? Even for the most hardcore Mandela Effect person, right?'

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 The friend goes, 'What in the world are you going on about?'

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Now Morris figured he would get this response from his buddy, but then what his friend said next was,

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 'Dude, what are you talking about? Your name is Freddy.'

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And Morris said he looked down at his phone and he was just staring at it. Staring at that last message his friend sent, 'Your name is Freddy.'

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Morris grabs his wallet, looks at his ID card, 'Frederick,' it says on the ID card.

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Frederick, formerly known as Morris, said he felt like he was going insane.

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He thought for the past however long, right? He's a little kid. He probably calls him my age, a little kid in the 1980s.

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Up till that moment he believed his name was Morris, but now his name's Frederick on his government ID.

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 His best friend calls him Freddy and it all hits him at once. He actually thinks he's going crazy, which is a totally acceptable thing, right?

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 He said he called his parents in a panic which would be an alarming phone call, 'Mom, Dad!'

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I think I'm crazy! I think I'm crazy! I think I'm crazy!

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Frederick said that he actually then made an appointment with a doctor and over a period of time was having multiple visits done and getting tested for, you know, the good old mental illness test.

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 They take a little bit of your blood, swirl it around, look for the crazy gene. He said that he had been checked out and the doctor said, 'You're not nuts.'

170
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 At least there's nothing we can see biological. We don't see like a brain tumor. We don't see anything like that going on.

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 But you might want to go see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but as far as biologically speaking, we don't see anything wrong with you.

172
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 No amnesia. No underlying mental issues that we know of.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And that's the story of Frederick, aka Morris, aka a man who became the Mandela Effect himself. This is a super fascinating story.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I found it posted anonymously on the export. It 100% could be made up. Trust me, it totally could be made up, right? Which would suck!

175
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And I would apologize for wasting your time.

176
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But in the idea of what we think of the Mandela Effect, it does track, right? The Mandela Effect is basically the theory behind his timelines shifting.

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Now, like he said earlier, the Mandela Effect tends to be stuff that doesn't affect your life. It tends to be these changes that whether or not Darth Vader said, ' Luke, I am your father,' or 'No, I am your father,' whether or not he said either one.

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 It doesn't affect your life in any real way. But this one he remembered. He absolutely remembered. It was so personal to him.

179
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 If the movie just changed, right? If Morris' name remained Morris, but he watched a Nightmare on Home Street in the year 2022 and he saw the character's name was Freddy Krueger, that would be crazy.

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Because he's like, 'I know for a fact I was teased about this all the time.' But now we have his name also changing as well. We have Morris' name also changing.

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It's a Frederick that's so weird because it's like when he's, we accept the Mandela Theory, the Mandela Effect theory is fact.

182
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 When he switched universes and when he got slotted into this one, whatever mechanism causes the Mandela Effect, make sure that he ended up in a universe that the horror movie villain from the 1980s had the same name as it had before.

183
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Would it have been even more jarring if the character's name in the movie was Freddy Krueger in this universe, but his name was Morris?

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I can't imagine, I can't imagine that would be more jarring than finding out his name was Freddy this entire time. It's just weird.

185
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Like you would basically have two variables, his name and the character's name and out of all the things that could change in the universe, those are the two details that changed as they're flying through the multiverse.

186
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I mean if you accept the Mandela Effect as a real phenomenon, you'd have to wonder about all the movies you've never watched.

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I would never know if a plot point changed in Bermuda's intrigue, some lifetime movie of the week starring Jessica Morris as a land developer in Bermuda, and she falls in love with a dude who happens to be a bad guy.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I would have no idea if that plot changed. It changed a thousand times in a day, I would have no idea.

189
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Imagine how many times these events, these changes could be happening that we're not aware of.

190
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 It's just interesting because it could be happening all the time, but he has such a personal connection to it. His name changed and it changed to match a horror movie villain.

191
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Like what does it mean? It's actually such a perfect story that's what makes me think it could be fake, right?

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 But I wanted to share that with you. I thought it was really interesting. I really do.

193
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So Frederick, if you're out there, try not to go crazy, try not to go too crazy.

194
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And if you do, don't get a job as a janitor at an elementary school. It will not end up well for you.

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I guess I shouldn't say that. He might be a janitor right now. He's like, "Is that a threat? Are you going to get me fired?"

196
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 "Bad June, let's go ahead and get out the world famous carbonicopter. We're leaving behind this man."

197
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He's in the throes of insanity. He's like, "Ah, my name, my name!"

198
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 We're like, "See you later, dude. See you later, possibly psychotic man. We're leaving behind this dude. Let's fly all the way out to Australia."

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 This is one of those stories that we don't have a specific time period of when it took place.

200
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I would say relative, you know, relative modern age, right?

201
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 We're not in the 19th century steampunk era, probably in the past 20 years around there.

202
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I don't have a specific location. I was able to go through this person's posting history, find out she's from Australia.

203
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 She lives in Australia. So somewhere in the great wilderness of the continent of Australia, this story takes place.

204
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It was posted by someone who goes by the name "Am Kuala Bear." We're going to go ahead and call her Maggie.

205
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 This story starts like this. Maggie and her husband have a little boy, a little two-year-old boy, and they're living in this house somewhere in Australia.

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 It's a rental house. It's not one that they own, but they're making it their own, right?

207
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 They're actually changing the deed. They're doing that mortgage scam. They're stealing it from some old lady.

208
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 No, they're making it their place. They're turning this house into a home type of thing.

209
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But what they notice is they're a little boy. We're going to call him Joey.

210
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Joey, while living at this house, he's two years old. He meets an imaginary friend or creates one, right?

211
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I've never had kids. I don't know how that works. I had imaginary friends when I was a kid.

212
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Good old Frederick Kruger. He killed all my enemies. No, but I don't remember the mechanism. I knew they weren't real.

213
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 I knew they weren't real, but I'm wondering, like, do you parents sit there and go?

214
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's that time, the kids too. He's going to start imagining possibly spooky guys running around.

215
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 You would wonder, I think, if you were a parent and you were a believer in the paranormal, I wonder if you would go through that.

216
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Is it a ghost or an imaginary friend? You would have to ask yourself that.

217
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Maybe not. Maybe most parents don't think that their kids are contacting Cthulhu whenever they're like, "Oh, I have a friend. His name is Jenny."

218
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But when we have Joey here, his imaginary friend, the way that they really start to figure out what's going on is they wouldn't know.

219
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 This sounds kind of funny. They would notice their little boy, the son, he would take his toys and he would throw them down the hallway.

220
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 There was this long hallway that ran through the house that connected the bulk of the house to the garage.

221
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He would throw his toys down the hallway and then he would turn around and he would mumble to himself as he was walking back into the living room.

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Parents are like, "What in the world are you doing, bro?" And he goes, "There's a boy who wants to play with the toy."

223
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I don't know why it sounds like Jack Nicholson. Let me not do a kid voice.

224
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The little boy goes, "There's my friend. He's down the hallway. He wants to play with my toys, so I throw my toys to him."

225
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 It's super interesting. I don't want to dissect it right now. We'll talk about it. I don't want to go on too many diversions.

226
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But remind me of that. Remind this recording to bring that idea back up of him throwing toys on the hallway.

227
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 So time goes on and Joey keeps interacting with his imaginary friend and the parents start to ask him questions about the imaginary friend.

228
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Maggie goes, "What's his name? What's your imaginary friend's name?"

229
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And Joey goes, "His name's Don. His name's Don, like D-O-N."

230
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And he describes Don as a little boy. He describes Don as a little boy, which would make sense.

231
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Which makes sense, right? Age-appropriate. I mean, Pete's dragon. I don't know how old he was. Actually, he was an imaginary. He was real.

232
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Actually, he's a fictional character. He's a fictional character, so it doesn't matter what he was an imaginary in the movie.

233
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Anyways, Don was a little boy who was in the house with his family, his imaginary friend, who was interacting with Joey.

234
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 She asks, like, "What's his name?" That's a totally normal question. But then she's asking, "What is he doing here? Why is he here?"

235
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Which makes me think that maybe she thought there was something paranormal going on.

236
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 The mom goes, "Why is he here?" And Joey always had the same answer. Joey would always say, "He's waiting for his mom to pick him up."

237
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So he's throwing the toys down the hallway. He's talking to Don, and he always has the same answer to what he's doing there.

238
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 What's Don doing here? He's waiting for his mom to pick him up. Everything seems to be fairly normal.

239
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Kids have imaginary friends, hyper-imaginations, right? They're constantly saying totally weird stuff. Borderline creepy stuff.

240
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 What happens is this starts to escalate where Maggie and her husband are in bed, and all of a sudden they hear Joey screaming from his room.

241
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And they get up and they run into the room, and thankfully Joey's just laying there in bed. But Joey says he can't sleep.

242
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I can't sleep, mom. I can't sleep. Whenever I close my eyes to fall asleep, Don shows up. And I'm trying to sleep, and he keeps tickling my toes.

243
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And I want him to stop. I want to go to sleep. But he stands there at the edge of my bed and he tickles my toes, and I can't sleep, and it makes me so mad.

244
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And this goes on for a while, like, not just that night. This goes on for a while. Joey says when I'm trying to sleep, Don comes into the bedroom and tickles his toes, and he's doing it to irritate him.

245
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Joey just wants to get a good night's sleep. So eventually Joey starts sleeping with the parents.

246
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Well, one day, Maggie and her husband get a notification from the real estate agent saying that they're going to have to leave the house. They're going to leave the house.

247
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 This was a short-term rental, but it was a little shorter than they had planned. What had happened was, while they were living there, the owner of the house passed away.

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And he'd passed away for about the past six months or so.

249
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And the family was deciding what to do with the property. But at this point, they've decided to sell it, and they're going to split the earnings, split the money from the house.

250
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 So this family's going to have to find the new home. And they're totally fine with it. We'll go. We'll find some place else. Everything will be fine.

251
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And they do.

252
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And Don doesn't follow them to the new house.

253
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 You could easily chalk this up to being an imaginary friend. You could even chalk this up to it being a ghost boy in the house, being mistaken as an imaginary friend.

254
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 There's so many, we see so many stories like this. It could be a tulpa, right? The kid is imagining the friend.

255
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So I don't know if children can create tulpas, honestly, but possibly. I mean, their imagination, they don't know what's real. Children don't.

256
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 So maybe they're more likely to create tulpas. But anyways, you have a possibility that is a ghost, mistaken for an imaginary friend.

257
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You have an imaginary friend, and the boy is imagining all of this.

258
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 You have the kid having an imaginary friend he believed in so much, it became a thought form, it could tickle him in the middle of the night. All sorts of stuff.

259
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 But that's not the wrap up to the story, because there's something even weirder going on here.

260
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 What happens is, a while after they've moved out, this takes place a while after Maggie and Joey and the husband have left this house,

261
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Maggie comes across the news article from a local newspaper, local news website, what have you,

262
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and it talked about Don.

263
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 She's reading this article, "Don was a real person."

264
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 So what we were looking at was a ghost.

265
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 But here's the weirdest part of all of this, and I've really been trying to think of another example of this.

266
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Don, that was the house he grew up in. He grew up in that house with a single mother.

267
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 But Don died as an old man.

268
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Don was the owner of the house who died not in the house. Don did not die in that house. Don died somewhere else.

269
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And for the six months between his death and them being told they had to move out, that was the six months when the family,

270
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 above them, not Maggie and Joey and the husband, the owners of the house, that family was deciding what to do with the house.

271
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And that coincides with the six months that Joey saw the child, Don.

272
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 What we're getting at is an elderly man. It doesn't necessarily say he's elderly, but obviously he has adult children.

273
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 So Don's probably in his 60s or 70s.

274
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 He grew up in his household, raised by a single mother. He was a baby in that house and a kid in that house,

275
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and eventually he struck out on his own, but he always owned that house.

276
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He dies, but his ghost in that house is a little boy.

277
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I cannot think of another time we've come across this. I almost feel this episode is going to go a little bit long because I have a ton of stuff to say about this.

278
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 This is such an interesting phenomenon.

279
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I will say this too. We'll go back to the hallway about him throwing the toys down the hallway.

280
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Generally, if you're handling a toy to somebody that you like, that you're not scared of, you just hand it to him.

281
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 The fact that he was throwing the toys down the hallway and then walking away murmuring makes me think that even Joey was a little off put by this phantom.

282
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Even Joey, even though he did interact with this dude, this little boy ghost who we find out later was a 70 year old man.

283
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 It sounds like a Marlon Wayne's movie. He seemed to be scared of it.

284
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 There's one other story I know of where kids were throwing toys to the ghost. That was that terrifying one.

285
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I'll try to find it in the show notes, but it was on a military base.

286
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 If I remember correctly, there was a house that burned down with a bunch of children in it, or maybe they got brutally murdered by their dad.

287
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It was one of the two. Four or five kids died.

288
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Right next to it, there was a daycare center.

289
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 The two things didn't exist at the same time.

290
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 This, I think, was an unused plot of land since the murder or the burning.

291
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 It was one of the two, or maybe both.

292
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 The next one was this daycare center that was built later.

293
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 The daycare kids would throw their toys over the fence to this unused piece of property.

294
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The teachers were like, "Dude, those toys cost money. Why do you keep throwing those over the fence?"

295
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And the kids go because the children on the other side of the fence want to play with the toys, too.

296
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 So the idea was the victims of whatever tragedy happened. They were still there, and only the kids could see them.

297
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I believe those kids would have easily handed those toys to those kids if they could have.

298
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 They had to throw them over the fence because that was the only way they could get them there.

299
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 They didn't seem to be scared of those fandoms, but the fact that he's throwing this stuff down the hallway

300
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 doesn't make it seem like Joey was not totally comfortable with Don.

301
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 But the idea that we have, like I've been trying to think of another phenomenon like this,

302
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 and the only one that I could come up with was the ending of Titanic, right?

303
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Where Rose was this old lady. She was walking around on the boat being all old and stuff.

304
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And then when she died, she was super hot. Kate Winslet.

305
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I can't use that as evidence, right? I can't go, "Well, paranormal researchers, let's remember the haunting of the Titanic."

306
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 They're like, "What? What are you talking about?" You had that.

307
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Listen, it would make sense that you wouldn't be a ghost in a wheelchair.

308
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And now that I think about it, I can't think of a time, I know there's like haunted hospitals where you might hear the sound of the wheelchairs,

309
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 but if you were paralyzed from the neck down and then you died, I don't think your ghost would be paralyzed from the neck down.

310
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I have nothing to back that up. I mean, there are stories of ghost peg leg pirates that they make a clumpety-clump sound as they're walking around on their peg leg.

311
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 But see, now we're getting into the whole, because when I was telling this story to my friend Sabine, she goes,

312
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 "Is it possible that this was like a residual recording type of ghost?"

313
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And that's why it's a little boy and not the old man as he died. And I go, "It's unlikely because it's interacting with these people."

314
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 The recording theory of ghosts, which I do think explains a lot of ghosts, is there's a strong emotional charge in an area,

315
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 and a happy memory or a tragic memory is played over and over again.

316
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 So that's why at 3 a.m. every so often you wake up in the middle of the night, you go to the fridge to get some leftover stuffin' from Thanksgiving,

317
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 and you see a naked man standing in your doorway.

318
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I would always say default that there might actually be a real person. Don't go, "Well, that's a ghost."

319
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 That guy, that obvious hobo who broke in, that's a ghost.

320
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 But you know, at some point, a man died in his underwear in your living room, and so his ghost shows up, like almost as a recording.

321
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He was so depressed, he was so depressed, he's like, "Oh, I didn't die in my furry outfit. I'm gonna be remembered as an underwear ghost."

322
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 But the fact that he was tickling them, the fact that they assumed to be some sort of conversation going on, like, "Give me your toys,"

323
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 or "Can I play with your toys?" "Hey, Joey, you wanna play?"

324
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Makes me think it wasn't a recording. It's so fascinating, though, because it does really open up to what you are as a ghost.

325
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 We recently did an episode, "Why Aren't There A Lot Of Fat Ghosts?" when there's a lot of overweight people out there.

326
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And I would argue we don't have as many elderly people ghosts as we would assume was out there.

327
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Ghosts all seem to fall in an age range of child, you know, creepy child ghosts.

328
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 All the way up, I mean, honestly, when you think about it, maybe to their 50s.

329
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We don't see a lot of stories of elderly ghosts dying on the toilet.

330
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 When I think statistically, that there should be a lot of them.

331
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 So is it possible that when you're a ghost, whatever phenomenon creates ghosts, that you actually become what you want to be?

332
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And that's what we were kind of talking about with the overweight ghost.

333
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Like, is it possible that if you died, you're 350 pounds, you died?

334
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 That's not how you saw yourself in life. That's how your physical representation was, but you always saw yourself as being different.

335
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Like I said, when I'm overweight, right? I'm like 290. I don't have dreams. I'm not fat in my dreams.

336
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 So that's not how my mind sees my own body.

337
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 So is it possible that when you die, if you become a ghost, and again, we don't know what that mechanism is, because not everyone's a ghost,

338
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 but is there something about you becoming how you see yourself?

339
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 And then, or is it, I mean, again, here we have an old man, again, we don't have his age, but we're going to assume he's 60s,

340
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 because he has adult children who are trying to decide what happens to his house.

341
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And then he becomes a boy as a ghost. That's so fascinating. It's such a fascinating story.

342
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Again, if it's real, it could totally be made up.

343
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 But it's such a fascinating story, because it forces us to look at that question.

344
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 What is aging vis-à-vis death?

345
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 We do know that the body can age so much, it just stops working, but does your physical age correspond to your soul?

346
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 How your soul will look?

347
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And we don't have the answer for that. We don't have the answer for so much.

348
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And it would be interesting, because remember, they sold the house and its family moved.

349
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Is Dawn's spirit still in this house? Is Dawn's spirit still this little boy interacting with other children living here?

350
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 There's just so many unanswered questions, and there's so much for us to explore.

351
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 And this one's a big question.

352
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And it would explain why we don't have a bunch of elderly ghosts floating around.

353
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Because that's not the form they're choosing.

354
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And then you really have to think, all of these children, ghosts we do get reports of,

355
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 how many of them are adults?

356
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Like, think about it, if you woke up in the middle of the night and you saw a little boy, the ghost of a little boy, standing in the corner.

357
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 He's standing in the opposite corner from the underwear, man.

358
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 You see a little ghost boy standing in the corner, at this point you're having a heart attack.

359
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 At this point you're just not, you're not even thinking about having things give me leftovers at this point.

360
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 You're trying to keep from becoming a ghost yourself.

361
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But if you saw a little boy ghost, you know, huddled in the corner shivering,

362
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 you're like, "Just why do you keep making it more creepy as you're clutching your chest?"

363
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 You would think like, "Wow, that would suck, right? A little boy ghost, he died as a little boy."

364
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 But let me ask you, what's creepier? What's creepier?

365
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Having your house haunted by a little boy, or having your house haunted by a little boy who's actually a 38-year-old man.

366
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Because I figure as creepy as a little boy would be, like he could stand in the corner of the room, you gotta get bored of that.

367
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 You turn him into an end table, you have like a little piece of wood bouncing on his head.

368
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Little boy, I mean, very worse than Dennis the Menace, right? He's breaking your windows, he's making your vases fly around and stuff like that.

369
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But a little boy can only do so much.

370
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Sure, you probably try to switch souls with one of your living kids, but other than that.

371
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 But imagine the type of weirdness you would have.

372
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 You had a little boy who actually had the mind of a 38-year-old man.

373
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Because then, man, he can get into some stuff, right?

374
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 He's constantly smoking cigarettes and drinking.

375
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 He's smoking and he's smoking in your house, he's drinking, he's buying porn on pay-per-view.

376
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 You're like, dude, what is going on? What is going on?

377
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 You got a little ghost boy who has all of the weird mental hang-ups as a full-grown adult.

378
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Like, I think that would be the worst. I think it would make it creepier.

379
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 And then, really, you got to think about it, what if there's like a little girl in the woods?

380
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 You're like, okay, that's enough. I'm leaving my house.

381
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 You're like, get out of the way, man, in underwear.

382
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 You walk in through the woods and you see a little girl with a jump rope going,

383
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 "La la la la la la."

384
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And you're like, I need to move, I need to move.

385
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 But I want to go check that out. And you go out there.

386
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 What if that little girl is actually not a little girl creepily jumping jump rope?

387
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 What if it's like a Malaysian war criminal or something like that?

388
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So somebody died, some guy died in the 1940s as he was just killing people with a homemade machete in the middle of Malaysia.

389
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And then he's like, I'm going to be a little girl in Massachusetts.

390
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 And I'm just going to stand in the woods, dude. You're like, you want this guy?

391
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 This guy's the freakiest of them all.

392
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 And you think about it, like, if you can choose your form as a ghost, which we don't know if it's true, right?

393
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 We don't know if it's true, but if it's true, then all bets are off.

394
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Because every time you see like a ghost doing something, it could be like a craziest man in the world,

395
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 disguised as a little girl jump roping right outside your house.

396
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 There's like real kids jump roping and you're like, get away from me, get away from me.

397
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Malaysian dictator. They're like, what?

398
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 It really would make you question all of it.

399
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Because if some of it can happen, that beautiful girl, not little girl,

400
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 that beautiful maiden, that civil war ghost that's dressed in the full gown, the antebellum gown,

401
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 because her boyfriend got his brains blown out by a cannonball in Gettysburg.

402
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 And she's like, oh no, I loved him so much. And then she jumps off a lighthouse, right?

403
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Super hot. You go to hang out with a ghost or you show up at a ghost or with roses and chocolates.

404
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 They're like, what do you hear? It's like, I'm here to woo the ghost.

405
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 But then it turns out that that's like it's an impersonator.

406
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 It's not that hot chick. It's some like grandma.

407
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Some grandma who also died during some wars. She's like, oh no, I really was in love with that guy who fired the cannon.

408
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And the cannon blew up and killed my lover as well.

409
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 But then like she's impersonating this beautiful maiden.

410
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I guess that wouldn't be so bad because then it's just an old lady who looks like a beautiful girl.

411
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 That's going back to the whole Titanic thing.

412
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 But what if it wasn't? What if you were trying to hook up with this super hot civil war chick

413
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 and then all of a sudden turned around and was Saddam Hussein.

414
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 He was disguised as a beautiful ghost.

415
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 I don't know. I don't know if that's possible. I just read this story.

416
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 I just read this story and it's possible.

417
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 This story is true that she could become an old, be an old man and become a little boy ghost.

418
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 And really you have to ask yourself, how many other times has this happened?

419
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Now they're probably not a bunch of Malaysian warlords.

420
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Saddam Hussein is probably not currently in disguise in an antebellum dress.

421
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 But prove me wrong.

422
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Prove me wrong because there are some hot ghosts out there.

423

 But I'm not willing to take that chance that it could be the third world dictator.

424
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 That's how we end the first episode of Season 20.

 TikTok is @DeadRabberRadio.

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

430
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 But I'm so glad you listened to it today. Have a great one.
