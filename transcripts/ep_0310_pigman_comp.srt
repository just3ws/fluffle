1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,780
 Minnesota, a hellish winter wasteland in the middle of an otherwise beautiful country.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,100
 You would think that all sorts of ghosts, demons, monsters and UFOs would be drawn to

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,820
 this bleak, war-torn state.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,900
 But surprisingly no.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:25,100
 Actually it seems to be one of the least haunted states in America and almost no cryptids.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,100
 Why?

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,340
 Who knows.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,900
 But I was able to dig up a few ghost stories, one of the most obscure cryptids I've ever

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,980
 covered and yes, this is an interactive road trip today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:47,340
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,460
 I'm your host Jason Carpenterner, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,580
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,700
 So this episode has kind of an interesting origin story.

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,820
 So what happened was I did my birthday special episode and it started off with a story about

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,300
 this little kid who tries to run a 5k and ends up winning a 10k.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,860
 Again, adorable story, don't really know if it fit the format, but it was my birthday

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,420
 and I wanted to share that story with my friends.

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:17,780
 Anyways, because I have a particular format for this show, KakiCube on YouTube goes "Oh

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,620
 man, I thought the story was going to be paranormal because you normally cover stuff that is paranormal,

20
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,540
 you don't normally just tell heart lifting stories.

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,040
 Heart warming stories?

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,660
 What's heart lifting?

23
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,660
 That's terrible.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,900
 Oh, I feel like my heart was just lifted.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,820
 It was an uplifting heart warming story is what I went to say.

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,340
 KakiCube said "I was a little disappointed because I thought the story was going to have

27
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,460
 a paranormal angle to it, like he was going to get sucked into another dimension or he

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,100
 was really running like instead of a 5k, he was running like a 5D, he's in the fifth dimension,

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,100
 he's running through.

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,380
 Like I'm everywhere at once, I'm both a winner and a loser."

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,020
 And he goes "I thought it was going to be paranormal, I was a little disappointed because

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,420
 nothing paranormal happens in Minnesota."

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,420
 And I read that comment.

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,540
 I was thinking that can't be true, like there has to be something in Minnesota.

35
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,780
 I'm gonna prove you wrong KakiCube, I'm gonna prove you wrong.

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,780
 And so I set out to prove him wrong and I actually, yeah, he's kind of right.

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,940
 The first thing I went, I was going, they have to have monsters over there, right?

38
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,220
 The place is like a hellish winter landscape.

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,060
 There's not, there has to be some sort of goblin or ghoul hanging out Minnesota.

40
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,820
 Mysterious Universe lists the Minnesota Iceman, a known hoax, it was basically a fake corpse

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,260
 and a block of ice.

42
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,380
 It listed the Mystery Monster, which was a rotted badger that washed up on the beach.

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,220
 These are their cryptids.

44
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,660
 There is a sea monster named Peppy, which is pretty stupid.

45
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,340
 And then they have the Windigo, which isn't even Minnesota, that's like an immigrant cryptid.

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,900
 It's from another part, it's from Canada, it's from another part of the country, he

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,060
 just happens to travel through Minnesota.

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,100
 So I was like, when I first saw that, I was like, whoa, KakiCube's right.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,420
 And it leads to a bigger question of why.

50
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,340
 Why doesn't Minnesota have a lot of creatures?

51
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,620
 And we'll get into that if I remember, because, well, let's get into it right now.

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,140
 I think it could be one of two things.

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,060
 I could think it could be that.

54
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,980
 Minnesota is as old as the rest of America.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,180
 We have states that are newer and obviously the geography, it's not like there's a

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,500
 giant hole there and then one day they're like, oh, it's filled up with sand.

57
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,820
 We will call this Minnesota.

58
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,060
 It's a very old established state, there are Native Americans there for a long, long time.

59
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,700
 There's a lot of Native Americans still there, I think, maybe hopefully.

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,020
 I hope there's at least some.

61
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,820
 Anyways, what I'm saying is that it has a long history.

62
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,380
 Why doesn't it have a lot of ghosts?

63
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,420
 It could be that the people who live there don't really care about it, which will cover

64
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,900
 that in one of these stories coming up, or they just don't really think it's that important

65
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
 to talk about.

66
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,860
 It could be that the places is really such an inhospitable place to humanity with its

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,900
 cold, cold winters that not even a ghost, not even the undead want to live there.

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,060
 The window goes like, oh, I'm going north for the winter.

69
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,540
 I'm going to sunny, sunny Canada.

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,300
 Lack and leaves.

71
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,300
 Who knows?

72
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,300
 But let's go ahead.

73
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,860
 I took up his challenge and I go, there has to be something out there.

74
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,020
 Let's take a look at some of these guys.

75
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,500
 I dug up, get it?

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,220
 Because they're ghosts.

77
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
 Okay.

78
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,700
 Pick a number between one and five.

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,300
 Now let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,740
 You're like, haven't picked my number yet, bro?

81
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
 Well, hurry up.

82
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,740
 Hurry up.

83
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
 Pick it.

84
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,740
 Okay, you got it?

85
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
 Okay.

86
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,740
 Let's hop inside the Jason Jalopy.

87
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,500
 We're going to drive around Minnesota.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,220
 So I hope you have like eight layers of clothes on.

89
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,220
 Do they even have a summer?

90
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,020
 I don't want to spend the whole time ragging on Minnesota.

91
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,020
 But whenever I hear about Minnesota, it's in conjunction with the Twins, the famous

92
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,540
 Siamese Twins that ran for governor, or it's like bleak cold winters.

93
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,940
 Are there any sitcoms that take place in Minnesota?

94
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,300
 Are there any movies that take place in Minnesota?

95
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
 Okay.

96
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,820
 So we were driving through Minnesota and we come across the soap factory.

97
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,220
 Which sounds, I mean, come on.

98
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,500
 And then the teenagers got lost in the abandoned soap factory.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 What?

100
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,220
 I'd be like, yay, I'd just be spraying water everywhere.

101
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,980
 The teenagers chasing me. I'd get in a giant bubble and float away. Not scary.

102
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,660
 But anyways, soap factory, one of their most famous, we're in for a while to ride on this

103
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,660
 one guys.

104
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,980
 Because I really had to dig for these.

105
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,980
 These are the most intriguing.

106
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,300
 A lot of them were just a ghost walked by a house in 1874 and it's haunted.

107
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,580
 That's how lame the ghosts are in Minnesota.

108
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,100
 These ones are kind of cool though.

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,140
 Anyways, as the story continues, I'm floating away in a bubble going, haha, and there's

110
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,540
 like this haunted doll shaking its fist at me.

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
 I'm floating away.

112
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,780
 You're not floating away.

113
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
 You didn't come up this plan.

114
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,900
 You got attacked by the doll.

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,620
 But anyways, back to the real story.

116
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
 We're in the soap factory.

117
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,380
 This is on, I'm sure, I think I can give out this address.

118
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,100
 I'll give out the street.

119
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,620
 It's on 2nd Street, Southeast, in Minnesota.

120
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,300
 Oh, I guess I'd probably need this city.

121
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,180
 I'm assuming it's me.

122
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,180
 Whatever.

123
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,340
 Just look up soap factory.

124
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,700
 The links are there.

125
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,660
 There we meet a man known as Adrian Lee.

126
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,220
 He's a paranormal investigator.

127
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,780
 My favorite job occupation.

128
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,380
 And I'm reading this article and they're like, yes, the soap factory is one of the most haunted

129
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,740
 places in Minneapolis.

130
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,300
 Adrian Lee, paranormal investigator says, here's one of his quotes, "One of the most

131
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,540
 paranormal thick environments I have ever had the displeasure to investigate."

132
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,540
 No one's making you do this.

133
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,180
 You don't have to sound like a snobby art critic.

134
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,020
 I imagine walking around a haunted house rubbing his finger over the bookshelves and like testing

135
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
 the dust.

136
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,780
 I hate this place.

137
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,420
 He calls it bordering on the demonic.

138
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,460
 And I love this line in the article.

139
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,060
 It says, Lee doesn't go in without a couple of pastors.

140
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,740
 So apparently this psychic investigator, paranormal investigator, whatever, has on-call multiple

141
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
 pastors.

142
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,340
 Like he picks up the phone.

143
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,500
 He has like the Bible phone.

144
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 He picks it up.

145
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,620
 He's like, it's time to go boys.

146
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,860
 And they're like going down a fireman pole.

147
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,380
 They live in a giant chapel.

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,420
 They're going down the fireman pole, driving away in their chaplain mobile.

149
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,980
 That's a stupid name.

150
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
 Bible mobile.

151
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
 Whatever.

152
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,180
 They're driving away in a Bible themed vehicle.

153
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
 The Bible mobile.

154
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
 I already said that one.

155
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,460
 Anyways, anyways, the joke's over.

156
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,460
 I love the fact.

157
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,220
 He's like, it's demonic, one of the most paranormal-y, blah, blah, blah, blah.

158
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,940
 So he says all this stuff, but this is actually like, well it's not anymore, but at the time

159
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,460
 when Adrian Lee was kicking down the door with his team of pastors posing in the doorway,

160
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,580
 ready to confront the demons, it was an active artist space/workshop/residency.

161
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,020
 You could stay there and you got to stipend and you could paint or do your Ovent Guard

162
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,940
 dancing or shoot paint out of your butt hole or whatever form of art you chose to do.

163
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,380
 And the most demonically possessed place in Minneapolis.

164
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,980
 That's a problem with this narrative.

165
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,660
 He's trying to build it up as being like this horrible place that smells of sulfur and you're

166
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,500
 like, no, that's just the guys over there, they don't shower.

167
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,980
 It's part of their art.

168
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,580
 And they roll in sulfur and you're like, ah, they eat a lot of eggs.

169
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,300
 So you go, that's not scary.

170
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,300
 And that's what I was thinking too.

171
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,860
 I was like, that's not scary.

172
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,340
 And at the same time, the article I was reading this from must have thought, yeah, it's not

173
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,340
 scary, isn't it?

174
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
 That's not really that scary.

175
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,060
 So they added this part.

176
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,820
 While factually true, let me read this to you.

177
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,660
 So actually, let me start off.

178
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,340
 It was originally a soap factory.

179
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,100
 It wasn't some nutty art commune that became the soap factory because it's a funny name.

180
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,460
 It used to be a soap factory.

181
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,540
 Then it shut down and then a bunch of Bohemians took it over and now Adrian Lee is showing

182
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,820
 up and now the place is closed at this point.

183
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,020
 But anyways, it's like office building.

184
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,020
 But anyways, it was used to be a soap factory and to make soap, you needed animal carcasses.

185
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,820
 The article is like, isn't that spooky?

186
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,940
 Listen to this quote.

187
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,100
 The flow of bloody skins through the factory rivaled the current of the Great River next

188
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
 door.

189
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
 That's a bit of hyperbole.

190
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,300
 You've got a raging river and all these skins go, pfft.

191
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,220
 People are rafting on the skins.

192
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,100
 And at the turn of the century, the building's appetite for flesh made it a repository for

193
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,300
 stray dogs that the city paid to be rounded up and strangled.

194
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,500
 That's a rumor, very, very popular rumor in the area that a lot of their sk- think about

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,260
 it, you're an industrial soap factory.

196
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,340
 So you have orders that have to go out every single day.

197
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:30,500
 There's not enough stray dogs in the city to last more than a week or two.

198
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,060
 If that, they're obviously ordering animal hides from slaughterhouses.

199
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,700
 They're not sitting around and they'll be like, "Oh, Jared doesn't get back with those

200
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,300
 thousand dog skins.

201
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
 We're closed!"

202
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,860
 And everyone's like freaking out.

203
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,460
 It was an industrial scale soap factory.

204
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,260
 But anyways, I'm sure a couple of dogs ended up in there, but I don't think that was their

205
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,540
 bread and butter.

206
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,580
 Or bread and blood-er.

207
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,740
 So anyways, then it goes, 'cause even that, the article knows that that's not a really

208
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
 good selling point.

209
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,660
 The article literally says after that sentence, "Not gruesome enough for you?"

210
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,380
 Consider then that before the warehouse was built, the site was home to a small business

211
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,700
 that produced artificial limbs for soldiers wounded in the Civil War.

212
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,900
 That's some creepy stuff.

213
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,460
 I'm like, "What?"

214
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,900
 That's quite noble.

215
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
 That's odd.

216
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
 I'm not...

217
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,220
 When I walk by a guy with a prosthetic leg, I'm not like, "Where's his real leg?

218
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,100
 Is it a ghost somewhere?"

219
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,540
 And if I worked for a factory that made metal hands and legs, I wouldn't be like, "Oh, I

220
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
 wouldn't be scared."

221
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,460
 I'd be like, "I'm doing a good thing.

222
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,580
 I'm doing something for people who lost their limbs fighting for the nation."

223
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,380
 It was the Civil War.

224
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,060
 It wasn't like some lame war that happened.

225
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,220
 It wasn't like some French Indian war or whatever.

226
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,900
 It was the Civil War, the defining war in American history.

227
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
 Anyways, history lesson's over.

228
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,340
 So you're walking through the soap factory.

229
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,460
 I'm floating in my bubble.

230
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
 I'm still in my bubble.

231
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,460
 You're like, "Damn it, Jason.

232
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,340
 Dahl's chasing you everywhere."

233
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
 I'm floating up in the bubble.

234
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,940
 You're looking for a pin and a straw to shoot it down.

235
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,140
 I'm like, "He he he."

236
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,300
 I hit all the pins.

237
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,580
 I have them all with me.

238
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,500
 I'm holding all of these pins in my hands.

239
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,660
 And I go, "If you picked number four," you're like, "Oh, I forgot we're doing this

240
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
 gimmick."

241
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,860
 I'm like, "Yes, we are doing this gimmick."

242
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,140
 If you picked number four, this is your resting place forever.

243
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,820
 A place, and you have to live through all stages of it.

244
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,820
 So first off, you start off as a noble handyman and you get to build the first cybernetic

245
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,060
 arm for George Washington's great uncle who was still alive during the Civil War.

246
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,180
 Wait, no, it'd be his great ancestor.

247
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,220
 Anyways, you're able to build him a robot arm.

248
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,700
 You're like, "This is a cool fate."

249
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,940
 But then you flash forward to the soap factory days, but you're the dog and you're running

250
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,300
 through a sea of skin and flesh and you're trying to hide under all the flesh as meaty

251
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,060
 Minnesota hands reach through the flesh trying to grab your fur and you're all scared.

252
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
 That's dark.

253
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,580
 Okay, let's get out of that one.

254
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,380
 Let's get out of that one.

255
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,340
 You're disappointed in me.

256
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,580
 Even the dolls looking up at me in the bubble and being like, "Dude, that's too dark."

257
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,580
 Okay.

258
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:16,060
 So the worst fate of all, you're a struggling artist sitting in an abandoned soap factory

259
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,260
 trying to paint something and you're trying to hit the brush against the easel.

260
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,700
 Not the easel, you're trying to hit the brush.

261
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,300
 That's why you fail at your art because you don't have a canvas.

262
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,980
 Anyways, you get a canvas.

263
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
 You realize you're mistake.

264
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,300
 You go get a canvas, but as you're painting on the canvas, you see a little bloody paw

265
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,700
 print appear on the painting.

266
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,740
 You're like, "That's not scary."

267
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,940
 A little bloody paw print goes away and you're like, "Oh."

268
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,140
 And then from behind you, you smell sulfur and you turn around and you think it's just

269
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,020
 your buddy Jake, but it's a dark cloud and you suck it up.

270
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,540
 And then you become a famous artist.

271
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,780
 The most famous artist to ever come out of the soap factory.

272
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,340
 You've never thought you could be this famous, but it's really the demon in control of your

273
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:12,060
 body and you're just a witness to all of the fame and all of the luxuries and all of the

274
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,500
 horrible things he does with your body late at night.

275
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,780
 How long is this episode to run so far?

276
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
 Oh geez.

277
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,580
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to the next one.

278
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,300
 We got to blow through this here.

279
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
 What's the next one?

280
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,460
 Geez, that took forever.

281
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
 Hop back in the car.

282
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,460
 We're going to First Avenue.

283
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,460
 So I think it's nearby.

284
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,460
 We're going to First Avenue.

285
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,380
 There's a place called the Dancerteria.

286
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,660
 We're going to the Dancerteria.

287
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,420
 The Dancerteria is not a cafeteria full of dancing.

288
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,860
 It's actually a dance club, the Dancerteria.

289
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,020
 Now I don't know if that's what it's called now.

290
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,740
 I think actually it's called something a little more hip.

291
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,100
 I think it's called First Avenue.

292
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,620
 But anyways, it used to be Dancerteria.

293
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
 Maybe it's still, I don't know.

294
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,660
 Anyways, back a long time ago.

295
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
 Super specific.

296
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,260
 It was World War II.

297
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:04,660
 Everything was swinging and jazzy and a young beautiful woman was in love with a dude.

298
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
 That dude loved her back.

299
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,780
 They kissed and they held hands and then he goes, "I have to go fight World War II."

300
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,660
 And she's like, "What?"

301
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,740
 And she's not really a part of it.

302
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
 She had no idea.

303
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,420
 So he sat down and he explained the rise of Nazi Germany and imperialism.

304
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,300
 And when they got to the Pearl Harbor part, she was totally like shocked.

305
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,220
 But anyways, eventually, after about an hour long discussion on this thing, he's like,

306
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,780
 "Oh, by the way, I'm leaving right now.

307
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,860
 We could have been making whoopie, but I had to tell you about World War II."

308
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,340
 So anyways, he leaves and she's like, "I hope he comes back to me."

309
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,940
 Now obviously this is a ghost story, so you know that he's not.

310
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,940
 Because he doesn't.

311
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,420
 Now he's not the ghost.

312
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,260
 This young woman, he dies during World War II.

313
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,620
 And she's like, "I don't know why he died."

314
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,660
 And they're like, "He died fighting for the country."

315
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,300
 She's like, "What?

316
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,460
 What do you mean fighting for the country?"

317
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,460
 They hadn't explained it to her.

318
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:00,740
 But anyways, she's so heartbroken over the fact that her lover died due to unknown circumstances

319
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,340
 that she's at the dance ataria where she loved to hang out and she goes, "I gotta kill myself."

320
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,380
 And what's weird is, we've covered this on another story before, not this particular

321
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,580
 incident, but this same type of death.

322
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,620
 This young woman goes into the women's restroom, goes to the fifth stall, and hangs herself.

323
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,180
 How, and this is what I said in my original episode, how do you hang yourself in a bathroom?

324
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,900
 I understand how it's possible.

325
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,220
 You have to use your underwear to do it, and you just kind of lean over and choke.

326
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,700
 It's very, very painful, and it takes a long, long time.

327
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,820
 But it's possible.

328
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,940
 That's generally how people kill themselves in jail.

329
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,780
 When you hear someone hung in jail, they're not thrown an old-timey noose.

330
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,380
 Sometimes they'll use bedsheets and they'll wrap it around a bar.

331
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,940
 But it's the same thing.

332
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,820
 You basically put something around your neck and lean over.

333
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
 Don't do it.

334
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
 It's quite awful.

335
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,500
 But it's possible to kill yourself in a bathroom.

336
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,180
 I don't understand why you would do it in a bathroom.

337
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,740
 If someone said you have to kill yourself, I would go, I would kill myself in the most

338
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,980
 beautiful location ever.

339
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,940
 A movie theater showing Transformers 3.

340
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,020
 But I want to kill myself in a gross, disgusting place.

341
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,900
 Like at least let me see the sunset.

342
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,780
 I don't want to game myself, not only in a restroom, but a public restroom.

343
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,660
 Their last moments are thinking someone really needs to clean that toilet.

344
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
 Ugh.

345
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,660
 Horrible.

346
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,540
 So, she does this.

347
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,820
 Now, if you go to this nightclub and you go into the fifth stall, this is terrifying to

348
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
 me.

349
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,140
 This is honestly the scariest ghost.

350
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,220
 I think it's one of the scariest ghosts possible, other than a ghost under your bedsheets with

351
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
 you.

352
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,220
 That can be kind of sexy.

353
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,620
 But going to the bathroom and looking up and seeing a full-bodied apparition standing

354
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,620
 in front of you.

355
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,500
 Because, for a couple reasons.

356
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,100
 One, you're going to the bathroom and it's always creepy when someone's in there with

357
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 you.

358
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,300
 Two, there's not a lot of room in a stall, so it's not like I'm in a graveyard and

359
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,540
 I'm looking at a ghost far away and I see the little light.

360
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,420
 Like, we're knee to knee.

361
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,220
 And I can't run without doing several actions.

362
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,420
 I can't, I gotta finish going poop.

363
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,860
 And then I'll probably have to poop more after seeing the ghost.

364
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,900
 But you have to finish wiping is optional in this situation, to be honest.

365
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,140
 Like if there is a ghost in front of you, I'm not worried about whether or not my butt

366
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
 is going to itch.

367
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,140
 10 minutes from now.

368
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,700
 But you still gotta pull your pants up, open the door and get out.

369
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,340
 And there is a ghost with a bent neck in front of you.

370
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,500
 You don't have a lot of, like you're basically jumping out of there.

371
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,380
 Now luckily, I don't go to the women's restroom, so ladies, this is your deal.

372
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,060
 But now, she is known to be seen also on the dance floor.

373
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,580
 Along with what the article called, and this isn't backpacker verse by the way.

374
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,580
 This isn't backpacker verse.

375
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,260
 This is like Minnesota Monthly.

376
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,540
 So you can see where this is headed.

377
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,620
 This is the actual line.

378
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:58,740
 She dances on the dance floor, quote, along with other legless ghosts.

379
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,940
 Where did her legs disappear at any point in the story?

380
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,660
 And more importantly, how does a legless ghost dance?

381
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,140
 Is it just a torso swaying back and forth?

382
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,540
 So you're a ghost, you're trapped in a public bathroom forever, one of the worst places

383
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
 for a ghost to live.

384
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,140
 And then eventually you go out to the night club and you're thinking, oh that's cool.

385
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
 You can listen to music.

386
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,700
 Yeah, remember she's a World War II ghost.

387
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,820
 So she's like swinging and jazzing to like Benny Youngman and Bobby Darron and whoever

388
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
 else.

389
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,780
 Now she's in the dance club and her and her legless ghost are showing up and they're

390
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,260
 like, oh I wonder who's playing tonight.

391
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,860
 And it's 2019 and they'll be like, hey everyone, welcome, anal snot.

392
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,540
 And what are the ghosts, your musical tastes are pretty set, honestly.

393
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,260
 Like people don't radically change musical tastes, especially after they're dead.

394
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,980
 So if you chose number three, you walk into the women's restroom, the lights flickering

395
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,780
 on and off.

396
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,380
 If you're a guy, this might be a little awkward, but you still gotta do it.

397
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:06,260
 You count the stalls, you go and you sit on the fifth one, it keeps going dark.

398
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
 Nothing happens.

399
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,180
 You're like, oh that was interesting.

400
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,500
 You pull your pants up or assuming you're a girl, put your, what do girls do?

401
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,940
 Do they take their dresses off when they go to the bathroom?

402
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,140
 I guess they just lift them up.

403
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,260
 I guess not all women wear dresses.

404
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,940
 Anyways, yeah, like if you have like a skirt that unzips, do you unzip your skirt and put

405
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,940
 it around your waist?

406
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
 What?

407
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
 I never even thought of that.

408
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:36,300
 Anyways, so the women do, they do, men and some women put their pants back on and you

409
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,860
 walk out of the bathroom.

410
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,940
 And then you encounter Slippy.

411
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,300
 Because there's also another ghost there.

412
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:48,100
 There's a staircase that descends down into the basement of the dance atyria.

413
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,180
 There's a ghost down there named Slippy.

414
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,940
 And Slippy has a unique power among ghosts.

415
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,620
 Very very rare power.

416
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,500
 Seen it a couple times.

417
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,660
 Slippy can manifest items into our world.

418
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:07,260
 So as you're walking down the stairs, you see a balloon just appear in front of you, slowly

419
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,980
 starts floating towards you.

420
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,420
 But as you go to leave the basement, the door slams and the balloon just floats closer

421
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,660
 and closer and closer to you.

422
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,380
 And then pop!

423
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,540
 Everything is pitch black.

424
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,180
 And that is when you learn why so many ghosts have lost their legs.

425
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,180
 I'm making up this last part.

426
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,900
 This part's not true, but the balloon pops with such velocity.

427
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,900
 Both of your legs explode off of your body.

428
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,020
 And for the rest of time, you have to just wiggle your torso in midair to the sweet,

429
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,420
 sweet sounds of terrible independent music.

430
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,260
 You're like, "Oh no, oh no, another Maroon 5 cover band.

431
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,580
 This is so horrible."

432
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,340
 I guess actually they wouldn't play there.

433
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,740
 They'd be at the state fair.

434
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,340
 But anyways, you're trapped in the dance atyria.

435
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,660
 Okay, let's move on to...

436
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,100
 Let's move on.

437
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,700
 Let us move on with this now extra long episode of Dead Rapper Radio.

438
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,540
 I really gotta stop doing these.

439
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,980
 I shoot for a half hour because I know how valuable your time is.

440
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,860
 I try to keep them short.

441
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,020
 But we've had a bad luck recently.

442
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,820
 Anyways, I'm having fun.

443
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,340
 So I hope you guys are having fun too.

444
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,020
 But we'll get back to our normal schedule, because this episode, there's no way this

445
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,460
 episode's 30 minutes.

446
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,420
 So let's go ahead and hop back into Jason's Lappie.

447
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,380
 If you pick number three, number four, you guys are toast.

448
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,100
 One of you guys, what happened to the first one?

449
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
 I don't even remember.

450
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,940
 Second one got his legs exploded by a balloon.

451
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 The first...

452
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
 Oh, soap factory, soap factory.

453
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,140
 So anyways, you're trapped in.

454
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
 The rest of us hop in the Jason's Lappie.

455
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,180
 We're driving to a place known as Grey Cloud Island.

456
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,740
 This is in eastern Minnesota.

457
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,140
 What's interesting about Grey Cloud Island, first off, not an island.

458
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,740
 It's not an island at all.

459
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,580
 I had to look it up on a map because I had a sneaking suspicion.

460
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,820
 Because I read in these articles about Grey Cloud Island and other than calling it Grey

461
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,460
 Cloud Island, they never specifically said, "Well, the island is situated."

462
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,740
 They never referred to it as an island.

463
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,260
 There is a strip of land.

464
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,140
 It's not super wide, but there is a strip of land connecting it to the mainland.

465
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
 Not an island.

466
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,380
 It may have been at one point, but it's not anymore.

467
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,420
 So change it to Grey Cloud Peninsula.

468
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,740
 Has a ton of Native American burial mounds.

469
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,300
 This was a kind of a sacred spot for them.

470
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
 There's a bunch of burial mounds there.

471
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,820
 Now there's a giant gravel factory, which people assume have just destroyed tons of

472
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,460
 archaeological stuff there.

473
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,660
 A bunch of bodies getting chewed up with the gravel.

474
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,740
 That's why when you're riding your bike super fast down the road and you just like flip

475
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,580
 off of it and you can't figure out why that piece of gravel came from a haunted burial

476
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
 ground.

477
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,460
 It does have some interesting things, though.

478
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,460
 That's why I'm covering it.

479
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,980
 One, this would be an interesting game to play.

480
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,500
 I don't know how true it is.

481
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,700
 A couple of people have stayed to this, but it seems like it could be some sort of optical

482
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
 thing.

483
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,420
 There's a row of 12 graves.

484
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,260
 When you walk down the row and you count them, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and

485
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,420
 then you turn and you walk back the other way, there's 13 gravestones.

486
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,780
 Now obviously there's not.

487
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,820
 And I guess like the 13th gravestone is supposed to be your gravestone or something like that,

488
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,860
 but obviously there's nothing paranormal going on there because again if it was and

489
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,980
 it was that easily replicated then it would be completely steadied by science.

490
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,920
 They're like there's a dimensional shift.

491
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,300
 Something appears when we turn around.

492
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
 It would be complete.

493
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
 It would be all over the news.

494
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,180
 But it's interesting because it's either completely made up or it could be some sort

495
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,420
 of visual trick where you don't see the 13th gravestone when you're walking by originally

496
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,740
 or it could just be a perspective thing.

497
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,780
 I think that's kind of interesting.

498
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,260
 But it has two things that I find really, really interesting and that's why we're going

499
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,380
 to Grey Cloud Peninsula on this one.

500
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:50,280
 One, it has a population of about 300 people and they hate ghost hunters and this is considered

501
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,420
 like a sacred area/full of ghost stories.

502
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,760
 But they don't want any ghost hunters.

503
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,500
 They run them right off their territory.

504
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,180
 The graveyard is locked down.

505
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,500
 You can't even go in the graveyard unless you are related to a dead person in the graveyard.

506
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,100
 No visitors allowed.

507
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,740
 That always makes me suspicious because it would be an easy way to get that sweet, sweet

508
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,740
 tourist money.

509
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
 By saying, "Yeah, yeah, we're haunted.

510
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,020
 You pay five bucks, you go to the haunted graveyard."

511
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,220
 That always makes me suspicious when people don't want to do that.

512
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,440
 But really the most consistent rumor about Grey Cloud Peninsula is the idea that it's

513
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,120
 run by the Ku Klux Klan or a satanic cult.

514
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 It goes back and forth.

515
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,600
 But the real reason why these people are super secretive and they want to keep people off

516
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,560
 of their land isn't because they don't want a bunch of teenagers throwing beer cans at

517
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,280
 green lights floating by.

518
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:45,380
 They're actively engaged in cult activity or that's where the Ku Klux Klan in Minnesota

519
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,160
 hangs out to do whatever they do nowadays.

520
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,260
 I don't even know the Ku Klux Klan.

521
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,100
 It seems like such an archaic group.

522
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,820
 But anyways, that's the rumor going on right now.

523
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,180
 So people tell stories about being chased off by residents and having drones fly over

524
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,700
 their head, hiding in the bushes.

525
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,660
 And a lot of these people say, "I went there to go see this green light."

526
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,820
 And then this white pickup truck started chasing me.

527
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,380
 Now, the white pickup truck could, apparently that's like a common thing.

528
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,860
 If you go there for any amount of time, a white pickup truck starts following you around.

529
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,000
 Some people say it's security for the gravel company.

530
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
 Other people say it's the Klan or the cult.

531
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,600
 But a lot of these stories are out there of people like hiding in the bushes as like

532
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
 neighbors are looking for them.

533
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
 And they're like on raid.

534
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,160
 The one guy was saying he could hear a woman talking on a radio to somebody else being

535
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,880
 like, he was saying it sound like she was looking for him and she was communicating her location

536
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 to somebody else and all this stuff.

537
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,120
 So anyways, that's a myth that's going on.

538
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,400
 So if you picked number one, you're outside of the Jason Jalopy.

539
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,300
 You're standing in the middle of a giant gravel pit.

540
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,700
 You're like, oh, there's no way I'm getting out of this.

541
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,780
 And you start trying to climb up and gravel just keeps getting kicked out from underneath

542
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
 you.

543
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,700
 And you're like rolling down.

544
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,220
 After about three days, you finally crawl out.

545
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,740
 Actually, the next morning, the workers show up and they're like, what are you doing at

546
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,740
 our workplace?

547
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
 And they help you out.

548
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,980
 But anyways, you still don't have a car.

549
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,460
 So you're walking around Great Cloud Island and you see 12 gravestones.

550
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,420
 And you're like, oh, this part's interesting.

551
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,500
 You start walking and you count them.

552
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,360
 And when you count up to 12, you turn around and now it's nighttime.

553
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,840
 Big moon in the sky.

554
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,040
 You see the 13th gravestone and you're like, that's the second most unusual thing that

555
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 just happened to me.

556
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,000
 The first one is the massive time jump.

557
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,920
 And around that time, you see a bunch of people come out of the woods and black robes.

558
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,840
 They're not white robes because I'm not going to make jokes about the clan chasing you.

559
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,400
 But it's a little more sensitive than that.

560
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
 These guys have black robes.

561
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,480
 They're like, we are not affiliated with any racist organizations.

562
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,100
 Yes, we are sane worshipers and we are going to kill you, but we're not going to kill you

563
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,380
 because of your ethnicity.

564
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,660
 We're going to kill you because we're evil, evil, demonically worshiping people.

565
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:57,180
 And you're like, oh no, at least I'm not being killed because of something I can't control.

566
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,540
 And then as you feel the knives going to your body, you feel a little bit better because

567
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,980
 you know that they're equal opportunity murderers.

568
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,980
 I really had no way.

569
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,940
 I have no other way to end that one.

570
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,620
 Sorry if you picked the number one and you expected a racist cult to kill you.

571
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,680
 I don't think you guys realize how on the, you guys might actually how on the seat of

572
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,080
 the pants this show is.

573
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,360
 I just write notes and then just talk.

574
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,760
 So sometimes I realize as I'm talking, I'm like, oh wait, am I going to have to have

575
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,600
 the clan show up at the end of the story again to do something funny?

576
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
 Yeah, that was, yeah.

577
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,680
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on.

578
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
 How long is this?

579
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
 Okay.

580
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:39,480
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next haunted spot.

581
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,720
 We got two more guys.

582
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,380
 We're almost done.

583
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
 We got two more.

584
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,380
 Okay.

585
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,180
 So let's move on to our next haunted spot.

586
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,060
 Sorry commuters who only have a 20 minute drive to work.

587
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,900
 This is a two-parter for you.

588
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,820
 We're going to St. Anthony, Minnesota.

589
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,700
 And I think that might be where the, the 5K took place if I remember correctly.

590
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,180
 Probably don't, but I think that's where the 5K took place.

591
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,220
 And after all of our adventures, soap factory guys showing back up covered in animal carcasses

592
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:12,320
 like Conan the Barbarian, then the Danzatiria guy shows up, no legs, so he's just kind of

593
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
 floating.

594
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,080
 He's a disembodied spirit floating around.

595
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,640
 Great cloud dude who just got taken out by the cult shows up, suspiciously wearing black

596
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 robes.

597
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
 Well, what?

598
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
 Why are you wearing those?

599
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,000
 Oh, nothing.

600
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,240
 What happened to the guy at the soap, the soap factory?

601
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
 I forgot.

602
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
 He wasn't wearing animal skins.

603
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,880
 He became possessed by the demon and was like killing people at night or something.

604
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,000
 Anyways, anyways, he's here too.

605
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Whatever.

606
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,340
 We're all at Dairy Queen.

607
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,100
 We're all at Dairy Queen in St. Anthony.

608
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,540
 And now we, now when a Little League team wins a game to go to a pizza parlor, when

609
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:50,420
 we are all murdered by ghosts and/or non-racist cults, we go to Dairy Queen.

610
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,680
 Now at Dairy Queen, this is Haunted Dairy Queen.

611
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,260
 This is just product placement for Dairy Queen.

612
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,940
 I used to work at Froster Freeze, which was bought out by, I don't have enough time to

613
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
 tell those stories.

614
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
 Sorry.

615
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,780
 So anyways, we're at Dairy Queen.

616
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,840
 So here are the signs that this Dairy Queen is haunted, according to multiple articles.

617
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,400
 Okay, I'm not making these up.

618
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
 These aren't jokes.

619
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,920
 We're in this Dairy Queen.

620
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,080
 The first thing we do is we hear children laughing.

621
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,400
 "Oh, we look around.

622
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
 There's a bunch of kids behind us."

623
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
 We're like, "Oh, okay.

624
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,720
 That makes sense."

625
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,200
 We order some blizzards and the receipt comes out and they go, "Okay, you guys ordered five

626
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 blizzards.

627
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,520
 Sorry, the receipt here said you ordered six.

628
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
 There's a free blizzard."

629
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
 We're like, "What?

630
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
 We've never been in a fast food restaurant where an order was wrong."

631
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,140
 We're looking at each other.

632
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
 Oh no.

633
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,900
 Mysterious cold spots in a Dairy Queen.

634
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,540
 A restaurant that specializes in ice cream.

635
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:46,060
 Sometimes it gets cold in there.

636
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,820
 A sign of a haunting, according to multiple articles.

637
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,340
 Now the last one is a little more haunted-rific and that's where the employees hear names,

638
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,500
 their names being called when no one else is around.

639
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,160
 So it could just be that you're 16 and you have your listening to XXXxtentacion in one

640
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,280
 ear and your boss is going, "Jeremy!

641
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
 Jeremy!

642
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
 Turn around!"

643
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,280
 And you're like, "What?

644
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,720
 I think I heard something, dude."

645
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
 He threw his headphones out.

646
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
 "What?

647
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
 Someone was just calling my name."

648
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
 "Yeah, it was me.

649
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
 What?"

650
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,880
 "Your orders are always wrong, dude.

651
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
 We keep giving out free blizzards.

652
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
 What, dude?"

653
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,160
 I mean, okay, it's most likely not haunted, but it was reported multiple times this Dairy

654
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,280
 Queen was haunted.

655
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,460
 So if you picked, you're like, "Dammit, Jason!"

656
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,900
 If you picked number five, you're trapped in a haunted Dairy Queen.

657
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,500
 Okay, here, we'll make it even better than that.

658
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 Your soul.

659
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,020
 Because I could be trapped in a haunted Dairy Queen.

660
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
 I could do that.

661
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,100
 But anyways, because you'd be going down, some of them have the playgrounds and stuff,

662
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
 you're all, "Wee!"

663
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,260
 You're popping out of the balls.

664
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,020
 Kids are like in the ball pit and you're like, "Bleh!"

665
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
 All the time.

666
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,120
 It would be hilarious, but we're gonna make it scarier for you because otherwise that

667
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,240
 one was kind of weak.

668
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,240
 If you picked number five, your soul is turned into a waffle cone, right?

669
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,920
 So it's like all twisted around and you're all like, "Never mind.

670
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
 Never mind."

671
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,880
 If you picked number five, you're just in a haunted Dairy Queen and every Sunday night

672
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,280
 you turn into a haunted waffle cone and somebody eats you and then you turn back into a regular

673
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
 ghost.

674
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,580
 And then you come back and now you're the ghost of a waffle cone.

675
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,700
 So now you can't even hop out of the ball pit.

676
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,980
 Dun dun dun.

677
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,980
 Sorry, dude.

678
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
 That one.

679
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
 That one.

680
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,260
 I thought I was gonna be able to come up with something, but to be fair, I didn't even

681
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
 think about it.

682
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,140
 So let's go ahead.

683
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,180
 There's four of us who aren't waffle cones.

684
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,740
 If you picked number five, you are a waffle cone.

685
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,260
 And we're gonna walk to the Minnesota State Fair.

686
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,060
 But we're all getting our waffle cones unless you are one.

687
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,280
 No, then you'll have a little tiny waffle cone as well.

688
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,780
 You got a little arm.

689
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,160
 We're walking to Minnesota State Fairgrounds.

690
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,840
 Now obviously if you picked number two, this is you.

691
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,080
 This one's kind of long, but anyways, this one's weird.

692
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,120
 It's a little story I like to call Curse of the Pigman.

693
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,960
 Now apparently, I didn't know this.

694
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,760
 Pigman is a very popular last name.

695
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,540
 And it seems to be especially popular in Minnesota for people who have bad luck.

696
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,700
 October 4th, 1777.

697
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,580
 Come on, get 'em boys.

698
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,220
 It's the Battle of Germantown.

699
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,900
 It's the American Revolution.

700
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,980
 Stab a dude in the neck.

701
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,260
 Come on, keep going.

702
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,740
 Let's fight them British.

703
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,460
 Ah, guys are getting gutted, right?

704
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,880
 And in this fight is John Pigman.

705
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,800
 He's actually leading the fight.

706
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,960
 Come on boys, follow the old Pigman.

707
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,320
 Let's do this, you skewering British dudes.

708
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,880
 We used to be related.

709
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,520
 Not anymore, you British dudes.

710
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
 Kill 'em.

711
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,640
 Anyways, after the bloody battle is all over with, John Pigman goes, "Oh, that's pretty

712
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
 dope, dude.

713
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
 Kill 'em bunch of dudes.

714
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
 Fight 'em from a country."

715
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,320
 Now, while he was off fighting and becoming a war hero, which he was remembered as, his

716
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,700
 wife and his idiotic son were left back at the farm, and his son was a dummy, so the

717
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,060
 farm went into debt.

718
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,660
 And eventually when John came back, he lost all of his land and was thrown in debtor's

719
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,060
 prison, which was a thing.

720
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,780
 If you had debt and you couldn't pay it, they threw you in prison, which it's luckily isn't

721
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,820
 a thing, because otherwise I'd be doing 25 to life.

722
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,460
 But now we're jumping into the year 19-- that's bad luck, right?

723
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,940
 You become a war hero, come back thrown in debtor's prison, because your stupid son doesn't

724
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,780
 know how to plant corn.

725
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,040
 1911, there's a dude born-- oh, that guy was from Minnesota.

726
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,440
 That all happened in Minnesota, I forgot to say that.

727
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,600
 This is the curse of the Pigman.

728
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,400
 1911, there was a guy born in Minnesota.

729
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,160
 His name was Melvin Lewis Pigman.

730
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,760
 His nickname was Fat.

731
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,600
 So his nickname was Fat Pigman.

732
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,940
 Real guy, real guy.

733
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,340
 1924, you like Jason?

734
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,980
 That really-- all the only unlucky thing.

735
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,860
 If your nickname was Fat Pigman, that is about as unlucky as you can get.

736
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,820
 1924, the curse of the Pigman strikes again.

737
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,260
 And trust me, I'm going somewhere with this.

738
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,180
 I'm just not going to talk about it.

739
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,260
 Anyways, just trust me.

740
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,620
 1924, HF Pigman.

741
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,840
 Which I'm pretty sure HF stands for High Flying, because HF Pigman, he was a human Daredevil.

742
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
 Sorry, I read that wrong.

743
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,880
 He was a daredevil human fly.

744
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,600
 So that's a guy who climbs up buildings and stuff like that.

745
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,100
 Nowadays we call him human spiders.

746
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,840
 I guess he also probably flew.

747
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,440
 He might have some sort of glider.

748
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,600
 But anyways, HF Pigman, I'll read the sentence.

749
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,280
 HF Pigman, a daredevil human fly.

750
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,440
 This is from an article.

751
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,940
 Loses his grip in 1924.

752
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:16,100
 Loses his grip and falls 70 feet from the courthouse tower in Albert Lee.

753
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,100
 He survives the fall but sustains serious injuries.

754
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
 No duh.

755
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,860
 70 feet is quite a long way to fall.

756
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,540
 But anyways, so I found that when I was looking at Pigman in Minnesota history.

757
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,020
 That's unlucky, right?

758
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,420
 This one-- okay, so this is where I told you to hold on.

759
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,740
 I'm going to tell you one more cursed Pigman story.

760
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,280
 And then I'm going to tell you a Pigman story.

761
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
 And then we're done, okay?

762
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,680
 Just a little bit longer, guys.

763
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
 Hold on.

764
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,880
 Even the ghost with no legs is somehow tapping his foot impatiently.

765
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,640
 This one's weird, dude.

766
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,440
 2015, there's a dude named Christopher Cruz.

767
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,160
 He's sleeping.

768
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,200
 And he hears a boom, like this loud noise.

769
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,160
 And he wakes up and his wife is laying next to him in bed.

770
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,080
 Dead, shotgun blast to the chest.

771
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,320
 There were kids in the house.

772
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,380
 He wakes up, calls the cops, tells them, "I woke up.

773
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,460
 I heard a loud noise.

774
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
 My wife's dead.

775
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
 Her chest is blown up."

776
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
 The cops show up.

777
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,420
 Kids are there, all this stuff, right?

778
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,500
 Cops show up.

779
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,660
 They don't find the shotgun.

780
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,820
 But they find a spent shotgun shell in her room.

781
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,380
 Four years later, Christopher Cruz is arrested.

782
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,420
 He's currently on trial for the murder of his wife.

783
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,820
 His wife's name, Jan Pigman Cruz.

784
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
 Pigman Cruz.

785
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
 So it's hyphenated.

786
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,140
 But it was originally Pigman.

787
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,280
 So the Pigman curse can strike you even if you just know a Pigman.

788
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,240
 And you go, "Jason, it's obvious he probably shot..."

789
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,480
 This is what's weird.

790
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,440
 How do you, you know the police tore that house apart looking for that shotgun.

791
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,480
 How do you shoot a woman with one of the loudest personal weapons you can carry commercially,

792
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
 right?

793
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,000
 He's not shooting a howitzer cannon, but he shoots her with a shotgun that ejects the

794
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,220
 shotgun shell, then runs, hides the shotgun in a place where nobody finds it for four

795
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,300
 years, calls the cops.

796
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,620
 And the whole time the kids don't see him running, none of the neighbors see him running

797
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,140
 outside, burying the shotgun.

798
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,700
 The cops, I can guarantee you, tore that place apart looking for that shotgun that night.

799
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,860
 I don't think that they would have been like, "Oh, you know, it's been four years.

800
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
 Let's go look for that shotgun."

801
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,940
 And they're like, "Oh, we should have looked for it earlier."

802
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,200
 They obviously probably suspected him right away.

803
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,840
 They were looking for that shotgun.

804
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,360
 How did he get the shotgun out of the house and hidden from the police all this time?

805
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,680
 I can understand if they're on a camping trip and this happened, but in your house she

806
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,800
 gets shot and somehow even with the kids you're able to get that shotgun to a place, you couldn't

807
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,440
 bury it because they had seen freshly buried soil.

808
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,640
 They were immediately suspicious of this guy.

809
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,600
 To this day the shotgun's never been found.

810
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,680
 He may have killed her, or he could be a victim of the curse of the pig man.

811
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,180
 Like a ghost shot or something like that.

812
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,900
 So you ask, "What's the curse of the pig man?"

813
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,660
 Now obviously I've selected these four people named Pigman who have bad luck, other than

814
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,180
 just having the last name of Pigman.

815
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,660
 The guy's other name was Fat Pigman.

816
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,260
 You're thinking, "Jason, you're wasting my time at this point."

817
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,380
 I wouldn't even say I selected these guys.

818
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,180
 I typed in Minnesota Pigman.

819
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
 You're like, "Why?

820
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,580
 Get to that part.

821
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,580
 Hold on.

822
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,660
 I typed in Minnesota Pigman and I found these just like right off the bat.

823
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,160
 People with the last name of Pigman seem to suffer terrible luck."

824
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,680
 So that is in and of itself a bizarre thing.

825
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,280
 Pigman people from Minnesota suffer terrible luck.

826
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,920
 There might be great pigmen out there somewhere, but whatever.

827
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,240
 The reason why I typed in Minnesota Pigman, the reason why you picked the number you

828
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,760
 picked, which was number two, was because when I was looking for ghosts and hauntings

829
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,260
 and cryptids, the reason why we went on this whole adventure that Kaki Cube sent us on,

830
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,500
 was I found on this website, this is where it gets weird guys, there's a website called

831
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,620
 hauntedplaces.org.

832
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,980
 And I'm just looking for just, this is when I'm first doing my research.

833
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:11,340
 I find this entry on Minnesota State Fairgrounds on hauntedplaces.org.

834
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,700
 This is what it says, "The Minnesota State Fairgrounds, according to some, is haunted

835
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,560
 by a ghost pig, or half human half pig, called the Pigman."

836
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,660
 Other reports say a brown bird that nests here is believed to be a reincarnation of Wayne

837
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,800
 Murray, the maintenance man who died here in 1986.

838
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,080
 And I read that and I go, "I could care less about the brown bird."

839
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
 What?

840
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
 What?

841
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
 You see a brown bird you're like, "That's good ol' Wayne.

842
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,360
 Wayne used to fly around and chew up worms.

843
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,120
 That son of a gun.

844
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,600
 Still flabbin' his wings.

845
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,840
 Why is that?

846
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,100
 What the hell is this Minnesota Pigman?

847
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:53,260
 The Minnesota State Fairgrounds, according to some, is haunted by a ghost pig, or half

848
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,660
 human half pig, called the Pigman."

849
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,380
 Guys we all know how the internet works.

850
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,460
 We know how urban legends work.

851
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,940
 I've covered dozens of these things over the course of this show.

852
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,980
 You can have the most obscure urban legend.

853
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,820
 When I was 12 there was some homeless guy named Joe Trombone, who's a schizophrenic

854
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,700
 dude who rapped on buses.

855
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,960
 There's YouTube videos of him now.

856
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,240
 So 20 years later people are still posting stuff about Joe Trombone.

857
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,600
 There is nothing on this Pigman.

858
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
 At all.

859
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 Nothing.

860
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:33,240
 But what's weird are there are traces of Pigman in Minneapolis culture.

861
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,800
 Now it's hard to determine whether or not these things were founded, but here's my

862
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,680
 best example of this.

863
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,840
 There is a Pigman triathlon.

864
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,740
 So there's like, what is that, swimming, boating, and running or something like that, right?

865
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,100
 Three things I don't like doing.

866
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,660
 It's called Pigman Triathlon.

867
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,380
 You go, well maybe John Pigman founded it.

868
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,620
 Maybe when he was killing British soldiers he had to run, swim, and then boat.

869
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
 Maybe.

870
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,620
 But very, very interesting.

871
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
 I was like, oh that's interesting.

872
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,820
 I kept finding traces of it.

873
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,660
 There is a photo.

874
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,660
 It's a fake photo.

875
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,740
 And the guy admits it was fake.

876
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,740
 He sold it on eBay.

877
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,220
 He said he found it at some shop.

878
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,520
 It's basically a Photoshop picture of a baby and a pig mixed together.

879
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:20,200
 And the headline of the article is "extremely rare photo of Minnesota Pigman for sale on

880
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
 Craigslist."

881
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
 And the article goes on and says, "That's fake.

882
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
 I just think it's a funny photo.

883
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,080
 I'm gonna put it up there as a joke."

884
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,040
 So people in the media, that article specifically talked about the Pigman as if it was a real

885
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,320
 cryptid in Minnesota that people would know if I used to turn Minnesota Pigman.

886
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,440
 People would be like, oh yeah I remember hearing about that as a kid.

887
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
 The Minnesota Pigman.

888
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,420
 There are no resources on this guy.

889
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,580
 Nothing.

890
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,100
 And what happened was when I was typing in Minnesota Pigman, it kept bringing me up

891
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,140
 stuff about human flies and dudes blowing their wives away.

892
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,100
 Except for those little pieces and those little traces.

893
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
 Really really bizarre.

894
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,140
 And I have two conclusions to come from that.

895
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,300
 One, here's my conspiracy theory.

896
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,220
 What if, I have two of them, but what if, we talked about Great Cloud Island, right?

897
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,440
 And we talked about the fact that the community there doesn't want anyone to know about any

898
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
 of the ghosts.

899
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,680
 They're always running people out.

900
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,560
 What if the entire population of Minnesota is keeping a cryptid from us?

901
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,600
 What if this is a Great Cloud peninsula on a giant scale?

902
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,880
 There's a Pigman.

903
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,280
 There's a half human, half pig that everyone in Minnesota knows exists.

904
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,160
 He's like, hey guys, what's up?

905
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,440
 He's skateboarding, has his sunglasses on, and they're like, Pigman!

906
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,340
 He's skateboarding off into the sunset.

907
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,460
 But no one outside Minnesota gets to know about this dude.

908
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:48,580
 Because that sentence on the hauntedplaces.org is the only record that I could find of the

909
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,580
 Minnesota Pigman.

910
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:57,500
 And to make the story even more weird, when I went to go verify a detail from the Minnesota

911
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,660
 State Fairgrounds entry to the hauntedplaces.org, I can't access it.

912
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:09,720
 Because of recording this, and I just checked a couple minutes ago, the link that I provided

913
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,960
 takes you to the front page of hauntedplaces.org.

914
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,160
 The whole website, if you click on any link from that website, none of the links work

915
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
 now.

916
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,400
 They all take you to the front page of hauntedplaces.org.

917
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,200
 Is it possible that this website found out that I was getting too close to the truth and

918
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,880
 shut itself down for maintenance?

919
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
 No.

920
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
 It is not possible at all.

921
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,260
 That is completely paranoid delusion.

922
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,920
 I do think it is weird timing though.

923
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,400
 I think it's 100% a coincidence, but it is odd.

924
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,360
 I am curious that if when the website gets fixed, you can go to the website, you just

925
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,000
 can't visit any of their entries.

926
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,580
 I would be curious that when the website gets fixed, if Minnesota Pigman is still there.

927
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,640
 But that is not it.

928
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,500
 I have something more to go on.

929
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,620
 Because I'm looking up Pigman, an article came up about these dudes in China or Ireland

930
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,960
 or something like that trying to make a half human, half pig.

931
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,760
 Now not to release to the Minnesota State Fair, but so a pig can grow human organs,

932
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,240
 you can take the organs out and put it in a human.

933
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,600
 Groundbreaking if it's possible.

934
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,040
 But remember, I'm looking for the term Minnesota Pigman.

935
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
 I find this in...

936
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
 Oh wait, never mind.

937
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,480
 It wasn't in China or Ireland.

938
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,080
 It was in Lajala or is it La Jolla, California?

939
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,760
 I think it's La Jolla.

940
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,480
 Anyways, this was in the article.

941
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,300
 Professor Daniel Gary, a cardiologist and head of a different chimera, it's basically

942
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,660
 it's the term where you take two animals and stick them together.

943
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:40,220
 You basically take like a dove and a rat and just sew them together, but genetically.

944
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:45,060
 Professor Daniel Gary, a cardiologist and head of a different chimera project at the

945
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,780
 University of Minnesota said this is a significant advance that raises opportunities and ethical

946
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,100
 questions as well.

947
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,680
 Gary said that the rapid progress in chimera research had prompted a range of troubling

948
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,820
 questions including whether the progeny would look more human or more pig.

949
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:06,680
 What would happen if a chimera had a human thought and whether it was possible for the

950
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,320
 human cells to cannibalize the pig embryo, resulting in a mostly human, slightly pig

951
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,320
 offspring?

952
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,460
 So what, this guy's talking about pigs.

953
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,660
 He's talking about pig people.

954
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,680
 Jason, why are you giving this guy...

955
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,460
 University of Minnesota, I go, oh, he's also working on doing this chimera project.

956
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,700
 I wonder what he's working on.

957
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,420
 Is he also working on a pig, half human, half pig thing?

958
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,940
 There is no mention.

959
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,580
 This guy really does exist, because I had to look him up too, but there is absolutely

960
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,140
 no mention what he's working on at all.

961
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,100
 Even though this article states he's working on a different chimera project, but I couldn't

962
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,620
 and I looked all over for this guy.

963
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,620
 He did not say I'm working on like a half draft, half lizard or nothing like that.

964
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:54,360
 We just know that this guy in Minnesota is working on a different chimera project, but

965
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,120
 has enough information about how it works that he can adequately explain the possible

966
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,600
 outcomes for a human pig.

967
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,120
 Is he also working on a human pig hybrid?

968
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,360
 Has he crafted and created a human pig hybrid?

969
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,320
 Is the pig man... there's two questions here.

970
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,660
 One, is the pig man a real urban legend?

971
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,020
 And then two, is the pig man real?

972
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,820
 Normally with cryptids it's always the first question.

973
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,100
 We know the urban legend is real because we've heard the story.

974
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,780
 We know about Bigfoot, Mothman, uh, Mellonheads.

975
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,860
 We heard about all these guys before.

976
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,740
 So the fact there's so many resources on it, we know it's not just one guy telling the

977
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,740
 story.

978
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,260
 It's not your uncle being like, "Hey, did you hear about pig man walking down the street?

979
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,860
 Like, you know it's an urban legend."

980
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,340
 That's normally not in question.

981
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:45,320
 I don't think I've ever questioned whether or not the story itself was actually even

982
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,600
 being told.

983
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,720
 Factually, whether or not it's real is different.

984
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:54,040
 We're actually questioning whether or not the legend exists.

985
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,400
 Whether or not anyone else has ever heard the story of the pig man, other than there's

986
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,640
 two sentences on this website that's down right now.

987
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,560
 But then we find all this other pig, the pig man triathlon and the Minnesota Pig Man news

988
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,640
 article and stuff like that.

989
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,140
 So in the Minnesota Pig Man news article, I should say, doesn't say, you, everyone knows

990
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,140
 who the pig man is.

991
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,500
 He's that cryptid running around Minnesota.

992
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,780
 It just is like, "Oh, here's a photo of a weird looking pig, Minnesota Pig Man."

993
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:24,140
 It almost assumes that you have a working knowledge of this cryptid.

994
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:30,740
 So if you picked number two, you wake up in a laboratory one day and you're in a cage.

995
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:35,140
 You're all hunched over in a big old human cage.

996
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,440
 You see other people in their own cages and they have little hooves for hands and you're

997
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,960
 like, "Oh, this isn't going to be good."

998
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,280
 And you get unhooked from the cage.

999
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
 They open the door.

1000
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,760
 They need to oil the cage.

1001
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,280
 It's not a really well-funded laboratory.

1002
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,720
 And they make you get out and they're like, "Come on, come on."

1003
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,880
 And they take you to a laboratory and they have a giant needle and you see in the liquid

1004
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,880
 and you see little pig fetuses, right?

1005
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,380
 Flowing around in the vial, in the ambionic fluid and they inject it into your veins.

1006
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,740
 You're like, "Ah."

1007
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,820
 And then you look down at your hands and you have hoof hands.

1008
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,140
 You're like, "No."

1009
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,180
 And then this is so cute.

1010
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,940
 I'm just listing stuff at this point.

1011
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,740
 Anyways, if you pick number two, you're a half human, half pig.

1012
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:28,120
 And you're like, "See all these other pigs?

1013
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,920
 They're getting like tags put on them and they're like getting punched in the stomach.

1014
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,920
 I don't know.

1015
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,320
 They're bad stuff.

1016
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,760
 Stuff you don't want to see happen to an Ascension creature."

1017
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,000
 And you're being led through the facility and you're led to a...

1018
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,480
 It's getting darker and darker and darker and you're like, "Ah."

1019
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,560
 All you can do is go, "You've lost the ability to speak, but you still have a human brain.

1020
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,900
 It's your little pig feet are like kicking down the linoleum hallway and it's really

1021
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,900
 scary."

1022
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,100
 And then you feel a little curlicue tail stick out of your butt and you're like, "Uh-oh."

1023
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,700
 Transformation is almost complete and you can't wait for the point where your human

1024
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,100
 mind becomes as dumb as an animal.

1025
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:12,860
 So you don't have to contemplate the horrors that awaits you in this giant pig body.

1026
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,500
 And that is when the door opens up.

1027
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,200
 And you're let out and you see a giant slaughterhouse.

1028
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,200
 Not the soap factory.

1029
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,200
 That's on the other side of town.

1030
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,360
 You see a giant slaughterhouse and you see a bunch of pigs going in it.

1031
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,400
 And you're thinking, "This is a really inefficient way to give pigs my turning people into pigs."

1032
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
 But it's not about the meat.

1033
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
 That's just a byproduct.

1034
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,640
 The science is what they want.

1035
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,000
 He explains that to you.

1036
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,040
 He's like, "Bad pig."

1037
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,480
 And then as they're leading you to the slaughterhouse and you're starting to poop out pig blood,

1038
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,820
 poop, because you're super, super scared.

1039
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,060
 This old rickety truck pulls up.

1040
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,860
 Some guy goes, "No, I don't take him to the slaughterhouse.

1041
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,620
 I got special plans for that pig."

1042
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,620
 And you're like, "Uh-oh.

1043
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,340
 I'd rather go to the slaughterhouse."

1044
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,700
 But the dude picks you up.

1045
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,980
 He throws you in the back of this pickup truck and this dirty old farmer starts driving away

1046
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,980
 with you.

1047
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,100
 You've still got a human mind, but you've got the gross, gross pig body.

1048
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:19,440
 And then he pulls up to his farm and you hop out and you're like, "Oh man, what's going

1049
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,440
 to happen to me now?"

1050
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,160
 And then you see the corner of the farmhouse.

1051
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,760
 You see a little spider web.

1052
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
 You see a little spider web.

1053
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
 And you're like, "What?

1054
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,760
 That looks familiar."

1055
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,800
 And the little spider comes down and goes, "Hi.

1056
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,080
 I'm Charlotte."

1057
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,320
 And then you live the life of Wilbur.

1058
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
 Your name was Wilbur.

1059
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,800
 That was the twist ending.

1060
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,040
 You didn't know that, right?

1061
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,040
 Your name was Wilbur.

1062
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,800
 You looked down, you had a name tag.

1063
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,640
 And you are Charlotte's web, dude.

1064
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,640
 You're Wilbur the pig.

1065
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,060
 Now you may say, "Jason, that's a happy ending, but if you remember the ending of Charlotte's

1066
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,560
 web, it's not because you lose your best friend in the end.

1067
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,640
 You say goodbye to Charlotte and then all of her children abandon you too."

1068
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:08,740
 So whichever number you chose, you either got an ending with a violent death or an ending

1069
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,040
 with an emotional death.

1070
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
 The death of your best spider friend.

1071
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,600
 And then you got that gay rat Templeton annoying you for the rest of your life too.

1072
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,100
 You got to worry about that.

1073
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,100
 So there we go.

1074
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,100
 Our journey.

1075
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,680
 And now I'm floating around in that bubble again.

1076
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,280
 I'm looking down at all of the victims of this story.

1077
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,680
 I'm floating in the bubble.

1078
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,600
 I go, "So there we go, travelers.

1079
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,520
 I hope you enjoyed these stories of Minnesota hauntings.

1080
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,520
 Did you enjoy them?"

1081
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,720
 And you guys are like, "I guess.

1082
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,720
 Yes.

1083
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,360
 Can we get a ride home in the Jason Jalopy?

1084
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,360
 Can we get the keys?"

1085
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,360
 And I'm like, "No."

1086
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,080
 You guys all have to stay in Minnesota.

1087
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,880
 That is your true fate.

1088
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,280
 I was like, "No!"

1089
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,640
 You are trapped in Minnesota forever.

1090
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,560
 Even after the heat death of the universe, you are trapped here in this hellscape known

1091
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,560
 as Minnesota.

1092
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,120
 So then I'm just floating away in my bubble.

1093
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,160
 So I don't think I'm doing another multiple choice one for a while.

1094
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,640
 Those take a long time.

1095
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,640

00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,320
 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

1101
