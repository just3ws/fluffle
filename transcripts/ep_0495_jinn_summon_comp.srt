1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
 Has the internet uncovered the path towards summoning your own jinn?

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:13,380
 And then we take a look at a man whose father told him many stories growing up of being abducted by aliens and

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:21,460
 Having a religious experience with them. Is there any truth to these stories? Is it possible that all aliens?

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,900
 worship the same God today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
 *music*

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:38,900
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover. It's day two of Alien Disclosure Week

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,140
 Yes, we're here called the UFO Disclosure Week. It doesn't matter stuff is getting disclosed one way or the other first off

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,380
 Let's give a shout out to our newest patreon supporter Nate

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,960
 Nate thank you so much for supporting the show. You are going to be our captain this episode

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,180
 I may refer to you as Nate dog. Hopefully you're fine with that. Hopefully you know who it is

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,500
 It's definitely a compliment from me because I love Nate dog rest in peace

13
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,120
 If you can't support the patreon that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,020
 That really really helps out a lot and I actually want to highlight this I have a Google alerts set up for Dead Rabbit Radio

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,420
 But it only pops up once a week

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,020
 because otherwise it goes off all day long because

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,740
 Every time I put out a podcast it goes to all these different websites and things like that

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,140
 So a lot of times I don't see time stuff that pops up on time

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,420
 So Nate as you stand there dutifully with your arms and a wet your side or something

20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,420
 I don't know crossed you just kind of standing there waiting for your turn to drive one of vehicles

21
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,900
 Let me read this post I found it pops up on my Google alert too late, but I want to read this post

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,980
 I found on the export. It's a titled dead rabbit radio. I did not write this

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,540
 I did not write this but somebody did and I wanted to address this a dead rabbit radio and here's what it said

24
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,620
 I miss it bros. I can't wait till Monday if you're here Jason. Hey friend

25
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,980
 I am thankful for your show and it makes me happy life has been hard lately, but dead rabbit radio is real good

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,200
 I'm not saying that because it's complimentary towards me

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,860
 I wouldn't be reading it if it was insulting, but there was a there's a key point in that and I get this in emails all

28
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,280
 The time I actually got a similar comment from a YouTube username

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,900
 34.qg7 just today

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,540
 That they're having trouble with their life that life is hard

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,540
 That things haven't been going well for them that they're lonely or sad or whatever and guys

32
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,260
 It makes me feel so good to know that I can help you out in that way

33
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,660
 Because we're all we

34
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,220
 One like being into ghosts and stuff like that like sometimes you can find like ghost buddies

35
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,100
 physical corporeal beings other humans that are into ghost or paranormal or Bigfoot and stuff like that

36
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,840
 But a lot of times it's pretty solitary right a lot of times. It's maybe an internet community and things like that

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,340
 So I'm glad that I can kind of be

38
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,780
 Be out there be out there in this audio realm

39
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,140
 To be your friend to be your your buddy your your

40
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,220
 You know what I mean like that made me I get so many emails or people are telling me

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,340
 That the show makes them happy and that to me is the biggest compliment

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,980
 That really to me is the biggest compliment for the show. So whoever you are anonymous person

43
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,900
 It's back the show is back. It's not going away anytime soon and to everyone who's ever emailed me

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,700
 Saying that they're not doing good that they've been having a bad week or a bad month or bad year or whatever it is

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,580
 I'm glad that I can be a little bit of

46
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,500
 making it better

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,380
 Making it better

48
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,420
 So I just wanted to acknowledge that because I get that comment a lot and I'm glad I can kind of

49
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:02,660
 Do my little part to make your day at least for maybe half hour a little bit more fun a little bit more fun

50
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,580
 You're not alone. You're not alone. There's millions of people out there just like you you just haven't met them yet

51
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,500
 But you will you'll be really good friends when you do

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,740
 Nate let's fire up at Jason Jalopy

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,180
 We are driving down to Los Angeles this I mean I got a ton of stuff to cover today

54
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,060
 We're driving down you found breathless. We're driving down to Los Angeles right now. So as we're driving LA

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,360
 Let me give you a little bit of this in two or ten different things at once right now

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,340
 I'm all feeling that reports and you're looking for UFOs and like giving you a hug so you don't feel so sad and Nate's like

57
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,460
 Where's my hug? We're going to LA at September 7th, 1973

58
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,500
 And we're gonna go see the Johnny Carson show at the Tonight Show is what it is

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,940
 So it was the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson

60
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,220
 I'm old enough that I actually watched it when it was on the air not this episode not that old

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,620
 But I remember watching it in the 80s yesterday

62
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,020
 I talked on the episode saying that for a long time talking about aliens talking about UFOs

63
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,700
 It was you were ridiculed for it

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,140
 Nowadays you can have your own web group or you can actually have your own YouTube channel and and even if you're not doing that

65
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,220
 Even if you're an officer speaking in front of Congress or something like that. It's not as jokingly

66
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,020
 Courage as it used to be and I want to play this clip as an example for this

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,100
 What I'm about to play you it's Muhammad Ali famous boxer Muhammad Ali

68
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,940
 He's on the Tonight Show and he's acting a little kind of reserved and Johnny Carson kind of picks up on it

69
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,180
 So he asks him like, you know, what's going on? That's what kind of the lead-up is to this clip

70
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,860
 Quite reserved tonight. I've been studying UFOs. Did you know there are UFOs out here flying around?

71
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,180
 This would be the place for him Southern California

72
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,720
 I'm seriously sighted a bunch over Georgia. I've seen him at night

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,100
 They have real photos of him and the government and the people just completely seem like don't talk about it

74
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,380
 But mr. Harold Salkin of Washington DC is head of the National UFO

75
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,900
 Bureau

76
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,420
 brought me moving films

77
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:09,180
 I actually have moving pictures of little saucers of gray steel objects coming into pictures that people took and I'm just surprised

78
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,980
 They don't know that talk more about it something they can another great insight into the fight game

79
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:21,020
 I read that but did you read the thing last night on the news? No, it's on physicists said there's two things to address there

80
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,980
 It appears that that was the first thing really Muhammad Ali is saying in that clip other than like hey

81
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,420
 He starts talking about this UFO thing and he's kind of like this is what I wanted to talk about

82
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,020
 Sitting next to him is the heavyweight champion Ken Norton

83
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,020
 they're doing publicity for their upcoming heavyweight fight rematch and

84
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,620
 Ken Norton's just kind of sitting there shocked the whole time the whole clip is about three minutes long and I had the links in the show

85
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,180
 Not to recommend listening to that but that laughter

86
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,100
 That laughter even what you have Muhammad Ali

87
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,740
 World famous boxer

88
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:59,900
 Saying yeah, you know, this is something I want to talk about I want to talk about you talk about UFOs and that laughter and you can

89
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,740
 Tell half of it is nervous laughter because they don't know the audience doesn't know how to react to it

90
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:10,060
 But the other half is laughing at him. That's really what it used to be like for the UFO community

91
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:17,740
 You don't get their reaction much anymore. You can have post Malone who I'm pretty sure is haunting my apartment at this point

92
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,580
 I'll do that story tomorrow's episode because I'm still doing some research on that

93
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,740
 But you can have post Malone and I think it's also picking the audiences back then you had a general talk show

94
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,940
 You went on there and then after that after Muhammad Ali gets off you'd have like a dancing cat

95
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,940
 It was just kind of a general talk show nowadays post Malone can go on

96
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,780
 H3H3 or Joe Rogan and they'll talk about UFOs and one there's no audience there

97
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,460
 You don't get that instant reaction

98
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,780
 But two I think one people are more open to it and you can pick your audiences when you talk about it

99
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,460
 That's what it used to be like though and that takes guts

100
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,740
 Now it probably caught him a little off guard when they first started laughing but like I said the clip goes on for three minutes

101
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,860
 He just keeps talking about and Johnny Carson kind of he's a little dismissive at the beginning

102
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,220
 But then he actually goes oh, you know

103
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,020
 I read this article saying that it may be satellites falling and stuff like that

104
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,420
 There's like this back and forth between them as far as that goes, but it was

105
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:21,040
 Completely hostile you had a hostile audience when you talked about this stuff back then this was in 1973

106
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,380
 September 7th 1973 as opposed to today

107
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,740
 So it really took guts to talk about this stuff when a heavyweight boxer is getting

108
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,660
 Laughed at and mocked on national television

109
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:40,020
 Imagine someone who just saw UFO and they're in their small town and they're like hey

110
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,260
 I think I saw something weird last night. I don't know what it was

111
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,940
 Imagine that reaction, but it's your peers and you're in your small town diner

112
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,800
 So that's what that was like Nate. Let's leave behind LA Muhammad Ali's like no no

113
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,180
 Take me take me to a future where people will believe me. We're like no, sorry, dude

114
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,780
 You got you got fights to win or lose. I don't really know his record

115
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,780
 But I don't know if he won that fight, but he was were speeding away. He's like do I win?

116
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:14,340
 Do I win this fight? I don't know. We're not sports people at least I'm not we're driving away Nate. Let's go to

117
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,260
 Spooky bedroom. I don't know. Maybe it's your bedroom. That's spooky. I'm pretty sure my bedroom is haunted by post Malone

118
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,940
 Even though he's still alive something weird is going on. We're elite. We're not going to my bedroom

119
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:35,500
 That's tomorrow's episode. Let's just go to your bedroom, but it's super spooky like you've put up like crepe paper and

120
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,420
 It's like black and red and you've lit some candles

121
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,860
 That's what your bedroom normally looks like and we are going to look at a

122
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,380
 Ritual I found this on Reddit. I found this on Reddit

123
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,620
 It is supposedly so I always like to say that because I want to give credit to the person who brings it to my attention

124
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,300
 This was from a user named bill feiny. So we're sitting in your bedroom. Thank you bill whoever you are

125
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,700
 We're sitting in your spooky spooky bedroom

126
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:10,340
 And we're going to look at something that he supposedly found from a book called the miraculous aspects of things

127
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,860
 Existing supposedly according to this reddit post. This is a book that was written by Zachariah L.

128
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,500
 Cosweeney in the

129
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,420
 1200s so long long time ago if you don't have a calendar if you don't have a calendar in front of you just take my word for it

130
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,860
 The 1200s is farther back than the

131
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,500
 2020s apparently this is a text that actually shows you how to summon a gin

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,460
 Now gin, you know one of the biggest things I see in the party

133
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,900
 I can't say it's the biggest thing I see but it pops up a lot in paranormal world. The one thing that pops up a lot is

134
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,540
 How do I get wishes?

135
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,940
 It's funny because you think about it. That is the

136
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,580
 Wanting to have a wish fulfilled and wanting to be able to go back in time and change things

137
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,100
 It's like an it's like a basic human need

138
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,580
 It's so weird to think that you know if you I think I talked about this like on episode 40 of this podcast

139
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,640
 If you went back to like old timey England like the 1400s

140
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,820
 And they're like using sickles and stuff to like chop hay up and like pet and sheep

141
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,460
 Do instead of using the sickles on the sheep. You know, they're like, oh, you know, what would be totally awesome

142
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,620
 I heard back in the the thousands things were way cooler people are dressing all in retro thousand clothes

143
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,980
 They're like, I don't know. I don't know what clothes they wore in the 1400s

144
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:39,180
 But you know what I mean like people always look backwards with like sepia colored glasses or they didn't have glass glasses

145
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,380
 Wasn't invented back then so they just looked back and go, you know what?

146
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:48,060
 I'm sure I wish I lived in the times of the Arthurian legends. That's what they were thinking

147
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,380
 They're like back when knights actually fought for good instead of like beating up peasants and nostalgia is a thing

148
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,220
 I'm sure you could even go back to like the bee season. They're like, ah, I don't know

149
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,580
 Maybe maybe there's a limit because you have to have some sort of record of the past

150
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,460
 You're gonna be sitting in your hovel in

151
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,620
 Grease and you're like, ah, dude things were way better back

152
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,700
 I'm guessing cuz things suck so bad now. I'm just guessing anytime before now is better

153
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,820
 But anyway, so time travel wish fulfillment very very basic human needs

154
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:26,260
 So that is a very lengthy introduction to this. I said I have a lot to cover and I'm seeming to ramble more than often

155
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,060
 Here's this. Here's your instructions. Get a pen and paper. You write this down

156
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,460
 before sunrise

157
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:38,100
 But but but before you start writing stuff down realize you will be summoning a gin if you follow these instructions

158
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,860
 So maybe not spooky spooky bedroom. You got a I'll give you a single light

159
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,180
 So you can write stuff down or you can use your cell phone because you don't live in the PCs

160
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,380
 Before sunrise you have to practice solitude and quiet and then at night

161
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,660
 So this is like the day before so it takes a couple days preparation

162
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:03,500
 So you wake up one morning you practice solitude and quiet and then that night you pray and praise God

163
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,180
 So this might not work for atheists although I

164
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,740
 Would be kind of weird when atheists are trying to summon a gin and expect it to happen

165
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,220
 They're like, I don't believe in anything except this thing. I heard on a podcast before sunrise

166
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,980
 I'm sure do atheists believe in ghosts actually not that I think about it. I know do they?

167
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,180
 Like I guess like they probably believe in Bigfoot

168
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,780
 That's for that's another episode. That's that's another episode

169
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
 I could see an atheist believe in an aliens

170
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,500
 But I don't get an atheist believe because at what point you're like, ooh that ghost

171
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,060
 That's real, but then it's if it becomes like a wraith or a demon you're like

172
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,300
 It's ghosts ghosts all the way down like I don't I don't know actually that's a good question

173
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,260
 But the question that will be answered on a later episode has nothing to do with this one except

174
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,060
 Except you'll be summoning a gin and to do this you have to praise God. So that's why that comes up

175
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,860
 Could you praise God if you could you fake it fake it till you make it fake it till you make a gin

176
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,780
 Before sunrise you practice solitude and quiet and then that night you pray and praise God the next day

177
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,380
 You're gonna fast, but before you fast you're gonna fast from Sun up to Sun down

178
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,460
 But you're gonna wake them in the morning. So you got to wake up before the Sun comes up

179
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,540
 You have to only eat unsalted food

180
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,340
 No planters peanuts for you. You can eat this stuff is inedible. This stuff is inedible

181
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:30,020
 I'm about to list by the way, so I mean if you want to summon a gin your first wish should be make unsalted foods taste good in the future

182
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,060
 You can only eat barley. I don't know where you're getting that at

183
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,540
 I have no idea where you buy just straight barley, but you can eat barley

184
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,380
 You can eat unsalted olives. Those are disgusting even if they are salted dried grapes

185
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,060
 That's like a raisin right dates. I've never had one of those and

186
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:57,580
 My food review it's it's oddly become that you can eat barley unsalted olives dried grapes dates or

187
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,740
 Fruits and vegetables they should just say fruits and vegetables right because no one's gonna go out and buy

188
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,780
 You don't have to eat barley by the way

189
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:11,580
 You don't have to go raid a horse farm or like guys. What are those things called the stalls the horse place?

190
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,100
 Thing you know what I mean. You've seen movies or been around real horses the place with all the boxes and the horse heads are popping out of it

191
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020
 Whatever

192
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,620
 You don't need to go there for this ritual

193
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,300
 But if you wanted to steal barley go to a horse farm

194
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:38,140
 But anyway, so you just eat fruits and vegetables really and then but here's the thing put down that honey because that's what you're going for

195
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,940
 It's not a fruit or vegetable. You can't eat anything that has an animal origin including honey

196
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,780
 So no meat no eggs no milk and then whatever else comes out of a cow or chicken or an owl

197
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,580
 Don't eat it and then you fast first from sun up to sundown

198
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:01,300
 And then when you break the fast you have to go back to eating the barley you have to go back to eating unsalted stuff or again

199
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,020
 Just fruits and vegetables

200
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,340
 That's when the sun's going down now before nightfall comes

201
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,060
 So you have that time period of dusk and then night falls coming you need to start

202
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,460
 Summoning the gin now you have to read this phrase out now. I am

203
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:23,660
 Going to be a total chicken. I'm not gonna read this phrase out on I've debated this and I know you guys were waiting with baited breath

204
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,740
 Is he going to actually summon a gin during this podcast?

205
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,060
 So this message is apparently written in a combination of Arabic and a gin dialect

206
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,300
 I'm like, okay, but when I ran it through a translator and there's no Google translator for gin

207
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,460
 There's no Google translator for like leprechaun or anything like that

208
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,760
 But when I ran it through the translator it didn't even pick up any of the Arabic words. So I was like

209
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,200
 I'm not really don't really feel comfortable, but

210
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,100
 You can check it out online. You can check it out online. It's not super long

211
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,940
 I don't even feel comfortable reading the first word

212
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:07,060
 Because again first off post Malone's already haunting my apartment and then two maybe he's haunting my apartment because I've been reading this in my head

213
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:14,140
 It's probably I don't know it probably take you 30 seconds to say it if that but you have to say it one

214
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,260
 Thousand times so it's nightfall now

215
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:25,020
 And you've already done all this preparation and you repeat this phrase over and over and over again

216
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,540
 1000 times out loud and there you go

217
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,220
 After the thousandth time this is interesting because this is something that's easily testable. I

218
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,460
 Listener be aware as far as actually doing this ritual because again, it may work

219
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,660
 You may want to summon a gin it may summon something else

220
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,220
 But or it may have a psychological component to it as well

221
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,980
 We'll get into that but it's something that's easily testable like once you get it down

222
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,140
 After the thousandth time the gin will appear in front of you in human form

223
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,780
 And if that happens if you're standing there and you see a human that previously did not exist appear in front of you

224
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,820
 Don't panic it says do not panic if you've summoned something from the other realm

225
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,180
 You are instructed to crawl into bed and go to sleep

226
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,740
 You got to immediately go to sleep. I don't know if you have to immediately like I don't know if you have to

227
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,540
 Immediately go to sleep that might be putting a little pressure on you

228
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,900
 But you have to at least like try to go to sleep can't be on your phone

229
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,100
 Can't be playing your Nintendo switch while you're sleeping the gin will wake you up. Hey, dude

230
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,020
 Hey, dude wake up wake up you do you summon me dude?

231
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,900
 You said that a thousand times don't you want me to be here?

232
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,740
 Why are you speaking so rude and then you wake up and then you will create a contract with this gin during this conversation?

233
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,740
 I don't know how casual the conversation. Hey, how was your day?

234
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,060
 Were you doing anything before I summoned you into this realm?

235
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,020
 You know stuff like that it could just be straight to business

236
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,780
 But eventually you do come up with this contract and here we get this quote

237
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,000
 The gin will be bound to a lifelong servitude which includes fulfilling realistic wishes and

238
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,860
 Forming the human about the questions that he sets to the gin

239
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:08,300
 Unquote so there you go. I think it's funny because there is that caveat saying well the wishes have to be realistic

240
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
 Like you can't wish to be

241
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,980
 King of ours or something like that like it has to be something like I wish this donut had only a hundred calories and the

242
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,540
 Gin's like Duke

243
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,740
 He got sit in one fourth and gives you you're like, huh? They have to be realistic wishes, but that's still an interesting thing

244
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,300
 I would just be fascinating that a human appeared in my bedroom not saying that humans don't appear in my bedroom

245
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,860
 They don't magically my bedroom, but humans do walk around in my bedroom from time to time

246
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,180
 But that would be weird right if someone just magically appeared in front of you that would be proof enough

247
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,180
 But the fact that he will stay stick with you forever. He'll answer questions that you set upon him

248
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
 So you're like who is

249
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,720
 Who's who's that man walking on the street and Jin's like

250
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,740
 And he reads his ID in his pocket. He's like, oh, that's Jimmy Smith the actor

251
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,180
 He's that's where what's he doing in my hometown and Jin's like

252
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,060
 He's looking for a job

253
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
 So I don't know

254
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,500
 That would actually be kind of cool because I would be pestering him with questions all the time

255
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,100
 In the middle of night. He's trying to sleep. I'm like, hey, Jin. Jin wake up. Hey, dude

256
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,180
 I was wondering what do you call place where horses are at?

257
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,260
 He's like, oh, please. Let me break my contract. I'll make you president of Mars

258
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,260
 I'll break all my laws just to get out of this. So anyways, that's how you can summon a Jin

259
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,600
 I'm wondering if you could record it record that saying and go

260
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,460
 And then hit play and let the recording play out a thousand times

261
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,700
 It would be weird then what if it doesn't work?

262
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,540
 You're like, I'll go to sleep but like your mp3 player

263
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:50,100
 It's sitting there and it's like just sitting there like the cameras closing on the MP3 player and

264
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:57,660
 Then the Jin appears in the MP3 player and he's like I'm you're at your command and like the music is allowed to make wishes

265
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,480
 It's a little black mirror episode for you guys

266
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,880
 That one's free, but anyways apparently if you doesn't work

267
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,580
 I'd be shocked if it did obviously, but I'm not gonna try it if it doesn't work

268
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,220
 They say just keep doing it just keep doing it over and over again

269
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,580
 It'll eventually work and what's interesting is in the reddit comments

270
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,700
 So one of the first ones that popped up was from a guy named

271
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,340
 Ibnami this guy says

272
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,180
 Don't do this don't do this at all for a psychological reason if you repeat anything

273
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,340
 1,000 times in a row it's gonna mess with your head like that is really how

274
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:43,300
 I'm not saying like chanting chanting is supposed to take you to another like realm another like supposed to elevate the spirit

275
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,540
 But he's like don't do this chanting if you channel just random stuff and just repeated that phrase a thousand times

276
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,620
 It's gonna mess with your head. Don't do it. This is not saying don't do it because the Jin might show

277
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,740
 Don't do it because you might actually cause psychological damage to yourself. That is probably true

278
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,380
 It probably has some sort of tulpa effect

279
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,980
 But who knows maybe this guy is onto something not this guy not this killjoy the original guy

280
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,900
 Maybe you can do this and summon a Jin and get realistic wishes, but again, that's a that's a bit of a

281
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,300
 That's a bit of a small print thing going on there because you could be like I wish and the

282
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,180
 No matter what the Jin's I can't do it before you before even finish it

283
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,300
 Nope, he's just eating all your potato chips all your unsalted olives. You're like, oh man. I really wanted those

284
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,260
 It's going to garbage. Yeah, because they're disgusting. He's eating barley

285
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,700
 So let's go ahead and get Nate in the seat of the carboner copter now

286
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,460
 What I did was I promised you on yesterday's episode to talk about

287
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,540
 This guy whose dad was abducted by aliens not only did I promise it on yesterday's episode

288
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,900
 I promised it on this episode as well in the intro, but Nate let's get in that carboner copter

289
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
 I don't know if we have enough time for that

290
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,660
 Honestly, I don't know if we have enough time for that technically the the story with

291
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,940
 Ufo disclosure

292
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:10,020
 I don't think I have time to really do this story justice and I don't want to have another long episode because I want to make sure you guys

293
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,260
 You know, I don't want to waste your guys's time

294
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,980
 Let me not saying the show's waste of time, but you know what I mean?

295
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,300
 Like I like having a set amount of time. Hold on a second here

296
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,620
 Let me find a shorter story to end this on a shorter good story. Don't worry. I'm not just going to throw throw mud of the wall

297
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,140
 Okay, here we go

298
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,380
 Nate you've been doing circles in the carboner copter been in a holding pattern

299
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:38,940
 We are now leaving behind your creepy bedroom. You can redecorate it when we come back. We are headed out to Kokomo, Indiana

300
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,540
 It's January

301
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,780
 1999 I got this from that website one of my favorite investigative websites think about it docs.com

302
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,420
 It's January 1999

303
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,180
 Helicopters coming over Kokomo, Indiana. It's late at night

304
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,180
 It's late at night

305
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,020
 It's late at night and two women are driving

306
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:05,060
 Down a dark country road in a little area north of Kokomo, Indiana

307
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,340
 We don't have their real names, but we'll call them June and

308
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,660
 Monica June and Monica June is driving the car and those are their real names. It's just a shot on the dark

309
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,020
 June's driving the car Monica's on the passenger seat. Yeah

310
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,420
 Car is driving on the road this area that they're in if you're familiar with Kokomo, Indiana

311
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,020
 If you're familiar with that area, you may actually know the stretch of road

312
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,540
 Apparently on both sides of the road

313
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,620
 There's these big bushes these big bushes that kind of line the road and they're about 10 feet tall

314
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,380
 Monica and June are just having a good old conversation driving on the road

315
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,740
 Monica falls silent for a moment and then a moment longer

316
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,700
 And then a little longer and June looks over and she sees her friend's face

317
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,460
 contorted in fear

318
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,820
 Not just a slight grimace. It's not just a

319
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,100
 It's a look of pure agony

320
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,900
 Seeing something that fills her with

321
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,820
 mortal fear

322
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,860
 Monica points out into the darkness as the cars continuing down the road and just then

323
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,060
 The car engine shuts off

324
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,740
 The car is now just coasting down the road the headlights dim

325
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:32,340
 Lining each side of the road are these bushes these 10 foot tall bushes and Monica is pointing out

326
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,860
 Towards the bushes, but not at the bushes

327
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,900
 above the bushes

328
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,980
 June sees it too. What she's seeing is

329
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,780
 peeking over the bush are people

330
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,020
 She said the heads seemed larger and the shoulders seemed disproportionately big

331
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,860
 but all of these

332
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:03,300
 Creatures these beans these shadow people were all over 10 feet tall big enough that she could see the head in the shoulder

333
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,420
 So 12 feet tall 13 feet tall and they're just staring as the cars coasting down the street

334
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,100
 engines completely shut off June almost reflexively

335
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:21,260
 You're gonna think it's natural geography, right trick of the light something like that June swivels her head to

336
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:27,140
 Her side of the car looks out. She sees the beans on her side of the car as well looking down at them

337
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,500
 Now at this point June turns to Monica who Monica is still just barely holding it together

338
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,900
 June turns to Monica and she says the one thing that if you are a passenger in a car

339
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,840
 You hope no one ever says in a situation like this because you are helpless

340
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,420
 You are stuck to the desires of the driver June says quote

341
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,300
 They want to communicate. I am stopping

342
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 But before June can actually hit the brakes because she believes that whatever this encounter is they want to just talk to them

343
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:05,020
 Monica flips out Monica absolutely flips out on this. She's having a completely different reaction to this

344
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,780
 June is getting the sense that they want to talk to us and

345
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:16,560
 Monica in an almost animalistic fight. It's basically you have that response. You have like a fight response than a I don't know

346
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,280
 Communicate with us response. That should be the fourth one fight flight freeze or just talk it out

347
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,840
 Monica though is straight fight complex. She's really not even communicative at this point

348
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,360
 She just becomes violently hysterical is the quote that's used and while June is now trying to call Monica down

349
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,600
 The car is just continuing to coast and these things are standing on both sides of the road for a length of around 50 feet

350
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,100
 And then at that point

351
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,980
 June looks up and she doesn't see them any further

352
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:55,740
 Than the 50 feet that the car coasted once they pass by where these shadow beans were on both sides of the road

353
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,100
 the engine

354
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,600
 Starts up again lights turn back on

355
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
 car drives home

356
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,960
 That story ends with this passage here quote one of the women who I'm assuming is the passenger

357
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,340
 I don't think the driver would be like well golly. I wanted to stop the car

358
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,080
 But now that I think about it here's this quote one of the women locked herself up in her room for two days

359
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:26,180
 And we're not talked to anyone after the incident. So again, I'm just assuming that's the passenger. That's an interesting story one

360
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,660
 It's terrifying

361
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,660
 Because it has all these it has all the combinations. It's at night. You're in the middle of nowhere

362
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,060
 You have an unknown

363
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:41,180
 Element and in this one you have multiple unknown elements. They're basically surrounding the car the car is dead

364
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,940
 And you have a fight between the two people in the car not a physical fight

365
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,500
 But you have the passenger who noticed them first and was just instilled with fear

366
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,740
 Freaking out when the driver says well, they want to just want to talk to us

367
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,540
 Let's stop

368
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,900
 Now we don't know what the intentions of these creatures are

369
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:05,040
 We don't know if these were shadow people. We don't know if these were malevolent. They're a bunch of out-of-work gins

370
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,620
 We don't know but I think if in my case, I wouldn't stop the car

371
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,920
 Especially if I was surrounded if I saw one of them, maybe

372
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,840
 But if I saw a bunch of them both sides of the road, I wouldn't stop the car

373
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,400
 This story is interesting because what would have happened if Monica wasn't there

374
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,060
 That car could have passed silently by all those subjects. June was just looking in front of the road

375
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:34,820
 Maybe she experiences a little bit of car trouble, but even the car trouble didn't come till Monica had already pointed them out

376
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,220
 Maybe her car would seem to the gas pedal wasn't really working for that point in time and it keeps going

377
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,940
 Maybe the fear actually now that I say that maybe the fear is what gave them enough power to shut the car down in the first

378
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,540
 But June could have just driven right by him

379
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:56,280
 June's car could have broke down and she's out there trying to figure out what's going on. It's 1999 not everyone has a cell phone

380
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,720
 It's nighttime. She's hoping someone else is gonna drive by to help and while she's trying to figure out what's wrong with her car

381
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,800
 Why the engine just died there are these dark shadows just staring down at her

382
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,520
 Silently watching her and waiting

383
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,200
 It's also possible that she was driving out

384
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,240
 Like this episode are you glad I found this one people who are listening to this episode at night driving down the road and

385
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,540
 They're experiencing car trouble. It's also possible that she would have stopped so let's play it where she's driving on the road

386
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,780
 She sees the figures the car does die

387
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,660
 But she's coasting and she goes they just want to communicate

388
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,780
 She gets out of her car and then just disappears

389
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:44,000
 I have to assume some sort of malevolent force with this because there's very few guardian angels that will

390
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,600
 Check up your car to talk to you right that was always my biggest complaint about that twilight book

391
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,640
 There's a lot of them

392
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,640
 But was that Edward the romantic star at one point doesn't want Bella you guys didn't expect this

393
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,680
 You guys didn't expect this on today's episode Edward doesn't want Bella to go meet the werewolf guy

394
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,200
 Whatever his name was Sean or Sam or something like that

395
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,720
 Edward doesn't want Bella to go meet that dude Sean the werewolf whatever his name was so Edward

396
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:21,180
 Breaks into her car and rips out the starter engine to her car and says I told you stay away from Sean

397
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,060
 She's like pretty sure that's not his name

398
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,860
 He's like doesn't matter stay away from them because you're not getting this starter engine back and I'm never reading that and I thought I

399
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,220
 Know guys like that. I know guys that would

400
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,900
 Human strength they're not like er, but I know guys that if they could have they would have ripped starter engines out of their

401
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,880
 Girlfriend's cars or girls they're interested in but she ended up with them anyways though

402
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,960
 It's horrible horrible moral of the story, but and then the werewolf ends up with her baby

403
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,680
 It's the whole the book is so all the books are weird didn't finish the last one, but it did three of them

404
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,000
 my point is is that

405
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,800
 Good things good guys don't normally damage your car or even temporarily

406
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,080
 It's so good that that gin that I summon was throwing down spike strips on the road doesn't happen

407
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:11,580
 You could say guardian angel makes it so your gas pedal doesn't work just right and then a car goes by it because you were

408
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,060
 decelerated fine

409
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:20,200
 But to actually like kill your engine and have you glide down this dark road as you're surrounded by ghosts or demons or whatever

410
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,700
 They were aliens who knows seems odd. It's almost like when you read the story

411
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,220
 I'm sure there's a group of people who go oh dude if Monica was in the car June could have had a

412
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,540
 Close encounter like June could have experienced the paranormal

413
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:42,400
 But I think a more rational person me would say good job Monica good job because you probably saved her from

414
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:50,480
 A fate worse than death. Ooh, here's one. Here's one. So to wrap this episode up this chaotic episode

415
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,240
 You're driving down the road late at night

416
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,920
 And then that story happens to you

417
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,040
 I'm gonna repeat the whole thing

418
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,480
 But you're driving down the road late at night your car dies and you've always been a little bit interested in the paranormal

419
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,420
 You've summoned gins you read the Twilight series and now you are in the middle of nowhere

420
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,380
 With these giant beans of shadow and darkness

421
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:18,900
 It has to be the the silhouette would have had to be so pitch black to be noticeable at night

422
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,900
 I've seen things like that. I've seen shadow people like that. It's like watching it. It's really hard to describe

423
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,860
 It's like it's like darker than black

424
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,200
 Very it's like an true absence of light. I've done a couple episodes on those guys

425
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,860
 My personal experiences, but so to be able to see those things against the night sky that have to be

426
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,760
 physically and possibly dark

427
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,560
 Machine good, but you get out of your car. You've always wanted an encounter like this you get out of your car

428
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:55,980
 You just want to communicate you yell out into the darkness. I know you just want to communicate. That's why I've stopped

429
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,220
 Please please tell me what you want me to know

430
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,160
 But you never get to tell that message

431
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:11,560
 The next day your car is still on the side of the road police car shows up tow truck shows up

432
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,100
 Family and friends wonder what happens to you

433
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,160
 Nobody can ever really figure it out

434
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,240
 then on another night

435
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:30,240
 Another car is driving down that same stretch of road and that night a keen observer

436
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,080
 May notice

437
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,040
 There's an extra

438
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,120
 Giant shadow standing on the side of the road

439
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,880
 looking for another victim

440
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,880
