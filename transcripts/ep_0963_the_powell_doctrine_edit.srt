1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What would you do if one day you woke up in the middle of the night to grab a little midnight snack out of your fridge?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 But instead you're confronted by the ghastly vision of a dead boy screaming out "Please don't kill me, sir! It was only one pie!"

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 You're like "Dude, I gotta lay off the mescaline if this is what happens when I wake up in the middle of the night."

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And then we take a look at what happens when a conspiracy theorist is in charge of your local government.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And we are forced to ask the question, "What if he's right?"

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 [music]

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started. First off, flying into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone give a round of applause for our newest Patreon supporter,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Despicable B. Woo-yah-ha-ha-yah! Woo-hoo-yah-yah! We're trying not to clap too hard. We might accidentally squish B.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 B, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't swear to Patreon, I totally get it.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. You have no idea how much that helps out.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Despicable B, get all your arms ready. I'm gonna toss you an oar for the Dead Rabbit Roe Boat.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 We're gonna roe, roe, roe out of Dead Rabbit Command all the way out too.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Sanger, California. Sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Sangre, California. Sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Eventually you will end up at 87 Acacia Drive, a simple house and a simple suburb somewhere deep in California. But this house has a horrifying issue.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Food keeps disappearing from the fridge. That might not sound super scary. It really isn't that scary.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But here's the thing, I have such a limited amount of food in my fridge at any given time.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Right now all I have is a bunch of Gatorade, half-drinking bottle of zero Coke that's like dream flavored or something like that.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 It tastes like pineapple. It's disgusting. And it's not gonna taste any better.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I don't know why I just keep taking zips from it every once in a while and go "Ehhh!"

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And put it back. I should just pour it out. But I got a bunch of Gatorade. I have a bottle of Coke Zero dream flavor and then some water and some Slim Fast. That's it.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 But I count on those things. I don't like them. I'm sure I'm thirsty. I hope that Coke Zero dream flavor is still in there.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I take a sip. I'm like "I'm not thirsty anymore. It's cured my thirst."

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I'm a man that doesn't have a lot of food in his fridge or really anywhere in my pantry. I just kinda get what I eat and eat what I get.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Never really had a big back of a food. So if I went to go eat my can, I do have a pantry.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 This is all the food that I eat. You guys are immediately joining the Patreon. You're like "Jason, you're gonna starve."

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I do have a pantry. I'll reach in and I'll pull out a can of beef tamales. Did you know they sell tamales in a can?

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I do. Cause I eat them. And cans of chili. Got canned chili.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 But I know like I'm like "Oh dude, I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry for that can of beef tamales. They're actually pretty good."

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And you're shaking your head. You're like "Oh, can I join the Patreon, Jason? Go buy some real tamales."

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I'm fine. I'm fine. But let's say I come home from work and I'm just ready to dig into those tamales.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And they weren't there. I'd be totally bummed dude. It'd be like "Oh no."

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 "I'd find something else to eat but I really was in the mood for some canned beef tamales."

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I would instantly know if stuff was missing from my pantry or from my fridge. And I think most people would.

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 If you were really looking forward to say a salad and you had like a head of lettuce and a couple tomatoes and some onions, whatever else goes in a salad,

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 and you can't wait to go home and chop it up, chop chop chop chop and make a salad, you go there and there's no lettuce.

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 You'd be like "Oh no. Now I'm just going to sit here and eat one tomato and one onion."

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 You're like "No Jason, normal people have extra food." Normal people don't just go "Oh I want a meal and it's not there."

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And then you just sit there in the dark. It would be an issue. You may not horrifying maybe the wrong word for it,

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 but not knowing like coming home and thinking you're going to have something to eat and not being there does completely suck.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Okay, it's not horrifying. You find a very inconvenient issue because food's missing from your fridge.

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Now I think your first thing, you wouldn't go paranormal right off the bat.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I don't think so. If you noticed food was missing from your fridge, you would think "Well maybe I ate it, right? Maybe I already ate it."

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Or maybe someone came over. I did have that part of the other day and the guy was hiding in my head of lettuce.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He's like "Hmm, are you going to eat that later?" You're like "Yeah Joe, I'm totally going to make a salad."

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 "Why do you just want a head of lettuce anyways?" "I'm just curious. I mean if you don't want it, you know I'll eat it."

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 "I'll eat it right now. I bet you $5 I can't eat that whole head of lettuce. Get out of here. Go, go."

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 You would think it might be somebody like a roommate or family member that's snacking that you don't know about, right?

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 That's doing some late night snacking. But as you're sitting there in front of your fridge and you're like "Where did that food go?"

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 All of a sudden you hear a voice going "Oh man, please. Don't blow my brains out."

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 You're like "What? Where did that come from?" "No sir, please. It was just a single pie. Oh no please. I'm just an orphan."

55
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 "Don't shoot me in the face." You're like "What? This is super specific. This is super weird. What's going on?"

56
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And you realize that somewhere around you you can hear the disembodied voice of a young boy.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 "Please sir. It just looks so delicious and I really wanted to..."

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 *Groans*

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 You're standing there outside your fridge. You just wanted a snack.

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And instead you heard a little monologue from a ghost boy.

61
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Apparently.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 At Acacia Drive. Specifically 87 Acacia Drive.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I tried looking this house up this exact house on Google Maps and it brought me to 3 Acacia Drive.

64
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And then when I started looking at the address since I started zooming in, looking at people's addresses.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I couldn't find exactly 87 Acacia Drive. So I don't know if this house still specifically exists or at some point it got torn down.

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 But on this street, in this house, or in this area, supposedly there is this haunting.

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 A food goes missing from your fridge and then you'll hear a young boy pleading for his life.

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 "Don't shoot me please. Not again!"

69
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 How many times have you been shot? Well I've still got a bunch of pies.

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Let's travel back in time to the Great Depression.

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And not at Acacia Drive because it didn't exist at this time. It's just kind of a field.

72
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Nearby though. Nearby during the Great Depression there was this farmer.

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And he's sitting at home and his wife is baking up a pie.

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He's like, "Ah yes, the Great Depression. I sure am sad. Someone needs to invent some Zolofta."

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 But until then, I'll just sit against this chair and wait for that cherry pie to finish cooking.

76
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And then Ma goes, "Well, it's done, but you know..."

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I didn't actually know this was a thing. Is this a thing?

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 "We have to let it sit on the windowsill to cool. You can't just eat this pie."

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Okay. I guess. I mean, I'm not saying... like, did they put it at the windowsill?

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It seems like that would be an invitation for people to steal it.

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 At the very least, a crow is gonna get a couple cherries out of it.

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 "Let it cool on the table."

83
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Or anywhere where some random orphan, which is what happens here.

84
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 The woman is cooling the pie on the windowsill, and an orphan boy is wandering through the area.

85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And he's so hungry. He's like, "Oh, I've got to eat something.

86
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 This Great Depression, when will it end?"

87
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And he's walking by and he smells the cherry pie from the windowsill.

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 There's no reports that he actually floated as his nostrils were tickled by a little scent line that wasn't in the reports.

89
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But the orphan smells the fresh pie and sees it and walks up to it and he grabs the pie off the windowsill and takes off running.

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Now, the farmer sees what has happened and he grabs his rifle.

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Kind of overreaction, but he grabs his rifle and he runs out after the orphan boy.

92
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I get it. It's not a lot of money. It's the Great Depression.

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 This may not be able to make another pie.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 But if someone is running with a pie and you pull a gun on them, a couple things are going to happen.

95
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 One, they're probably just going to drop the pie, right?

96
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 It's not like they're going to keep holding on and eventually we'll catch up to them and get the pie back.

97
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 If you were running with a pie, you were running with a hot pie, and a guy came out with a shotgun.

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 You're ditching the pie. It's going to make you run a little bit slower.

99
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I don't have a hungry yore and you can't just start eating it there.

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 It's a hot pie. I'm like, "Oh, if I have enough cherries, that'll give me the energy to escape."

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 It's still piping hot.

102
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 The kid's going to drop the pie, or the kid's going to keep running with the pie, and it's just going to slosh all over the place and stuff like that.

103
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 He should have just let the kid have the pie, is what I'm saying.

104
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But he doesn't. The farmer takes off after him with the rifle, and the kid's running.

105
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 There's also no reports on what happened to the pie. We don't know who ate it, but we can assume the orphan kid didn't get it.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 The kid's running, the farmer's chasing him with the rifle, and eventually the kid gets to this area that would soon be a Keisha Drive.

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But at this point it's just kind of an empty field.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 The farmer catches up to him and levels that rifle right at the boy, and he goes, "Sir, please, I didn't mean to steal your pie."

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 "Well, I didn't mean to steal your pie." It was an accident.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And then just walked by, and he jumped into my hand, "Sir, please, I'm just so hungry."

111
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 "I'm so sorry, I just really needed a cherry pie."

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And that farmer aims that rifle right at him.

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 "No, sir, please, I just wanted something to eat."

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Now there's two different reports. One is that the gun accidentally discharged.

115
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 The farmer was thinking, "Well, you know, just a young boy. I don't want to scatter his brains all over this empty field."

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 The other one is that he shot him. The other one is that the farmer didn't care.

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 The police for mercy went unheard, and he shot this kid in close range with a rifle.

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Had said pie survived this long, if the kid was able to expertly carry it all the way to this part of the field, he sets it down gently.

119
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 He turns around and pleads for his life.

120
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 "I still want to eat this pie. I'm scared if it was perfectly there because now there's dead boy all over your pie."

121
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 He's like, farmer's like, "Oh, I didn't think about that. Can't eat it now, or can I?"

122
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 What we have today is the ghost of this boy in this house, because, you know, he died and then eventually a neighborhood sprung up around it.

123
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He haunts this house and food disappears.

124
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And every so often you'll hear him moaning and crying out, "Please don't shoot me. It was just a pie."

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 This is a super interesting haunting. On the one hand, this is what we call a residual haunting.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's basically the spirit of the boy is long gone.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 This is a psychic recording of an extremely tragic event.

128
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 A young kid being shot, being murdered because he was so hungry he stole the pie.

129
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And it's one of those hauntings that just continues to play out over and over and over again.

130
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 This is the most common type of haunting. This is the most common type of ghost activity.

131
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You can't interact with the child on any sort of level. You're just hearing his place for help because when he was killed, he left a psychic scar across the area.

132
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But that only accounts for the voice.

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 What makes this an unusual haunting is not only is it playing out an event over and over and over and over again,

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 like the ghost walking down the hallway, or the ghost woman standing in the attic looking for her long lost lover to come home from the Civil War.

135
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 These are just recordings of events.

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 The disappearing food is one of the most rare type of hauntings.

137
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That's where we start to get into poltergeist activity.

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 When physical matter is appearing or disappearing, that is one of the most rare types of hauntings.

139
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 So this is a really interesting one.

140
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Ghostly voices over and over again.

141
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Dime a dozen. Dime a dozen.

142
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Having food. And again, it's not like pennies disappearing. It's not like where to put my car keys type of thing.

143
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It's specifically food. It's specifically a single type of item that continues to go missing.

144
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Now of course, the story could totally be made up. It could 100% be Urban Legend.

145
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I found it reported in two different places.

146
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 TheShadowlands.net, which is one of my favorite repository of ghostly stuff.

147
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It's been doing a scryte here October, like I said, a ghost story a day, and I'm actually shocked that I've been able to keep to that.

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And then there is a, on this website called Kings River Life, which is a local website, local news.

149
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 They had a story called, they had an article called Ghost Stories of Sanger.

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So they also are reporting this as well.

151
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But it makes us ask the question, where's the food going?

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Obviously, if you have roommates in your house or you have a family and food goes missing, you know where it's going.

153
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It's going into their belly.

154
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 But if a ghost is taking this food, is he capable of eating it?

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Is he capable of actually destroying matter?

156
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Because that's a huge thing.

157
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 That, as far as the paranormal world goes, that's so insane.

158
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Can a ghost, can the dead actually destroy matter?

159
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 When a human eats a head of lettuce, you can digest it and then you expel it from your body, right?

160
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 You poop it out.

161
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 But what happens when a ghost eats a head of lettuce?

162
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 What happens when a ghost eats a can of tamales or a pie?

163
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Like, where does that go? Does it turn into some sort of ectoplasmic residue?

164
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Does it simply disappear from the mortal coil?

165
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Obviously, we don't know, because there's so much stuff we don't know about ghosts.

166
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 We're looking at a ghost that's actually hungry.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 He died hungry and now his ghost is continuing to destroy matter.

168
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 In some way. Is it simply disappearing?

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Is he devouring it? Who knows?

170
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I remember a long time ago, I've actually tried so hard to find this article.

171
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Again, I didn't bookmark it like I normally do. I was being a dork.

172
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But I found this really, so I can't cite it, but I'll tell you the story.

173
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I found a really interesting thing.

174
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's very, very common in ghost stories.

175
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Specifically, in places that are haunted like hotels, haunted businesses, haunted department stores,

176
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 that the bathroom sinks will turn themselves on.

177
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You'll be in there all by yourself, and these aren't the new ones with the sensors that do turn themselves on.

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 You'd be in the bathroom all by yourself and then you'd hear the water running behind you,

179
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 and you turn around and you actually see the switch flipped up on the water faucet.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 I mean, that actually takes physical strength to move up and down.

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Lights going on and off. To us, it takes physical strength, again, before the age of motion detectors,

182
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 but you actually have to flick a switch.

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 That can also easily be some sort of wiring issue, right?

184
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Or the light bulbs uninstalled correctly or anything like that.

185
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But to have water come out of a faucet, you actually have to turn it up and down.

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 It requires a manual strength, manual movement, and strength to turn the water on and off.

187
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Super common, though, when we look at haunted businesses, haunted hotels,

188
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 they had bathrooms will do this, haunted department stores and so on and so forth.

189
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 You'll see it also in houses as well. You'll hear about the water faucet turning on and off in the kitchen.

190
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 And I saw this website and they actually, I can't believe I dropped the ball on this.

191
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I wish I could cite it for you. I'll try one last time before, maybe I can put in the show notes,

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 but they said the reason why ghosts turn the water on and off, like that is a very common thing.

193
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 The lights flickering on and off, we can imagine, is just spooky, right?

194
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 For whatever reason, ghosts love to be super spooky.

195
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 But the reason why they turn the water on and off, and it said this very plainly in the sense,

196
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 matter of factually, ghosts are constantly thirsty.

197
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 They're parched.

198
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So they turn the water on and they're drinking it.

199
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I had never heard that theory before. It sounds like common sense.

200
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It really does sound like common sense, because that is such a normal thing that happens in haunted places,

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 the water turning on and off.

202
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I said they're drinking it. I was like, wow, that's really creepy.

203
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I don't know why I didn't save that bookmark, but yeah.

204
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 You have, but see even then, like if a ghost is drinking the water, the water's not actually disappearing.

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 You're still seeing it run through. It's just the idea that someone turned it on.

206
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 You didn't, you're the only person in the bathroom.

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 But do ghosts eat and drink?

208
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And if so, that opens up to where do these products go?

209
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 When I drink, I know what's going to happen to it.

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I know where the water's going to be in an hour or two. It's going to be coming back out of me.

211
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Fascinating ghost story, and it does make you ask, is this ghost actually consuming this food?

212
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Is the ghost in some way actually, it's possible that the ghost is just taking it?

213
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 But then the question is where?

214
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's not like, and one day we went into the basement and it was full of all the food we had lost in the past 40 years.

215
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Rotten vegetables all the way down.

216
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Where is the food going? If the ghost is actually dematerializing the food, that's one thing.

217
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Where is it going? But if he's eating it, that's even weirder.

218
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Because then, like, how does it biologically work? Well, it doesn't. There's no biological system into this ghost.

219
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But eating and drinking, is it something that ghosts do?

220
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Fascinating story, if you happen to live out in Sanger, California, if you happen to live out there, go knock on this house and go,

221
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 "Hey, can I see your fridge?" Actually, don't do that, because that's the reason why Alice Jones just got sued and lost for a billion dollars.

222
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I haven't covered that. I think that's big enough news.

223
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I probably, I mean, it's really fascinating as far as the world of conspiracy theory goes that you have that judgment against them.

224
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 But that was the big issue. People were going to the houses of the families of the Sandy Hook victims and knocking on their doors and harassing them.

225
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So, do not do that involving this ghost. It is an interesting ghost story.

226
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I wonder what's actually going on there. Urban legend, actual haunting.

227
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 If it's an actual haunting, there's a whole host of questions here about what could be going on.

228
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Despicable Bee, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the Carboner Coptor.

229
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 We are leaving behind Sanger, California. We dropped off a ton of food for this hungry, hungry ghost.

230
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Fly us all the way out to Vermont.

231
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADAD

232
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 We imagine them with big beards. They're digging up giant skeletons.

233
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Giant skeletons being found all over the United States.

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We're watching montages of people standing next to giant skeletons and then people winning awards for the best giant skeleton ever dug up.

235
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And then, off in the distance, off in the distance, every time a giant skeleton is dug up, you start to see a train coming towards them.

236
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And this train has on board a bunch of experts from the Smithsonian.

237
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They're here to validate the claim of these giant skeletons.

238
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Giant skeletons of America is a very popular conspiracy theory.

239
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 There's photographs. There's a lot of photographs of these people.

240
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 There's photographs of them standing next to these giant skeletons that they just dug up.

241
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And then the skeletons always just disappeared.

242
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 We did a whole episode on it. I'll put it in the show notes.

243
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I find it interesting. I think the problem with that conspiracy theory, I'll put my cards on the table,

244
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 is that newspapers lie. They lie today. They lied back then.

245
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 They'll tell lies to sell newspapers. And I think a lot of those photos were fake.

246
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I think those articles were put in there to drum up business for the newspaper.

247
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 We did an episode a while back about a newspaper that ran a five-part series saying they had the world's strongest telescope

248
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 and they saw people dancing on the moon. And it was totally made up.

249
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It was totally made up. I don't even think I have to say that the 100% made it up.

250
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So I think a lot of these photographs were fake. Now were all of them fake?

251
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 We've done enough stories about legends of giants in America.

252
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 We had that Native tribe that was a bunch of giant red-headed cannibals running around kidnapping other people.

253
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 I do believe that giants could have existed.

254
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I'm not totally saying they're all made up, but I think a lot of them were. I think a lot of these photographs were.

255
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 But that's not even the most interesting part of the conspiracy theory. Are they real? Are they fake?

256
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The conspiracy theory really is this Smithsonian Institute

257
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 who was supposed to be collecting all of these artifacts from all around America

258
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and finding out what the heritage was of this country, both pre- and post-colonialism,

259
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 when they got these skeletons they smashed them to pieces.

260
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 They were actively covering up the existence of giants in America.

261
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But the question always was why? Why would they do this?

262
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You have a giant. You have a giant in your country. Why would you want to destroy this?

263
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And when I did this episode, if I remember correctly, it's been years since I've listened to it,

264
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 but when I did this episode, I think the leading conspiracy theory was

265
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 that if you have giants, if you have proof of giants, you have proof of the Bible.

266
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 The idea was that because giants, outside of David and Goliath,

267
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 giants are basically the Nephilim, their proof that angels came down and had sex with human women

268
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and created a race of giants, a race of heroes of renown.

269
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And God's like, this is the one I had planned for the humans. I didn't want these half-human, half-angels.

270
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 So he sent the flood to destroy the Nephilim.

271
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And then Noah gets in his ark and the animals and all that stuff.

272
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And it's the restart of humanity as to what we know today.

273
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So if you could prove that giants existed, it would be proof that the Bible was true.

274
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And the Smithsonian, this godless institution, wanted to do whatever it took

275
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 to make sure people didn't think the Bible was true.

276
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 That's the leading conspiracy theory as to why they would actually want to destroy these skeletons.

277
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 What's even more fascinating than that is what may actually be the reason why they were doing this.

278
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Because to be fair, we don't know if they were actually smashing skeletons.

279
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 We have reports of these skeletons being found. Who knows how many of those reports were just fake from the get-go.

280
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 But let's say you had, let's say five of them were real, or ten or a dozen, whatever.

281
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You would have these skeletons shipped off to the Smithsonian to be studied and they would never be heard from again.

282
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 At the time where we had all of this stuff popping up, there was a guy named John Wesley Powell.

283
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And he was in charge of the Bureau of Ethnology for the United States from 1879 to 1902.

284
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So again, we're matching up to when these articles were popping up in the newspaper.

285
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 The Bureau of Ethnology, or the Bureau of American Ethnology is what it came to be known as,

286
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 worked directly with the Smithsonian Institute.

287
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And John Wesley Powell was the author of the Powell Doctrine, which basically directed how we would study pre-colonial times in America.

288
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 There will be no reading into information. There will be no examination of artifacts.

289
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 There will be no trying to connect any Native structure, building, art form, or language to any culture outside of the United States.

290
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 No, we think the Vikings got here. No ancient Chinese landed on the shores of California.

291
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 No boat came from Assyria and left some markings on a cave somewhere deep in Arizona. None of that.

292
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 No civilization from the New World contacted the natives of America pre-Columbus. End of story. It didn't happen.

293
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Not only did it not happen, it's actually disrespectful to the cultures that were here, building the mounds, building the structures,

294
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 creating the art, creating the language that the Native Americans did.

295
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 They go, "It's completely disrespectful to think that a boat from India got lost and ended up on the shores of Texas and taught them how to write.

296
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I'm not going to have it."

297
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And because he was in charge of the Bureau of Ethnology, he set the direction for investigation pre-Columbus.

298
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 We're not even talking pre-colonial. Pre-Columbus. No one came from the New World to America ever.

299
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 If you see any evidence of that, you're reading it wrong.

300
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 This fascinating stuff, right? Here's this guy who is making this blanket claim and everyone goes, "Yeah, sure."

301
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So when we do find Viking runes on the East Coast that easily predate any sort of pilgrims, any sort of explorers that are post-Columbus,

302
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 completely written off, it's a fraud, doesn't exist, someone must have carved it after the fact.

303
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 We find language in the American Southwest that is similar to languages from the Middle East.

304
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Now, totally, either it was a mistake or you're reading it wrong, because that didn't happen.

305
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 So when it comes to the giant skeletons, it's the same thing.

306
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 When you would look at these, a lot of times they're adorned with spears and jewelry and all these other accrued tomance.

307
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 That word, did I say that right?

308
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 That is not of the native tribe.

309
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Smash 'em.

310
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Get rid of 'em.

311
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 And what's really interesting is we go, "Okay, so he believes that.

312
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 The Pal doctrine changed the way we looked at things.

313
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Really the way we are examining history.

314
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 If you saw something that looked like a Syrian, you saw writing that appeared to be Greek, it wasn't.

315
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You're reading it wrong.

316
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Why?

317
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Why?

318
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Why is he so adamant about this?

319
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Some people say it's because he had tremendous respect for the natives that were here and he didn't want to undercut their systems

320
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 and they wanted to undercut their technology and their writing by saying, "Oh, but someone else gave it to him."

321
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 However, and that might be true, but however there's another group of people who believe, and this is so fascinating,

322
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 this is going to lead into the next story too, so fascinating.

323
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 A lot of people believe the reason why he was adamant that there was no one here before the Native Americans

324
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 and there was no contact between the New World and the Old World, or yeah, the Old World's Europe,

325
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 between the Old World and the New World, pre-Columbus, because he hated Mormons.

326
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And the Mormon religion, really in a nutshell, just like the history of it,

327
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I'm not going to go into the actual, like, pre-Joseph Smith and all that stuff, pre-finding the golden tablets,

328
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 is that there were massive empires in America.

329
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 They had these two huge warring groups of people that had these, what we would describe as European-level battles, right?

330
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 These like, England and France colliding over territory, that's what we were talking about.

331
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 They weren't these little separate tribes that kind of were nomadic moving across the wilderness.

332
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 No, they had an empire, they had multiple empires that went to war on American soil.

333
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And there are, within the Latter-day Saints, there are archaeologists that are looking for proof of these great battles,

334
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 of these great civilizations that once existed in America.

335
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 John Wesley Powell, his father was a Methodist preacher in Palmyra, New York.

336
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And when the Book of Mormon was published in 1830, it started a wildfire of people wanting to convert to Mormonism.

337
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 And John's own father was affected by this.

338
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 John's father, his church, was emptied out.

339
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 All of his congregation joined the Latter-day Saints.

340
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And this Methodist minister couldn't believe that so many people could be led astray, led astray by this religion that just popped up.

341
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And saying all this crazy stuff about these empires in America, and you had these ruling elite, and they're riding their mighty beasts into combat,

342
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 and all these crazy battles and all of this technology, this golden armor, it just doesn't exist.

343
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 None of it exists. How can people be believing this book? I lost all the members of my church.

344
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 This is blasphemous.

345
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 So when his son grows up, he sees the effect that it has on his father, sees the effect that it has on the community when he grows up and joins the Bureau of Ethnology.

346
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 He says that is impossible, and if you find any proof that there was any sort of advanced contact on this continent, it doesn't exist.

347
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 You're reading it wrong. End of story.

348
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 So forget the giant skeletons, right?

349
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Is it possible that Smithsonian was actually smashing up this proof of the Mormon religion?

350
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It's a fascinating story. That's actually not the story I plan to tell.

351
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Like, I have another story that's more... I have a story that just happened a couple months ago that I want to talk about, too.

352
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I think I'm going to save that till tomorrow, because this is...

353
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I've been wanting to tell this story. I've actually been looking for a good place to put it, so I think we're going to kind of wrap it up here for this one.

354
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 But yeah, it's a crazy conspiracy. Is it true?

355
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I've always been... It's funny, because there's so many ways to break it down. I'll try to wrap it up very quickly.

356
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 But first up, I would understand John Wesley Powell's motivations both ways, right?

357
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 The one is based on anger. The one is based on anger.

358
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Now, he could have seen what the Mormon religion did to his community and did to his father, right?

359
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 To be a minister with no congregation. You're not really a minister. I mean, you're a man of God, sure.

360
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But you know who you preach into. They're all gone.

361
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And he wanted revenge. Again, he's hearing from his dad. Like, this is just idolatry. This isn't real.

362
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Look at this. Look at what's in this book. None of this is real.

363
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 And then you can imagine the sun taking on that anger.

364
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 So if someone did get a telegram from the middle of Mississippi saying, "Hey, we did find this weird thing. We found like a set of golden armor."

365
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 What do we do with this? Well, we know for a fact that golden armor was not here, pre-Columbus.

366
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 So it might be a fraud. But just send it back. We'll take care of it. Melt it down. He's walking around with a golden grill.

367
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 He's like, "Hehehe." But then we take a look at, let's say his motivation wasn't spiked out of the Mormon religion, ruining his father's church.

368
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I could also understand him, because he definitely did have this doctrine. The Pal doctrine is a real document.

369
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I'll put it in the links, but you also have the motivation of him saying, "Listen, the natives to America, all of these tribes, they are advanced.

370
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 They all have this advanced society. They've done these things."

371
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And to say that, "Oh, they were just a bunch of people eating grass until the Assyrians showed up, a wave washed them over all the way from the Middle East."

372
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And then they showed up here and they taught him how to ride and taught him how to draw and taught him how to have a society.

373
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 It really is demeaning, right? It would be demeaning. I could see him doing that as well.

374
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 He said, "I have great respect for the natives of this country before we got here."

375
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Would it be right if he did that? No. As a historian, you want the story to be what it is.

376
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 You want it to be. Whether or not history is good or bad, that's not the point. It's the fact that this is what happened.

377
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 I've always been a believer that you did have contact between the old world and the new world before Columbus.

378
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But I don't think it was. The natives didn't know how to do anything until a Viking boat showed up in New England and then they talked and then they're like,

379
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 "Whoa, you can write stuff down too." I think the tribes, all the different tribes of America, they had their art system, they had their writing system,

380
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 they had their society, they had their government, and then a couple Vikings showed up in New England.

381
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 It would have been a hard scrabble world to live in, right?

382
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 But you leave your etchings on rocks somewhere out there, some runes, and eventually they either got obliterated by the locals or they integrated into the locals

383
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 or they just died on their own eating some poison berries. The end.

384
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 I do believe stuff like that happened. I do believe when you find a tablet that is clearly not of a language of the locals in the area that either someone brought,

385
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 I mean, you could say you're misreading it, sure. It could be a modern fraud, sure. But when you can get rid of those two, when you can debunk those two and say,

386
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 "No, we know that this was carved back in 1300 AD. We know for a fact it's not modern." We can look at it and you could say we're misreading it,

387
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 but this clearly looks like this is not from around here. This clearly looks like it is a Syrian or this is Chinese or whatever.

388
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Then you have to say, "Yeah, there probably were isolated incidents where boats were blown off course and they thought they were going to die out in the middle of nowhere

389
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and they ended up washing along the shores of California." I do believe that that happened. We did a cool episode, one of my favorite episodes about the Viking boat that's found in Death Valley.

390
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I love, that's one of my favorite stories. I think even when I was recording it, I think I said it was one of my favorite stories and in this day it's one of my favorite stories.

391
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 I do believe that. The giant skeletons going back to that, that's always the thing, like yellow journalism, they're making stuff up.

392
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 But some of it could have been real. Some of those giant skeletons could have been real. A giant in and of itself isn't an oddity.

393
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 We have giants today. I think that's possible. I definitely think it's possible that you had some giants.

394
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 I don't know if, we have giants today. When people see Shaq that don't go, "Well, I guess the Bible's true."

395
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 He's just a really cool basketball player, right? Seems like a really nice guy. People aren't like, "Wow, well, they talked about giants in the Bible and here I'm looking at an entire roster of giants.

396
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 They're called the LA Lakers, therefore the Bible's true." I don't really get that, but I don't think it would be proof of the Bible.

397
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 But I do think that if you're using the pal doctrine and you get a phone call or a telegram back in the late 1800s and they're saying, "Hey, we found this giant skeleton, the Smithsonian,"

398
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 according to the pal doctrine would say, "This is a fake. This is not real."

399
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 And at the very end of the day, if this is actual proof of a society outside of the Native American society that we know of, it doesn't exist.

400
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 You'd be like, "Well, we're clearly looking at this skeleton." It doesn't exist. And you would make it not exist.

401
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 So the idea of them smashing skeletons, not so people don't believe in the Bible, but smashing the skeletons because they're being told this stuff doesn't exist.

402
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 What you're looking at is either fake or you're misreading it, right? It's just some guy with gigantism. It doesn't mean anything. Just smash it to pieces.

403
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Or box it up, shove it away, we'll get to it later. But you never meant to get to it later because it would actually be proof of another civilization where 100% there wasn't one.

404
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 It was just the Native Americans. It's a fascinating, fascinating story, and it does dovetail into what I wanted to talk about.

405
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And again, equally fascinating, we'll talk about that tomorrow, where we're going to meet a conspiracy theorist in the local government who's affecting people today.

406
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 This was just supposed to be a segue, really, but I really love this topic. John Wellesley Powell had a theory, a conspiracy theory.

407
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 I mean, we would say it's interesting because we would say it's not a conspiracy theory, Jason. This is history. This is what we know.

408
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 But the reason why it's history is because the person in charge of it said, "Get rid of any proof." To be fair, he didn't say smash the skeleton.

409
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 To be fair, he doesn't say it in a document. He's just saying if you find it and it points to an origin outside of the Native Americans, you're reading it wrong or it's fake.

410
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And that was the directive. That was the doctrine. And people followed it. And now it's just history. People may not explicitly follow it, but it pretty much is followed now.

411
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Whenever you see an article about something being found that is proof of a pre-Columbus contact with an old world, it's always been like it's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake. It's fake.

412
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 All these articles would just be kind of debunking it. And some of it does deserve to be debunked, right? Some of it is fake.

413
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 But this guy put his finger on the scale. Historians were looking into this stuff and he had his finger on the scale. And how many people knew that his father hated Mormons?

414
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 How many people knew that? Puts his finger on the scale. So when they're trying to figure out what this is, you have this invisible hand pushing down this pal doctrine saying,

415
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 "Well, it's not that. And it's not that. So it must just be a mistake. It must be a fraud."
