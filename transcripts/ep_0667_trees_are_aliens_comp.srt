00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
 Meth Monday returns with the story of a man who just wants to inject meth in a Starbucks

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,720
 restroom and watch a little porn.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,460
 What's wrong with that?

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,640
 And then we take a look at a bizarre new conspiracy theory that I just came up with.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,680
 Well, I'm sure other people believe it, but it might be true.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,680
 We spend so much time looking in the skies for aliens or looking at the people next to

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,960
 us wondering if they're men in black.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,560
 Or if the true aliens are trees today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,080
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,920
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,840
 First off, we got to welcome our newest Patreon supporter into Dead Rabbit Command, writing

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,200
 in on a beautiful tiny little pony named Gammy Ginn.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,600
 It is Splack Artorias.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440
 Splack Artorias is riding in.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,800
 He's like, "I haven't even listened to this episode yet."

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,760
 On this tiny little demon pony.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,720
 If you haven't listened to episode 666, Gammy Ginn is a demon pony from that episode.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,800
 It was a goofy episode, a fun episode, an episode for the fluffle for the fans.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
 I really enjoyed recording it.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,080
 I hope you guys had fun listening to it.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,040
 And now Splack Artorias is on the back of a murderous, tiny little pony person who may

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,800
 drown us all at any moment.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,640
 But the moment is not now.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,480
 The moment now is to toss Splack the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,800
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,120
 We are headed out to a Starbucks in your neighborhood.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,840
 Wherever you live, the closest Starbucks, this is where that story took place.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,400
 Gammy Ginn is suspiciously eyeing any large bodies of water as we're driving down the

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,520
 road, but Splack just keep driving faster and faster.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
 Don't let Gammy Ginn murder us all.

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
 We pull up to a local Starbucks.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,680
 We get out to go get a nice cup of Joe.

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,960
 People still even say that?

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,320
 I think my grandpa was the last human alive who called it a cup of Joe.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,520
 And he was probably saying it ironically.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,240
 We're all getting out to grandpa and the rest of you guys are getting out to get a

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
 cup of Joe.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,000
 This story was recommended to me by long time listener Dylan Dobb.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So thanks Dylan.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
 Dylan does not want to be associated with the story.

45
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
 He's like, "shh, don't use my real name.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,960
 I don't want people to know what I'm reading online."

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,240
 Dylan, we're all pointing at him in the crowd.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,520
 Dylan, Dylan, we're saying his social security number and his home address.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,760
 We walk into the so called Starbucks.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
 We're standing in line.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,400
 We're going to get our cup of Joe.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,880
 And there's a man in front of us.

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,960
 He looks totally normal, right?

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,600
 You wouldn't think anything about it.

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,120
 But this man is actually the star of this story.

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,240
 His name or his username, I don't think this was the name his parents gave him, is G. Skeletor.

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,040
 So this is G. Skeletor's story that he posted online.

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,640
 He was going to Starbucks, like we all do, for a little bit of coffee, for a little wake

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,680
 me up, a pick me up thing, you know.

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,480
 It's something you've got to get that cup of Joe in you before you get started working

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,000
 at the old factory.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,720
 But you know, cup of Joe doesn't work for everyone.

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,600
 He wants a little bit of espresso and just a little bit of methamphetamine.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,800
 So he orders his coffee.

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,080
 He goes, puts his coat down on his chair.

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
 This is very normal stuff.

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
 We've all done this.

68
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,920
 The rest of the story is not normal at all.

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,600
 I'm trying to make it as normal as possible.

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,720
 And then he goes into the bathroom.

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,200
 And that's normal too.

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 We all have to defecate or urinate at least two or three times a day.

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
 He goes in there.

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,480
 This is where we enter the Twilight Zone.

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,200
 Once he opens the door, he passes into an alternate universe that's alien to, I hope,

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
 all of us.

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,160
 He says in his Reddit post, this is on Reddit, on the meth board, he says he's recently

78
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
 decided to change the game.

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,320
 He realized that it takes so much time to smoke meth.

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,280
 And if there's one thing that a meth user doesn't have a lot of, it's time.

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,120
 They're usually working like 10, 12 hours a day and sleeping no hours a day and then

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 working the rest of the day.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,600
 And I don't have enough time to smoke meth.

84
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,840
 You gotta put it in your pipe and you gotta like, turn it.

85
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
 And that's it.

86
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
 That's all you have to do.

87
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,600
 It's not super labor intensive to smoke meth.

88
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,760
 But it's too long for G Skeletor.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,800
 He has much better things to do.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,640
 Conquer Eternia for one.

91
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,160
 He can't waste time smoking, so he started injecting his meth.

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,480
 A true meth master, I might say.

93
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,000
 So he goes into the Starbucks bathroom and he injects his meth.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Actually now the thing about it.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,440
 Why would you order, what good is coffee after you've done your meth?

96
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
 Like you're like, oh man, this meth, this meth.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
 I'm gonna get super high and strung out.

98
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,160
 But I also need some espresso.

99
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,840
 Like why would you, I can understand waking up and being like, ugh, I need some energy

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
 to go do my meth.

101
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
 It takes so long.

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,400
 Drink in a little coffee and then do in your meth.

103
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,040
 But at what point, do you, what point do you inject meth into your body and go this isn't

104
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
 enough?

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
 I also need a double shot latte.

106
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
 Like that would be nothing.

107
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,080
 But anyways, he does order, actually wrote down his order.

108
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,600
 It was a double shot vanilla espresso.

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,480
 That's like one grain of meth.

110
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,000
 Anyways he shoots up this meth.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
 He's a man of action.

112
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,840
 Doesn't have time to smoke.

113
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,480
 He shoots up meth.

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
 He goes out.

115
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,800
 He gives his double shot vanilla espresso.

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,200
 He drinks it and he's like, whoa, finally I'm awake.

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,840
 And then he sits down and he pops up his laptop.

118
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,760
 This man is, this, okay, I guess I should have said this in the beginning.

119
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,080
 This is not child appropriates.

120
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,920
 If you have kids, drop them off the nearest Starbucks.

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,680
 Say, I have to listen to this podcast.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
 You guys can hang out at the nearest Starbucks.

123
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,640
 This man loves to watch porn in public places.

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 That's his big thing.

125
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 Not the meth.

126
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
 Not the meth.

127
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,140
 That's just a side hobby.

128
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,320
 That's his hustle.

129
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,400
 His main thing is watching porn in public.

130
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
 He gets a little corner area so no one else can like see anything except for him, puts

131
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,840
 his headphones in, starts watching porn.

132
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,440
 Now I skipped this part.

133
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
 I skipped this part.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,920
 I'm looking back at my notes.

135
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,360
 I love it because I couldn't find, he posts a lot to the meth board, but he posts mostly

136
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,280
 to this board called addicted to the needle.

137
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,080
 I swear Reddit is the biggest cesspool, the biggest cesspool on the planet.

138
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,680
 There's a subreddit called addicted to the needle.

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's all about, it's exactly what it think it is.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,120
 It's about people who are addicted to shooting drugs intravenously.

141
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,360
 And I'm impressed I pronounced that word correctly as well.

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
 Horrible.

143
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
 Why would you have this?

144
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,800
 But anyways, he's on that Reddit a lot and he's on this other one and this is a quote

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
 from this article.

146
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,280
 I've never thought I might introduce myself in this fashion.

147
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,120
 Quote, "Doubt you guys and gals remember, but I'm the guy..."

148
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
 Never.

149
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,880
 I've never had to, I've never thought I would read a sentence.

150
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,040
 I've never thought I would have to describe myself like this.

151
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
 I'm not.

152
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
 This is what this guy's saying.

153
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,960
 Quote, "Doubt you guys remember, but I'm the guy..."

154
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,800
 Doubt you guys remember, but I'm the guy that likes to do meth in public and then jerk

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,600
 off and bu- jerk off in public.

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,080
 How could you forget this guy?

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
 How he's like, "Oh, I don't know if you guys remember me."

158
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,000
 We're like, "Dude, we remember you."

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I'm the guy who we know.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,400
 You're the guy who likes to do meth in public and jack off in public.

161
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,040
 He's like, "That's me."

162
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,120
 Anyways, he goes into the Starbucks.

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,600
 He's sitting in his corner booth.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,120
 He has his headphones on.

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,280
 He's profusely sweating from the methamphetamine and the anticipation of watching porn in public.

166
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
 It's his thing.

167
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
 Don't you remember?

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
 He's the guy who loves to do this.

169
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
 He specifies he likes watching gangbang videos.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,480
 He mentions that several times in the post.

171
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
 It's like, "I don't care.

172
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 I don't care.

173
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,080
 You're not adding to the visual of it, sir."

174
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,360
 It doesn't matter if you're looking through a JCPenney catalog and masturbating in public.

175
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,760
 It's gross either way, but no, he's a connoisseur.

176
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,560
 You need to know it's gangbang videos.

177
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,120
 And he's sitting there.

178
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,880
 He doesn't- he's like a genie.

179
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,400
 He sits there with his arms crossed and he's masturbating.

180
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
 And you're thinking, "How in the world?

181
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 He's a master at this.

182
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,840
 He's the man who's known for doing this."

183
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,120
 Apparently he's wearing sweatpants or something like that.

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,480
 This is going way more detail than I planned.

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,640
 But his erection's rubbing against his thigh.

186
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,760
 And he's just watching this video and shimmying and sweating profusely.

187
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,960
 Stuff that people normally don't do at a Starbucks.

188
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,760
 You just see some guy sitting in the corner watching a movie and he's kind of doing a little

189
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
 shimmy shake.

190
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
 And he's sweating.

191
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,040
 He's super disgusting.

192
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,400
 And that's how he masturbates.

193
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,360
 Now I'm going to give him credit for that.

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,320
 That is a skill I have not mastered or ever even thought was possible.

195
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
 He does this all the time.

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,920
 He masturbates in public and for whatever reason this time suspicions were raised.

197
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,400
 A barista walks over to him.

198
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,960
 Now he's usually really good at this.

199
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,160
 Normally he slaps the laptop down and goes, "Can I help you?"

200
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,160
 And his sweat is pouring from his face and he's all flush.

201
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
 The barista goes, "Uh, no, no, that's okay.

202
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
 He was just weird.

203
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
 You're kind of shimmying."

204
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
 And then she walks away.

205
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,320
 But this time he was so lost in his porn mindset that the barista walks over and sees this

206
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,720
 gangbang video and it shocks her.

207
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,220
 And she screams.

208
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,880
 And then he screams and he jumps up.

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
 Big boner.

210
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,760
 Now, okay, actually, now that I said that, I can't, he says that it was big.

211
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
 I've been normal sized, right?

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,360
 He's like, "Dude, it was like eight feet tall.

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,480
 I was like knocking over other people's drinks.

214
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,920
 I was turning and I was like tipping chairs.

215
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,160
 It was probably average size.

216
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,520
 Let's not get this guy too much credit."

217
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
 But he jumps.

218
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,920
 Actually, it doesn't matter how big it is.

219
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,400
 If you're sitting at Starbucks, if you're sitting at Starbucks and some dude is sitting

220
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,240
 next to you, jumps up covered in sweat and has any size boner.

221
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,560
 I'm not going to be like, "Whoa, it's not that big."

222
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,880
 It's still bizarre and disgusting.

223
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
 He jumps up.

224
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,960
 His boner pops up.

225
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,520
 She screams even louder.

226
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,680
 He runs out.

227
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,040
 He runs out of the coffee shop and he says, "As he's running."

228
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
 Don't worry.

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,840
 This story has a point.

230
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,680
 I'm not just telling this story for, the story has a point.

231
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
 The story has a point.

232
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,760
 He's running out of Starbucks and as he's running, his boner is rubbing against his sweatpants

233
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,760
 and he begins orgasming in the parking lot.

234
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,640
 As dudes are chasing him, I can almost guarantee they stopped chasing him at that point.

235
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,680
 If you're chasing a guy and you see him orgasm in front of you, just leave him.

236
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
 Doesn't matter what he's done.

237
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,920
 Doesn't matter what crime he's committed.

238
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,960
 Just turn around and go back and try to enjoy your coffee.

239
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,000
 He runs down the street and he gets on a bus and flees the area, which is a great advertisement

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 for public transportation.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Right?

242
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,040
 If you're ever on a bus, you may be on the seat that a sweaty man who just ejaculated

243
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,640
 in his sweatpants is sitting, running from vigilante justice.

244
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,680
 He says in this post, this is the final part of this post, "I hop on the nearest bus and

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,000
 make a clean getaway."

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 It's not clean.

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 This is going to be several.

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,640
 I'm going to just be a getaway.

249
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,120
 "Made a clean getaway, covered in jizz, sweat, and the accomplishment."

250
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
 The accomplishment.

251
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,160
 He's very highfalutin.

252
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:54,000
 "Covered in jizz, sweat, and the accomplishment of knowing I survived my first close call.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,760
 I'm still a free man to masturbate another day."

254
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
 Unquote.

255
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,600
 So he is out there, masturbating right now, to the memory of it.

256
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,280
 I'm telling this story for a couple of reasons.

257
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 One, it is funny.

258
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
 It is a funny story.

259
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,480
 Two, this story provoked a hostile reaction on the meth board of all places.

260
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
 It was about 50/50.

261
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,720
 50/50, half the people were like, "Way to go, man.

262
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,080
 I've always wanted to do that, but I've been too scared to try."

263
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,200
 Other people were calling him a monster, saying he was disgusting, saying this better be made

264
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
 up.

265
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
 How dare you?

266
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 It was bizarre.

267
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,800
 I've never seen a meth addict get indignant.

268
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,600
 Very, very indignant people on this board.

269
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,760
 But the main reason why I wanted to cover the story is I wanted to talk about a unique

270
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
 subculture outside of the meth subculture.

271
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,920
 I've actually wanted to cover this story for a long time.

272
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,520
 And this story gave me a perfect vehicle to take and speak.

273
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:58,480
 Speaking of vehicles, Splacatorious, I'm going to toss you the keys to the hair hang glider.

274
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,400
 G-Skeletor was just using it.

275
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,880
 So where gloves is your piloting it?

276
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,240
 Where gloves I pretty sure I know where his hands have been.

277
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,760
 We're going to have to put Gammy again in a little backpack.

278
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,320
 And Splacatorious, take us up, up and away in the hair hang glider.

279
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:23,080
 We are headed out to a goon cave.

280
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,840
 I came across this subculture probably about a year ago and I wanted to cover it and I

281
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
 didn't.

282
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,800
 And now due to my lack of judgment I'm covering it now.

283
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,120
 This is one of those weird subcultures that it's like on the one hand I know why it exists,

284
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,040
 but on the other hand it seems so innately self-destructive that it's hard for me to

285
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,080
 understand how it propagates itself.

286
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,280
 It's a subculture known as the goons.

287
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,480
 Or they have a bunch of other terms for them.

288
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,080
 They call themselves gooners.

289
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,560
 Why they don't call themselves goonies?

290
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
 I'll have no idea.

291
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
 They totally should call themselves goonies.

292
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
 Because then at least they have the slogan goonies never die, right?

293
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,800
 But no, they call themselves goons or gooners.

294
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,400
 Or this one's more self-explanatory.

295
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
 Pornosexuals.

296
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,440
 These are people who identify their sexual attraction as porn.

297
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,760
 And you go, well isn't that kind of isn't porn innately sexual?

298
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
 Like you what?

299
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
 No, no, no.

300
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,640
 I'll watch porn of like a busty girl walking down the street.

301
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 That's the whole porn.

302
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,440
 It's only like 30 seconds long.

303
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,080
 It's all like a download on my dial-up.

304
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,360
 A busty woman walking down the street.

305
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,640
 And I go, oh I love busty women.

306
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,560
 They love the movie itself, the clip itself.

307
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
 These porno-sexuals or goons.

308
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,480
 And they also consider themselves the anti-no-fap.

309
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
 Which doesn't make sense.

310
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,760
 Because no-fap, you have fapping, which is masturbation, then no-fap, which is anti-masturbation.

311
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
 They're anti-no-fap.

312
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,400
 So one of them just be the normal fap?

313
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,320
 They believe that not only should you masturbate, you should masturbate all the time.

314
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,440
 But you can't ejaculate.

315
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,120
 Gooning is the idea of edging.

316
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,200
 So you masturbate as long as you can without ejaculating.

317
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 Fine.

318
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,640
 I'm being like whatever, right?

319
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,600
 Like as an endurance sport, whatever.

320
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,760
 Someone wants to sit there and do that and they're like dude, oh man I can totally get

321
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,040
 super chafed.

322
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
 That's nothing.

323
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 I'm taking three layers off today.

324
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
 Whoa.

325
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,280
 They can goon all they want.

326
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,120
 Or edge all they want.

327
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,400
 I've heard of that before.

328
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,880
 But goons, again Reddit, complete cesspool.

329
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,920
 If you type in don't do this, don't do this, please don't do this.

330
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,920
 If you go to Reddit and type in goon, you'll get one, a subreddit about the movie goon

331
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,880
 starring that dude from American Pie.

332
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,640
 And then every other thing will be about these guys.

333
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,640
 They believe that you should goon all day long.

334
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,960
 All day long.

335
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,480
 They have several posts about dude I called in sick for work today.

336
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
 All I did was goon.

337
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,840
 Their entire subculture is images of women doing porn stuff and it'll say you're goon

338
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 mommy.

339
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,160
 I'm trying to go off memory here.

340
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,880
 You're goon mommy wants you to quit work and goon all day.

341
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,240
 And that's it.

342
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 And there's hundreds of pictures like that.

343
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 Goon for me baby.

344
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,840
 I actually do have some of them written down here.

345
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,080
 You met a real woman today.

346
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 It was disgusting.

347
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
 Start porn.

348
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,840
 I'm not going to say the F word.

349
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 It's disgusting as this episode's been.

350
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,360
 I'm like, well I'm not going to cuss.

351
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 I cuss in real life.

352
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,680
 I just don't like cussing on the podcast.

353
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,480
 So you can listen to it at work.

354
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,100
 No one's listening to this at work.

355
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,480
 You met a real woman today.

356
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
 It was disgusting.

357
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,880
 Start porn.

358
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,320
 Make love to your fist.

359
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,440
 But the other word.

360
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,840
 They are constantly talking just they call themselves fist effers.

361
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
 Just call yourself goonies.

362
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,400
 You just call yourself goonies.

363
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,560
 It'd be way better.

364
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,080
 There's little gifts of like women doing sex stuff and it says it's caption ruin yourself

365
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 with porn.

366
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,120
 They want you to call in sick.

367
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,960
 They want you to ruin your life.

368
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,120
 Goon caves is where we're at.

369
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,120
 There's a subreddit called goon caves specifically for maximum goon viewing.

370
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
 A goon room.

371
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,280
 Why can't they call it a goon room?

372
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
 They show a guy.

373
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,960
 He has five different pornos going on at once.

374
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,080
 And he's adding a new.

375
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
 He bought a projector.

376
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,680
 He bought a projector to project it on the wall.

377
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,600
 This is that level of porn.

378
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,280
 So it's not like if you get home from work.

379
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,280
 Personally I find porn extremely boring.

380
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
 Like I do not watch porn.

381
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,880
 I'm not saying I've never watched it.

382
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,360
 But like video clips and all that stuff.

383
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,640
 I just find it boring.

384
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,800
 So I'm like scrolling through all of these images and I'm like to me it would be the

385
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 same.

386
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 It would be the same cool.

387
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,640
 And if someone was super into building boats and bottles and you loved building boats and

388
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,120
 bottles so much that it was like I'm going to call in sick to work to build boats and

389
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
 bottles.

390
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,280
 But to me porn doesn't have that like mental attraction or physical attraction.

391
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,040
 I was watching this stuff and I was like I would be bored.

392
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,680
 If someone made me sit down and watch five monitors of porn at the same time I'd pull

393
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,240
 my phone out and I'd be like oh what's going on in the news.

394
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,080
 I find it boring.

395
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,680
 These people want to ruin their lives over it.

396
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,960
 And whether or not the guy in the first story was gooning.

397
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,200
 Whether or not he was the first gooning he was one eyed willy.

398
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
 I don't know.

399
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,800
 He seemed to actually like ejaculating.

400
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,920
 But I find the whole thing interesting because it's such a self-destructive subculture.

401
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,360
 The guy at the Starbucks eventually will get caught.

402
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,200
 He's going to be labeled a sex offender.

403
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,280
 He's probably going to do like six months or something like that a year in prison.

404
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,440
 And it's going to ruin him.

405
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,080
 And these guys are quitting their jobs.

406
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,000
 The one guy goes my girlfriend's gone.

407
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,640
 I'm going to the goon cave and I'm thinking that poor girlfriend.

408
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,760
 What is she going through?

409
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,000
 So that's not sustainable.

410
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,640
 It's a subculture that seems to be getting new and new people into it.

411
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,640
 But it's so self-destructive how long can it last.

412
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,960
 And it's weird because I'm sure there are a lot of goonies.

413
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,320
 I'm just going to call them goonies.

414
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,120
 I'm sure there's a lot of goonies out there.

415
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,240
 They may not even know they're goonies.

416
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
 This is why I hate Reddit.

417
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
 They don't even know this subculture exists.

418
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,960
 But one of these days they're going to stumble across one of these subreddits and they're

419
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,400
 going to find their brothers and sisters.

420
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,040
 A lot of women are goonies as well.

421
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,160
 They're going to find them and then that's just going to amplify these gross disgusting

422
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,760
 ... Here's the thing.

423
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
 You go Jason are you kink shaming?

424
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,800
 If it makes you lose your job, yes.

425
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,320
 If your kink is telling you to quit work, yeah, that's not a good thing.

426
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,040
 Okay that went on way longer than I thought.

427
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
 Splaccatorious.

428
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,000
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonicopter.

429
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
 We're saying goodbye to the goon cave.

430
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
 Bye.

431
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,320
 We're waving goodbye to him.

432
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,560
 We're like, "Hey, see you later.

433
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,840
 Thanks for letting us in your goon cave.

434
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,360
 He's not paying attention to us.

435
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 His eyes are focused."

436
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,080
 How long could you do that?

437
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
 How long could you do that?

438
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
 You're like, "Drag me away."

439
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
 You're like, "Jason, quit asking questions.

440
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,440
 Please, let's move on to the aliens or trees story."

441
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,920
 You drag me reluctantly.

442
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,640
 I'm still trying to psychoanalyze this guy onto the carbonicopter.

443
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,640
 Gammigan, Gammigan stays in the goon cave.

444
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,920
 We see Gammigan grabbing for a jar of acillean.

445
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,160
 We are leaving behind the goon cave.

446
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:58,440
 We are headed out to Tascora, Nevada.

447
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,720
 The year is 1885.

448
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,360
 We're in Tascora, Nevada.

449
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 It's nighttime.

450
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,560
 We're on an old, timey wagon train.

451
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
 Sitting, I'm having a shotgun.

452
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,120
 I don't have time for all this intro stuff.

453
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,600
 That first story took too long.

454
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,800
 We're in a wagon train and we see off in the distance.

455
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,280
 I'm all describing the type of clothes we're wearing.

456
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,280
 We see off in the distance, we see a blue light.

457
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,000
 Then I look at you and you look at me and I'm like, "Gitty up, cowboys.

458
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,160
 Let's go out there and check out that light."

459
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,000
 We're riding through the brush and we still see the light.

460
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 We get closer and closer.

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 We don't know what to expect.

462
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,880
 It's 1885, so not really thinking about aliens or anything like that.

463
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,920
 We just see a weird blue light off in the distance.

464
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,960
 When we get to it, we see the source of the light is a tree.

465
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,960
 We walk up to it and it's glowing so bright we actually saw it a mile away.

466
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,600
 Now that we're close to it, it's hard to tell whether or not it's a tree or a shrub.

467
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,120
 It's just this giant plant that is glowing blue.

468
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,280
 I push you towards it.

469
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,040
 I push you towards it to see what it is and you land on it and you go, "Ugh, gross."

470
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,400
 You realize that it has a thick, honey-like substance.

471
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,880
 The tree also stinks really, really badly.

472
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
 You've got it all over your hand now.

473
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,160
 We notice that the glow is coming from this substance.

474
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,080
 The bush itself isn't glowing, but it's covered in this honey-like substance that's glowing.

475
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,600
 Now that it's on your hand, your hand is glowing as well.

476
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,120
 I first came across this story on the Forty-N-Map.

477
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,080
 Sometimes the stuff on the Forty-N-Map we can't really verify.

478
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,600
 This is one of them that I was able to.

479
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
 I was able to find an article on the Mysterious Universe website which actually sourced this

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,600
 story to a journal written in 1885 called Theosophist.

481
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
 So interesting story.

482
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 Like I said, I found it on the Forty-N-Map.

483
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,720
 I thought it was kind of a one-off thing, but then I started reading more about odd trees

484
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,480
 in the Mysterious Universe article.

485
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:16,160
 In 1894, in the Badlands of Arizona, there was a 25-foot tall tree covered in quills.

486
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,600
 You're like, "Jason, isn't that just a cactus?"

487
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
 No.

488
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 No.

489
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,320
 I'm not sure if this isn't a Pawnee's podcast.

490
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,040
 It was a tree, but all the quills were like laying against its body.

491
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,760
 So it looked like it was just wearing like a flapper dress.

492
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,000
 But if you got too close to the tree, the quills would like pop up.

493
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,160
 They wouldn't shoot out like a cartoon, but they would just all of a sudden become rigid.

494
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,960
 Imagine a thousand boners and sweatpants would stick out and it would go shhhhh.

495
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,800
 It would hiss at you, as well as filling the air around the tree with the smell of rotting

496
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 meat.

497
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,680
 1885, you'll start to notice a trend here.

498
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
 We'll discuss this as well.

499
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,680
 In 1885, in New Guinea, there was a German expedition exploring the area.

500
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,280
 They were up about 5,000 feet high above sea level walking around.

501
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,080
 And there's just this gnarly tree.

502
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,840
 It's like on a thrash or a t-shirt and a skateboard.

503
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
 There's this gnarled old tree.

504
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,960
 And what made them think something was weird was there was no other vegetation around it.

505
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,840
 And there was a bunch of dead animals around it as well.

506
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,240
 And for whatever reason, this detail doesn't really make sense, but one of the Germans goes,

507
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
 "Oh, you know what I'm going to do?

508
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,840
 I'm going to chop it with this axe.

509
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,240
 That's why I brought this axe to just chop down random trees on our nature expedition."

510
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,080
 They're like, "No, that's the last tree that species left."

511
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,560
 He goes to chop a branch off the tree and he gets thrown back.

512
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,160
 Like an electrical charge hit him.

513
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
 Tossed him back.

514
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
 And he's like, "Uh-huh."

515
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,240
 You can see his skeleton briefly as he's flying through the air.

516
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,440
 Turns out this tree was actually conducting some sort of electrical charge.

517
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,600
 If he tried interfering with the tree, i.e. chopping it up, it would electrocute you.

518
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,240
 They decided to take a couple samples of this tree.

519
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,560
 I know, hold your questions.

520
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
 The electrical tree.

521
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,160
 They were able to take a core sample and a couple cuttings of it.

522
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,240
 And they continued on their expedition and as they moved farther up into this forest,

523
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,240
 they started to see more and more of these trees interspersed with the rest of the foliage

524
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,560
 of the area.

525
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,200
 That story to me out of the three of them is the least believable.

526
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,240
 If they had just stopped with him getting electrocuted, but how are they taking core

527
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
 samples of it?

528
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
 Whatever.

529
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,880
 Every story shares something that makes me a little suspicious.

530
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,800
 They all take place in the 1800s, late 1800s, and that's when we were seeing stories about

531
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,600
 giants.

532
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,640
 It was really where we were at a turning point in science, superstition to science.

533
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,800
 We were starting to find dinosaur bones.

534
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,680
 We were starting, because that didn't happen until like the mid-1800s, because we were

535
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,960
 drilling for oil.

536
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,520
 We started to find dinosaur bones, a lot of them.

537
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,240
 And then you started seeing stories of giants.

538
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,560
 You started seeing stories of these miraculous events, these cannibal tribes, these dwarfs,

539
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,520
 all this stuff all over the world.

540
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,640
 So either this was the point where the elves went to the east or the west or whichever

541
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,040
 direction they went to and all magic left the world.

542
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,720
 And the 1800s was the last remnants of these folkloric creatures.

543
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,640
 Or people were just making stuff up.

544
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
 It was to sell newspapers.

545
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,200
 People would buy newspaper and be like, "Hey, Billy, do you read the story about the Quiltry?"

546
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,560
 "No, Jerry, I didn't."

547
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,920
 Well, then go buy the newspaper, because that's the only article today.

548
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,040
 The Quiltry.

549
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,000
 We'd see this yellow journalism.

550
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,920
 People making up stories, because people were fascinated by this new science, but still

551
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,040
 had enough superstitions in them to believe everything.

552
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,000
 That makes me suspicious of these stories.

553
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,680
 But their fun story is nonetheless.

554
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,200
 We don't know whether or not they're true.

555
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
 They're all pretty much one-off things.

556
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,200
 It's not like I can just start asking every German person I know, "Hey, did your great-great-grandpa

557
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
 ever get electrocuted?"

558
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,000
 But as I was reading these stories, and especially the glowing tree, I thought, "Let's put our

559
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,720
 conspiracy caps on to finish off this episode."

560
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,160
 What if trees are aliens?

561
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
 That's what I was thinking when I was doing this research.

562
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,280
 And I'm not saying that every single tree is an alien.

563
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,440
 But follow me on this course.

564
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,760
 Follow me through this explanation here.

565
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,080
 I think it's really kind of interesting.

566
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,800
 We recently had that exciting news story that really turned out to not be true.

567
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,960
 That mushrooms or fungi were found on Mars.

568
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,560
 They're still trying to figure that out, but it's starting to look like it wasn't.

569
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,280
 It came from a very dubious source.

570
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,280
 But that dubious source, they may be right this one time.

571
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,600
 But the idea was that mushrooms or fungi was found on Mars.

572
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,680
 I was super excited about it.

573
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:58,280
 But the idea of panspermia, that a seed could travel through space, or spores could travel

574
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,240
 through space for eons, doesn't need a starcraft.

575
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,680
 It needs to be built and then maintained and refueled.

576
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,800
 Even stuff with solar sails or faster-than-light drive.

577
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,880
 These are all artificial things, and artificial things can break down either through error

578
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,480
 or accident.

579
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,760
 But a spore will just travel through space.

580
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,280
 And if you have spores and seeds traveling through space forever, it's designed by nature.

581
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,160
 There's a unique power when nature designs something versus man designs something, or

582
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,640
 hands design something.

583
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,600
 So we have panspermia, seeds coming down.

584
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,160
 And these seeds coming down and landing in various planets and sprouting as trees or

585
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,840
 bushes.

586
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,400
 That would be a far easier way to spread across the galaxy.

587
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,760
 And our thing with aliens is, and it's the biggest mistake I think that we do when we

588
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,800
 look at aliens, is we think of them as us.

589
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,960
 A galactic federation that builds starships, that puts in control panels, and the architect's

590
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,840
 like, "Mmm-hmm, good job."

591
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,960
 And all this stuff, that's all the way humans interact with stuff.

592
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,440
 We form federations.

593
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,960
 We build craft.

594
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,520
 If we look at an ocean, we go, "What size box do I have to build to get across this ocean?"

595
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,640
 When we look at space, we go, "What size box do I need, and what fuel do I need to get

596
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,280
 through space?"

597
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:32,160
 And so I think that's a big problem when we look at alien motives.

598
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,400
 We hunger.

599
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,300
 We want to consume goods.

600
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,800
 We want to consume resources so we think aliens would do the same thing.

601
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,280
 Or we want peace in a clean environment so we think aliens would want to do the same thing.

602
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,720
 And so we think that we can do that.

603
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 They can do that.

604
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 They can do that.

605
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
 They can do that.

606
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
 They can do that.

607
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 They can do that.

608
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 They can do that.

609
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
 They can do that.

610
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 They can do that.

611
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
 They can do that.

612
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
 They can do that.

613
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
 They can do that.

614
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
 They can do that.

615
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
 They can do that.

616
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
 They can do that.

617
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
 They can do that.

618
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
 They can do that.

619
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
 They can do that.

620
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 They can do that.

621
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
 They can do that.

622
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
 They can do that.

623
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
 They can do that.

624
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
 They can do that.

625
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
 They can do that.

626
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
 They can do that.

627
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,720
 They eventually get giant Douglas firs.

628
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,440
 They're going to walk into the United Nations, start throwing acorns.

629
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,360
 We live and die in a wink of an eye of a giant redwood tree.

630
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,200
 They care nothing for our cities.

631
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,600
 They care nothing for our culture or our art or our little babies, little precious little

632
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
 baby people.

633
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,400
 I don't care about any of that.

634
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,120
 They're just mighty, mighty trees that have been around longer than most countries have

635
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
 existed.

636
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,520
 So what if there are trees out there?

637
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,280
 They could be singular trees like these stories that have come from another planet, a single

638
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,760
 seed that has landed.

639
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,320
 These seeds could rain down all the time and we never noticed them.

640
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,400
 But when they land on a planet that has the right soil, the right water, the right atmosphere,

641
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,280
 they sprout and they may be just a singular tree or they may be a well-known tree.

642
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,320
 They may be a well-known tree like an aspen or a Douglas fir or something like that.

643
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,200
 And it so fits our environment that it actually looks like it evolved naturally here.

644
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,280
 I started thinking about that conspiracy theory.

645
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,240
 I started thinking what if that'd be a very easy way for an alien to come to Earth and

646
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,320
 just to gather information and doesn't need any global plans for domination.

647
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,040
 It just exists.

648
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,160
 Just like a penguin isn't trying to take over Antarctica.

649
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,640
 A penguin just wants to eat fish.

650
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,920
 Just because if aliens came down it doesn't mean that they have to have a noble or an

651
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,040
 evil reason.

652
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,880
 They may just want to come down.

653
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,840
 I started thinking about that and then I went into crazy conspiracy land.

654
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,960
 That part wasn't crazy.

655
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:04,040
 Our history, human history, is rife with magical wood.

656
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,680
 The depths of the old days.

657
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,040
 Having miraculous abilities.

658
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,840
 When we think about, think of, when I say this, I want you to picture this in your head.

659
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,160
 When you think about a haunted house, what is that house made out of?

660
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,600
 It's the wooden houses.

661
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,040
 It's the old wooden houses and you go, "Well Jason, that's just because of the stereotype.

662
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,560
 That's just what we see in the movies."

663
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,480
 When you think of a haunted house, it's the wooden house.

664
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,520
 You never look at a solid steel art deco house and be like, "Oh man, old man, Metagory

665
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
 lives there."

666
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,000
 What's the number one thing that you hear about in haunted houses?

667
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,160
 One of the number one things.

668
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,000
 Slamming doors.

669
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,080
 What are doors made out of?

670
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:59,200
 What I'm saying is that wood has built into it a mystical, almost magical, almost alien

671
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,120
 quality to everything else on this planet.

672
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:14,080
 Wood seems to be imbued with a life force that we do not find in rocks, in stone and

673
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,560
 steel.

674
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,840
 People prefer wood.

675
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,520
 They go, "I love the look of it.

676
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,760
 I love the look of this hardwood floor."

677
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,160
 But why?

678
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,680
 Is it something that we just find pleasing to the eye or is it something else?

679
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,560
 Something, if we stopped using wood, we would stop planting trees.

680
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,760
 If we stopped planting trees, we'd all suffocate.

681
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,280
 You know what I mean?

682
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,800
 There's specific types of wood that we prefer to use.

683
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,120
 Are we actually choosing to use that wood because it's pleasing to us?

684
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,560
 Or are we in a way being mind controlled by these trees to spread them further, to create

685
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,920
 these forests of them, these particular trees?

686
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,200
 Have we already been invaded?

687
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,040
 Have we already been conquered by wood aliens?

688
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,160
 Much of Pinocchio's walking through the forest?

689
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
 You know what I mean?

690
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
 Trees.

691
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
 Have we already, like, when we're in the...

692
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,920
 Think about how many people go, "I love to be in the outdoors.

693
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,280
 I love to go in the forest."

694
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,160
 What if it actually, there's some pheromone in the air that is making us love trees, making

695
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,220
 us worship trees and wood?

696
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,800
 So we want to spread it.

697
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,440
 We want to make the world greener.

698
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
 More trees.

699
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,280
 And we decorate our house in those hardwood floors, in those doors.

700
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,640
 You go, "Jason, that's ridiculous.

701
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
 People don't worship wood.

702
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,760
 I'm not trying to be disrespectful.

703
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:47,600
 But there is at least one billion people on this planet who do, in a way, worship wood."

704
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,680
 Their religious icon, the one that protects them, makes them feel safe, makes them feel

705
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,120
 not alone, is wood.

706
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,720
 It was made from wood, and to this day the image is often wooden.

707
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:10,520
 There is at least a billion people on this planet who worship the cross.

708
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,320
 We're always afraid of an alien invasion coming in the future.

709
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:40,120
 It could have started before mankind even appeared on Earth.

710
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:53,800
 It's not a tree.

711
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:14,640
 It's not a tree.

712
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:28,320
 It's not a tree.
