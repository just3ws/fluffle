1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Is your local drug dealer running a scam?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 What would you do if you were walking down the street and you saw two girls start to levitate in midair?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we traveled to East Tennessee State University.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Boys and girls were going back to school. Or should I say, back to GOOL.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio. We're gonna talk about ghosts if you weren't clear on that.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I don't wanna sleep down. Actually, I'm gonna walk to sleep down.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 One person who I know always has lots of fun is our newest Patreon supporter.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. Give a big round of applause to Cartoon.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Everyone give a round of applause. He's walking in. He's two dimensional.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Cartoon, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon. I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Really, really helps out a lot. Tell your friends, tell your family. That helps the show grow.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Now Cartoon, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed all the way out to a local coffee shop.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I guess we could have walked probably, but here we go.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Cartoon is flying us in the dead rabbit dirgeable. Just a couple blocks. We are that lazy.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And we're gonna jump out, use the little repelling lines. We're gonna walk in.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 So we're walking into this coffee shop, aka your neighborhood drug dealer.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Caffeine's a drug. Everyone knows this. That's not what this segment is.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm not blowing the lid off of the caffeine is a drug conspiracy.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I have a question, and this is a legitimate question, and you guys may know this.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 When you would, I believe the coffee shops are running a scam. Here's the scam.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 When you walk into pretty much any coffee shop, especially the independent coffee shops, Starbucks,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 not so much, but independent coffee shops, they will always be festooned with the artwork of a local artist.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And underneath the paintings, there's price tags. You know, it'll say like, "Burke Trum's Belt."

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's a picture of a belt on some guy named Burke Trum. It has a little title, has a little price tag.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Does any- Have you ever known anyone through all of recorded human history,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 find me an example of this like in Pompeii, they're like stuck in the ash frozen in this pose,

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 has there ever been a piece of art purchased from a coffee shop ever?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Ever. I've actually been in a couple coffee shops and I'm not a big art guy like having art on my walls.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Like I prefer movie posters or cursed paintings. That's pretty much where it's at for me.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 But some people like art, some people like having like a picture of like a tulip,

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 or I don't know a picture of a kid running through a field or whatever.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But that's a photo they took, they're hunting humans, they're like, "This was my favorite hunt of all."

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 You have this stuff, right? But I've seen some like art at coffee shops that was kind of sexy, right?

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And I would be like, "That's kind of in between a cursed painting and a movie poster, something a sexy lady,

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 a sexy painting of a lady, but I never bought it." Right? I never bought it.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 What I'm saying is, even if whether or not it's like a sexy lady or like a photograph of Mount Hood

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 or just like a painting of a tulip, no one ever buys it.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Have you ever been getting coffee here? Like some guys like, "Hmm, I'd like one pound of those beans and a cup of coffee."

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And then, you know what? How about this $400 painting? He like hits it off the wall and he like puts it down on the counter.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Here's my scam. Here's what I'm thinking. That coffee shops know that no one is ever going to buy this artwork.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And the artist is either hoping that someone will buy it, someone will see it, or just wanting the exposure,

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 because then it's kind of like you're at an art gallery. But what's really happening is the coffee shop is getting free decorations.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 The coffee shop is getting, their walls look beautiful and it's constantly changing.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It's a nice conversation piece. People are like, "Whoa, can you believe someone's charging $400 for that painting?"

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 All it's it is is a tulip. You have this stuff going on. The coffee shop doesn't have to ever buy paintings.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 They constantly have a revolving thing of art and they know no one's ever going to buy the art.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So this is my theory. Again, I don't know if it's true. I might get inundated with emails and YouTube comments saying,

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 "Oh no, I purchased art. I've got my name Snooty McGee. I might purchase art, you heathen, and when I buy it, I buy it at a coffee shop."

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But I can't imagine every independent coffee shop you go into has artwork.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And I can't imagine people who are drinking coffee or just walking in to buy a bagel or whatever are also going to drop $1,000 on a painting.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But then again, where else are you going to put it?

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 But I don't know. So I would like to know from you guys, have you ever bought coffee shop art? Have you ever made coffee shop art?

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Jason, it's not coffee shop art. It's art that is placed in a coffee shop. But you know what I mean.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So very, very curious. I think it might be a scam. I think the coffee shops know.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I'm glad that the coffee shop I do go to. I know they listen to this podcast.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 But I think the coffee... I'm never going to be allowed back in there. They're going to ruin my punch card.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I think the coffee shops know they're not going to sell art. They know it's just free decorations for them.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I don't know though. Maybe it's a booming industry. I've just never... I've never been to someone's house.

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And I go, "Where'd you buy this painting?" And they go, "Oh, I bought this at Dopeo coffee shop."

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But then again, when I go to people's houses, I never ask where they get their art. Now that I think about it.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind...

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 My former friend's house. He says not all artwork has to turn you on, Jason.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 We are leaving behind my former friend's house. We are headed all the way out to Puerto Rico.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 [imitates music]

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 We're headed to Montana, Santa. That's in Puerto Rico. It's September 22nd, 1982.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It's a nice, crisp night. This particular night, two men are walking down the road.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Now they don't know each other. They're just passing through town together.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But they would soon become interweaved in an inexplicable event.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 One of them was a retired police officer. We don't have his name. We'll call him Charles.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 He's walking down the street and he's like, "Just turned in my badge and my gun today."

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I just retired today. What mysteries will life hold for me? He's walking on the street.

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He pauses. He sees a bizarre event going on.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Also walking down the same street at the same time is Felido Felix.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Now hold your applause. I know, I know. You're excited that Felido Felix has finally made his debut on Dead Rabbit Radio.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 When I read this story, they kept saying the name Felido Felix as if he was somebody important outside of this story.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 The story lets us know that two people, including a retired police officer and Felido Felix, were there.

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I'm like, "Who in the world is Felido Felix?" Well, pardon my ignorance.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Felido Felix is apparently a rock or pop or fighting action in the genre of music. He's a big musical guy in Puerto Rico.

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He's recorded 67 albums. That's insane. I mean, I don't know how many of them are good or how long they are.

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 They might only be like three seconds long. It might be like 1980s punk rock where the songs are super short.

87
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Retired police officer walking down the street and Felido Felix as well.

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Now you may not know who Felido Felix is. I don't know who he is, but I'm going to imagine for the rest of the story someone of his caliber musically.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So maybe Johnny Cash or maybe Travis Scott. Who knows? Who knows? Whoever your icon is.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Or you could just imagine a guy named Felido.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Felido Felix and a retired police officer, what do we name them? Charles?

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Are walking down the street and they see two girls standing on a street corner.

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Mcdahlia Centron and Ida Rivera. They're standing on the street corner and they're surrounded with a whirlpool of multi-colored lights.

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Multi-colored lights surrounding these girls. And then like that's one thing, right?

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Maybe they just came from a rave. Maybe they have little flashlights and stuff like that.

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They're not light surrounding these girls, but to Felido and Charles they also see a look of panic, a fear on these girls' faces.

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So they don't know what's causing the lights and they don't know what's disturbing the girls.

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But then they know they have to do something when the two girls begin to levitate off the ground.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 "Whoa, we're floating!" one of the girls said. The girl speaks and she can think of anything to say.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Charles, who gave up his badge and his gun but never gave up his fighting spirit, starts charging towards the girls.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And so does Felido. He's right behind the police officer and they get to these two girls and they're going to grab them, right?

102
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 What would you do if you saw someone floating? They're not going to walk them and be like, "Well, golly, what are you doing three feet off the ground?"

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 If you saw someone who was scared floating away, you would instinctively want to grab them.

104
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I actually had the maintenance man over at my apartment the other day to fix an outlet and he was like, "I'm not shutting off the electricity. I just want to get this done."

105
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 He's like, "Taking out an outlet and sparks are shooting." I'm like, "Ah!"

106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And I made sure I stood far enough away from him so if he electrocuted himself, I wouldn't instinctively reach out to grab him.

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Because we have a tendency to reach out and grab people in need. If the person in need is smoldering, don't touch them.

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And he's alive. He's alive but... Yeah, I stood far enough away that if I saw him go, "Ugh!" I wouldn't instinctively grab him.

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So these people are the real heroes. They're running towards fight. I'd go the other direction. I'm like, "Too spooky. I don't want to grab a floating person."

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 They're running towards these two hovering girls who look terrified. If they look like they were having a good time, you'd be like, "Go nuts, ladies! Fly away!"

111
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 But they look terrified and when Felito and Charles got there, they both got shocked like they hit some sort of force field and they fell down.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 The two girls are still hovering there and Felito gets up, dusts himself off. He released another album while he was on the ground.

113
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He's ready to go again. Same thing with Charles and they're going to try to grab these girls again.

114
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And Felito said that they had to force their way. It almost felt like a force field, like some sort of power repelling them from the girls.

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But they're fighting it. They're going to grab these girls. And as he's reaching towards them, he sees a feminine outline.

116
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Standing next to the girls. It's not like just a rabbit. It's not like a sexy silhouette.

117
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 He just sees something very recognizable, female form. But as he's looking at it, it starts to morph into a three foot tall man with broad shoulders and a slightly larger,

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 but not grey alien large, but a slightly larger than human bald head.

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 He had large, narrow eyes, pointed ears, and was wearing a tight fitting beige outfit.

120
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And Felito is looking at this little man and the little man looks up at Felito and realizes that his true form is now being seen.

121
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 As they're making this eye contact, Felito and Charles are able to grab the girls and begin to pull them back to Earth.

122
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Only a couple feet up in the air, but again when you're levitating against your will, one foot is too tall.

123
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 As they're grabbing the girls as he's making eye contact with this being, at once the humanoid disappears.

124
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 The two girls are released from this force that was causing them to float in the first place.

125
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And Charles and Felito were able to pull the girls down the ground. It just kind of ended all at the same time.

126
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 The girls are obviously freaking out, but they need to figure out what happened.

127
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Like Felito and the police officer are like, "Okay, starting the story from the beginning, right?

128
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Because all we got was you guys hovering in midair with the multi-colored lights."

129
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 These two girls said they were walking down the street and in front of them appeared the Blessed Virgin Mary.

130
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And they mentioned that they had actually seen the Virgin Mary previous to this event.

131
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But this time when they were walking down the street and she appeared in front of them, she tells them,

132
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 "You need to go somewhere with me. We need to leave this place."

133
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Mary says to these two girls, "We need to go. I'm going to take you someplace else. I need you to come with me."

134
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And she grabs the girls. And the girls immediately begin to experience visions.

135
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 They see a beautiful destination. And the night sky opens up. It's like a path ascending through the heavens.

136
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 They can see the road that they're going to go down and the amazing place they will end up that they don't want to go.

137
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 So they become panicked. Even though they're seeing this lush paradise, they don't want to go and they're becoming fearful.

138
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And the Blessed Virgin Mary, holding both of them, starts to lift them off the ground and take them down the path into the cosmos.

139
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And that is when Felito and Charles saw them surrounded in the multicolored lights.

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Now, when Felito first got to the scene, that feminine outline he saw, to him it was the silhouette of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

141
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It was a very, very recognizable shape to that icon. That's what he saw. And then he saw it morph into this little three-foot-tall man with the pointed ears.

142
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Crazy fascinating story. It was originally reported in Millennial X, which is a magazine. It's a Spanish-speaking magazine.

143
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 It's written by Jorge Martin. And I got it from ThinkAboutToDocs.com. That website is back up, thankfully. It's a great, great website.

144
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Think about it, Docs.com. I got it from them. Cover a lot of this super obscure stuff.

145
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And this stuff tales. We did an episode. It was the end of Season 14, I think it was.

146
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Episode 711. Can demons disguise themselves as holy icons?

147
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And it was about two... No, it was three girls. I think that story took place in the Soviet Union. Three girls were out running the Virgin Mary as she was chasing them down a hill.

148
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And that was a weird one, but here we have... That episode I go, "Well, did she have any malicious intent?" Like, where she was chasing them, but was she trying to, like, cook them in a stew? We don't know.

149
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 This one, she's actively... And really, the question goes is that it wasn't the Blessed Virgin Mary in the first story, or this one.

150
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 The question is, "Can forces of darkness disguise themselves as holy icons?" So, it was a demon pretending to be this person.

151
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And this one, we have that transmorgification. We have that image of the Blessed Virgin Mary becoming this little man.

152
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And he doesn't fit into the gray alien trope just from the pointed ears and the size of the head.

153
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Elfling... Who knows?

154
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Demon and training, he hasn't got his hooves yet. Who knows? Creepy story because it goes back to that thing.

155
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And now we have even more evidence that yes, and a lot of you people emailed me and on YouTube said, "Yes, here are verses from the Bible.

156
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Here are other stories where holy figures were just a deceptive camouflage for a darker spirit."

157
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And then we have this one where we're actually looking at this creature. Again, alien, Faye, demon, who knows?

158
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 But this is in broad nightlight. I can't say broad daylight, but it was on a busy street corner. People saw this.

159
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 "Felido Felix," guys, "Felido Felix," saw this. Fascinating story, and it's creepy.

160
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Because it means when you're in that moment of despair, when you're in that moment of need, and you see that personification of your God,

161
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 or the personification of an important figure in your religion, and they're giving you guidance, you have to ask yourself, who is talking?

162
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Satan hears your prayers too. Creepy, creepy story, creepy story, knows what your wants are, and it can actually manipulate you.

163
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yeah, love it, spooky. I doubt these girls went to church for a while, but again, it's not the real religious figure.

164
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 It's not the Blessed Virgin Mary. It's not these other religious figures. It's something mimicking them. Very, very terrifying.

165
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Cartoon, I'm going to go ahead and tashie the keys to the world famous Carpentercopter. We are leaving behind Puerto Rico.

166
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We got 67 albums of pure "Felido Felix" to listen to all the way out.

167
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Two, Johnson City, Tennessee.

168
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 [imitates carpentry]

169
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And to start this off, I want to give a shout out like I always do. It's probably my favorite book.

170
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 I use it for research. I read it for fun. I've read it multiple times. Haunted Places, The National Directory, written by Dennis William Howe.

171
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 That is not an ad read. I get no money. I'm not putting no affiliate links in here. Please pick up a copy of this book. You will not be disappointed.

172
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It is such a fun read. So many ghost stories. And they also do a Bigfoot and UFOs.

173
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 It's a great book. I love it. I myself have more than one copy just in case it goes out of print. It's my favorite book.

174
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And that's where I found out about this story. I did a little more digging. It's just this one's so wacky.

175
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Cartoon, land that Carpentercopter here at East Tennessee State University. We all jump out. We got our caps and our gowns on.

176
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 We graduated, bro. But now we're going to take a tour of the campus. We probably should have done this when we were freshmen.

177
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But man, that's for those LAMOs. So we're walking around throwing frisbees and drinking coffee.

178
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 We're doing the college life thing. Living in the dorm. East Tennessee State University. This is in Johnson City, Tennessee.

179
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Now, like all great schools, there's a bunch of ghosts. There's a bunch of ghosts running around. No one cares about the graduation rate.

180
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Or like how many people matriculate from this to being a doctor or something like that. How many ghosts are there in your school?

181
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 That should really be whether that should really be the determining factor on where you attend.

182
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 For a college built in 1911, it doesn't actually have a ton of ghosts. And the ghosts that it has seem to be pretty generic.

183
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But let's take a walking tour of this haunted campus. The first ghost we're going to meet is the founding president of the school.

184
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 This is the guy who got the ball rolling on this place. And he just like doesn't like you to waste electricity, right?

185
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So he'll be walking down the hallways. If you leave a light on, he shuts it off. If you leave your television going on late at night, he shuts it off.

186
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Shut lock stores and things like that. Pretty benign stuff. Like actually that's super terrifying, right?

187
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And you would think so, but it's for, it's kind of lame, right? Like sure, you want to save electricity.

188
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But you're a ghost, bro. You're a ghost. You can float anywhere. You can like, I don't know.

189
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 What was my idea last time I would go to the sports arena and mess with all the football games?

190
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 But now he's just shut off lights. That's kind of lame. So on the Ghost-O-Meter, on the world famous Dead Rabbit Radio Ghost-O-Meter,

191
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 we're going to give that two haunts out of ten. It's cool that you exist. It's cool that you've pierced the mortal veil and are now back among the world of the living,

192
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 but you're not doing much with it. So two out of ten booze. There's also the ghost of this English teacher.

193
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Oh, she loves Shakespeare. She loves Shakespeare so much that she taught it, right?

194
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You thought there was a twist there. You thought she was going to become the ghost of Yorick.

195
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 She loves Shakespeare so much that she taught it, but in the 1970s, she just couldn't handle it anymore.

196
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 She's like, "Oh wait, Shakespeare totally sucks. I wasted my entire life." And she kills herself.

197
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 So her ghost is floating around. And now, here's the thing. It would be super awesome if the ghost is like quoting Shakespeare.

198
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 It's like half-noth you got a dish towel, and you're like, "Oh, right, I don't. Thanks, Dead English Teacher."

199
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 She's floating around school. She's helping people out in Shakespearean ways. Right? That would be kind of cool.

200
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 She's helping young lovers talk to their parents so they don't kill themselves. Pantaloons dancing in midair. That'd be awesome.

201
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 She haunts a painting. The painting of her dad. And the reason why they know the daughter haunts the painting of her dad

202
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 is when you walk by this painting, the eyes are girl eyes.

203
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I don't know if they have big, comically large eyelashes, but apparently they're feminine-looking eyes, and when you walk past the painting, they stare at you.

204
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Now, on the Bu-O-Meater, on the world-famous Bu-O-Meater, I would actually give that a 4 out of 10 booze, just for originality.

205
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 It's not super-shy. They've seen it in every episode of Scooby-Doo. But you don't really see many ghosts in real life inhabit the painting of their dad.

206
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Right? Just for that, it gets a couple extra stars. But it doesn't do anything. It's not like you're walking by and the ghost jumps out and scares you.

207
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Also, maybe the dad just had feminine eyes. We don't know.

208
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But the reason why I wanted to talk about this. I didn't want to just talk about generic ghosts. I didn't even write down their names or the locations where they haunt.

209
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 I was like, "Eh, whatever." I wanted to talk about this because this has one of the most unique ghost stories I've come across.

210
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I've been racking my brain, and I've been thinking, "I don't think there's anywhere in the lore that states that this has happened before."

211
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Cooper Hall. That's where we're going at right now. Cooper Hall, it used to be the Carter House, as in George and Mayette Carter.

212
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Huge economic mastermind in the area. When you type in "George L. Carter," you're going to get a ton of articles, both of the time and recent, talking about all of his contributions to this region of Tennessee.

213
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 In fact, the land that the university is built on, he donated. Could you imagine being so rich, you can go, "Here's the land to build a school."

214
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Having that much resources. His house was still part of the college campus, and he's living next door. You know there must have been some awesome keggers, ragers back then.

215
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 We're talking 1910, 1911. Still, they were definitely drinking back then, and you get all those flapper chicks.

216
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I have to be awesome now that I think about it. My life goals become famous, own a bunch of land, donate the land to a college, and then just have a bunch of infinite girlfriends.

217
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 But until I can do that, George Carter was living that dream in 1911, and it's him and his wife and their child, who donates all this land, they're still living on the college campus, and then eventually, when he passes away, his house became Cooper Hall, which became a women's dormitory.

218
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And in Cooper's Hall, there was a giant stained glass window depicting George's daughter, Alice. And it's this young woman with long flowing hair in this beautiful stained glass window.

219
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 The problem was, people felt that this stained glass window was haunted. Because what they knew, this story was passed down through generations of students in this girls dorm in East Tennessee State University,

220
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 George and Mayetta's daughter, Alice, was haunting Cooper Hall. She had fallen in love with a young man, and George said, "You will never marry that man. You cannot be with him."

221
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So, she takes a lethal amount of rat poison and dies.

222
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And George's overcome with grief, if his daughter had just not tried to defy the stars, she'd still be here with him. And in honor of her, he had this giant stained glass image of her made.

223
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And it was their house, and in 1935, when he passed away and his wife passed away, the house became property of the college, he came to the girls dorm, and this stained glass window remained.

224
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 By 1936, it was a woman's dormitory, and you'd be walking through the halls late at night, and you'd hear a woman singing down these empty dark hallways.

225
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 That was if you were lucky. That was if you lucked out, because sometimes you'd be dead asleep, and you would hear an unearthly scream pierce the night.

226
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 A woman in pain and terror yelling at the top of her lungs, but when you would investigate it, no cause could be found.

227
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 You'd be walking through the dormitory, and you could feel eyes on you. Someone was watching you, an invisible stalker. Objects would go missing as well.

228
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 All of these things added up to "The Place Must Be Haunted."

229
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And the students and staff realized that the phenomenon seemed to be emanating from the stained glass.

230
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Like, the closer you were to it, the more likely you would hear the screaming, the more likely you would start losing items in your room.

231
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Eventually, they stopped having to be a dormitory.

232
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Oh, you know, we have another purpose built for this, but staff always thought it's just no one wants to be there, so they switched it over to offices.

233
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And they also have a campus radio station built there as well. That's where that's house. And they start reporting this bizarre phenomenon as well.

234
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Alice is still mucking about the house.

235
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 The school ends up abandoning the building for a time period, and no one was using it.

236
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And again, the word around campus was, "It's too haunted to use."

237
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 You couldn't use it as a dormitory, you couldn't use it as offices, and no one wants to be at the campus radio station at 3 in the morning,

238
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 for a while it sat completely abandoned. And then the campus decides we could renovate it,

239
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 but they made the decision to tear down the entire building.

240
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Ah, it's cost too much to renovate. We're talking about a house that was built and lived in by the guy who basically made the college possible.

241
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 You think this would be a landmark, but they say, "No, it'll cost too much to renovate," and they demolish the house.

242
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 But before they demolished the house, somebody went in and removed the stained glass and took it.

243
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So the building is raised, and it no longer sits there today.

244
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And that's just typical ghost lore. That alone is just on the same level.

245
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 That story alone, I'd give it just because of the screaming.

246
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And it takes place in a girl's dormitory. I'd probably give it 7 booze out of 10.

247
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I like the location, and this ghost is pretty active and it's pretty spooky.

248
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 What makes this on a scale of 1 to 10 and 11? I have not come across any story like this before.

249
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 This episode's probably gonna run a little long, 'cause I haven't really scratched the surface on this, but I wanna hammer this home.

250
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 There was a local historian there in Johnson City. His name is Ray Stahl.

251
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 He wanted to write about the haunting of Cooper Hall. Just like a fun puff piece, probably.

252
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And he starts digging into this, and he finds out Alice isn't real.

253
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Now, I'm not saying the ghost stuff never happened, 'cause that did. People reported that.

254
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 But George and Mayetta never had a daughter. They had one child, a son, named James Walters Carter.

255
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 But according to accounts, they didn't want a son. They wanted a daughter.

256
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 They wanted a daughter so bad, they raised James as a girl.

257
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It could have been they just wanted a girl and just kinda left it to that. It could have been that they raised him as a girl.

258
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 We don't know if he was trans, like it was his decision. That's why I'm not using that terminology, because what it seems like is it was out of his control.

259
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 His parents wanted a girl. We have no evidence that this is something that he desired of himself.

260
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 But when he dies, his ghost comes back as a, this is how it is described, a female version of James Walter Carter.

261
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Apparently people who have encountered this spirit have, has described her as looking, like, compared to photos, I guess, because the account that I read said it was described as a female version of James Walters Carter.

262
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So here, this boggles my mind, and I've really been spending a couple days kind of having this ping-pong in the back of my head.

263
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I don't think, and again, we don't have any way to tell, but from the narratives that come across that it wasn't his decision to be raised as a girl, or to be immortalized as a woman in the stained glass window, because that apparently is supposed to be James.

264
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 But they made him so feminized in the stained glass that people going forward thought that James, didn't know James existed. They thought it was a girl named Alice, who was the daughter.

265
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 This is really what I'm getting at here. Who creates the ghosts? Who creates the ghosts? When I die, my legacy will be what people remember of me.

266
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And what people remember about you is usually not the total truth. It very rarely is.

267
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You're not able to make amends, so they could always think you were just a total jerk because of the last two weeks of your life.

268
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Or you could be remembered as a great guy when you actually did all sorts of awful things in private.

269
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Or you could have been a horrible person, but people just want to remember you as a good person, because since they were your associates,

270
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 they want to think of themselves as good people and they hung out with a good person, they don't want to think about all the horrible things they know you did, because then that implicates them.

271
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 They're all sorts of things, but who creates the ghosts? Because when I die, the memories of me are my image. That will be what people remember me as.

272
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 James Carter dies before his parents, but they never acknowledged him as a boy. They always wanted a girl.

273
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And they immortalize him as a girl in the stained glass window.

274
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And their psychic energy created a female ghost, a female image of their son James.

275
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I can't think of any other ghost story I've ever encountered over decades of researching where someone returns as a different sex than they died.

276
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I can't think of any of them.

277
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 But here we have one. The one that's fairly well documented or known in the area.

278
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 You have someone who is returning, they were male in life, and now they're appearing as female in death. There's nothing else like that in the literature that I've ever come across.

279
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And I think it could easily be argued if you had a transgendered man, if when he dies he comes back as a man, he was biologically born a woman and he comes back as a man as a ghost.

280
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 I think you could easily discuss that and go, "Well, that would make sense." Because that was the spiritual essence they felt was a male essence?

281
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Fine, whatever. But this isn't that. As far as we can tell, he was forced. Like his parents wanted him to be a girl so badly.

282
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 That's what they remembered him as in death, and they created her ghost.

283
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 So it really, really boggles your mind. Like, if that is really James Spirit and he was tormented in life by parents forcing him to be something that he wasn't supposed to be, that he didn't want to be,

284
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 and then dying, possibly from killing himself, right? That origin story may be the same, from dying and then he's brought back into an eternity of being what he didn't want to be.

285
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Even in death, his parents still control his destiny. That alone is insane.

286
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Then you just open it up to all ghosts. Like, why is it if I went to Britain and I'm walking through a haunted castle I would expect to see Marie Antoinette walking around holding her head, right?

287
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Or had it not chopped off or something like that, maybe? Or hung? Is that really the ghost of that person? Is that really them or is that something that we've been told so that's what we see?

288
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I'm not saying that the ghost image itself is fake, but is it taking the form of what we expect?

289
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Like, if I saw Marie Antoinette's ghost, I would imagine her to have big boobs and have like one of those cut off little tops, like with the square in the top so you could see the cleavage.

290
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Like a barwinch from a D&D manual. That's what I would expect. Maybe you would expect her to be more modest.

291
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 So you would see her walking around in like a sack of potatoes.

292
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But if someone told you the day she died she was dressed super sexy, because she knew someday she'd be a ghost, then we would both see the sexy ghost.

293
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Do you get what I'm getting at? It's the ghost... Again, I'm saying the ghosts are real, but the stories that we tell form the image.

294
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And you can actually make the ghost conform to the imaginary versus the reality.

295
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 With Marie Antoinette's case, we're talking about how much cleavage we see.

296
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 With James's case, he was controlled in life, and now his soul is controlled in death.

297
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 It's just, it's one of those stories I came across and I was like, this... It's gonna take me a while to process this, honestly.

298
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Like, what does this mean for the life after death experience? What does this mean for...

299
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 This really cracks it open. Who creates the ghosts?

300
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 If your soul is now bound to this earth for whatever reason, you're not completely finished with your work, or a cursed death or something like that.

301
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 If your soul is bound to earth, who determines what you do?

302
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I always assumed... I know the first thing I want to do is walk on the ocean floor.

303
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 I want to do that. And then after that I'll probably just play video games, watch people play video games, float around, you know, cast for style, solve some mysteries maybe.

304
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But what if a bunch of chowder heads want to imagine me like stuck in a Home Depot?

305
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I'm stuck in like the Rotary Saw section.

306
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Like, that's not good, right? Who controls the ghosts? Who determines where your soul spins eternity?

307
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Or even more importantly, what your soul is? How you act, how you feel, what you look like.

308
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Will that be the true representation of you untethered from all mortal bounds?

309
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Or will it depend on how people remember you?

310
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Who creates the ghosts?

311
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 It's a question I didn't even know we had to ask, until we took a little trip to East Tennessee State University.

312
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
