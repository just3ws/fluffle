1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Can you die in such an embarrassing way that you have no choice but to walk the world as a ghost?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then we continue the story of Dr. Jonathan Reed. In the last episode, he killed a grey alien with a tree branch bashed its brains in, in the middle of the woods.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 He then threw it in the trunk of his car and drove it home. But little did he know that although he may have won the battle, he would not win the war.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 We only have eight days left of season 20. Eight episodes would probably be a better way to say that.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Eight more episodes. I'm taking an extra two days on my vacation just to get ready to give my speech at the Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside, Oregon.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I will be giving my speech. Why are there no fat ghosts?

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And that will be at 7 p.m. Wait, is it? Let me double check when the time is. Let me double check. Great sales pitch.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 That'll be at 6 p.m. I will give my speech on March 24th at 6 p.m. at the Oregon Ghost Conference. It's $15 and that's a three day pass.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 You'll be able to attend all the other lectures and walk around the vendors booth and meet with other people who are ghost aficionados. And who knows?

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Maybe you'll meet a ghost yourself. There's nothing ghost. Paranormal activity is not guaranteed.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I hold no liability if you are not seeing a ghost or get possessed by a demon at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But you guys should swing on by and I will be there at 6 p.m. March 24th giving my speech. Why are there no fat ghosts?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 It should be a blast. It should be. But someone who's always a blast, someone who's known for blowing up power generators around the country, the FBI is looking for this guy.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Everyone give it up for one of our legacy Patreon supporters. Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is Justin M.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Woohoo! Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah! He's doing cartwheels. He's throwing dynamite everywhere.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Justin M. You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. I don't know if I should say your last name honestly because you started joining the Patreon so long ago.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Sometimes people go, "Hey, just use a nickname." And I don't remember if you did that. But if your name is Justin M. You know who I'm talking about.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Justin, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. You guys can't support the Patreon. I totally understand.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 If you guys don't want to be outed as a domestic terrorist or like what? I'm not a terrorist. That's what a terrorist would say.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Justin, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. It really helps out a lot. Maybe you prolong the terrorism campaign across the country telling people you will stop your reign of terror if they listen to Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I doubt that would work. So don't try it. But if it did work, Justin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. Let's drive all the way out to... Illinois.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Long leisurely journey across the country. Feet kicked up on the dashboard letting the wind blow on our face. It'd be fun. I've never been to Illinois.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I've never been out there. I'm sure it's cool. Specifically, we're going out to Bloomington, Illinois.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And while we're there, we're not there to like see the local nightlife or whatever, but we're there to go back to school.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Hope you guys brought your book bags. Hope you guys got on. Hope you guys studied for that test. We're going to take it in like five minutes.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Hope you guys are ready for this exam. We're going to Blooming Grove Academy. I tried looking them up. Their website is down.

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I'll say that's a bad sign if you're looking for schools to send your kids to. If they can't even keep their website up at 404.

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I was like, "I don't know. Why are you going there in the principal? He just hasn't shown up for a while. He's just kind of forgotten that he works there."

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 You have maybe three or four teachers for the whole school. And this is hilarious. I didn't know these types of schools existed, but since doing this is a private academy,

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I've found two schools like this in my paranormal research. It's not paranormal. It just seems like bad planning.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Blooming Grove Academy is ages K for kindergarten, right? So grades kindergarten to 12th grade.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 The seniors in high school and little kindergarten kids and everyone in between goes to the same school, which I imagine their bullying problem must be just hilarious.

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Because you would straight up have like 11th graders picking on kindergarten kids. Maybe Jason Hilarious isn't the right word. I'm pretty sure that is a criminal act.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 But I was like, "Wow, what a concrete jungle that must be where you have seniors, 8th graders, 1st graders all on the same campus, all interacting."

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Because I don't think it's like gated off. I don't think they have like these huge insurmountable walls. They're just kind of like walking together through classrooms and stuff.

42
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 This particular card kid is like, "Oh man, I'm an advanced mathematics again. I took a wrong turn down the hallway. I don't know any of this stuff. I don't know how to spell my name."

43
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 It's crazy. I have no idea why you would do that. But maybe they don't. Maybe they don't. I couldn't verify on their website.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I found that notation several times because I was like trying to look at review sites for the school. No reviews. I'm sure this school even exists. Maybe it was burned down a rubble.

45
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 There's photographs of it and there is no rubble in the photographs. So Blooming Grove Academy.

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 The reason why we're here isn't just because we're social scientists and we want to check out how a high schooler interacts with the 3rd grader.

47
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 We're here to look at a ghost. We're here to investigate the haunting of Blooming Grove Academy.

48
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And when you look at the hauntings here, or haunting I should say, it's all kind of centered around the 3rd floor of this one particular building on campus.

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I should say that door slam. You can hear the sound of door slamming.

50
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 If the door is closed, sometimes you'll hear the sound of the doorknob rattling, like someone's on the other side trying to get out or in.

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 What's creepier? If you're walking on the hallway and you heard a doorknob rattling and you go, "Oh dude, there's a ghost in that room trying to get out."

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 But I'm in this long hallway. You just keep on walking by and you're like, "Oh that's a tormented spirit."

53
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 That would be kind of creepy, right? But if the hallway is well lit, I think you'll be okay.

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You do have a growing wet stain on your pants because you're like, "I'm pretty sure there's a ghoul in this room. I'm standing right next to the door."

55
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 I'm like, "Hum the hum the hum. What would be scarier as you're peeing your pants?"

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The reason why is because you could run down the hallway, right? But imagine if you were in that room.

57
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 What's the thing about if you're in a room that had a long hallway attached to when you're in the doorknob?

58
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 You would just go, "Oh someone's walking down the hallway and trying to get in."

59
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 If you knew the room was unoccupied, then you'd go, "Oh it's a ghost."

60
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But at no point would a hallway be unoccupied. Someone could always walk down a hallway.

61
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 But if you were in the room and you hear the doorknob rattling and then you thought, "Dude I bet you it's that ghost outside this room. What can you do?"

62
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 You're on the third floor. You can't really jump out the window. You could, but then you become a ghost yourself.

63
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So you would just kind of, I think it would be scarier to be in a small room with a ghost trying to get in

64
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 than in a large area that you can easily run away from and a ghost is trying to get out. That was kind of the point of that whole thing.

65
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Anyways, I don't know if this is a dorm room again. I don't know what this school is like. I couldn't find any official documents of Blooming Grove Academy.

66
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 There was a couple schools named that. I had to make sure I was getting the one from Illinois.

67
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But apparently there's also this room that has a loud music playing and as you approach it, the music shuts off.

68
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So standard ghost stuff. So why are we talking about an undead rabbit radio? Why are we at Blooming Grove Academy?

69
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Because I come across hundreds of accounts like this. Doors, rattling.

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Okay, I mean again, if you're in the situation, it's terrifying, but just reading it online, you're just like, "Oh, you know, that'd be scarier if I was there, but it's not scary."

71
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So why are we talking about it on dead rabbit radio?

72
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Well, this might be one of the most unusual origin stories of a ghost. So unusual, I don't even think it's possible.

73
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I had to start doing research. I was at my favorite bagel shop in town, a drinking coffee, and I had to keep typing in horrible, horrible sentences and hoping no one was standing behind me.

74
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 We've covered some bizarre deaths that caused ghosts on this show. There was a boy in a Burger King bathroom who hung himself, which I don't think is possible in a Burger King bathroom.

75
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 It is possible to hang yourself, unfortunately, but next time you're in a public restroom, specifically, whether or not it's a Burger King bathroom, I don't think it matters, but next time you're in a fast food restaurant, I want you to go, "Hmm, where could I hang myself in here? There's no real fixtures."

76
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You could do the thing that they do in prison where you wrap the underwear around your neck and then you just kind of lay down your legs and I think you miss a step.

77
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 They find me just sitting in a Burger King bathroom with a pair of underwear just around my neck and I'm like reading a book. I'm supposed to die eventually, right?

78
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 They're supposed to kill me. There's a couple other things you need to do. You just put underwear on your neck and then you die.

79
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But he could have done that, but I still don't think it's super possible for a kid to hang himself in a Burger King bathroom.

80
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 We also had another kid who hated shoe shopping so much, his mom dragging him to a Payless Shoe Source.

81
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I'll put these episodes in the show notes that he ran out of the Payless Shoe Source. He was so sick, "Mom, I don't want to wear no more shoes. I'm running free, barefooting free."

82
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And he got hit by a car and exploded. The key point was not only did the car hit him, it just kind of like blew him up.

83
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Which again, not super possible, right? I guess if the car was going fast enough and if the boy was frail enough, we'll get a physicist on the show and we'll talk about this.

84
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 The reason specifically why we know he blew up was because one of the ways he would show up as a ghost in the Payless Shoe Source, which admittedly this is a hilarious prank.

85
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I mean, if I got blown to pieces, I'd probably do something like this.

86
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He's haunting the Payless Shoe Source and what people have said is they will go to get a box of shoes. They're like, "Oh, look at these. These are going to be great shoes."

87
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And they open the box up and there's a little boy's decayed head in the box and like half the forearm.

88
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 So like he blew up. He blew up in his eternal rusty place. It's a Payless Shoe Source.

89
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And he's in boxes. I think he also appears as a full body apparition. I recorded that episode a long time ago.

90
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 But those are both pretty embarrassing. I mean, getting hit by a car isn't necessarily embarrassing. That unfortunately happens all the time too.

91
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 It's the fact that he's now trapped in a Payless Shoe Source for eternity or until Payless goes out of business, which I'm pretty sure they have at this point.

92
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 This though, the one we're about to talk here, that was a little refresher. This one might be one, I don't think this is possible.

93
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I don't think this is possible. I had to keep googling it, much to the consternation of anyone with eyeballs walking behind me while I was looking this up.

94
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Apparently this is the ghost story at Blooming Grove Academy during a junior high basketball game.

95
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 So middle school students, right? 6th, 7th, 8th grade. There was a kid, he was playing basketball.

96
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 "Yo Jimmy, pass me the ball." They don't actually give his name, of course. These are the ghost stories. The legend is how much of it is true, how much of it is urban legend.

97
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 But they're like, "Jimmy, pass me the pill." And he's like throwing the ball and then another kid's getting in. Jimmy's like, "What a good workout I..."

98
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 "My tummy." He's like, "Why does my stomach hurt so bad?" And then they're like, "Jimmy, heads up." And they throw the ball back to him. He's on dribble on the ball.

99
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Every time he dribbles on the ball, he's like, "Oh no." And he apparently either had a stomach flu or ate too much Taco Bell because his stomach is just totally grumbling grumbling.

100
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And he's playing a basketball game. It would be the worst time to be sick, but he has points to make.

101
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 He shoots the ball. Yay, Jimmy's team! Woo, yeah, yeah. And he's feeling how sick he is and he starts to feel that bile come up through his throat and he throws up.

102
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But... So I don't know if this is possible. He feels the bile, he feels the food coming back up.

103
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And then suddenly, his burrito is slowly making his way up. He's esophagus. He knows the feeling well. He remembers what it felt like going down.

104
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 He's throwing up, but he knows he will be so embarrassed to be thrown up in the basketball game that he stops it.

105
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 He closes his mouth shut and lets all of the vomit fill up his cheeks. He's standing there. His lips are dripping liquid.

106
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 He's like, "Yo, Jimmy, stop passing the ball back through. He's all trying to dribble."

107
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 He basically throws it in his mouth, but like a full throw up, not just a little bit of bile, full on in his mouth.

108
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 He's holding it in because he'll be so embarrassed if he throws up so he's holding in the vomit.

109
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 They don't say if he continues to play the game. He's like, "Oh man, he's sunk a three-pointer."

110
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But he stood there and he held the vomit in for so long, he died. He died. He fell over and had asphyxiated on his own vomit.

111
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 That's the ghost story. Now, here's the thing. I know you can swallow your own vomit.

112
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 You're like, "Damn it." You're sitting down in the big pot of stew. You're like, "I don't even know what I start eating."

113
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And listen to Dead Rub Radio at the same time. This is disgusting.

114
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Hey, parent, I know you can swallow your own vomit and die. Again, unfortunately, that happens.

115
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But I looked it up. I was typing into Google, "Can you on purpose?"

116
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 "Choke on your own vomit."

117
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And pretty much every resource was, "Yes, if you drink too much, this is a huge issue."

118
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Yes, you can swallow your own vomit if you're laying down and you're intoxicated. And even firsthand accounts, people were like, "Yeah, man, I had a really bad experience with that.

119
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I'd been drinking heavily, but I was still walking around, and I threw up, and then a piece of it got stuck in my windpipe and all that stuff."

120
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 But they all weren't trying to hold it in. They were either in a position where they were laying down. They choked on their own vomit.

121
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 There's no reports of somebody choking on their own vomit and dying in a basketball game, where they're actively moving around.

122
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So I don't know if this is possible. I don't know if physically you can be standing up playing a game of basketball.

123
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Why keep focusing on that? I was like, "But if they're playing cricket, then who knows? Probably."

124
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 You're standing up, you vomit, you hold it in, and then you choke to death. Now I imagine maybe he held it in, and then it went back into his windpipe or something like that,

125
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 because you got all that liquid and all that food floating around up there. Those refried beans have to go somewhere.

126
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But I find that intra-- if the story's true, which if it isn't, it's the funniest made-up ghost story we've come across.

127
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Let's say the story's true. Let's say that this kid, I don't know, maybe had a reputation for throwing up around the school,

128
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and everyone's like, "Jimmy, if you throw up one more time, we're going to call you regurgitating Jimmy for the rest of your life."

129
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And he's like, "I don't want that nickname." I did throw up multiple times around school to come to this point.

130
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 "I, Jimmy, I, Jimmy vow to never throw up again." He's playing basketball. He's about to throw up. He swallows it.

131
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I don't-- well, he didn't mean to swallow it again. Like, he just was holding it in, and he suffocated.

132
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 I don't know why you would be embarrassed to throw up at a basketball game.

133
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Now, if you threw up and then slipped in it and accidentally threw the ball and the opponent's hoop,

134
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 then yes, that would be kind of embarrassing. That would be so funny.

135
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 I would be the guy laughing. Everyone's like, "Oh, Jimmy, I'm up on the stands. I'm laughing."

136
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I was like, "Did you see what you just did? Did you see what you should be embarrassed? You should be so embarrassed by what happened."

137
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I just find it so interesting, and you wonder if he threw up and died, and he died because he didn't want to be embarrassed,

138
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 if the embarrassment is what's keeping him at this school. Like, if-- like, he basically willed himself in not a way that he wanted,

139
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 he is now a ghost in this school, because-- and this is the reason why I say that-- had he-- like, the fear of embarrassment was so great in this kid

140
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 that he didn't want to throw up in public, and that ended up killing him, and that ultimate fear of embarrassment is what is holding him on Earth,

141
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 because here's my theory, and we'll wrap it up like this. The ghost that's on the third floor-- that's not where they were playing basketball.

142
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 They weren't playing basketball down the hallway. The defense would jump out of different doors to distract people.

143
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 The ghost is on the third floor of this building. It's not at the gym, with the doors rattling and stuff like that.

144
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Had none of these ghostly activities ever happened-- let's assume all of this stuff is true-- had there been no reports of door slamming

145
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 or doorknobs turning or music playing and then mysteriously shutting off, had those never happened, there would be no internet record about a junior high school kid

146
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 swallowing his own vomit during a basketball game. You see what I mean? Like, he is even more embarrassed now that even though his name may be lost to history,

147
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 even though no one may remember who this kid was, in the world of the internet, in the realm of the paranormal, he will forever be known as "vomit boy" of Blooming Grove Academy.

148
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And that's the ultimate embarrassment. That's the embarrassment that literally lives on after you die. Had none of these hauntings taken place,

149
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 assuming this story is true-- and it could just be urban legend, it could be totally made up, but let's say the story's true, put on our conspiracy caps--

150
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 had none of these hauntings ever taken place, we have never come across a story. No one would know the story of the vomit boy of Blooming Grove Academy,

151
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 that's his only legacy, no one else remembers who this dude was, except for the boy who choked on his own vomit, because he was too embarrassed to vomit.

152
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So, we always talk about personal attachments to an area, keeping you stuck there, a house you loved so much, a park that you spent so much time at,

153
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 personal attachments can draw your spirit to those areas after death, what about negative attachments, like embarrassment?

154
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Or, there should be a creepy one, jealousy, right? You have a significant other who just can't get over you, they die in a horrific way,

155
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 and then six months later, they're haunting your house, because they're attached to you. I wonder if we've covered that, sounds vaguely familiar,

156
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 but again, if we have covered it, it's once over the course of what, 1,040 some odd episodes. So, negative attachments can they also keep you stuck to an area?

157
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I guess one way to ask is if you live in Bloomington, Illinois, go out and check Blooming Grove Academy, first off make sure it still exists,

158
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 it might be a meatpacking plant now, there, your website is down, but maybe try to investigate this vomit boy of Blooming Grove Academy.

159
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Find out the truth, is it embarrassment keeping him there? Who knows?

160
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 But it's an interesting theory, and I thought it was an absolutely hilarious death. Just a minute, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter,

161
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 let's leave behind Blooming Grove Academy, we got everything from our finger painting permits to our high school diplomas, we are now all high school graduates,

162
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 fly us away from here and take us all the way out to Seattle, Washington.

163
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,040

167
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,040
 Last week, we ended on a cliffhanger, which is rare for this show, right, it's a daily podcast, not everyone listens to every episode,

168
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 and that's totally fine, so let me give you a quick overview of what happened last time.

169
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:23,040
 On Dead Rabbit Radio, we have the story of Dr. Jonathan Reed and his trusty golden retriever, Susie.

170
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 I'll give you the same warning I gave on Friday, if you're a dog lover, this is a bit of a rough one, but I'll go, I don't need to go through all the gory details,

171
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 I did just talk about a man-swelling vomit for 20 minutes.

172
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:43,040
 It was October 1996, near the snow-qualomy pass in Washington, Dr. Jonathan Reed and his seven-year-old golden retriever, Susie,

173
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 stumbled upon a four-foot tall, half-grey, half-reptilian creature,

174
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,040
 and Susie and the alien began to fight. The alien was moving at a super-fast speed,

175
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 and Susie was trying to get a good lock on him while Dr. Jonathan Reed was dumbfounded. He did pick up a big tree branch,

176
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,040
 so he figured he'd have to get into the fight at some point.

177
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 Eventually, Susie grabbed a hold of the alien's arm, the alien then ripped off the top of Susie's head,

178
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:26,040
 the top of her skull, and just threw it to the ground. I mean, he just ripped this dog's head off.

179
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:34,040
 Susie's body as it was bleeding into the forest floor then began to crumple and distort,

180
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 as if it was being sucked into a miniature black hole inside the dog's body.

181
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,040
 So Dr. Reed is watching this dog go "mmm" and "bing!"

182
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:55,040
 I don't know if it actually made a "bink" sound or it was just a sound of guts and entrails being sucked through a portal.

183
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:05,040
 Who knows? But anyways, Dr. Reed is so mad at this point that he rushes the alien and bashes its head in with this club,

184
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,040
 exposing brain matter and skull fragments and all this stuff.

185
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,040
 The level of gore in that story was quite interesting because we don't see that much.

186
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,040
 Even in stories where humans are getting abducted, a lot of times it still feels fairly sterile.

187
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,040
 There's not blood spraying all over the room when an arm gets chopped off.

188
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,040
 An arm is still getting chopped off, but it doesn't seem to be that gore.

189
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 And even for Jonathan, he thought he killed a kid at first.

190
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
 He thought he had killed a human in a costume. He was in shock.

191
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 And what he does is he takes the alien's body, wraps it in a thermo blanket, and carries it over his shoulder.

192
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,040
 They were about an hour and a half from the car and he carries this little guy who weighed, he said he goes,

193
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,040
 "Wait only about 50 pounds, surprisingly light."

194
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 He might have weighed more if he still had his brains in his head, but without his brains, he was pretty light.

195
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,040
 He carried this creature's body all the way to his car, threw it in the trunk, and headed back home to Seattle, Washington.

196
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,040
 And that is where we ended Friday's episode.

197
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
 So let's go ahead and we got some more of the story.

198
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,040
 We got the second half of Dr. Jonathan Reed's journey.

199
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,040
 And we'll take a look at a little bit of the behind the scenes of the story.

200
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,040
 Because when I started researching it, I came across it on ThinkAboutDocs.com and they had a pretty brief write-up.

201
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:35,040
 And I felt there was information missing, so I tracked down the book that they sourced it from, bought the book, read the chapter on this story,

202
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,040
 and go, "Wow, there's a lot of information left out."

203
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,040
 And then as I continued to do more research, I go, "Wow, there's a lot of information left out of the book.

204
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,040
 It's not good information. It doesn't paint Jonathan in a good light."

205
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
 Let's take a look at all this stuff.

206
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:55,040
 So now we're at the point where they're back in Seattle, Jonathan and this dead alien in his trunk.

207
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,040
 And he takes it and he throws it in the meat freezer in his garage.

208
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,040
 Goes to bed, which I think, I think that's pretty much a full day, right?

209
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,040
 Your dog got sucked into oblivion. You beat an alien to death.

210
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 And, let's not forget, you had to carry his body out.

211
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,040
 He throws the alien in the ice freezer, the meat freezer.

212
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,040
 Goes to bed. The next morning, he wakes up and he takes the alien out of the freezer, the alien's body.

213
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 It's still wrapped in this thermal blanket.

214
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,040
 And this is where we have video footage.

215
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,040
 We do have existing video footage, because what we're going to find throughout the story is,

216
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,040
 he says, "I took pictures of all of this stuff. I took pictures of the...

217
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 Oh yeah, he ran into the alien's nine foot tall UFO. It was kind of flowing around the forest."

218
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
 That happened on Friday's episode two.

219
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,040
 But he said, "I took photos of the UFO. I took photos of this alien's body.

220
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,040
 It took all this video footage of the alien, but people, of course, want to see it.

221
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,040
 But the feds took it all. The feds took it all."

222
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,040
 Which, I believe that can happen, right?

223
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,040
 I mean, it's a convenient excuse, but I believe that can happen.

224
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,040
 But this video footage exists. You can find it on YouTube.

225
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,040
 And, okay, here's the thing.

226
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:18,040
 To say it is less than convincing is half right.

227
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,040
 Jason, isn't that convincing?

228
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
 Here's the weird thing about it.

229
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
 There's video footage of this on YouTube.

230
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,040
 It's all creepy and yellow, and it's with a video camera, because this was like in '96, '97.

231
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
 You walk around this video camera.

232
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 He's breathing as heavy as you would imagine a man would who was filming his neighbor undressing.

233
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 It is very...

234
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,040
 Maybe I'll play a sound clip just of him breathing, because it is quite funny.

235
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,040
 And that's really the only sound, right?

236
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
 [breathing]

237
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
 [breathing]

238
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
 [breathing]

239
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
 [breathing]

240
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040

241
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
 [breathing]

242
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
 [breathing]

243
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
 [breathing]

244
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,040
 And then he's undressing.

245
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,040
 Not undressing, he's unwrapping the alien from the thermo blanket.

246
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,040
 It's one of those like metallic aluminum blankets or whatever to keep you warm at night.

247
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
 [breathing]

248
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
 Or cold. That's one of the things.

249
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
 But anyways, I think it's warm.

250
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,040
 Anyways, this isn't a blanket review podcast.

251
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 You're like, "What? I've been listening to this for a thousand episodes.

252
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,040
 I was wondering when he's getting to the blanket reviews."

253
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,040
 He unwraps the alien. We see this on camera. He unwraps the alien.

254
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,040
 And you see what looks like a fairly realistic looking alien head.

255
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,040
 Doesn't look like a typical gray alien.

256
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,040
 Doesn't look like some store-bought mask.

257
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,040
 The head itself is interesting.

258
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,040
 The alien though was described as wearing a one-piece black suit.

259
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,040
 So from the neck, it had like a little collar on his neck or like, you know, like where it cut off.

260
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,040
 There's the black thing around his neck, whatever that's called.

261
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,040
 Collar. I think it was right the first time.

262
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,040
 And then it went all the way down and it was like completely covered his feet and his legs and his arms.

263
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,040
 So it looked like he was in like a unitard.

264
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,040
 Like just one piece suit with no seams in it whatsoever.

265
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 So when he unwraps the alien, you see this little alien head.

266
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:04,040
 And then you see what I could only in my own scientific analysis would describe as a cabbage patch.

267
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 As a cabbage patch.

268
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 I was so disappointed. I was so disappointed.

269
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
 It looked like a cabbage patch doll.

270
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,040
 Now at this point I already done a ton of research, right? I'm reading the book.

271
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 I'm re, I was typing up all my notes and then finally I was reading all these articles and one of them had a link to the,

272
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,040
 because I kept talking about video footage and pictures and reading all these sources and they're like,

273
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 but the feds got them and then I finally read this other article and they go, yeah, here's a link to the YouTube video.

274
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 At this point I'd spent hours getting all this stuff ready.

275
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,040
 And I watched the video and I was like, oh my goodness, that looks like a cabbage patch doll, bro.

276
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 That totally looks like a cabbage patch doll.

277
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:51,040
 I'll use a screenshot for the show art for this episode, but, or maybe not.

278
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 Maybe that will give it away.

279
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 Maybe we're going to listen to this episode.

280
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,040
 Is he talking about cabbage patch dolls?

281
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,040
 Anyways, the body does not look realistic. The head does.

282
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,040
 And this is what's fascinating about it.

283
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,040
 I've seen a lot of, um, like crime scene stuff.

284
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,040
 And not just like on YouTube or Live League.

285
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:26,040
 I told you guys, I went to my cousin's, um, murder trial and it was very interesting when they showed the inside of the house where he had stabbed that dude.

286
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
 It was not like you're watching on YouTube.

287
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:36,040
 We're sitting there in the courtroom and we're watching on this big monitor and it's completely silent.

288
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:47,040
 There's no audio and it's just this camera walking through the house recording the ground just kind of sweeping sites aside like you're looking at stuff and then it walks up to a man laying there.

289
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
 It's a deceased man.

290
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,040
 He got stabbed in the heart with a steak knife.

291
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
 It's truly unsettling.

292
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
 And I'd been in that house too.

293
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
 I had hung out of that house.

294
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
 Not a lot.

295
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,040
 It was a known meth distribution center.

296
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
 I didn't go there all the time.

297
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
 Well, my buddy was there.

298
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
 My cousin was there.

299
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
 Right.

300
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
 We'd go over there.

301
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
 We'd play PlayStation 2 and stuff like that.

302
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
 But I didn't stay there after dark.

303
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
 I never stayed there after dark.

304
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:23,040
 I remember my cousin, Belly, was like, yeah, sometimes when I want to leave and I don't want to go through the living room, he pulls back his curtains and he had just kicked his window had no screen because he's like, yeah, I kicked it out.

305
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,040
 So this is how I get in the house.

306
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
 I just hop in and out of this door.

307
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
 So I don't have to walk through everything.

308
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,040
 Anyways, it's weird.

309
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:40,040
 And that's kind of what it felt like watching this, not as emotionally draining as watching the one at my cousin's murder trial.

310
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,040
 But there is a weird factor to it where on the one hand you're like, oh my God, that body's totally fake.

311
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
 But it's the video carries on.

312
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
 It does.

313
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,040
 I'm not going to say it's disturbing or it's like one of the seven most creepiest things you're even going to see today.

314
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
 But there's a weird element to it.

315
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,040
 It does feel slightly that it was a living thing.

316
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:12,040
 It's not like you're looking at a dead human, but you do kind of get this weird and I started laughing when I watched the video and I kind of slumped my shoulders into feet because I had already done a ton of research and I was like, this is obviously fake.

317
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,040
 But as the video progressed, I go, I'm getting, this feels uneasy.

318
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,040
 Like I don't know, I don't know what it is.

319
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
 And here's the thing.

320
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,040
 The world is full or the universe is full of mysteries.

321
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,040
 Evolution can take its own path on a multitude of planets.

322
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,040
 Who's to say that somewhere out in the void?

323
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
 There is not a cabbage patch world.

324
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,040
 There's not a world where people have the name Xavier stamped on their butt.

325
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
 Who's to say that?

326
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:50,040
 Who's to say that having bones and flesh and a realistic body is the only way to evolve?

327
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,040
 Maybe that's how he was able to run so fast.

328
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 Which that's funny because Thomas the Dink Engine, he was the guy who was piloting the Carboner Cup today episode.

329
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:08,040
 He messaged me on Instagram after the episode and he was talking about the video and he's like, there's no way, there's no way those little cabbage patch lakes can run so fast.

330
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
 I was like, I know.

331
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,040
 And this is what's in here.

332
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
 Let me finish up the story here.

333
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,040
 Finish up the narrative because I really want to go into this a little bit deeper.

334
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
 We don't have a lot of time.

335
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,040
 Jonathan Reed, we can pretty much summarize this.

336
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
 Jonathan Reed has the body.

337
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
 He takes the video footage.

338
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
 He takes a tons of photos.

339
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,040
 He begins contacting UFO groups like Mufon, the Mutual UFO Network.

340
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:43,040
 And he says that that was probably the worst decision that he had made because they start to pre--in his words, being very aggressive towards him.

341
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 They wanted to take the body.

342
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
 They wanted to chop it up.

343
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,040
 They wanted to analyze it and they wanted to investigate Jonathan as well.

344
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
 And he's like, you know, like, what are you talking about?

345
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
 Like, I have this alien.

346
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,040
 You guys can come look at it, but I don't want you chopping him up.

347
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 And he's trying--he--so Dr. Jonathan Reed, he worked at a university.

348
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
 He was like a research psychologist.

349
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,040
 Research--yeah, he was a research psychologist.

350
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,040
 He tried talking to his peers of the college.

351
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
 A lot of them just kind of blew him off.

352
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
 A couple of them were interested in his fine.

353
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
 But then at the last minute, he said, "I can't come out there. I can't come out there."

354
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,040
 So Jonathan is starting to think that there might be a conspiracy going on against him.

355
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 He also starts to feel kind of uneasy because he remembers--hey, wait a second.

356
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:37,040
 I bashed that creature's brain in the forest, but when I pulled it out and videotaped it--and it was so funny because I thought about this too when I was watching the videotape.

357
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,040
 I go, "Where's the gaping wound in his brain?"

358
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,040
 It was pretty gory the way the story was written. How come half of his skull isn't missing?

359
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:59,040
 Jonathan goes, "When I smashed his head open, it really took a big chunk out of him, but when I took him out of the freezer and I was videotaping him, I realized that the wound had healed."

360
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,040
 Or it wasn't the process of healing. It definitely wasn't as bad as I had inflicted on him before.

361
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:16,040
 And he starts to think, "What could possibly--the thing's dead, but I mean, I don't know. It does have a cabbage patch body. Who knows how the biology on their planet works?"

362
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:31,040
 So he's getting kind of the cold shoulder from some of his colleagues. He's getting negative feelings from mainstream UFO researchers, and then he begins to hear a thumping from inside the meat freezer.

363
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:41,040
 And that's when he's like, "Oh my god, dude. What could possibly be going on in there? I mean, it's probably the alien right?"

364
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 He's like, "Oh, did I leave the thermostat off? Did it melt? Do I have a bunch of bad meat in there?"

365
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,040
 No, the thumping from inside your freezer is most likely the alien you dropped off in there.

366
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:58,040
 And at this point, we're like--it's only been seven days since he came back. This is all happening in a clip.

367
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:15,040
 He opened up his freezer and he saw the alien was alive in the freezer, and the alien started screaming, making this really shrill, high-pitched noise, and Jonathan slams the freezer shut, won't let the little guy out.

368
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:24,040
 Two days after that, Jonathan said he was out going to work or doing some shopping or something like that.

369
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,040
 And now he's driving home, he's driving past his house, and he sees people in his house.

370
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,040
 He sees a bunch of people walking around in his house, and he sees a couple vans outside of his house, so he just kept driving.

371
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,040
 He's like, "I don't know where that one is, but I'm going to keep going."

372
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:51,040
 And then when he did go back, the body was gone. There were holes all on his walls where they were looking for evidence.

373
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,040
 They feared maybe he was stashing photographs here and there.

374
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:07,040
 He said that he had connected with a local UFO group. He said that he had sent some photos and some videos to other people, and one of them turned up dead, a UFO researcher named Dolly.

375
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:15,040
 He said that she was dead, found dead due to a heart attack, and the copy he gave her of the UFO was gone.

376
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,040
 But one copy of the video tape that exists, that's what's on YouTube, he said that he then went on the run for two years with his good friend Gary.

377
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:35,040
 They moved up and down the West Coast. They worked with a group of supporters, known as the Alliance, and the Feds were constantly trying to shut them up by any means necessary.

378
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:43,040
 And that is after the two years he ends up calling Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell in '98. This all started in '96.

379
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 Exposing this whole story to the world. It's a fascinating UFO story. It was done heavily at the time, and I think the story's kind of fallen into obscurity.

380
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:01,040
 Really, I mean, I had never heard of this before, and even the blurb I found on ThinkAbout@Ducks.com, which is a great depository of UFO encounters, they had a bunch of facts wrong.

381
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,040
 It was just like a blurb someone had typed up.

382
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:19,040
 But at the time it was huge. Both Jonathan and his friend Greg went on to become speakers in the UFO community. I know Jonathan himself became an author, began doing the Turing circuit.

383
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,040
 I had no idea any of these guys existed, but they were big at the time. Really, really big at the time.

384
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:38,040
 And they brought the attention of a group called UFOWatchDog.com, and they're not watching for UFOs. They're watching for the people who watch for UFOs.

385
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:45,040
 And it's super interesting. They actually think this whole story was made up.

386
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:58,040
 And they say that Dr. Jonathan Reed never existed. It's actually a man named John Bradley Rutter, who also lived in Washington. He'd been living in Washington the whole time. He didn't go on the run with his friend, Greg.

387
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 They said Dr. Jonathan Reed, or John Bradley Rutter, was not a doctor, no college degree at all on record, and they called him, quote, "a liar, con man, and UFO leech."

388
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:26,040
 So we have that. And what's so interesting is because there's no real material of people vetting Jonathan Reed, the only stuff that I really had to go off was UFOWatchDog's own website.

389
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,040
 And they're like, they listed all of these experts in the industry, and they're like, this expert says that this story is 100% authentic.

390
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,040
 And this expert says that they talk to everyone at the university, and they remember Dr. Jonathan Reed, and they remember being asked about this.

391
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,040
 And then UFOWatchDog goes, but we don't believe those guys either.

392
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:51,040
 And I go, well, I didn't know that there was anyone checking the side of the story saying it was true, and now you just named the people who are.

393
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 So they listed a whole bunch of experts who say, no, we actually believe this story, and here's why.

394
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,040
 And UFOWatchDog just goes, yeah, but those guys are lame too, so believe us.

395
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:10,040
 When we show a picture of a guy, and we say this guy's name is John Bradley Rudder, I don't know if that is really his name.

396
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 You've given me no birth certificate. You've given me nothing to go off of.

397
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
 So it's super weird. They actually ended up, this is what it comes down to with this story.

398
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:29,040
 We've covered crazy things on the show before, and we've covered groups that go, we don't believe in that thing, but very rare.

399
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,040
 Like UFOWatchDog group has multiple pages. They have a huge, huge thing built up on this guy.

400
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,040
 And they're like, from the moment he told the story, we were on him, we were going to prove it was a hoax. Why?

401
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,040
 Like he sells a couple of books, right? It's not cool to lie, right?

402
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 I'm not saying that a hoax scene is cool at all.

403
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:55,040
 I think it diminishes the UFOology as a whole, or even the world paranormal, people who fake psychic stuff, UFO stuff, channeling.

404
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:03,040
 And if you're faking it, you're diminishing it as a whole at the very least, and at the most you're actively taking advantage of people,

405
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,040
 not just from their money, but their time. I think it's horrific to hoax.

406
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,040
 But the reason why I say like, why him? Why him out of all of the hoaxers?

407
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:21,040
 Because I do believe that we have hoaxers and huxters and all that stuff. Why him? Why are they going so hard after him?

408
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,040
 And it was so weird for them to publish stuff that made me go, I don't know, maybe you're wrong.

409
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
 Maybe they're right. I don't know.

410
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:36,040
 To me, the UFO watchdog group should just been like, you guys know about Dr. Jonathan Reed? Here's a link to the YouTube video.

411
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,040
 That is the most debunkable part of it.

412
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 Like I was disappointed when I saw the aliens body. I don't know what I expected.

413
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 I was hoping I would see an actual alien. Like when they unwrap that foil and I saw that cabbage patch body, I was disappointed.

414
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,040
 Like that is the big, all other people saying it's true. It's not true. It's true. It's not true.

415
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:09,040
 I don't know if you provide me birth certificates, if you provide me social security numbers in the keys of their house, then I'll believe you.

416
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:17,040
 I think the cabbage patch body and the, this is the problem, and I gotta wrap this up too. I can talk about this all day long.

417
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,040
 The behind the scenes stuff. The cabbage patch body is obviously, it looks so fake.

418
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,040
 My shoulders just kind of shrugged and defeat.

419
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,040
 The other thing is like the story can't keep evolving and it does.

420
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:44,040
 At some point apparently they go, "Hey, oh, I also forgot to tell you that the alien had on a magical bin 10 type watch that will allow you to open portals to other dimensions or control the UFO or something like that."

421
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,040
 And that's why the government wanted him so bad and they were chasing him for two years because they wanted the watch.

422
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,040
 And him and his sister drove around in a van fighting monsters with monsters.

423
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,040
 It's like, "Dude, just leave that stuff out. That didn't happen. That didn't happen."

424
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,040
 You didn't find a magical watch.

425
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,040
 You can't add details. Either it started off with him having a bin 10 magical watch or he didn't.

426
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:16,040
 But that is the conclusion of the story of Dr. Jonathan Reed and Susie. Or did that ever even happen?

427
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,040
 Were they attacked by a cabbage batch doll from another world?

428
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 Do aliens from other planets have soft bodies that you can squeeze?

429
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,040
 Who knows? Probably not. Probably not, man. That dumb doll. That dumb doll.

430
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,040
 I was so disappointed. I was so disappointed.

431
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,040
 I would rather have them just said, "Well, I didn't want to show the body."

432
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,040
 He was shy. He had to be at a giant genitalia and it made me feel inadequate.

433
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,040
 So I'm going to keep the blanket up to his neck. I'm just going to show you the head.

434
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,040
 Because the head was... The features weren't overly exaggerated.

435
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,040
 He had to open up the eyelids and move the mouth.

436
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,040
 He was like, "Hey, believe in me. Believe in me, kids."

437
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,040
 It's a fascinating story. I love it. I don't know how true it is.

438
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,040
 My belief level did drop considerably once I saw the YouTube video.

439
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,040
 But a fascinating story nonetheless. It's more fascinating, obviously, if it's true.

440
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,040
 It's just made up then. The UFO Watchdog group is right.

441
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,040
 But if they're wrong, then maybe we're all wrong about what aliens are like.

442
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,040
 Maybe they are... Cabbage Patch.

443
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:31,040
 Maybe that is the life form. You have carbon-based, possibly silica life form aliens like the conformers.

444
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,040
 And now, finally, cotton-based, soft and huggable, cabbage patch aliens.

445
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,040
 But before you go and squeeze one, give it lots of love and take it back to your home.

446
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:49,040
 Remember, this one did rip the skull off a... This one did rip the skull off a golden retriever without breaking a sweat.

447
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:57,040
 So, they may look huggable and lovable, but they may also put you in a life-and-death struggle.
