1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 In 2004, a meteorite smashes into the planet earth.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,360
 Or does it?

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,560
 Then we travel back to the year 1988 to meet a group of what have only been described as

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,000
 superheroes in training and their encounter with some mysterious creatures.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,200
 And finally, we travel to India where a man lives with 11 of his family members.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,800
 Three generations of people live in a house above a shop.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,840
 But when the shop doesn't open one morning, people fear the worst.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,320
 And they have no idea what's inside the house.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:54,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,120
 So for our first story, we're headed to Nicaragua.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,160
 I knew when I was researching the story, I was like great country, I can't say the

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,600
 word, the name of Nicaragua.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,520
 It's in South America, Central America.

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,320
 It's down south of the border.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,480
 I think it's in Central America actually.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,600
 Actually I know for a fact it's in Central America.

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,680
 So now how much people are doing it?

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,320
 It's not, it's at the tip of South America.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 Doesn't matter.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
 It's somewhere around there.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,760
 The year is 2014.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,560
 So very, very close to where we're at right now.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,040
 The date is September 6th.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,360
 Hop on board the carpenter copter boys.

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,200
 We're flying to Nicaragua.

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
 So as we're flying over Nicaragua, so it's just after midnight, we're flying around.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,320
 I go guys, see that airport over there?

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,640
 See Augusto C Sandino International Airport?

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
 See that right over there?

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,800
 You're like yeah, yeah I see it.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,600
 So we're gonna fly over that and I want you to keep your eye out.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,000
 I want you to keep an eye on things.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
 You're like are we spies now?

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,120
 We're working for the CIA.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
 Like no, no.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,040
 Is my eye shift back and forth?

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
 I'm like no.

41
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,480
 But don't ask that question again.

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,520
 I might have to kick you out of the helicopter.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
 We're flying.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
 I go do you see anything?

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
 And you're like no, no.

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
 And then.

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
 But.

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:31,320
 Just dirt and smoke appear just a little shy of the airport.

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,560
 Massive explosion.

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,800
 We see the explosion.

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,640
 We actually feel the shockwave.

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,480
 Is the helicopter, I'm sorry that noise probably woke someone up is listening to the podcast

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
 late at night.

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
 I continue to do it going down, going down, I'm hitting switches.

55
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
 But I'm able to stabilize the helicopter and we start to smell.

56
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,880
 It smells like something was burnt.

57
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,480
 Smells like something was really burnt.

58
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,880
 So what happened was in, this was in the city of Managua, Managua, September 6th, 2014.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 It's midnight.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
 People are sitting at home.

61
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,040
 They're watching everyone loves Raymond, eating popcorn, doing whatever.

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,320
 And all of a sudden they hear this massive explosion.

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
 They look out their window.

64
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,240
 They just see all this debris going everywhere and they can feel the shockwave.

65
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,640
 It's a pretty populated area.

66
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,480
 There's like 2.4 million people.

67
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
 It's right by an airport.

68
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,080
 So it's not in the middle of nowhere, not middle of the jungle.

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,040
 It's not in the middle of a desert.

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,840
 People see the explosion, hear the explosion.

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
 They smell the explosion.

72
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,680
 Of course military officials go out there.

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,880
 Rescue workers go out there because they don't know what's going on.

74
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,720
 What they find is a crater.

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,840
 40 feet wide, 20 feet deep.

76
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,280
 You had seismic centers across the country that had actually picked up the shockwave

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
 coming through the ground.

78
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
 They go, huh.

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,560
 It must have been a meteorite.

80
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
 So let's find it.

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,480
 Because this scientific thing, find a meteorite, give it to the nerds.

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,280
 Maybe it has some cool metals.

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
 The scientists are fighting over it.

84
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 Who gets to touch it first?

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
 They're like, dude, no.

86
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 When I see it, I'm going to become a superhero.

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
 I'm going to get my--no, no, I'm going to get superpowers.

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
 They're all wrestling.

89
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,680
 The investigators are like, I don't care who gets superpowers.

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,520
 Just find the meteorite.

91
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,920
 He's secretly hoping the blobs in it so he can eat all these nerds.

92
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 They look all over the place.

93
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,400
 No meteorite at all.

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,800
 Now thinking, okay, maybe the meteorite exploded.

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,520
 But maybe we'll find some fragments looking around, looking around.

96
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
 Nothing.

97
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,640
 And it gets to the point where they have to contact NASA.

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,680
 They're contacting outside resources.

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,440
 And they go, hey, listen, it's going to be really weird.

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,960
 But two or three nights ago, we had this massive explosion.

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,560
 And the guy on the other NASA is like, get meteorite, dude.

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
 Don't bug us.

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
 We should get some meteorite.

104
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
 And they're like, no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
 We thought it was a meteorite, too.

106
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,320
 But we don't find any trace of it at all.

107
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,080
 We're not finding any little pieces of it.

108
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,040
 But here's the weirdest thing about this.

109
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,440
 Nobody saw anything before this happened.

110
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,840
 This is called the Manigua event, because you have a crater that most likely was caused

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,620
 by a meteor near a city with a population of 2.4 million people.

112
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,080
 Not a single person, not a single camera picked up something impacting the planet.

113
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,000
 There is no footage, not anyone seeing it.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
 Well, Jason, maybe the rock was black.

115
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:15,000
 They said for something to leave a hole this size on Earth, it would have been glowing

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
 brighter than the moon.

117
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,960
 There is absolutely the amount of energy, the amount of force and heat that it built

118
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,320
 up to impact the ground like this.

119
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,680
 There is no way it would have gone undetected at all.

120
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,760
 At all.

121
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,520
 Some people say, maybe it was already a sinkhole there.

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,520
 And that was it.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,840
 And then people go, what was the explosion people heard?

124
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
 And they don't have an answer for that.

125
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,920
 Some people believe the most likely suggestion is that it was a man-made explosion.

126
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,200
 But they don't know who or why anyone would do that.

127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,160
 They have no proof of that either.

128
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,160
 So basically something punched the planet, left a massive crater near a city.

129
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,800
 And nobody knows how or why or possibly who did this.

130
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,480
 After black hole, dark matter appearing all of a sudden, just ripping out a part of the

131
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
 planet.

132
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,120
 Mandela effect, alternate reality colliding, maybe in an alternate reality, some guy took

133
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,640
 a bite out of Earth.

134
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,560
 But we just got the little, who knows?

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
 That's obviously ridiculous.

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,440
 But who knows?

137
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,200
 Let's go ahead and move on with our next story.

138
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,080
 Now our next story is another little shorty.

139
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 It's from our new segment we're doing right now called 1988.

140
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,240
 I found a list of a bunch of weird UFO encounters from the year 1988.

141
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,760
 This one I'm going to read to you because I think a lot of the passion is in the writing.

142
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,200
 This is from a website called Think About It Docs.

143
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,360
 They do a lot of, link in the show notes, but they do a lot of lists of UFO sightings.

144
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
 But anyways, here we have one.

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,560
 This is July 1988.

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
 We're in Cheetle.

147
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,800
 I don't understand how England sets their name and stuff up.

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,200
 San Francisco, California.

149
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 That's all you need to know.

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,320
 Chicago, Illinois, right?

151
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,440
 This is in Cheetle, which is in Cheshire, which is in England.

152
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
 What just, come on dude.

153
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
 Whatever dude, I'm so tired of you guys.

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,520
 I have so many stories coming up with weird geographical stuff.

155
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,240
 Just figure it out.

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,440
 Anyways, the year 1988.

157
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
 It's July.

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,000
 I'm going to read this to you.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,560
 This is from a book written by Jenny Randalls.

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,760
 It's called Mind Monsters.

161
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,560
 And if this is what the book is about, if this is just an excerpt from these amazing adventures,

162
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,760
 I got to buy this book.

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
 Here's a quote.

164
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 This is from the website.

165
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,840
 "Several teenagers that were practicing the martial arts at an old abandoned mansion."

166
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
 So right there.

167
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,000
 That's Power Rangers, bro.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,720
 Like I've lived a pretty cool life.

169
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,520
 I've done a lot of awesome stuff.

170
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,920
 But I cannot say that as a teenager, I practiced martial arts with other teenagers in an old

171
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,520
 abandoned mansion.

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,360
 Because those are the three best words.

173
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,880
 And you got teenagers, preferably with attitude, doing karate in there.

174
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
 That's awesome.

175
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,840
 And nowhere in the story does it explain why they are doing this.

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,240
 I can only imagine they're getting ready to fight crime or read over a pulsa.

177
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:18,320
 But several teenagers that were practicing the martial arts at an old abandoned mansion

178
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:26,760
 spotted several small black dwarf-like beans that appear to stare at them from the nearby

179
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
 trees.

180
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
 Oh, oh, oh, getting creepy.

181
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
 Maybe they're the putties.

182
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,200
 Maybe this is the first iteration of the putties.

183
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
 They're coming.

184
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,560
 They're going to fight these teenagers.

185
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,800
 This is their test.

186
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
 Back to the quote.

187
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,360
 "The beans had bright shiny eyes."

188
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,080
 Oh, and this is 8 o'clock at night, by the way.

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,200
 I guess I should let you know that.

190
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,440
 This is 8 o'clock at night.

191
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,720
 So not super late.

192
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
 It's still too spooky to see little black creatures with shiny eyes poking their heads

193
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,480
 out from around a tree.

194
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
 Any time is too creepy for that, but at 8 o'clock it's even creepier.

195
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,960
 The beans had bright shiny eyes and wore dark, loose-fitting garments.

196
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,200
 The beans apparently had the ability to grow in size to nearly twice their size.

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,400
 During the encounters, the witnesses curiously felt no fear.

198
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,600
 So I'm going to buy this book, by the way.

199
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,200
 I'm going to find out if we know what happens to our intrepid young heroes, bulk and skull,

200
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,600
 or like, there's no way they'll be able to defeat the dwarves.

201
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,720
 And they're like, "Lord Zed's like, 'Ho ho ho, this actually not what I think about

202
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
 it.

203
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,520
 This is 100% power rangers because the dwarves can grow to nearly twice their size.

204
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,680
 Grow my monsters, grow!"

205
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,920
 I'm now starting to think that this is fake.

206
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,440
 Like I got to read this book.

207
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,000
 The book was written in 2000, so I'm buying it tonight.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,400
 Now I'm thinking that Jenny Randall's basically was able to write power rangers fan fiction

209
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 and sell it.

210
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
 You know what here, hold on.

211
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,720
 I don't want to push this Indian story back again because I already pushed it back from

212
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
 yesterday.

213
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,200
 But let me look up this book here real quick.

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,520
 I had it bookmarked earlier, but I just found the book online.

215
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,680
 The chapter is called Introduction, The Case of the Ninja Dwarves.

216
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,200
 So I'm going to pause recording right now.

217
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,360
 I'm going to read this chapter and you may have to push the Indian story back.

218
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
 We'll figure this out.

219
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
 Play me out.

220
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Play me out, Jamie.

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
 Put on a little hold music for these guys while I read this book.

222
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:58,680
 Okay, so we're not doing the Indian story today.

223
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
 It's such a good story too.

224
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,720
 I'm going to put it off for two days now, but I just read The Case of the Ninja Dwarves.

225
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,800
 Now I'm pretty sure I've entitled this episode somewhere with Ninja Dwarves.

226
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,280
 So maybe it's not a huge surprise that this is how we're going to end up the episode,

227
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,360
 but I did more research on this.

228
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
 This story is pretty creepy.

229
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,840
 So let's travel.

230
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
 Let's hop on board the carboner copter.

231
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,720
 Yep, we're going official.

232
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,360
 This is no longer just a short little story.

233
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
 Hop on board.

234
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,880
 We're leaving behind Niko Wog.

235
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,480
 We're heading out to Abney Hall.

236
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,320
 It's the name of the building if you're over there.

237
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,880
 Abney Hall is still around.

238
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 It is abandoned.

239
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,160
 I guess it was the Agatha Christie used to hang out there.

240
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
 It's a real famous hall.

241
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,960
 The author Jenny Randalls wrote this book called Mindmonsters and she talks about this

242
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
 case.

243
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
 So let's take a look at her notes.

244
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
 We're going to land our helicopter.

245
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,080
 We're going to land it on the roof of this old abandoned mansion.

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,440
 It's all buckling under the weight.

247
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,960
 I'm like, okay, hop off, hop off.

248
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,840
 We're rappelling down the building.

249
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,800
 And you're like, Jason, I think the heaviest thing up there is the helicopter, not us.

250
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,600
 I was like, yeah, helicopter will be fine.

251
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
 So now we're walking around the grounds and we look through a window and it's the year

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,200
 1988 and we see some teenagers.

253
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
 Doing crotty.

254
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,800
 There was about a dozen of them and they had an instructor there as well.

255
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
 He's like, readable pulses, destroy.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 You know what's funny?

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,080
 The Power Ranger jokes are going to end because this story is actually quite creepy, but I

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,440
 do want you all to imagine the instructor of these teenagers as Tommy, the Green Ranger.

259
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,040
 I want you all to picture that in your head.

260
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,960
 So pulls out his little flute and they're like, doing their crotty stuff.

261
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,160
 Now one day they're doing the martial arts and they see something out in a tree out in

262
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 the field.

263
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,680
 I see something kind of poking out from behind the tree.

264
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,760
 Now you know it's a dwarf because we talked about that, but I want to build the mood.

265
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,280
 So they're like, that's weird, but they're still, keep kicking, keep kicking.

266
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,800
 Whoa, whoa, don't look at that weird object over there.

267
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,520
 But the kids can't avoid looking at the object.

268
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,360
 And one of them goes, I'm going to go over there and see what it is.

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
 It looks like someone's behind that tree.

270
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
 That's totally weird.

271
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
 So he goes over there and he's looking.

272
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,640
 He's like, guys, there's nothing back here.

273
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
 He's standing right at the tree.

274
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,720
 There's nothing back there.

275
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,600
 And from the house, they can still see a dark figure looking behind the tree.

276
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 That's creepy.

277
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,680
 I've had experiences like that too, where reality bends so much that you can have people

278
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,000
 all looking at the same thing and three people will have seen it and three people won't have.

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
 And I've told stories like that.

280
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,080
 I told that one story where I was out in an area that was haunted.

281
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,720
 We were ghost hunting and I went around the corner of this building to go pee.

282
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,520
 And then my buddies came running around the corner and they're like, dude, what happened?

283
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
 There's a long story.

284
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,560
 I told them on an earlier episode, but they heard me screaming for my life.

285
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,040
 They thought I was getting jumped because I had recently just started trash talking to

286
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
 some kids.

287
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,560
 They thought they'd come back around to jump me and I was not making a single noise at

288
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
 all.

289
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
 And so reality warped.

290
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
 I wouldn't want them to come around while I'm peeing.

291
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
 I don't want my boys to see me like that.

292
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,960
 So I wasn't pulling a prank or nothing like that.

293
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
 Reality warped.

294
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,200
 It was a sound that...

295
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
 They heard a sound.

296
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,920
 I didn't hear any noise.

297
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,840
 So it wasn't even someone else yelling.

298
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
 It was another...

299
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,000
 There wasn't another handsome man with a demesculin voice yelling in the area.

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,280
 There was nothing.

301
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
 They heard it.

302
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,040
 So anyways, I've been in situations like that, but you have that where one person's standing

303
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
 right there and they don't see anything and then the other people.

304
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,720
 And we talked about this on yesterday's episode too about these people.

305
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,440
 They saw a car accident and when they went to hypnosis, it turns out it was like a cover

306
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,520
 for aliens.

307
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,240
 I think that's creepier because again, if you can't see that there's a creature right

308
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,120
 in front of you, if you have to be at a different location to see it, there is no way to defend

309
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
 yourself against these things.

310
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,280
 If you open your closet and you go, "Oh, my closet's totally just...

311
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,000
 It's a little messy, but there's nothing in there."

312
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And you shut the door.

313
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,880
 But if someone was standing eight feet behind you in the other room and they saw you open

314
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,160
 the closet and they see like a man, like an old man with like chattering his skeletal

315
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,480
 teeth at you and you're just looking at a closet and you're like, "Oh, my closet's

316
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 kind of creepy."

317
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,000
 You shut it, but if someone was standing farther away at the right angle, they could see this

318
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,480
 horrific image.

319
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,560
 You can't defend yourself if you can't see it, right?

320
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
 So anyways, this guy is standing there.

321
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 He doesn't see anything.

322
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,920
 The kids are like, "No, no, it's right in front of you.

323
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,200
 It's right in front of you."

324
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,400
 This would happen at 8 p.m. around 8 p.m. every Sunday night.

325
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
 They would come here.

326
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 They would do their training.

327
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
 "Whoa, they're shrimpin' on the ground doing their shrimpin'.

328
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,000
 I, Jujitsu, starts back up Tuesday for me.

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Can't wait."

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,760
 They're doing their martial arts, but at 8 p.m. they would see this figure kind of poke

331
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
 out around the tree.

332
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,880
 And the more times that they started in July, every time they came, they'd see more of

333
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
 it.

334
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
 So eventually, it was no longer just looking behind the tree.

335
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,400
 At one point, it was just sitting on a rock, watching them.

336
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
 And this is interesting.

337
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,480
 So in the original thing I read you, it's been an hour for me, but for you, it's been

338
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
 five minutes.

339
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,280
 It says that they were wearing black, loose, fitting clothes.

340
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,440
 The people at the scene specifically just said what-- I thought there was a weird description.

341
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
 Loose fitting clothes, baggy jeans, is it a Marky Mark fan?

342
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 It was weird.

343
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,200
 They were wearing geese.

344
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,320
 This little dwarf who was like a shadow, he was completely black.

345
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,960
 His clothes were black, his face was black, his hair was black, it was almost like a silhouette.

346
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,640
 Was wearing martial arts clothes, a little ghee.

347
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,520
 So it was wearing the same clothes they had, but all black.

348
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,720
 So people, they thought that was weird.

349
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:36,960
 Obviously, like if I go out and I'm wearing like a Toucan Sam, I love my Fruit Loops jacket

350
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,480
 and I happen to see a ghost across the street wearing that same jacket, that's ten times

351
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,520
 scarier than if it was dressed as the Victorian ghost.

352
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,320
 But they-- and it said in the original description they weren't afraid.

353
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
 And that's true to a point.

354
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,920
 So when they're seeing this weird little dwarf sitting on this rock wearing a ghee, they know

355
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,040
 that it's paranormal and they felt that it was fairly sinister, but they weren't afraid

356
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,600
 of it yet.

357
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,480
 Because it goes way more in depth than that little paragraph had led on to believe.

358
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,920
 They start to see more of them as the practices go on at 8pm.

359
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,640
 They start to see more of them.

360
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
 Sometimes one would be sitting in the tree, sometimes one would be sitting on a rock,

361
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,240
 sometimes one would be just-- and at this point of thinking maybe it's just shadows,

362
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
 it wouldn't make sense.

363
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,480
 It's 8pm, it's later, the sun's setting, it's playing tricks, there's lights and stuff

364
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 like that.

365
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,800
 And they didn't have all sorts of shadows.

366
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,920
 They said that they don't even see a move, they just see him appear, which you know how

367
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,200
 a shadow tends to work.

368
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,560
 The light is cast differently on a bush and you're like, "Oh my god, that wasn't there."

369
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,440
 An hour ago there was nothing there and now there's a dwarf in the shape of a bush laying

370
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,560
 flat on the ground, oh no.

371
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,900
 But they were seeing these things.

372
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,920
 And Pauline, which I believe is a pseudonym, she said that she started to be able to sense

373
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,400
 before they would be there.

374
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,080
 Like she'd be able to kind of look over and go, "There's going to be one over there and

375
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,720
 she'd look and there'd be a little guy sitting there in his kimono."

376
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
 And they did.

377
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,160
 They went on the rock every so often he'd raise his hand and then he would grow to be

378
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,760
 twice as big.

379
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,840
 He got so big he'd be bigger than the teenager.

380
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,160
 So now there's a giant dwarf and a black kimono standing in the bushes all quite terrifying.

381
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,160
 At one point though, the kids are still trying to mess with these things because they're kids.

382
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
 Trying to figure out what it is.

383
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,640
 Some were probably trying to debunk it, some were trying to show how tough they were.

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,600
 I don't care about no little dwarf.

385
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
 I'll go out there.

386
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,200
 At one point, I thought this story, and this is where things get really weird.

387
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,480
 At one point, one of them, because they'd go into the bushes and mess around trying to

388
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
 find these things.

389
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,880
 As you would, really as you would, I'm not blaming them.

390
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,720
 The guy goes into the bushes.

391
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,000
 I wonder what the instructor was doing during all of this stuff.

392
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,520
 Because you're like, "You want to run a martial arts class.

393
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,680
 You're not running taps.

394
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,520
 You're not a paranormal investigator."

395
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,480
 Eventually they're like, "Come on, let's get back.

396
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
 Start wrestling again."

397
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
 And they're like, "No, let's see what happens."

398
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,000
 So this guy walks into the bushes looking for a dwarf guy.

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,640
 And the people on the terrace are watching this.

400
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,240
 Now the guy who goes into the bushes says, "This is what happened.

401
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,880
 I walked into the bushes and I could feel something really weird and creepy around me.

402
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
 And I left.

403
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,000
 I'm just walking out of the bushes."

404
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,880
 But this is what everyone else saw.

405
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,520
 Again, super trippy.

406
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,400
 Because you basically have two realities in the same reality.

407
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,040
 People are on the terrace watching this happen.

408
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,520
 They see him go into the bushes and they see the little ninja dwarf standing there looking

409
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
 at him.

410
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,160
 And then they both take a stance and they start kung fu fighting in the bushes.

411
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,200
 Their teammate is fighting a ninja dwarf, a ghost dwarf.

412
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
 And before they can really register what they're actually seeing, they're watching one of their

413
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,240
 buddies fight a supernatural creature, a martial art combat, a mortal combat in the bushes.

414
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,520
 They hear what's described as an unnatural scream.

415
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,120
 Everyone runs off the terrace into the house.

416
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,640
 Now I'm sure that guy walked out of the bushes and came in and be like, "Hey, what happened?

417
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,720
 I was just in the bushes and then I come in and you guys are all hiding behind the furniture

418
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,160
 with mops and sharpened broom handles."

419
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,400
 And they're like, "We saw you fight that guy and then we heard that scream when we were

420
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
 afraid something happened.

421
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,000
 So we did the smartest thing.

422
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,080
 We retreated back into the house and did a check on you at all."

423
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,480
 He goes, "No, no, I didn't.

424
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,480
 I think I would know if I fought a dwarf.

425
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,720
 I think that I would remember that, but that's what they saw."

426
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,280
 So now months have passed and this is no longer a, this is a cool little paranormal event.

427
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
 We don't have any fear.

428
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,560
 We're just kind of watching this thing.

429
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,760
 The malevolent dwarves go on the offensive.

430
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,040
 These kids, man, this isn't a place that they're living.

431
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,440
 So it's not, you know, you have haunted house movies where the family's like, "Oh, we lost

432
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,640
 all of our money in the stock market of whatever.

433
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,320
 We got to buy this house and it turns out to be haunted and they're like, "We got to

434
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
 move."

435
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
 And they're like, "We don't have any money to move."

436
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
 Like that's really common.

437
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,040
 And this, they're, they're breaking, they're not supposed to be here, by the way.

438
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,760
 This is an old abandoned mansion.

439
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,320
 I guess there was some people renovating it and there have been like social services

440
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,280
 being used from time to time.

441
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,400
 But at the time it was an old abandoned mansion.

442
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
 They weren't supposed to be there at all.

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,960
 So they're breaking into really a haunted house and they could leave at any time, but

444
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
 it's a perfect place to go do their martial art.

445
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,360
 One day, "Wah, wah, wah!"

446
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,720
 doing the martial arts, the instructor feels it choking around his neck.

447
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,880
 Can't stop it.

448
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,960
 He collapses to the ground, an invisible hand wrapped around his throat.

449
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
 And that's bad enough, right?

450
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,520
 It's bad on a couple different levels.

451
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,560
 And if you are training the martial arts and you know there's ninja dwarves nearby,

452
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,760
 you can always hope that the best of you, i.e. the instructor, will be able to fight

453
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
 them off.

454
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,360
 But apparently not, sneak attack.

455
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,520
 This guy got choked out.

456
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
 So what are your odds?

457
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,360
 Okay, so what are your chances of surviving a fight?

458
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 He then falls to the ground, right?

459
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
 And then begins crawling.

460
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 Ugh.

461
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
 Ugh.

462
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,720
 Now, it says that he crawled to the river and his students had to wrestle him.

463
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,040
 Be like, "No, no, he's like, "No, training's over, training's over!"

464
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,880
 No, no, no, and they're getting him choked.

465
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,040
 He's like, "No, not the chokehold, not the chokehold!"

466
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,600
 But I don't know exactly what they did, but they got him in a figure four.

467
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,240
 The point is that the students who were afraid he was going to crawl into the river and they

468
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,200
 had to hold him back, keep him from drowning himself.

469
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,920
 Now, that story, I do have a question about this.

470
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
 Where did he get choked?

471
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,640
 Because if he's outside by the bushes, they should know better at this point.

472
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,200
 He's outside by the bushes.

473
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,040
 He gets choked, he falls down, he crawls five or six feet, they wrestle him down, keep him

474
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,040
 from going into the river.

475
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,800
 But if they're doing their practice in the house, which is where they've been doing their

476
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,840
 practice as far as the story goes up until this point, the idea of a man getting choked

477
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:05,360
 and then crawling a good 50, 60 yards, unstopped by his team, unstopped by his students just

478
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 being like, "Are you okay?

479
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 Are you okay?"

480
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 He's just crawling, he keeps crawling.

481
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
 They're like, "What should we do?

482
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
 What should we do?"

483
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
 He's just crawling, crawling.

484
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,760
 I mean, like, that would take, think about how long it would take to crawl 50, 60 yards.

485
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,720
 And the whole time they're just like, "Sir, sir, stop it."

486
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,200
 Or, "Sensei, sensei, stop it."

487
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,680
 I hope for the sake of his knees and his hands that this story took place very close to the

488
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
 river.

489
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,680
 But I think they were inside.

490
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,640
 So I think he had quite the journey.

491
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,800
 He stops and takes a break.

492
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,960
 He's like, "Possessed by dwarf.

493
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
 Must kill self.

494
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
 Ugh, my knees.

495
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
 I'm sitting here for a second."

496
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 Students are like, "Are you okay, sensei?

497
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 Are you okay?"

498
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,200
 And he's like, "Just catching my breath until I'm able to kill myself.

499
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 Okay, I'm good again.

500
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 Ah, my knees.

501
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
 Ah, put my knee on a rock.

502
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
 No, no."

503
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
 And they're trying to stop him.

504
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,640
 Anyways, so that was the instructor's story, but they still keep coming.

505
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,840
 That was the first time one of them was assaulted other than the shadow fighting that the other

506
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
 guy didn't know.

507
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,440
 Now they're getting assaulted.

508
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,680
 Pauline herself, and she's cited heavily in the book.

509
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,840
 That's why I keep talking about her.

510
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 One day she's hanging out at the mansion.

511
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,920
 They're doing their attacking stuff.

512
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
 They're doing their martial arts.

513
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,880
 And her boyfriend's there.

514
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,400
 She turns to him.

515
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,720
 "Whoosh, yaw, yaw!"

516
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
 They start crowding fighting.

517
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,920
 "Wah, yaw, pa, pa."

518
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,040
 Which you're like, "Okay, Jason, that's normal, right?

519
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
 That's what we do."

520
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,880
 But no, she was too fierce.

521
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,600
 And eventually like a flurry of blows.

522
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,760
 She's like, "I can't block them all.

523
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
 I can't block them.

524
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
 Punch!

525
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
 Punch!

526
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 Stack, stack, stack!"

527
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,680
 She starts laying in when boyfriend falls in a hump.

528
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
 She's kicking him in the ribs.

529
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,360
 "Bop!

530
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,800
 She's just tearing into this dude."

531
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 Fights over.

532
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,680
 Actually, there was no fight to begin with.

533
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,880
 She just attacks her boyfriend.

534
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,320
 And they're just fighting.

535
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,160
 What makes it seem to be more than just a little bit of puncher's luck is that she's

536
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,240
 beating him up.

537
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,880
 And one of her classmates is like, "Pauline, stop, stop!"

538
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,960
 And he's trying to hold her back.

539
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
 And then she's still going.

540
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,280
 And then someone's like, "Pauline, what are you doing?

541
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
 What are you doing?

542
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
 He's dead.

543
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
 He's already dead."

544
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,400
 And she's still like going.

545
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,320
 And it took four of her teammates.

546
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,240
 Four of her peers to pull her off of her boyfriend.

547
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,880
 And she goes, "I think I was possessed."

548
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,440
 She has a quote around this time.

549
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,960
 She says, "It," referring to whatever the spirit thing is, "it preys on the bad part

550
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,280
 of everyone it comes into contact with.

551
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,840
 Basically, it's taking..."

552
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,440
 Which would make me think it's time to break up.

553
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,040
 Like, if my girlfriend ever beat me up, first off, I'm breaking up with her.

554
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,960
 But secondly, if she then says I was possessed, I'd be like, "Okay, maybe."

555
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,880
 But if she goes and the possession feeds on the bad part of me, then I'd be like, "So

556
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
 you didn't want...

557
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,520
 You wanted to beat me up.

558
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
 You just...

559
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
 You want...

560
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
 That was something inside of you.

561
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,080
 You just couldn't do it because there wasn't a monster dwarf possessing you.

562
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,200
 It fed off something you already wanted to do.

563
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
 I'm out.

564
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 I'm out."

565
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,000
 Now this creature is 100% on the offense.

566
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
 So this one girl, she wakes up.

567
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
 She falls asleep.

568
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,600
 This is straight up some Freddy Krueger stuff.

569
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,120
 She falls asleep on a bench, like a little bench they have set aside.

570
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
 She wakes up.

571
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 There's no one else around.

572
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,680
 And she's completely paralyzed.

573
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,160
 And she sees a black hand disembodied hand just kind of floating above her face.

574
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,480
 And it's getting closer and closer to her.

575
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,040
 And then she finally breaks free and jumps up and runs out of the room and finds her

576
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
 teammates.

577
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,080
 And like, "Oh, the hand is a big guy."

578
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,600
 And then there was another guy who got pushed against the wall.

579
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,120
 Which to be fair, that's getting off lightly.

580
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,480
 And I'm sitting around with my buddies and we're comparing stories.

581
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,120
 And one guy's like, "Yeah, dude, I got choked.

582
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
 I crawled 50 yards.

583
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 Look at my knees.

584
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
 Look how scratched up they are.

585
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,920
 I tried to drown myself.

586
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,120
 Oh, that's nothing.

587
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,200
 I got possessed by a ninja dwarf and beat up my boyfriend.

588
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,000
 Our relationship has not been the same since.

589
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,280
 Honestly, I think he's kind of in it.

590
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,120
 He keeps asking me to do it again.

591
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 Girl's like, "That's nothing.

592
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,520
 I fell asleep.

593
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,240
 Everyone left me alone in a room, asleep of a house we know that's haunted by ninja

594
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
 dwarves."

595
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
 "Sleep paralysis.

596
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,200
 A hand appeared above me.

597
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,720
 Who knows what would have happened?"

598
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,920
 And then another guy goes, "Pfft.

599
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
 That's nothing.

600
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,680
 I got pushed against the wall."

601
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,440
 So yeah, I don't even think that should be in the book.

602
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,280
 That would be like someone saying, "I sprained my ankle while the Titanic sank."

603
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,920
 Like sure, yes, you were there and you have a story to tell, maybe.

604
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
 But come on, dude.

605
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,520
 Like, there's a certain point.

606
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
 That's not...

607
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,280
 I'm sure a lot of people sprained their ankles during the Titanic.

608
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,000
 I don't think it's mentioned in every book about the Titanic.

609
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Save me, Jack.

610
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Save me.

611
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,680
 She's just mildly inconvenienced.

612
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,280
 She has a little bit of swelling.

613
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,800
 So they stopped going to the mansion at this point.

614
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,720
 That the guy getting pushed against the wall, they're like, "That's the last straw.

615
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,000
 Larry, you're the nicest guy who would push you against the wall."

616
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,640
 Everyone else has like black eyes and like busted bones, messed up knees.

617
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,160
 But Larry getting pushed against the wall.

618
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,920
 That is a wall too far.

619
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,800
 So they stopped going to Abney Hall.

620
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 They stopped going to do...

621
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,760
 They went to go do their martial arts elsewhere.

622
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,400
 A place where they...

623
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,000
 Actually, you think about it, that would be a good dojo because not only are you learning

624
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,280
 like technique, you also have to fight your way off the premises each week.

625
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
 That actually is...

626
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,680
 I'm gonna start a dojo like that where you go in and you train and you learn your techniques

627
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
 and then outside.

628
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,280
 There's just a bunch of thugs that push you and harass you all the way to your car.

629
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,240
 And eventually you can take them on.

630
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
 They stopped going though.

631
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,320
 They said it was a combination.

632
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
 This is weird.

633
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,920
 They said it was a combination of the dwarf attacks, of the ninja supernatural dwarf attacks

634
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,040
 and he was getting cold because it was October now.

635
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,320
 The weather had changed.

636
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,120
 I don't think...

637
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
 That's so...

638
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,400
 Someone said, "Hey man, why'd you stop living in Amityville?"

639
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,000
 You're like, "Well, room was a little high.

640
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
 It's kind of drafty."

641
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,120
 And you know, the suicide murder ghost that shot everyone in his family.

642
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,160
 Yeah, just not the best roommate.

643
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,240
 Like that would not...

644
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,280
 You don't have to have any qualifiers before that.

645
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,840
 Just be like, when the person who wrote this book, when Jenny Randalls asked, "Hey, why'd

646
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,840
 you guys stop going to this mansion?"

647
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,440
 They should have just said, "Have you not been paying attention?

648
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,280
 Have you not understood a word I've said?"

649
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,920
 "You little ninja dwarves.

650
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,000
 That's the only reason why no one would ever go anywhere ever again."

651
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,280
 Jenny Randalls ends up hearing about the story.

652
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 She goes to the...

653
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
 It seems like a pretty good book.

654
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,920
 I might actually finish reading it.

655
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,760
 Jenny Randalls and Mindmonsters.

656
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,040
 It's in the show notes as well.

657
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,080
 Jenny Randalls goes to Abney Hall.

658
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
 She looks around.

659
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,200
 She says she's there with an investigator.

660
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,520
 She says it seems kind of creepy, but you know, whatever.

661
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,360
 She ends up though, it's really cool.

662
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
 This is what I liked about it.

663
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,720
 She didn't just say the end.

664
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,240
 She ended up making a bunch of phone calls.

665
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,000
 She ended up making the people who worked to the place before the teenagers got there,

666
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,320
 who worked to the place since they've left, because her book was being written in 1990.

667
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,440
 She's calling up the property owners, calling up people who had worked in the area.

668
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,960
 She did a lot of investigation.

669
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,360
 Her theory, one, I should say this, was that the reason why the dwarves were wearing gays

670
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,680
 is because they were a dark manifestation of the emotions of the martial artists, because

671
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,120
 they were working so hard on keeping their anger in check.

672
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
 They're fighting.

673
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,840
 They're being violent, but it's not about being angry.

674
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,880
 It's about being calm.

675
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,920
 That there was some dark spirit in the area that was picking up the anger that they were

676
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,360
 bottling in.

677
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,960
 That was Jenny Randall's theory, which is an interesting one.

678
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,800
 Her other theory was that it's all made up, which is also always another interesting theory.

679
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,040
 But she did have two notes to talk about.

680
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,600
 One of them was that in November, which happened a month after they stopped going, I guess there

681
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,400
 was a series of, there was a really big trimmer in the area.

682
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,360
 And she learned that when she called up a maintenance crew or a construction crew that

683
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
 was working on renovating the house.

684
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,120
 They said, "Yeah, I know what you're, I know your house, what you're talking about."

685
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,440
 She goes, "Anything odd happened there?"

686
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
 He goes, "Yeah, in November there was an odd trimmer.

687
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,040
 We actually thought it was some sort of underground explosion, some sort of big dig going on,

688
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,400
 but we're construction people.

689
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
 We know what's going on.

690
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,760
 We actually made some phone calls.

691
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,120
 We could never get to the bottom of it."

692
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,120
 And she said that that's a common thing when paranormal events end.

693
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,200
 There's almost like a trimmer or a minor earthquake to signify that the event is gone.

694
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,440
 That's kind of an interesting note.

695
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,960
 She also said that when she talked to the groundskeeper, she goes, "Yeah, if you ever had anything

696
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,080
 weird happen at Abney Hall."

697
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,840
 And the groundskeeper goes, "Listen, man, the only weird thing that I've r-..."

698
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,080
 Because apparently like Agatha Christie's ghost is there or there is a ghost there or

699
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
 something like that.

700
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,960
 The groundskeeper goes, "You want to know the weirdest thing really that's happened recently.

701
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,040
 I'm like a teenager just kept breaking into the mansions, going into the bushes and crotty

702
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,920
 chopping the bushes and I had to run them out.

703
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,240
 I had to keep running them out and I haven't seen them since."

704
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,480
 So I mean, they definitely were there.

705
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,360
 They definitely were mucking about in the bushes, crotty chopping the bushes.

706
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,880
 The groundskeeper had to run them out.

707
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,840
 So that's actually an interesting bit of proof that the story isn't made up.

708
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,400
 That I mean, it would be weird that they got kicked off the property by the groundskeeper

709
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 for crotty chopping bushes.

710
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
 And they said, "You know what?

711
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,400
 I'm going to give him a left-right.

712
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,280
 I'm going to go find a paranormal researcher and tell him that the only reason we were

713
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,960
 crotty chopping those bushes because there were ninja dwarves in there."

714
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,600
 And that'll prove, that'll show him.

715
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
 I don't think so.

716
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,120
 The story is actually probably true.

717
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,560
 The question is, in that sense, I'm not saying they were definitely ghosts there, but it's

718
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,400
 probably true as in the events happened.

719
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:26,840
 I guess the biggest question is, what was in the bushes at Abney Hall?

720
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,640
 A playful spirit that fed too much on the negative energy of a group of teenagers?

721
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,960
 A demonic entity that simply laid in wait until the right victims came by?

722
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,080
 It seems that whatever it is is gone now.

723
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,080
 There's been no reports like that in the area since.

724
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,600
 The earthquake may have signified that the event ended.

725
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,000
 But more troubling is the earthquake may have signified the event simply moved.

726
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,800
 This creature may have been a dark manifestation of these kids' inner thoughts.

727
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:09,200
 So the question is this, if you ever come across this entity, what will it appear as

728
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,360
 to you?

729
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:20,400
 And will you have the strength to defeat the darkest side of your soul?

00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,080
