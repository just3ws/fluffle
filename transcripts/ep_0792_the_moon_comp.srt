1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 Breaking news from the world of conspiracy theories involving the latest updates to the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,380
 Gilaing Maxwell saga.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,440
 Then we meet a young boy who settles down for a nice night of sleep.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,080
 Instead he finds himself in a...

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,080
 situation?

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
 Some sort of situation, obviously, right?

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
 There has to be some sort of conflict.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,800
 And then we travel to the moon to meet a little Chinese lunar rover that has recently

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,960
 spotted a object in the distance.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
 Is it a pile of rocks?

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,060
 Is it an alien base?

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,400
 Or is it proof that Jesus Christ never existed?

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:55,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
 I'm having a great day.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,280
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,160
 We're wrapping up season 16.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,080
 We got two more weeks of episodes and I'm taking two weeks off and right now we're debating

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,880
 a Christmas livestream special that's up in the air.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,360
 But I'll keep you guys informed of that.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,280
 I won't let you guys know at midnight on Christmas Eve.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,160
 I'm like, "Join me now!"

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,800
 But someone who can join me right now, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,040
 on your feet, give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, Burb.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,120
 Everyone give a big round of applause to Burb walking on in.

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,600
 He's like a bird.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,160
 Favorite movie is The Burbs.

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,600
 If you guys get to where the Patreon, that's fine too.

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,120
 Just helps her out the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,040
 Now, Burb, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,800
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,440
 Let's start our journey by headed out to London.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,680
 Burb is driving us on out there and it's nice and sunny in London.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,640
 There's like birds flying through the sky and trees are there.

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,160
 We're out there for the wildlife.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,880
 This isn't a nature podcast.

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
 But we're like, "Get out of our way trees, get out of our way birds."

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,360
 We're headed straight towards the HMP Belmarsh, which is a prison.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
 What does that stand for?

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
 Her Majesty's Prison?

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,640
 Because I know she's on a bunch of boats too, right?

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,360
 But anyway, so the reason why we're here, they're holding a trial right now and we're

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,160
 like, "Get out of our way, Baylips.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
 Get out of our way, guards.

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
 We're on front seat.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,680
 We're sitting on the judge's lap."

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,800
 We're like, "These are the best seats ever."

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,680
 Getting popcorn everywhere.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,560
 The reason why we're here was so Julian Assange.

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,880
 Julian Assange is, I'm going to try to boil the entire saga down.

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,720
 I spend more time telling those jokes than I want to do.

54
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 Give me the backlog into Julian Assange's story.

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,120
 Julian Assange started the website, the group WikiLeaks, which is dedicated to transparency

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,680
 in government.

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,120
 And so because of that, a lot of people steal documents and give them to him because they

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,080
 see something going wrong in an organization.

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,320
 They want to expose it.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
 He's made a lot of enemies.

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,240
 He's made a ton of very powerful enemies over the years, obviously, right?

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,920
 Someone stealing your documents, you're like, "Oh no, the Kellogg's account.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
 We need that."

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
 Actually, it's not even stuff like that.

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
 It's not even just basic business mergers.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,160
 It's like videos.

67
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,360
 There's a very famous video going around the internet for a long time.

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
 It's all out there of the Apache helicopter opening fire on a crowd in Iraq.

69
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,680
 It was just like 30, 40 people milling about and just hoping to fire on him.

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,440
 And then it targeted some journalists and killed them as well.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
 It was a massacre.

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
 It was a massacre.

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,080
 So a video like that was super embarrassing for the United States.

74
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,880
 Back in 2012, when the US authorities were looking for him, he ran into the Ecuadorian

75
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,800
 Embassy in London and asked for asylum.

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,320
 And for the next seven years, he was like posting TikToks and stuff like that, being

77
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,600
 like, "Just doing dances, doing dances."

78
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,120
 And he would do media updates.

79
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 He'd do media updates.

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,560
 "I'm still here, guys, and we're still fighting for transparency."

81
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
 What happened behind the scenes?

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,960
 I think we covered this on a really early episode of Dead Arab Radio.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,720
 If we didn't, that was my mistake, because I thought it was hilarious.

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,520
 What happened about a year or two ago was that the Ecuadorian Embassy kicked out Julian

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
 Assange?

86
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
 They're like, "We're done.

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,000
 You've been here for seven years."

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,720
 And people were like, "Whoa, like is it because the... who was in charge that time?

89
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,480
 I think it was because Trump was leaning on Ecuador."

90
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,040
 Multiple presidents have tried coming after this guy, Bush, Obama, Trump.

91
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,280
 And I'm assuming Biden.

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,680
 I guess so, because they just won an extradition.

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,960
 He's being moved back to the United States, but he was in the Ecuadorian Embassy for

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,080
 seven years and reports came out that his room was super messy.

95
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,280
 And he was just kind of annoying the staff, because you're trying to run an embassy and

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,560
 there's a man living there.

97
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,520
 A very, very high-profile man living in like your former office.

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,800
 So now you're in the closet and you're like, "Ugh."

99
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,600
 Apparently he was skateboarding down the halls.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 Like super...

101
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,360
 I mean, there has to be security footage of this.

102
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,600
 I don't know why they have not released this as a found footage movie at this time.

103
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 So Ecuadorian...

104
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
 They did kick him out.

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,520
 They said it just was untenable.

106
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
 And he goes, "No, no, it's because of my politics."

107
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,400
 And they're probably rolling their eyes as they're like calling in all these maids to

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
 clean up his bedroom.

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,440
 They're like, "You're disgusting, dude.

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,240
 And you look at all these skateboard marks everywhere.

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,960
 How did you get them on the ceiling?"

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,600
 I was grinding.

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,840
 So after that, he didn't want to go to America, so he went to a prison in London.

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
 And he's been there for the past couple years, the past two years.

115
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,880
 Well, all of that stuff is the United States wants this dude for leaking those documents.

116
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,400
 And they want him so bad, they've been fighting this for...

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
 The people who stole the documents for him have already done their time and been pardoned.

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,760
 And he's still looking at some super serious charges.

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,560
 The reason why we're talking about this is obviously he does have tons of secrets.

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,760
 And there's always been talk of him having a dead man switch, which is what it sounds

121
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
 like.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,960
 You've got a dump that is sitting with a little timer on it.

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,120
 And every, say, once a week or once a day, depending on how paranoid you are, if you

124
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,400
 don't enter an access key or do some sort of movement, whether it be a phone call or

125
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,920
 whatever on the computer or telegraph or carrier pigeon, the dead man switch activates and

126
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,480
 all that information gets leaked.

127
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,680
 It basically is to guarantee that you stay alive.

128
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,600
 But anyway, so people know that he has something like that out there.

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,440
 That's, I think, that would be logical.

130
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,480
 Julian Assange was recently told, like there was a court hearing.

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,520
 There was a court hearing via video back in October, 2021.

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,960
 Julian Assange was told, "You will be extradited to the United States."

133
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,680
 I'm going to tell you this right now, son.

134
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
 The prison's in the United States.

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
 There are no Ecuadorian embassies.

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,520
 And he's like, "No!"

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,040
 Actually what really happened when this is why we're recovering this segment is the

138
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,080
 judge says, "Listen, you've lost your extradition hearing.

139
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,040
 You will be extradited to the United States."

140
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,320
 And Julian Assange, on video, has a stroke.

141
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,200
 This information is just coming out.

142
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,720
 I just saw this today on December 12th in the New York Post.

143
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,000
 He had a stroke during the live feed.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And he's okay.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,080
 He just had that footage to the found footage movie.

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 He's okay.

147
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,240
 He has a drooping right eyelid.

148
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
 And he has some cognitive difficulties.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,640
 So here's the thing you got when I saw that article.

150
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,120
 I was like, "Okay, this is interesting because one, that sucks, right, to have stroke.

151
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,280
 Two, what are the...?"

152
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,800
 I get that he's stressed about, "Listen, man, prisons in the United States, it depends

153
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,640
 on what prison you end up in, but I'm not going to say anything about California prisons,

154
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,400
 but prisons in the United States, they're really not as bad as they make it out to be.

155
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,120
 Texas is not a documentary, Oz's hyper-realistic, stylized show.

156
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,480
 It's not that bad.

157
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,240
 It's not so bad that if someone told me that I was going to go to prison that I'd have

158
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,520
 a stroke, I'd be like, "Ah, it's going to suck, right?

159
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
 I'm going to go in."

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,160
 I mean, I guess it's really easy for me to say that as I'm sitting in my closet and

161
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,480
 I'm within walking distance of a coffee shop, and I'm probably going to hit up after I'm

162
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 done recording these episodes.

163
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,960
 I'm like, "Oh, I can do 30 years in prison."

164
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,640
 They always say once you hear that door shut for the first time, it totally messes with

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
 your head.

166
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,840
 But I don't know if I'd have a stroke.

167
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,760
 Now again, Julian Assange, he's older than me.

168
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,520
 He's a pro skater, so his veins may be more worn out from wiggling around, trying to keep

169
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,760
 balance on the skateboard.

170
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,960
 But I think it's this.

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,440
 I think that my two theories, put on our conspiracy capture this one.

172
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,720
 One, he is faking...

173
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,320
 Jason, I don't know what world you live in, but it's quite hard to fake a stroke.

174
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 Maybe...

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,560
 Maybe it's a little bit of scotch tape, a little bit of scotch tape to make it look

176
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
 like his eye was drooping.

177
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,160
 I think, because he can just, no matter what now, he goes, "Oh, I have cognitive difficulties.

178
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,840
 I can't answer your questions.

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
 I don't know what it's going on.

180
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
 I don't know what's going on."

181
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,000
 I don't think he's now like a drooling idiot.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 He is still walking around.

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,160
 He's in good health.

184
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,400
 So that might be kind of hard to sell, but my theory is this.

185
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,080
 I'm thinking one, he's faking it so he can kind of say, "I don't remember what I did

186
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
 all those years."

187
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,160
 The other two are trying to get money for all the skateboarding injuries he caused.

188
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
 He's like, "What?

189
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
 I don't remember.

190
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
 I can't even move a skateboard."

191
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,760
 Look at my eye.

192
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,920
 My theory is this.

193
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,000
 This was a warning to the people who want him.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,480
 Like whether or not he physically had a stroke, the thing was is that he could have been a

195
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,280
 physical stroke, but that was a warning saying, "Listen guys, you don't understand when I die.

196
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,040
 All these documents are going to get released and you're going to put me in some like horror

197
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,680
 hardcore federal prison?

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 You guys are dumb."

199
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,920
 I think that this was a warning to them.

200
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,720
 I don't honestly think that it's real, but again, I don't know.

201
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,400
 I haven't seen Julian Assange lately.

202
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 The last couple of times we saw him, we thought it was a hologram.

203
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,160
 They're like the videos who are always weird with him.

204
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,040
 So I think this was a warning.

205
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
 I'm on death's door.

206
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
 If you keep pushing this, I'm going to release these documents, but at this point, I think

207
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
 a lot of the documents he has access to, I don't know how relevant they are to the people

208
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,720
 in power, and I'm not talking about the president, I'm always talking about the deep state, the

209
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
 power behind the power.

210
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,640
 A lot of those people have probably left by now.

211
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,920
 I mean, those documents were from like 2005.

212
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,760
 So the new group of people may be like, "I don't care if those documents get released.

213
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,920
 I just don't like leakers.

214
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,160
 I just don't like spies."

215
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,800
 So who cares if there's a day to drop it?

216
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,160
 It'll embarrass the past two administrations who were past it.

217
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,360
 So I think that the dead man switch has been compromised.

218
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,480
 I think that this was a warning to the people he has information on that I could die at any

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,760
 moment, and I don't think a lot of them care.

220
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,720
 And he will get extradited to the United States, which is interesting.

221
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,240
 He should have stopped pulling those 720 olleys in the Ecuadorian embassy.

222
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,920
 They would have kept them there for much longer.

223
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,000
 But who knows?

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,840
 I am not a legal genius, but we got a lot of breaking news.

225
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,960
 This is actually, I woke up to this, "Burb keep driving the Jason Jalopy.

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,480
 We're headed out to Manchester by the sea in Massachusetts."

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
 I think this is the first for this show.

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,720
 I don't think we've ever been to such a Tony neighborhood.

229
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,000
 So we all know about the Ghislaine Maxwell trial that's going on right now.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,840
 I think any conspiracy theorist worth their salt at least knows the name.

231
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,960
 Ghislaine Maxwell, a legion accomplice to Jeffrey Epstein, known and convicted.

232
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,720
 Child trafficker, he was convicted, and then when they arrested him again, he mysteriously

233
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
 died in jail.

234
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
 I've done some really good episodes.

235
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,040
 I think one of my best episodes is the episode about Jeffrey Epstein trying to create the

236
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
 AI dimension.

237
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
 I'm going to put that on the show notes.

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
 That's one of my favorite episodes.

239
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,720
 We did a lot of research on that and found Jeffrey Epstein's blog.

240
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 It's dope.

241
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
 It's a cool...

242
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
 I really like that it was so...

243
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,920
 Anyway, so Ghislaine Maxwell, she's on trial right now.

244
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:44,640
 Jeffrey Epstein died, killed himself, officially murdered, is the most common theory, and

245
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
 Ghislaine Maxwell is on trial.

246
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,200
 So she helped procure girls for him is basically a thing.

247
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,760
 My guess, my read on this trial, and I've only seen a couple articles on it and I haven't

248
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,280
 followed it closely, but I'm just going to...

249
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 I know how this type of stuff works generally.

250
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,440
 I think a lot of people know that she's being tried.

251
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
 She did commit these...

252
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,120
 Well, I have to say allegedly, but I think she did commit these crimes, but she's also

253
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,640
 being tried because Jeffrey Epstein died.

254
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,960
 They needed somebody.

255
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
 They needed somebody.

256
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,600
 So I think it's a trial of embarrassment, but there's new breaking news.

257
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,880
 I do think she should be tried, but I think she's so powerful, I think, in another alternate

258
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,160
 universe where Jeffrey Epstein was still alive, she walked.

259
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,440
 Because they could have rested her at the same time.

260
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,280
 She was free until about a year after he died, and then they filed charges against her.

261
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,600
 Anyways, new breaking news on the Ghislaine Maxwell saga.

262
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,320
 Her husband, her husband, Scott Borgerson.

263
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,880
 Breaking news in this case.

264
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,840
 Guys, get ready for this.

265
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,520
 The reason why we're at Manchester by the sea is we're about to meet Scott Borgerson's

266
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,760
 new girlfriend.

267
00:12:52,760 --> 00:13:00,120
 His new girlfriend, Chris McGinn, who's described by the New York Post as a local writer (this

268
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,520
 is an actual quote by the way, this is an actual quote by the way) is a local writer,

269
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,560
 mother of two high school children, and yoga enthusiast who has an ass that could crack

270
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,520
 open a walnut according to one local admirer.

271
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,200
 I immediately spent 10 minutes trying to see if I could find a photo of this one.

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,840
 She's a very attractive woman.

273
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,920
 Very attractive woman.

274
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,640
 But I need to see...

275
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,960
 That's a supernatural claim.

276
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
 This is a paranormal show.

277
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,680
 I can cover this.

278
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,000
 And it's conspiracy because Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 How is that?

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
 I get that it's a turn of phrase.

281
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,280
 I get that she probably...

282
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
 She can't do that, right?

283
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,320
 Because if she can do that, that's the found footage movie I want to watch.

284
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,640
 Crack open a walnut with your butt cheeks.

285
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,040
 We have New York Post.

286
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,080
 If you're going to make a claim like that in the third or fourth paragraph of your article,

287
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,920
 that is an actual quote, you gotta have a photo of her in yoga pants.

288
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,000
 Instead they have some TMZ style photos of her carrying coffee to her car.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,520
 None of them of her dropping a bunch of walnuts and she's like "Oh no!"

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,440
 And then we see her like squatting to pick one up as she's looking straight at the camera.

291
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,720
 New York Post, you have failed at your journalistic duty.

292
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,160
 You cannot make a claim like that.

293
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,840
 There's a lot of lovely photos of this woman wearing sweaters and standing at gallows.

294
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 But there are none.

295
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
 There are no photos that exist.

296
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
 This is lost media now.

297
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,040
 There are no photos of Chris McGinn.

298
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
 I'm not asking.

299
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,880
 There's some guy in Manchester by the sea right now getting his cameras together.

300
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,360
 He's like "Jason wants a creep shot.

301
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,160
 I'll give him a creep shot."

302
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,120
 I'm not saying go out and stalk this woman.

303
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,600
 I'm not saying that by any measure at all.

304
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,920
 I do find it odd that the New York Post is randomly asking people in Manchester by the

305
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,960
 sea if they know Chris McGinn.

306
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,440
 And one of the people says she hasn't asked that could crack a walnut.

307
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,360
 I mean, if one random person thinks that out of a sample then you know there's hundreds

308
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
 of people in town.

309
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,800
 Maybe thousands who think the same thing.

310
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
 So come on New York Post, do your job.

311
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
 And Chris McGinn.

312
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,800
 You know this thing, Scott doesn't work out and you're looking to move to Oregon.

313
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 You know where I'm at.

314
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 You can always hit me up.

315
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,120
 You can just hang out in my PO box or something like that or email me.

316
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
 It'll be easier.

317
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,480
 We're going to arrange a date.

318
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,080
 Because that's a supernatural claim I would like to test.

319
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,800
 I will bring the walnuts.

320
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,880
 You bring your lovely self.

321
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,080
 And we will talk about everything but the G. Lane Maxwell trial which is pretty much

322
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,680
 what I did in this segment too.

323
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,400
 Burb, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

324
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,680
 We are leaving behind Manchester by the sea.

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,640
 I'm waving goodbye to Chris McGinn.

326
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
 She's waving back.

327
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,440
 I pulled a bunch of walnuts out of both my pockets.

328
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
 I'm like it was a fun date.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,480
 Fly us up and away out of Manchester by the sea.

330
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,240
 We're headed all the way out to a family cottage.

331
00:15:51,240 --> 00:16:01,880
 It's summertime and there's this little family cottage out in nature.

332
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,000
 Trees rustling through the wind.

333
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,800
 And ow in one of those trees.

334
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
 Flies away.

335
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,240
 That was the sound of the wings.

336
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,760
 And inside the cottage there's an 11 year old boy.

337
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
 We're going to call him Doug.

338
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,440
 We're going to call him Doug.

339
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
 And Doug is this 11 year old boy.

340
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,880
 He's just wearing his PJs and his little underwear.

341
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,640
 And he's rolling around in bed.

342
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,680
 And he's like, "Oh, this sucks.

343
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,560
 I'm trying to get some sleep but I just can't get comfortable in this bed."

344
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,560
 We all know that feeling.

345
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:43,880
 And then at one point he wakes up and he realizes, "Uhhh, this bed is a little more than just

346
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
 uncomfortable.

347
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,760
 I'm pretty sure it's transmuted into another substance."

348
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,600
 And he wakes up and he realizes very quickly, all these things kind of pop in his head.

349
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,440
 He's outside.

350
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,360
 He's naked.

351
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,440
 And he's laying on a giant flat slab of rock.

352
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:10,800
 The night wind whipping around his body.

353
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,040
 Some pervert owl.

354
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
 He turns to his ranch.

355
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
 "Ooo, ooo."

356
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,080
 He's frozen in fear.

357
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,320
 He can't even move.

358
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,280
 He can't even move.

359
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,840
 And he goes to scream.

360
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,520
 His mouth opens wide but no sound comes out.

361
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,720
 Nothing comes out.

362
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,280
 He looks into the distance and sees the cottage maybe a hundred feet away.

363
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,440
 And for the first moment in this bizarre attack of images and feelings, there's a little bit

364
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 of safety.

365
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,800
 He closes his eyes.

366
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,720
 He looks back up of the cottage and now he's able to move.

367
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,480
 And Doug jumps up.

368
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,120
 He can't, he's shocked by this whole chain of events.

369
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,560
 He said the slab of rock reminded him of something that you would sacrifice a human to a god

370
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 on.

371
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,320
 And here he is in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness, surrounded by trees.

372
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,920
 He's even one eye on that owl as he slowly makes his way back to the cottage.

373
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,280
 He can see it.

374
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
 He can look.

375
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,960
 He says the cottage is maybe like a hundred feet away.

376
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,760
 And as he's walking to the cottage, he realizes when his bare feet touch the ground, he can

377
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,440
 feel the coldness of the soil.

378
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:38,600
 So the rest of his body, totally warm, as if the elements were unable to affect him.

379
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
 He gets into the cabin.

380
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
 He has to climb in through a window because the door is locked.

381
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,240
 And then he crawls into bed and he is praying nothing followed him back.

382
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,080
 He doesn't really know what to do.

383
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,520
 How do you explain any of that?

384
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 And so he doesn't.

385
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
 He doesn't tell anyone.

386
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,960
 And the next morning he wakes up, he just gets stressed.

387
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,200
 He goes out to have breakfast and just try to ignore the fact that he woke up a hundred

388
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,000
 feet away on this slab of rock totally naked.

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,880
 But later that day, he hears his older brother yelling outside, "Hey, Ma!

390
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
 Hey, everyone!

391
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
 Come on down!

392
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,560
 Come on down to the old God-sacrifice and rock!"

393
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,800
 The family comes down there and there's the older brother and he's pointing up and Doug

394
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:22,960
 said on the top of the trees, the tall ancient trees that surrounded this rock, hanging from

395
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
 a branch.

396
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,600
 My pajamas.

397
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,200
 So I'm assuming he told the story at that point and he goes to this day, "I don't know.

398
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
 I can't explain it.

399
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
 I have no idea what happened.

400
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,440
 I definitely didn't do it."

401
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,200
 He goes, all my family said they didn't do it.

402
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,880
 It wasn't some prank they were pulling.

403
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,920
 They're like, "Hey, let's put something in our kids' drink and it'll pass out.

404
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
 It'll be hilarious!"

405
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,800
 Well, cart his body to this rock.

406
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
 They had no idea what it was either.

407
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,920
 So an interesting, spooky story that was posted online.

408
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
 I found it by, what do I know?

409
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,240
 That was the name of the user.

410
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,680
 What do I know?

411
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:03,600
 But in the way that this show works sometimes, we get two stories that kind of show up at

412
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
 the same moment.

413
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,120
 I'm researching so much stuff and this sea very so often it shakes out stories that

414
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,760
 are very similar to each other.

415
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,960
 So it gives us something we can compare and contrast.

416
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,080
 "Burb, we're going to go ahead and we're going to call in the dead rabbit rocket ship.

417
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,680
 It's time to leave Earth's orbit."

418
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,560
 We're headed to the moon.

419
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:36,280
 I recently got this story sent to me by Cabot Cove Balloon Friends, a long time supporter

420
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
 of the show.

421
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,800
 It does a lot of art for us as well.

422
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,160
 Really, really, really appreciate all that stuff.

423
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,280
 The reason why we're on the moon is right now there's a little rover on the moon from

424
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
 China.

425
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,640
 It's like a little remote control thing, a little remote control RC car on the moon.

426
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,120
 The Chinese lunar rover is called the U2-2 or its nickname is the Jade Rabbit.

427
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,880
 And this little Jade Rabbit lunar rover is driving around and it shows in the distance.

428
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,200
 The photos will be in the show notes so they're pretty popular.

429
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,400
 You guys probably heard about this before but there's a little structure in the distance.

430
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,560
 Are you like, "No, Jason, I haven't heard any of this stuff.

431
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,760
 There's a building on the moon.

432
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,280
 Why are you so blasé about stuff?"

433
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
 I don't know either.

434
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,240
 I don't know either sometimes.

435
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,280
 I'm going on about a woman who's asking Crack a Wall and then I was like, "Oh, there's a

436
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
 building on the moon."

437
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,200
 Anyways, next story.

438
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,520
 This lunar rover, Jade Rabbit, has picked up this rectangle on the horizon of the moon.

439
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,080
 And this is so interesting.

440
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,280
 And Cabot Cove, thank you for sending this over.

441
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,520
 I find this so fascinating because it looks like a...

442
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,600
 Imagine how tall a building would have to be if you saw it on the horizon of the planet

443
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
 Earth.

444
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,640
 Or even just as far as your vision could see, you would see a tall rectangular building.

445
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,320
 You'd be like, "Dude, if that is visible in any way, shape, or form from where I'm standing,

446
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,920
 it must be massive."

447
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,520
 And so these photos have gone up and people have started talking, "What is this?

448
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
 Is it a building?

449
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,920
 Is it an alien base?

450
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
 Is it a rock structure?

451
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
 Who knows?"

452
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,520
 No, obviously scientists are saying rock structure, conspiracy theorists alien, people

453
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 are saying base.

454
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,840
 Everyone else is kind of taking a wait or see.

455
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,040
 Or what are you talking about?

456
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,880
 I have no idea what you're talking about.

457
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,240
 And I'm reading and I was like, "Oh, this is fascinating.

458
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,240
 Let's see them do this."

459
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,920
 And then at the bottom of the article, after you're reading it, it says, "It's going to

460
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,880
 take the lunar rover two to three months to get there."

461
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,400
 I was like, "That...

462
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,920
 Okay, how could something natural be that big and never have been discovered?"

463
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,320
 Because the Chinese are interested in this.

464
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,360
 When they saw it, they had to go stop, or turn in the rover and we're going to start

465
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,920
 going to find out what this is.

466
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:55,000
 This isn't something like a mark on Mars where some people say it's an alien microphone

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,320
 and other people say, "No, it's just a rock."

468
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,000
 The Chinese are like, "We're actually going there.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,880
 We don't think it's a trick of the light."

470
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,400
 It's going to take them two to three months to get there.

471
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,080
 And I was like, "Wow, this thing has to be huge.

472
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
 How are they even letting this information out?

473
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,960
 This is proof that there's life on the moon."

474
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,080
 And then after that, it says, "It takes two to three months to get there."

475
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:24,600
 And then it says, "The object is only 262 feet away."

476
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,960
 You think that should be in the very...

477
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
 I mean, I get it.

478
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,560
 The New York Post is where I read a lot of articles and they do get sensational.

479
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
 And I get it.

480
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,840
 Like, if that's in the beginning, then you obviously know it's not that big.

481
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,560
 It still could be a tiny little high, right?

482
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,920
 It could be Yoda's.

483
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
 We don't know.

484
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
 We won't know until we get there.

485
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,440
 I think it's awesome that the Chinese government is actually checking it out because NASA has

486
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,800
 a history of, like, there's, like, this ship flying, it's landing on Mars and a bunch of

487
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,680
 people are getting off and they're like, "Oops, our rover broke.

488
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 Sorry, guys.

489
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
 No more footage."

490
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,600
 They do not check out stuff.

491
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,280
 The reason why it's going to take three months is because this isn't like an RC car.

492
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,640
 And if it was like an RC car, which I think we've all played with at one point in our

493
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,520
 life, within five minutes of anyone playing with an RC car, it's on its back, right?

494
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,720
 Unless you're really good at it, you're always making hit walls.

495
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,920
 And that would happen up here.

496
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,960
 So they have to, like, it goes, it can go up to 0.112 miles per hour, this rover, but

497
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,560
 they never go it that fast.

498
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,880
 It has to drive a bit, take a picture, they run a 3D model, and then they go, "Okay, turn

499
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
 two centimeters."

500
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,640
 And it can't drive at night.

501
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,760
 And night, you're like, "Oh, that's not bad.

502
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
 There's only 12 hours now.

503
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,400
 Night on the moon is 14 Earth days."

504
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,480
 So for 14 Earth days, it just can't move at all.

505
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 It's too cold.

506
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,840
 So fascinating science stuff.

507
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,000
 And the question is, what is that an artificial thing?

508
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,840
 Let's take another look at a story very similar to Doug's story, very similar to Doug's story.

509
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,680
 And I message Doug and I go, "Hey, here's this story, and maybe this happened to you.

510
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,120
 Maybe it wasn't just you waking up in the middle of the night naked."

511
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
 Yeah, what happened to that kid?

512
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
 Was that ghosts?

513
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
 It's weird.

514
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,240
 But anyways, on July 3rd, 1951 in Ucaia, which is in California, there's a car that's

515
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
 a Catholic school camp.

516
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,320
 It's 3 a.m. at this Catholic school camp, and there's a young kid sleeping.

517
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,480
 We're just going to call him Martin.

518
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,000
 He's sleeping in his bed.

519
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,280
 He's not having the best night's sleep.

520
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,160
 He didn't have the best day, actually.

521
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,520
 You think you're going to go to Catholic school camp to read Bibles and stuff like that?

522
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
 But he cut his foot somehow.

523
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,840
 I don't know how that happened.

524
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,640
 The teachers are like, "Now we're going to reenact the crucifixion.

525
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 Any volunteers?"

526
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,600
 He's like, "Ah."

527
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,160
 So anyways, he has a cut on his foot, and he's sleeping in bed.

528
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:41,080
 And he notices, like his eyes are closed, he's being roused out of sleep, he sees a

529
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,360
 blue-green glow.

530
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,680
 Like you know, even though his eyelids are closed, it's such a powerful light, he can

531
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,200
 see it through his closed eyes.

532
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,160
 And he opens them.

533
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,480
 He's laying on a cement slab.

534
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,040
 No joke, these stories are not related in any way.

535
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,880
 He's laying on a cement slab.

536
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,840
 Like you know, this one's a little less evocative, a little less cthulian.

537
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,320
 But you know how you have picnic tables and then you have the concrete slabs where like

538
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
 the barbecue pits are set up?

539
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
 He was on one of those.

540
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,120
 He wasn't on a sacrificial rock.

541
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,640
 He was laying on one of those and he looks up and he says, "I don't know, maybe 70, 80

542
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,240
 feet above me, I see this large disc."

543
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,480
 And underneath it, it's emitting a bluish-green glow.

544
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,320
 And then shoots up into the night sky.

545
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,920
 He said the UFO was about a city block wide.

546
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,760
 Like this is a massive mothership type object.

547
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,200
 But now what does he do, right?

548
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 It's spooky, but he's all alone in the middle of this wilderness.

549
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,000
 He gets up and he's quite a distance from the cabins, but you know, still in the campground.

550
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,040
 He's at the picnic spot.

551
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,040
 So he walks back to the cabin.

552
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,360
 He hovers back to the cabin and he makes a ton of noise.

553
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,440
 He's totally freaked out by it.

554
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,360
 It's not like the first kid who sneaks in through the window, Doug.

555
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,800
 He's like, "Hey everyone, I got a crazy story.

556
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
 UFO just abducted me."

557
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,520
 And the cab counselors don't believe him and the kids are like, "Oh yeah, that's pretty

558
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 cool."

559
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,520
 And they're like poking his foot for evidence or like, "Maybe they put something in here.

560
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 Maybe it's an implant."

561
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
 No, you numbschool!

562
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,120
 Anyways.

563
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,760
 So he just get his counselors like, "Just go back to your room.

564
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
 Go back to your room.

565
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,040
 You got twigs and stuff in your cut-up foot.

566
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,160
 Don't sue."

567
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,160
 And he didn't get abducted by a UFO.

568
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,720
 Soon after these events, his memory returns.

569
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,760
 He actually does remember that this wasn't just him in bed and then him waking up, that

570
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 there was something that happened in between.

571
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,000
 Martin is greeted by a female entity, as it's described.

572
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,480
 He's short, humanoid, with a large head and huge, shiny, cat-like eyes.

573
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,040
 They're pitch black, jet black eyes, set over dull white skin.

574
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,400
 By that description, it's a little more human than a grey alien.

575
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,960
 That almost sounds like a hybrid, I would say.

576
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,120
 It has some of the features of a grey alien, but it has enough human qualities that I would

577
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,240
 specify this as a hybrid.

578
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,720
 And we do the typical thing where they speak via telepathy.

579
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
 This alien gives her name as Nain.

580
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,160
 Nain tells Martin that she is the leader of the security force for her entire planet.

581
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,920
 So this woman's pretty high up there.

582
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,720
 And now that I think about it, I wonder if aliens brag.

583
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,120
 Like, that doesn't sound right.

584
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
 Right?

585
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,200
 I'm not saying that she couldn't do the job.

586
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,080
 She probably could, maybe.

587
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
 But what's she doing?

588
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,200
 What's she doing walking around a Catholic schoolboy summer camp?

589
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,920
 She says, "I'm like the security detail for my entire planet.

590
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,680
 I'm in charge of everything."

591
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,800
 And as she's telling him this story, he realizes he looks around and he is no longer in the

592
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 cabin.

593
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,720
 He's no longer on Earth.

594
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,680
 She's standing on the ashes of a planet.

595
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,640
 She's just kind of walking around, continuing to talk.

596
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,720
 And he's trying to pay attention, but he's also floating a couple inches off the ground.

597
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,200
 And she explains to him, "Yeah, if you touch the soil, it's not going to work out well

598
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 for you.

599
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,000
 This place has suffered a lot of damage.

600
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,040
 It's not good for humans to be here."

601
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,440
 And she's kind of like kicking rocks around.

602
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,440
 Stuff like that stepping on skulls.

603
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,080
 So just float there for a bit while I tell you this story.

604
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,880
 She goes, "Once this place held a great civilization."

605
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,520
 And then the wars erupted.

606
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,680
 Great wars, mighty wars.

607
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:51,320
 And the weapons became so powerful they reduced every building to rubble, every life form

608
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,640
 to ash.

609
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,140
 They left massive craters in the ground.

610
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,520
 Some of them are so big, you can see them from Earth.

611
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
 Martin goes, "Huh?"

612
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,080
 And then he was paying attention.

613
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,520
 He was thinking if that girl could crack, wall nuts with her ass.

614
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,040
 The camera pulls back.

615
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 And we're on the moon, bro!

616
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,760
 We're on the moon!

617
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
 Twist ending.

618
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
 And it's not the ending though.

619
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,080
 Don't shed it off yet.

620
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,360
 She goes on to say that in her galactic corner, this isn't her planet, but where she comes

621
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,760
 from the moon is known as the place of ashes.

622
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,800
 Because this great war completely demolished the entire planet.

623
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,960
 The moon, whatever you want to call it, right?

624
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,480
 And so she says, she goes, "This was just like this thriving civilization that fell

625
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
 apart now."

626
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,400
 She explains that the galaxy is almost like a highway system in the United States.

627
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,800
 We have highways that are connecting everything, but some highways are more used than others.

628
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,480
 Some are more efficient to get around.

629
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,680
 And I guess the assumption from that is that we, maybe when the moon was in full swing

630
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,160
 when it was the hippest place to be, and Pluto Nash, Pluto Nash is walking around with his

631
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,240
 guys coming up with another scheme, there was a lot of traffic through the area.

632
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,040
 It would basically be the Las Vegas of this quadrant.

633
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,160
 And we were the Reno, Nevada.

634
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
 No one wants to be there.

635
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
 No one wants to live there.

636
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 But it was there.

637
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,400
 You couldn't do anything about it.

638
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,960
 And so, but once Las Vegas fell, definitely no one wanted to go to Reno.

639
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,400
 So now it's just the occasional ship coming by.

640
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,240
 And she goes on to tell about these stories about other alien life and how it's like out

641
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
 there.

642
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,000
 And this conversation always comes up with aliens.

643
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 This again is part of the lore, because this would be, I would ask an alien this.

644
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 What about religion?

645
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,440
 What about the story of Jesus Christ?

646
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
 How do these things play?

647
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,340
 Because you figure we do have a very limited knowledge of our own planet.

648
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,320
 So if you had outside observers, they could give you more information.

649
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,960
 And when Martin is talking about this, Nain just kind of looks at Martin and goes, "Jesus?

650
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,680
 Are you the story of that guy Jesus Christ?"

651
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,480
 Yeah, no, that's not real.

652
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,680
 Martin Martin's just floating on the moon.

653
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,840
 He's at a Catholic school game.

654
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
 He's like, "Uh..."

655
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,280
 She's like, "No, that's not real."

656
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,680
 That was a story that the elite in the world of your planet came up with.

657
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,480
 It came up with it a long time ago, because it was a way to keep you guys enslaved.

658
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,760
 Because he does it.

659
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,520
 He never existed.

660
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,800
 And she does the whole thing.

661
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,640
 And then she pulls out a clothed cigarette.

662
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,040
 Her suit becomes all black and she becomes an emo goth.

663
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,120
 And she does say, "If God was real, why would he allow such suffering in the world?"

664
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,240
 So this is definitely an atheist alien, which we don't get much of.

665
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,400
 Which is interesting, because we think there would be more of them.

666
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,200
 But it's very rare we come across an atheist alien.

667
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,960
 Before she returns, Martin to Earth, she tells him.

668
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,640
 She's still smoking the clothed cigarette.

669
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,760
 This isn't the first time we've met.

670
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,920
 We've met three times before.

671
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,520
 You don't remember those, though, and you never will.

672
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:03,480
 And then she looked at Martin and told him, "Whether or not you see me, though, I'm always

673
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
 nearby."

674
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,760
 Wakes up on a concrete slab at a picnic at a Catholic school camp.

675
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,260
 I love lost civilizations.

676
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,920
 I love the idea of humans used to be on the moon, used to be on Mars, that were descendants

677
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,840
 from a species that left those.

678
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,400
 We lost all our history and the story of the Great Flood was us leaving Mars and coming

679
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
 to Earth.

680
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
 I love all that stuff.

681
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
 Is there any proof of any of it?

682
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
 No.

683
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
 But I find it super fascinating.

684
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,680
 So this story spoke to me on that thing.

685
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,360
 The fact that I found it so closely to the other story about the guy woke up and the

686
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,880
 slide has Nain got a new boy toy?

687
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,720
 Is that what's going on here?

688
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,020
 But imagine this.

689
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
 Imagine this.

690
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:55,380
 This little hut on the moon could be proof that not just aliens exist, but what if it's

691
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,500
 proof that Nain exists?

692
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,820
 What if it's proof that this particular UFO alien abduction story is real?

693
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,820
 And if this story is real, then you have an outside source.

694
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,560
 When I say outside source, I mean outside the planet, outside the solar system, the leader

695
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:22,440
 of the security forces for an entire planet telling us, telling us the history of religion

696
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,040
 on Earth, i.e. it's fake.

697
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,760
 It's all used to enslave us.

698
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,640
 What if this shack is proof of that?

699
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:39,380
 If Nain is telling the truth and the lunar rover finds proof of her story, it means

700
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,680
 religions are fake.

701
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:51,080
 So as that lunar rover inches centimeter by centimeter so slowly across the landscape,

702
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,680
 it could be headed towards a structure of rocks or it could be headed towards proof

703
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:04,100
 of the greatest deception mankind has ever known.

704
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:12,320
 The aliens may call it the place of ashes because a great civilization annihilated itself.

705
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:22,120
 But if Nain's story is true and the Jade Rabbit finds proof of her existence, Earth will also

706
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,840
 call the moon the place of ashes.

707
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,240
 The place where God died.

708
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:45,060
