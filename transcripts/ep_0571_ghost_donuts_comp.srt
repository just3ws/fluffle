1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 In ancient China, a battle rages on, and a general comes up with a daring manoeuvre.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,520
 Then we travel to Athens, Georgia to take a look at the portal to hell and a staircase

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,360
 that leads nowhere. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:28,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Don't forget

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,040
 Thanksgiving, 12 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. We're going to do a live stream episode on

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
 YouTube, a totally live episode. I'm going to be on a little bit earlier to talk to you guys

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,760
 after the episode. We'll continue the conversation, answer any questions, just kind of chat. If you

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,240
 guys don't go to the YouTube, don't worry. I'm going to upload that as a podcast episode later

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,960
 than night on Thursday. And then I'm not going to do an episode on Friday. That's going to be a little

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,240
 break. Those live episodes take a lot out of me, honestly. It takes a lot to run on a webcam. It

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,880
 takes a lot to have to talk and know you're not going to be able to edit it, is what it is.

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,760
 It's kind of draining as a performer. But I like spending that time with you. And we did the last

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,640
 Thanksgiving. It was totally awesome. And I know this Thanksgiving, it's even, I don't, it's so

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,680
 important. I don't even have to pronounce the G at the end. This Thanksgiving, not everyone can be

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,360
 with their family. So let's be a family together and tune into that live stream or listen to it later.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,760
 But I'm sure maybe you have a family that loves you and you can spend time with them. Still listen

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,520
 to the, listen to the episode. But speaking of someone who does love you, let's give a round of

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,400
 applause to our newest Patreon supporter, Kim So-Raw. Kim So-Raw's walking in. She's blowing kisses

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,440
 to everyone. Oh, you caught one. Oh, that's pretty cute. Kim, you're going to be our captain, our

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,440
 pilot of this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand. Just help spread the

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,160
 word about the show. That is a way you can also help out the show. So I turn around and Kim So-Raw

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,800
 already has a patch and a peg leg and like a bird. I don't know, I don't know how she's

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,040
 snuck in with all this stuff, but she's in full pirate gear and that's perfect because we are

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,480
 taking the dead rabbit dreadnought. So let's get her in the captain's perch and we are all sitting on

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,920
 the, the, the wood. We're all just sitting on the wood of the ship as it sets sail to ancient China.

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:26,560
 We have to have a warship because we are headed into a battle zone. So everyone's sharpening their

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
 knives the whole time, getting ready, making shields, tearing the bow, tearing the wood of the

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,720
 boat apart. They're like, look, and I made a bunch of shields as we're sinking, but it's okay,

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,400
 we're almost there. Now I found out about this story from Noy's poetry. So I wanted to give

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
 a shout out to Noy's poetry for bringing this story to my attention. That's really, really awesome.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:55,520
 The year is 623 AD. And then like Zack Snyder Rock music starts playing and you're like Jason,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,480
 explain the same first. Just don't make grunting noises and then add a soundtrack. What it is,

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,440
 it's old timey, so it's all like sepia tone, but like red and stuff because you know there's the sun

35
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,920
 and it's a army of nomads coming over the hills. Now you guys get the visual right? They're moving

36
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,120
 all slow. Generals like dude, we could run in slow motion. We got a battle to fight. These are

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,520
 members of the Tuyuan Kingdom and they've had their eyes on the Gansu province and they're ready

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,520
 to take it. I don't know why nomads have a kingdom, but the kingdom constantly moves the castle. They're

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,440
 like where do we put the castle? It's over there now. This army of nomads lay siege to the Gansu

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,840
 province. Now the Gansu province was territory of the Tang Dynasty and the emperor sitting back

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,880
 at home and he's like hey, did you hear that rock music? I'm pretty sure he got invaded. I heard

42
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,160
 rock music and the generals are like yeah we heard that too. It was pretty bitchin'. So the emperor

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,560
 sends out General Chai Shao to go there, to go to Gansu and say you're really a general. You can

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,200
 kind of think outside the box. General Chai takes his army out to meet them at Gansu province, but

45
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 see the nomads have been there for so long and it's kind of a hilly area that when the Tang troops

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,080
 get there, they're just getting picked off by arrows. The nomads have a high ground, they got a whole

47
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,680
 bunch of arrows. They prepared for this. They didn't just bring one, they're recycling. They prepared

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,440
 for this. So they're just picking off troops constantly. General Chai is like okay because I

49
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,520
 need to take that hill, but it's pretty well defended. I got all these men here, but I think I'm

50
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,720
 going to need to send in a special strike team. Some time passes. And the nomads are on the top

51
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,200
 of the hill. They got their arrows ready. They're waiting for these troops to make another move,

52
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,320
 but the troops aren't making a move instead an elite task force. If only three soldiers are

53
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,000
 moving behind enemy lines. As the nomads are in their battle formation, just in case the Tang

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,760
 forces advance again, behind them they hear... and they're like okay that's not a joke. That's not a

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:21,760
 Zack Snyder joke. That's actual music playing. And a couple of the nomads turn around to see

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,600
 where the music's coming from and on a hill overlooking the nomad camp are three figures.

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,440
 One of them has a little guitar. Technically it's called a pipa, but if you guys get it,

58
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:42,560
 it's a string instrument. But that's not what's keeping the nomads attention. Nomads like hey look

59
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,640
 at... look what's up on that hill. And another guy turns around and is like oh my god. Because what

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:56,960
 is on the top of the hill is not only a dude with a pipa, but two super hot chicks dancing sexy.

61
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,760
 They're all rubbing up on each other. I'm not making that up to be sleetious either. They were

62
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,440
 doing an erotic dance with each other to the sound of... you might have had a better tune than that.

63
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,640
 The nomads see these two hot women bumping and grinding a dude with a little guitar playing a

64
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:24,080
 song and they're absolutely mesmerized by the beauty, the sheer eroticism of this moment.

65
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,960
 And in that moment, you're kind of lost, right? Maybe you haven't seen a woman in 30 years. You're

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,680
 a nomad. You keep forgetting where you put the women. But as you're watching these women,

67
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,200
 you start to hear noises. You start to hear noises about 4,000 men behind you.

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:50,640
 It seems to get a little closer. You're still mesmerized by this awesome sight you're seeing.

69
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,800
 Maybe about 800 men behind you. Oh, stop looking at me. Pay attention.

70
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:05,760
 No, no, the people are still watching this. General Chai slaughtered 500 men

71
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:14,240
 because the majority of them were staring at hot chicks. Now, there was more than 500 men there.

72
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
 He's just, that's all he could do. He's like, oh, my arm's cramping up, guys. Let's take a break.

73
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,920
 We should have stretched before this massacre. The rest of them ran away. I would be furious,

74
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,560
 dude. First off, I'd be furious that I was so far back in the crowd that I couldn't see the girls.

75
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,640
 I just see two kind of like feminine shaped blurry objects. I'm like, is that a mirage?

76
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,800
 Are those two palm trees like knocking up against each other in the wind? I'd be mad that I don't

77
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,680
 have a good front seat view. Secondly, I'd be mad that as the arrow is going through my neck,

78
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,840
 I see the guys in front of me still, still, still hanging out with these chicks. They're trying to

79
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,240
 get their phone number, still trying to invent a phone and the number system just so they can get

80
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,480
 their phone number. I'd be super mad that my compatriots, my countrymen were so thirsty

81
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,880
 that 500 dudes got killed and then the rest just ran away. So that is the story of General Chai,

82
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,640
 his ultimate secret weapon. They should use this in war more often. But here's my question. When I

83
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,080
 was telling this story, I kind of paused. Did he bring the two hot chicks with him? Like, was General

84
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,600
 Chai lead this army out into the middle of nowhere, into Gansu province? Sorry if you live there.

85
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,080
 I'm sure it's a lovely place. I heard they have great entertainment, but he's laying in this army

86
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,920
 out there and the whole time, like, his sergeants were like, dude, we are well stocked for the war

87
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,600
 in general. Chai's like, yes. The sergeants like, but I do have a question about them. And on the

88
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,200
 horse next to him was, and there's two chicks are dancing on the horse. And General Chai's like,

89
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,440
 listen, I don't need them. I might not. We may get there. The nomads may not be prepared. We take

90
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,640
 them by surprise. Or they could be on a hill shooting arrows at us. The sergeants like,

91
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,400
 that's a weird contingency plan. But that is why he was a general and the other guy was a sergeant.

92
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,040
 He could think two steps ahead. Kim so raw. Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonar copter. We're

93
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,040
 going to get you in the pilot seat of that. You're still wearing your pirate costume. It might be

94
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,680
 a little hard with a patch in your eye to fly an advanced helicopter, but I'm sure you will do a

95
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,200
 great job. We are leaving behind Gansu province in China. We are headed out to Athens, Georgia.

96
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:28,800
 It's a long trip the whole time and practicing my dance moves. I'm making you play a guitar.

97
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,080
 You're like, my fingers are bleeding. I'm dancing in front of you. Come on, man. Keep dancing.

98
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,000
 Is this distracting you? Is this you're like, it's annoying me is what it's doing.

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,160
 We're flying out to Athens, Georgia and I want you to fly over there. I'm kind of pointing

100
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,400
 out the helicopters. I'm still wiggling as I'm still wiggling. I want you to fly over there and

101
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,200
 we're flying over and we see in Georgia off the Atlanta highway is a hobby lobby and standing

102
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,600
 outside that store is a young man named Tyler. Now I recently had an interview. I recently was

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,720
 interviewed by a journalist about podcasts and how they find sources, how they verify sources,

104
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,400
 how they cite sources. It was kind of behind the scenes podcasting thing like that. Ethics in

105
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,280
 sourcing and Tyler was the one who's writing that article and interviewed me with them. He posted

106
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,720
 that on Reddit looking for interviews. So I went through his Reddit history because I think that's

107
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,360
 kind of what everyone does and I saw that he also had posted about something known as the

108
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,240
 portal of hell. So I said, tell you what young man, I'll make you a trade. I will do your interview

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,360
 for you, but I want to hear your story about the portal of hell. So as we're flying over this

110
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,880
 location in Georgia, we see Tyler waving at us and Kimso Ross getting ready to land and I'm like,

111
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
 no, no, no, we're not actually going to land on this story. Just kind of hover here and Tyler's

112
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,920
 like shucking his shoulders down there. This is an interesting story, but I don't really want to go

113
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,200
 too in depth to it, but it's a good gateway for our next story. So we're sort of leaving Tyler

114
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,160
 hanging out down there. He packed a lunch. He packed a whole picnic for us. In Georgia off the

115
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,000
 Atlanta highway, there is a location known as the portal of hell or hell's gate. It's behind the

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,520
 Hobby Lobby. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. It's actually behind Beach Haven Baptist Church.

117
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,280
 Or does it exist at all? This is an interesting story, but it's just a little bite-sized story.

118
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,320
 There's an old spooky house in this area that was built in 1910 and supposedly, and I read this,

119
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,080
 I read a bunch of sources on this. Tyler told me a version of the story,

120
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,720
 I read other versions of the story. There's an altar in the backyard. There's rumors of

121
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,160
 Satan worshipers, KKK members running the house. There's a naked guy on a horse,

122
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,240
 which puts the other two groups to shame, right? Like Satanists, yeah, you know whatever,

123
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,560
 the little cliche, KKK, again, little cliche. Naked guy on a horse. That's pretty dope.

124
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,760
 You can touch a tree out there at Bleeds. The reason why we're not landing for this story

125
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,960
 is because this is a typical urban legend in a town, a spooky house in a location

126
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,120
 off the beaten track. So it's not at the Hobby Lobby. You don't walk into Hobby Lobby and it's

127
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,520
 there. It's like behind the Hobby Lobby. And even the fact that they can't really agree on,

128
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,560
 because I read a bunch of different sources on this, they can't agree on the location,

129
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,960
 also adds the idea that this is probably a story crafted around a location than a location having

130
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,360
 a story organically. But every neighborhood has one of these houses. Every neighborhood has the

131
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,280
 spooky house. What's interesting about this house is two things. One, it's very well known. If I tried

132
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,800
 finding spooky houses in my hometown or your hometown or whatever, unless it's Amityville,

133
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,280
 you're gonna have a hard time finding a lot of resources on this. There were so many resources

134
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,640
 on the portal of hell in Georgia that there was enough to start contradicting each other.

135
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,000
 All these different legends people had heard growing up. They're posting them on Reddit,

136
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,080
 they're posting them on these websites. So although that was interesting, normally they don't get so

137
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,640
 famous. They have multiple mentions across the websites. But then something else is going on,

138
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,800
 and Tyler keyed me in on this, and when he was talking about it, my eyebrow kind of raised.

139
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,640
 The house is now private property, and they're going to demolish it or renovate the entire area

140
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,480
 to build some sort of park to preserve the area. And the reason why that raised my eyebrows,

141
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,160
 probably the same reason why it should have raised your eyebrow. We've talked about this a lot of

142
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,240
 times on the show. Places that have a reputation for being haunted, being purchased by the local

143
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,080
 government, or a group of outside interests like the Dark Entity or the Dark Entity Association,

144
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,760
 bought that place in Connecticut. We've seen this happen several times. The US government built a

145
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,640
 base around the hole that Charles Manson was going to go in after Helter Skelter, which he

146
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,720
 believed led to paradise under earth. There's a lot of different examples where these places that

147
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,880
 are supposedly haunted or have some sort of power, the government buys it up, and they are looking at

148
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,000
 this. I saw that they are, they did fill out like budgetary concerns to do all this stuff. But I

149
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
 wouldn't be surprised if this goes on for years and years and years, and they never do anything

150
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,960
 with the area. And it's just a cordoned off area that they can say, Oh, no trespassing. This is

151
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,800
 actually county property. We're going to be building something here. It's not safe. And they just

152
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,880
 keep it that way for 10, 15, 20 years. And the legend grows, which would make me think that there

153
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,520
 may be something actually behind the portal of hell as far as a paranormal activity goes. Or

154
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,000
 you have government officials who just like riding in their horses naked. That's the safest place to

155
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,840
 do it. Listen to that. You want to know what's shocking though, outside of Saint worshippers

156
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:42,480
 riding horses naked to fix this area up for a park $13 million. If you gave me $13 million,

157
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,400
 I would give every person in Georgia a piggyback ride. That's funner than a park.

158
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,240
 Now Kim, go ahead and pick up Tyler, put him in the carpenter copter. He has a picnic lunch ready

159
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:00,480
 for us. We are headed out to a truly terrifying story in Athens, Georgia. Pretty sure the portal

160
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,040
 of hell was on the outskirts of Athens, Georgia. I don't think it was in the city proper, but now

161
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,120
 we are actually in Athens, Georgia. We're headed to the University of Georgia. So hope you guys

162
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,120
 brought your schoolbooks. Hope you guys brought your scantrons. We all hop out of the carpenter

163
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,160
 copter. We're walking around University of Georgia. This was the other story Tyler told me. And

164
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,640
 this was one that again had ton of sources on. He's really good source of information for this

165
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,720
 type of stuff. Really, really weird one. We're going to let Kim lead the way though. We're going

166
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
 to let Kim lead the way with a flashlight. We're walking through the darkness. We're sneaking

167
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,040
 onto campus. It's night. We're headed to Joe Brown Hall. Open the door. It's all spooky.

168
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,360
 Actually, the hall is not spooky itself. There's just one part of it. I'm sure the door is automated.

169
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,480
 But anyways, we're walking through Joe Brown Hall. Joe Brown Hall, just another building on campus.

170
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,680
 Dorm rooms, teachers' offices. There's a little debate about that. We'll put a pin in that for

171
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,520
 right now. But it's a typical college building. Now, according to Carol Bishop, she's the archival

172
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,800
 assistant of the Special Collections Library. And she also runs a ghost tour here at University of

173
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:17,120
 Georgia. In 1971, Thanksgiving break. Ooh, I didn't realize it's super close. Ooh. There's a student.

174
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,880
 He's the only one in the dorms. Everyone else has gone for student break. He wanted to stay home

175
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,320
 and play pong or something. Whatever you did back in 1971 for fun. Just sit there, inanimate.

176
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,960
 That's what they love to do. But something went wrong, deadly wrong. Because after Thanksgiving

177
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,720
 break, people come back. They're like, "Oh, that was so good. I ate all that turkey." They're walking

178
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,680
 into school. And there is this student, this nameless student, hanging in his door room.

179
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,640
 Super gross, right? He'd been hanging for three or four days. And when the janitors came, everyone's

180
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,120
 like, "Oh, man, I just say Thanksgiving." They're throwing it up, stove top stuffing everywhere.

181
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,640
 The janitors come in, the cleaning crew comes in, and they said it was so gross and so gory.

182
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,320
 They don't matter how much they tried cleaning up the blood, cleaning up the body fluids, all this

183
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,800
 stuff, they could never get all the stains out. They couldn't get the smell out. Because it had been

184
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,760
 three days. Hold your questions, guys. Hold your questions. It had been three whole days,

185
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,640
 according to Carol Bishop, or maybe five. It doesn't matter. It was so stinky that they just

186
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:29,600
 said, "We can't do this anymore." So the doorway to his dorm room, they walled in. But there's a

187
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,680
 curious little reminder of this story. There's actually a staircase in Joe Brown Hall that dead

188
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,520
 ends to a wall. That is the story of the staircase to nowhere. Or is it? No, it's not. There's more

189
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
 to the story. There's more to the story, because I'll tell you this right now. I used to work at

190
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,160
 a crematory. Bodies can start smelling. Bodies will smell after five days, and they'll get all

191
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 gory and goopy and stuff like that. But not to the point that you couldn't clean them up.

192
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,280
 Like, unless they had, what's the 70s? Maybe they had really thick shag carpet. But I'm gonna bet

193
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:09,760
 dollars to donuts that you could clean up five-day-old gore. I'd almost be certain of that. I'm not

194
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,080
 saying it would be the place people would want to live in their dorm room. Yippee! I got the tragedy

195
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,360
 room, but you could do it. If you had your choice between eliminating a room and walling it up and

196
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,080
 plastering it over or just spending a weekend scrubbing and ripping out carpet and tile and stuff

197
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,920
 like that, it doesn't make sense. But that's why that story actually is not true. That story's not

198
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,000
 true. There's another version of the story that I found multiple times online. There was a police

199
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,600
 cadet at the time. He was working at the police academy, and one of the things they do to the new

200
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,680
 cadets is they make them look at really gross photos. Make them look like people popping pimples,

201
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,760
 people pulling slivers out underneath their fingernails, and the cops are like, "Oh, this is

202
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,400
 disgusting. Does this have anything to do with their job?" The chief's like, "No, I just have a fetish

203
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,080
 for watching young men have disgusting looks on their faces. That's my thing." He says that an

204
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,920
 unknown year, he said, "I don't remember the year it happened. I remember seeing the photos and I

205
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,720
 remember being told this story. It was late summer. It was around August, was this guy's story.

206
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,440
 There was a professor who had a staircase that led right into his office in Joe Brown Hall. He was

207
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,600
 also an avid fan of autoerotic affixiation. So if you don't know what that is, it's where you hang

208
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,560
 your, you don't have to hang yourself, but it's where you cut off the supply of oxygen to your brain

209
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,320
 as you're masturbating. And then right before you, uh, orgasm, for lack of a better word,

210
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,880
 there's a lot of words. I don't have a lack of a word, but in polite company, right before you

211
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,840
 orgasm, you'll stop choking yourself and the blood goes back into your brain and it's this

212
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,640
 supposedly amazing rush. I never tried it. You should be evident I'm still alive. It's super

213
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,760
 dangerous. It can kill you. And maybe you just start off using your hand, but eventually it's

214
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,160
 August of an unknown year and you're tying a noose because that's how a lot of people do it.

215
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:11,280
 That's how the lead singer of InXS died. That's how Kung Fu died. David Carradine. You have,

216
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,680
 it's super dangerous. So the idea is this professor really left autoerotic affixiation

217
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:22,560
 and he messed up and he hung there for anywhere from a few weeks to a full month.

218
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,480
 Now we're cooking with bodily fluids, right? After a couple weeks, you're going to have a

219
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
 really hard time getting that smell out. You're going to have a really, really hard time getting

220
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
 that smell out. I mean, again, five days isn't going to be easy. I'm not going to be like, what?

221
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,800
 No, why? It's going to, they can happen here. It doesn't smell so bad. As it sits and it soaks and

222
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:48,640
 it gets all gory and more elements of the decay are coming in and the blood turns black and all

223
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,320
 that stuff. It gets super, super thick. He basically was mel- it was like if you were holding a

224
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,720
 popsicle on a rope on a hot day, you probably didn't need that visual, but he was just melting

225
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,160
 out of the news. So it's George's summers. So it's getting extra boiling in there. You guys

226
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,600
 like, take it Jason. I mean a pot pie right now. You stop talking about this? Okay, sure, sure.

227
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,840
 And so for, there's no way they were going to get that smell out. They tried over and over again.

228
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,640
 This cop said, he had actually heard that they sent in firefighters with scuba tanks on

229
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,520
 and even they were throwing up, which would be hilarious to watch a scuba tank throw up.

230
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 Hopefully it was one of those big old timey ones with like the glass of viewpoint, the big ball

231
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,160
 heading, just see it filling up with puke. You're like, Jason, I'm still eating my pot pie.

232
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,080
 I'm still eating my pot pie. Sorry. I should think we're done. So anyways, that was that story. And

233
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,720
 I've seen that story go around as well. Now what's interesting is there are parts of the story that

234
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,760
 are true with the main part of the story. Like the portal to hell, people can't even really agree

235
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,520
 where the building's at. Joe Brown Hall does have a staircase that leads to nowhere. It leads to a

236
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
 dead end. And I'll actually post the photo on my Twitter and my Instagram because I want you guys

237
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,840
 to see it. Somebody painted an infinite doorway on the wall. It's really cool looking. So it's like

238
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,600
 you get to the top of the stairs and you're just looking down infinity. It's that what is it the

239
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,320
 Kruger effect or something like that where you can see the image keep getting reflected farther

240
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,160
 than farther. Really cool. It's true. There is a staircase leading to a wall. Your mind thinks

241
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,800
 obviously that's not a design quirk. There must have been something behind that wall. But you're

242
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,640
 hearing the story about the student who in the version that I read from Carol, it wasn't implied

243
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,840
 that it was auto erotic affixiation. It wasn't specifically stated as suicide either. So maybe

244
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,200
 she was keeping it clean for the students. The police cadet goes, oh no, the dude was jacking off.

245
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,320
 But the big difference was it was a professor in his office and it was in August in this hot

246
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,520
 August sun for a week or a month. The other one was a cold Georgia Thanksgiving break.

247
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:01,120
 Let's give a shout out to PHP Apple and Gaius Julius Kaiser. They actually did a lot of digging

248
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:10,400
 on this. They were posting this on Reddit. Really found the truth behind this story. March 2nd, 1972.

249
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,240
 They found the article. They found the exact date that will tell us what happened behind that wall.

250
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,600
 26 year old University of Georgia student Stanley Park Haddock hung himself in his dorm room.

251
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,680
 He'd only been up there for a few days. But the reason why the cops don't think it was a suicide

252
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,560
 was because his pants were down around his ankles. So they're looking at it and they're going,

253
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,920
 this is weird. This is super weird. Like we've seen it before, auto erotic affixiation happens.

254
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,480
 But it's also possible that maybe he hated pants. He hated pants. So he wanted to take

255
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,160
 him off and commit suicide. But there was an odd clue in this story. And when Tyler told me it,

256
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,800
 I was like, what are you talking about? I didn't say that to him. He's like, and then they found.

257
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,640
 And I was like, what? Well, I'm thinking, okay, what does that mean? What does that mean? But

258
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,280
 when I read it in context, I was like, oh, okay. Now I know what Tyler was trying to say. Not only

259
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,080
 did they find a dead man hanging with his pants around his ankles, they found donuts.

260
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:20,160
 I was like, who cares? They found donuts, right? But apparently this was the clue. This is why I'm

261
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,400
 not a police officer. When the police walked in, they found this guy hanging with his pants around

262
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,280
 his ankles. They found fresh donuts, well, they wore fresh when he bought them five days ago, but

263
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,680
 they found don't like new donuts. And they're so funny. This is what the cops thought. And this is

264
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:42,160
 true. They thought no one would ever buy fresh donuts and then kill themselves because donuts

265
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:48,080
 were hands down the most delicious food out there. There is no one on earth who would come home with

266
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,160
 the dozen donuts, set them down and goes, now my story is over. The saga of me comes to an end.

267
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,400
 You'd eat the donuts and then you feel better and then everything in life would go on.

268
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,560
 That was their clue. The pants around the ankles, you could figure out, I don't know, maybe he's

269
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,720
 maybe he borrowed his big brother's jeans, but the donuts, the brand new donuts, made them think

270
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,960
 that he had actually accidentally killed himself doing an autoerotic asphyxiation. It's tragic.

271
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,360
 I think it's an interesting story and we are walking out of there with the donut.

272
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,560
 Stanley's looking down on us as a ghost. He's waving to us. He's eating ghost donuts. So

273
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,520
 everything worked out okay. But as we're walking down the staircase and we're eating donuts,

274
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,400
 something still doesn't sit right with me with this story. Even though this is a true story,

275
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:44,960
 I don't think that's what's behind the wall. Hear me out. Nowhere in that article that I read,

276
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,840
 did they say, and then the maintenance crew sealed up his dorm room. No one would ever get in there

277
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,600
 again. They just said on March 2nd, which again, very good weather. You're not going to have massive

278
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,880
 levels of super stinky decay. Again, I'm not saying you want a dead body in your house for five days.

279
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,800
 What I'm saying is that's not a level where you would never be able to clean it up.

280
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,640
 Nowhere in the article does it say that they sealed it up. This is my theory that yes, that story is

281
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,760
 true. That Stanley did have a horrible accident and accidentally killed himself. But I don't think

282
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,200
 that's what's behind that wall of that staircase because I've been in a lot of dorm rooms in my

283
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,160
 life and I've never seen one that has a staircase for a single room. I mean, that you got to be like

284
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,000
 cock of the block if you're like, "See you guys later, you're walking up the stairs to your room."

285
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,080
 That doesn't make sense. And what's interesting is when Tyler first told me this story,

286
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,440
 he said, and I might be misquoting him, but I believe this is what I heard,

287
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:49,920
 he said that behind that walled up door is an entire hallway, which I would think would imply

288
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:55,200
 there's other multiple rooms back there. That makes sense. The idea of a stairway going to

289
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,960
 just one room, you have an entire floor dedicated to one room, it doesn't make sense.

290
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,400
 I think that the story of Stanley is true and that story has been transported to answer the

291
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,440
 mystery of what that staircase leads to. When in fact, that's not true. Now Stanley's room could

292
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,680
 have been one of the several rooms in that hall, but if you have one room that's super stinky,

293
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,840
 and as a college you want to maximize the people on your campus, are you going to shut down an entire

294
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,480
 floor, half a floor, a wing, because one room's super stinky? Give them a discount, give those kids

295
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,720
 a discount. You'd figure a way to take care of that without shutting off access to an entire

296
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,680
 wing. There's no way that door only leads to one room. It doesn't make sense from a design

297
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:50,560
 standpoint. They want to shut all those rooms down just because it's stank. They definitely want to

298
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:57,920
 keep it shut down all this time. It's happened back in 1972. You can get out smell, you can wipe away

299
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,240
 gore, you can clean up messes. But let's put on our conspiracy caps here and wrap the episode up

300
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:12,560
 like this. One thing that's hard to get rid of is paranormal activity. Exorcist or not, sage,

301
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,720
 cleansings, anything like that, salt. If something's powerful enough, if something wants to stay long

302
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,880
 enough, it's not going to leave. Someone complains about the smell, you can cover up the smell.

303
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,760
 Someone wakes up in the middle of the night and there's a 24 year old man standing at the foot

304
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,120
 of their bed. How do you deal with that complaint? Some kid's doing his homework late at night,

305
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,120
 has his headphones on, and starts to feel like something's different in the room.

306
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,360
 And doesn't realize that just inches behind him, there's a face staring at the back of his head.

307
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,680
 In the shower room, you think you're alone until you hear wet footsteps walking behind you.

308
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,920
 These are things that no cleanup crew can take care of. Now would be a reason why you would

309
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:06,320
 seal off an entire wing. So if you ever find yourself in Athens, Georgia, I dare you to try

310
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,600
 to find out what's behind that brick-dub door. Sure, there's another access point.

311
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,160
 A window you can scurry through, a heating vent for John McClain, you can pop through the heating

312
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:25,920
 vent. And you'll find yourself in a darkened hallway that no living human has been in for

313
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:34,240
 almost 50 years. Sealed off from the world. Moonlight coming in through a window that people

314
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,840
 have not glanced out of for decades. And while you're in this dark hallway, you have your sage,

315
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:49,920
 you have your crucifix, you're ready for anything. But then you smell a familiar smell.

316
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,200
 A smell that reminds you of happiness. You turn around and see a box of fresh donuts

317
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,920
 sitting in the darkness in front of you. You know your time is up. You know that this spirit

318
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:12,560
 is about to take you into the shadow realm. But, at least, before you die, you get to eat a donut.

319
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,640
 You get to eat a ghost donut and then you die.

 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one,

322
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,160
 guys.
