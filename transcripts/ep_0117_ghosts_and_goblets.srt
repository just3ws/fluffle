00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 The discovery of bones in a trailer home lead to some unanswered questions.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:14,080
 A drinking game gets out of control when it involves a power drill, and then we cover one of the most

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,480
 disturbing topics that we've ever talked about on this show. John Sharp and his spear gun. Today on Dead

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:32,240
 Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,320
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. Saying that, hold on a

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:46,800
 second I'm gonna pop some ibuprofen. And some Sudafed while I'm at it. One more second. And

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm gonna wash it down with a delicious cup of diet cranberry sprite. You know what's funny I'm

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,640
 actually do drink that and as I was listening back to the last episode we did about monkeys don't

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,240
 exist I thought you know what they're gonna sue me because I was equating diets cranberry sprite

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,880
 with Hans the lunatic. Okay so ibuprofen a little bit Sudafed. Oh I dropped the Sudafed the smallest

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:18,000
 of all my pills. Oh there it is. Why do they make pills round? They're like let's design something

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,160
 that people need to stay healthy and let's make it in the most rollable form. So if they drop it

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,640
 it rolls and clicks all the dust underneath their chair. I guess I really should just dust under my

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,080
 chair. Who dusts? Okay who dusts under their chair but I've never dusted in my life. I think

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,600
 dusting is the dumbest of all cleaning activities. I've never dusted anything. Maybe for a dramatic

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,080
 effect I ran my finger over a dust line but that's it. I don't ever dust. So before we get started

17
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,640
 it was funny I was looking at this so like I said I've been working a lot that's where the episodes

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,520
 are a bit shorter this one might be around actually revolving around normal length but oh and I do

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,000
 have to say this real quick. Last night's episode monkeys don't exist took forever to record the

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
 monkeys don't exist story I actually did three takes the first one I was just kind of like

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,240
 and then the monkey guy he doesn't believe it and these videos are fake isn't that wacky oh my god

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,120
 look at all of this stuff that this guy doesn't believe in and I'm recording it and I felt myself

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,320
 zoning out thinking oh my god this might be the worst episode I've ever recorded that's not

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,760
 true I actually know the worst episode I ever recorded there was an episode a long time ago

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,440
 I almost quit I hated it so much I'll talk about that some other time but I hated that episode

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,400
 but anyways I started to zone out and then I was like cut and I started it completely from scratch

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,000
 and I was going on again like each take was maybe 15 minutes and I'm like I could care less about

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,440
 this topic like I felt the topic was super interesting but my delivery was so bad and I was

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,480
 honestly thinking this might be the end of Dead Rabbit Radio like if I maybe I'm just working

30
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,880
 the three jobs maybe I'm just too tired mentally tired to do this type of show anymore and I sat

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,280
 there I stopped recording for a long period of time I just sat there silently in front of the

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,880
 mic and I thought I'm gonna come up with a narrative to it where and then that's when I invented the

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,120
 idea of haunts in your bedroom and it turns out to be one of my favorite episodes but yeah after

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 I got them recording it I was laughing really loud when I was editing that you laughing at your

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
 own stuff is pretty indulgent but yeah I was like okay so I think I'm gonna use that narrative

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,240
 device I'm gonna use it sparingly but there are there are other conspiracies that I've had on the

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,720
 doc that were just lists of lunatic facts and I was like it would be lame if I just read these

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,520
 facts off I didn't I couldn't figure out a way to deliver it so I just kind of like Bamagara's

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,080
 afterlife is one of them that I've had research for a long time but I'm like there's no it was just

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,120
 it will just be me listing stuff off but I've created this narrative device and I think that'll

41
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,480
 pop up especially with that one because it works but where was I going with that oh yeah yeah three

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
 jobs so I was mentally tired yesterday but part of part of one of my jobs is I kind of have to be

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,200
 up on my first aid I kind of have to know how to like field dress wounds and stuff like that the

44
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,320
 jobs are they're they're mundane working class jobs I'm not like a special agent or anything like

45
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,040
 that but so I've been reading up on first aid now I have a I have an app on my phone that's like

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,120
 the offline survival guide which makes sense because if you're trapped in the wilderness

47
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,680
 you're not gonna you're like oh I wish I knew how to make a tourniquet if only I had three bars like

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,800
 you want to have it just stored on your phone and I found a neat little tip it's only half a tip

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,040
 though if you have a large blister you're not supposed to pop it because then you have to treat

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
 it as like an open wound and again they're assuming you're out in the middle of nowhere if you're like

51
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,720
 at home well you still probably shouldn't pop it but especially if you're out in the middle of

52
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,480
 nowhere so they said if you had a large blister this is so gross if you have a large blister and

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,040
 you don't want to pop it but you want to make it smaller what you do is you take a needle a sterilized

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,080
 needle and sterilized thread which I don't know how you sterilize thread you can't really

55
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,040
 spoil it because then it just gets all but anyways you take a needle and a sterilized thread

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
 and you stick the needle through the blister and it's big enough to put a needle through it's not

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
 just a tiny blister you put the needle through the blister and you pull the string all the way

58
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,920
 through and then you take the needle off so you just have this string hanging out of your blister

59
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,640
 and the string so gross the string soaks up all of your blister juice so your blister gets smaller

60
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,800
 because it's going like the threads absorbing it now that was the end of the tip and I thought well

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 when do you pull the string out like do you just leave it in there forever the rest of your life

62
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,320
 do you just have a string hanging out of your blister like at what point eventually you're

63
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,880
 gonna have to pull it out eventually it will then become an open wound and think about it yeah I know

64
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,480
 having blisters suck but you know what is secondary to that walking with something in your shoe like

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,280
 if you're walking down the street and you have a rock in your shoe it's very annoying with this tip

66
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
 not only do you feel like a string in your shoe but it keeps getting bigger and gooey like your

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,920
 shoes all I guess you don't have them at both feet but I mean you have a string and then eventually

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,840
 becomes yarn because it's so full of pus I guess pus is in a blister right some sort of goo some

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,040
 sort of human made liquid I would I would totally throw those strings at people too just to let you

70
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,080
 I'd go to like a like a Michaels and I would pull it out and hide it in the yarn section and old

71
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,840
 women are like oh I'm never seeing this exotic yarn old women are like it smells like taquitos

72
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,240
 this must be from Mexico my I had a sister who used to work for a podiatrist she said sometimes

73
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,360
 people take their shoes off and they smelled like microwave to taquitos because they were so

74
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,920
 diseased let's go ahead and move on with the episode I hope none of you were eating taquitos

75
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,880
 just now I know it's very popular to listen to dead rabbit and eat a taquito but the first story

76
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,960
 comes out of our batch of new news just quick overview if you're just into the show new news

77
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,360
 are articles from 2004 that I saved in a folder called new news and forgot about until I found

78
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,280
 them on a computer I was junking let's go ahead and look at the first one though first one new news

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:25,840
 so this story of course takes place in the year 2004 and in my notes I just wrote Alabama maybe

80
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,800
 so I don't I couldn't really figure out what state it was from because the story was so old it was

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,200
 hard enough for me to even track down the current article because when you have I was downloading

82
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,000
 web pages these weren't bookmarks so it wasn't like I could go back to CBS news and even if I could

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
 for the most part that page would probably be purged because some of them would say this page

84
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,840
 is available blah blah blah but I did find this one I was happy enough to find the article this is

85
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,560
 weird so there's this a 10-year-old girl named Stephanie Ogden and she has this imaginary friend

86
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,480
 and her imaginary friend is a black girl in a white dress never got a name that we know at least

87
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,120
 maybe she just called her I don't know what's a good name for a go I'm really gonna get detracted

88
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,280
 I'm not gonna get sidetracked I'm not gonna get sidetracked okay so she's hanging out with this

89
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,480
 ghost girl this black girl with a white dress they were hanging out for the past five years so

90
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,600
 Stephanie met this girl it's weird she doesn't have a name though am I wrong they don't even say

91
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,680
 it in the article the she was hanging out with this imaginary friend for five years so you know

92
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,800
 they're hanging out that's a long time too they're hanging out there she said the mom said whenever

93
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,520
 Stephanie wanted a soda she would have to get two sodas one for her and one for her imaginary friend

94
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,160
 I don't know check the diabetes on that girl she's probably lying but anyways the parents were like

95
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,240
 you don't know kids have imaginary friends it's not a big deal but what happened in in in today in

96
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,440
 the year 2004 what happened was they were doing some renovation on their trailer home

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,320
 they're and so they were pulling up their floorboards and they find a pelvis

98
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:09,120
 pelvis bone on actual pelvis they find a pelvis bone and a leg bone and they're like oh my god

99
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,720
 like what's going on here and then they continue to well I'm sure they called the cops then but as

100
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,680
 they were continuing to do renovation they find another bone and what's weird is that the bones

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,240
 when the police investigated it they said it looked like a rat had been carrying them around

102
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,960
 underneath the trailer home like it was part of the trailer home itself it wasn't like they

103
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,520
 lifted up the floor and they saw a bone in the dirt it was yeah underneath the installation the

104
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,880
 insulation you know the pink fuzzy stuff and so the cops are like it's weird because we see that

105
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,760
 like a rat had been moving around playing them like a xylophone but the cops said it's also weird

106
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,320
 other than the rat moving them is that the people are up late at night they're all where's that xylophone

107
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:01,360
 music coming from the the cops are like I'm marking this girl's death the cops are like we can also

108
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,320
 tell that there's some sort of like there was dirt on them so at some point they believe that these

109
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 bones were buried and then brought or at least sitting outside for a good amount of time and then

110
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,560
 brought into the home and they go well the rat could have brought them into the home which is weird

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,280
 because the brats don't eat bones or somebody could have left it at left the person outside to decay

112
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,720
 and then put them put them in the home or they could have buried the body and then dug it up

113
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
 through it underneath the floorboards which doesn't make much sense and the cops were like here's the

114
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
 thing this trailer home has had multiple owners and it's been across multiple states and these are

115
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,840
 obviously human bones but we don't know we will never be able to track them down like this could

116
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,920
 have been anyone who ever owned this trailer home it could have been in any of these states it could

117
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
 have been unrelated to the trailer home and a rat was like oh dude these are awesome and he brought

118
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,840
 them into his house actually here's a question where's that rat where the rat must still be in

119
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,520
 the trailer home what rat is big enough to carry a pelvis bone but so the article was making it

120
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,720
 out to be they didn't interview the rat the article was saying that maybe the imaginary friend was the

121
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,360
 ghost of the little girl who previously had those bones now that's a creepy like story obviously you

122
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,040
 have these bones underneath your floor and your daughter keeps having this imaginary friend who's

123
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,680
 humanoid it's not like puff the magic dragon walking around the backyard drinking the second soda

124
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,640
 diet cranberry sprite but he it's creepy enough to have bones under your floor but then to think

125
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,280
 like this ghost girl was kind of like talking to your daughter for the past five years and also

126
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,440
 I was the daughter like hey mom hey dad you know my imaginary friend she's really cool we go to

127
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,640
 school together we play forts and her pelvis is under the floor but yeah so I mean it could be

128
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,160
 connected it could not be connected we have to you know I you know what actually it's 14 years later

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,200
 Stephanie Ogden is now 24 years old I'm gonna see if I can try to track her down and find out more

130
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,800
 about this dude I didn't think about that we have basically a time machine in our possession the time

131
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:20,000
 machine being an old folder of links this girl's old enough now so Stephanie Ogden of Alabama maybe

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,480
 get ahold of us get ahold of us if you're one of my 1100 subscribers on youtube wouldn't that be

133
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,680
 crazy but let's see if we can find her and ask her if she still has this imaginary friend or what

134
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,720
 happened to the rat these are all questions I need to know no I'm curious I'll I'll uh I'll see what

135
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,840
 I can dig up and we'll go on to the next story next new news so I'm sure this already got an old

136
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:57,280
 for you this one is a story of levels so it's the year you can guess it's 2004 we're in Perth

137
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,680
 Australia we're in Perth Australia there is an unnamed man and an unnamed party of people now

138
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,960
 generally unnamed you you have to take the article with a grain of salt but he's saying he wants to

139
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,480
 remain unnamed because it's super embarrassing but again you have to take with a grain of salt

140
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,120
 this 20 year old man is hanging out with his buddies it's 2004 Chumbo Womba's blasting on your

141
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,480
 radio that actually I'm not sure even then I think that song came out 99 they're like why are you

142
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:33,520
 playing this old song um 50 Cent is killing it with Phil and the blank top song they're like man it's

143
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,280
 gonna suck that there's not gonna be any more Star Wars movies ever I bet you they could tell the best

144
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,680

148
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,680
 that's kind of a cool name we'll pretend he just got 21 years old just got he's on break from

149
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,800
 American Gladiators so Serge here so Serge made him name don't sue me real Serge from American

150
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,280
 Gladiators if you've ever competed in that show Serge here is hanging out with his other 21 year

151
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,920
 old friends it was one it was a 21st birthday party for somebody else not Serge and Serge is

152
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,720
 there with Nitro and Tank and Flame on and they're like let's all have this drinking game and they're

153
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,960
 like yeah that's awesome so one guy pulls out a drinking helmet with a jug on it and they're like

154
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,960
 yeah dude we'll just pour liquor in here and it'll drink it in the hose and someone's like no

155
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,480
 it's kind of laying that's not how it's not how gladiator rolls so let's take this this pretty

156
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,680
 benign jug with the hose coming out into your mouth which isn't that but sounds more like a

157
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,480
 saw trap so let's take this jug and let's let's kick it up a notch let's kick it up a notch so

158
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,240
 they attached a pump to the reservoir where the liquor is going to go in at this point that all

159
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,200
 the gladiators are getting a little curious maybe a little apprehensive maybe a little apprehensive

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,480
 and some guy goes oh that's that's a cool pump but we need something to power it and they're like

161
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,360
 what do we get like double A's triple A's dude breaks out a power drill and says we're gonna

162
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,080
 attach this power drill to the pump and turn it on and it's going to push all the liquor straight

163
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,200
 into your stomach with that absolutely insane and dangerous idea cheers rose up through the group

164
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,240
 they started doing it put a hose in your mouth fill the little reservoir it wasn't reservoir it's a

165
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,440
 bucket basically with beer and then they turn on the power drill and the liquor would just be pumped

166
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,360
 right into your stomach first guy does it totally fine second guy does it totally fine six people

167
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,720
 do it all in all no problem so surge steps up and he's like yeah i can do this puts the hose in his

168
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,880
 mouth turn someone turns the power drill on now surge surges quote later much much later said

169
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,800
 and i'm paraphrasing the first part but he was saying that he knew something was wrong

170
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:25,600
 when he started to throw up quote red stuff unquote surge that's known as blood it's not

171
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,560
 generally called red stuff and that's exactly what happened he began vomiting up blood and alcohol

172
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,680
 and basically fell down his friends rush him to the hospital in their gladiator mobile it's

173
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,000
 they're in those big balls that they all have to run in they're like hurry up get him his body's

174
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,240
 like flipping anyways they get him in the hospital they get him to the thunderdome med take him in

175
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,640
 there what happened was the force of the liquor going into his stomach was so intense it ripped a

176
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,760
 10 centimeter i don't know what that is in in real measurement but a 10 centimeter rip in his

177
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,520
 stomach so all the beer and all the cheap food and all the weight gaining supplements and the

178
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,720
 creatine powder all of that pushed into his body and the doctors are basically like this dude's

179
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,760
 toast there's no way this guy's gonna make it but you know we get paid by the hour so they open them

180
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
 up i don't know if they get paid by the hour but they open them up and they were able to kind of

181
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,960
 vacuum everything out and they had to give him a ton of antibiotics and i think it was like a week

182
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,680
 or two but he was in a coma such and going all that stuff imagine all okay i just imagine getting

183
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,400
 a rip in your stomachs bad enough but then to imagine like the taquitos you just ate or those

184
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,760
 20 chicken nuggets and all that stuff just hitting your liver they're just like bumping around in you

185
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
 i the stomach acid would burn that'd probably be the only thing you would feel but i think you

186
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,800
 would also just like i said you have a pebble in your shoe that's irritating imagine having 20

187
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,840
 chicken nuggets just hanging out in your body they're out of your stomach they're just chilling

188
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,880
 you have these little lump shape you have like a little boot shaped um lump pushing against your

189
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,680
 stomach i probably he probably didn't care what his stomach looked like he was dying but the moral

190
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,560
 of the story obviously is this don't engage in stupid drinking games but i think the bigger moral

191
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,200
 of the story is why doesn't everyone just use english measurement what is it called imperial

192
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,560
 why do people still use stuff like centimeters and kilometers i don't get that these articles

193
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,840
 from other countries are irritating just use inches bro it makes you seem taller kind of i mean if

194
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,880
 somebody says i'm 300 centimeters tall you sound no matter how many things no matter how big the

195
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,840
 number is before centimeter you sound tiny you sound absolutely tiny just say inches or feet

196
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:54,480
 something guys get on board get on board for the sake of this podcast and the sake of the

197
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,520
 fact that i could use google and easily you know what here let's find out how big 10 10 centimeters

198
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,520
 is because i do have the internet in front of me it better be impressive though because i'm gonna

199
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,080
 be upset otherwise where's my phone oh i have a like on tinder okay let's see here this better

200
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:18,240
 be impressive or i'm gonna be mad 10 centimeters in inches it's three inches that that's a sizeable

201
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:32,960
 gap i want to see how tall i am in centimeters i'm five i mean six no i'm five foot 11.5 in centimeters

202
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,640
 let's see that's 181 centimeters that makes me sound like a tiny person if someone ever asked how

203
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:46,800
 tall you are and i said oh i'm 181 centimeters what makes me sound lily pushin lily lily um

204
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,840
 lily yeah it's a lily pushin pushin the little people from gulliver's travels you know he went

205
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,800
 to other places in those books like he went to the tiny place and then he went to a place where he

206
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,440
 was tiny and then he went to a place full of like hot air balloons or something i don't remember what

207
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,440
 the third or fourth place was but nobody does everyone just remembers that he was a giant and

208
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,200
 there's tiny people running around and i barely remembered that he was tiny but anyways he would

209
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,960
 have 108 tell me 181 centimeters doesn't sound tiny tell me that um do i have time to do the spear

210
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,640
 gun story considering my rant on centimeters i don't think i do i don't think i do you know here

211
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,400
 okay oh i'm gonna be completely honest with the spear gun story the spear gun story i actually

212
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:39,360
 have a full episode a 20 minute episode recorded of the spear gun story and it is so creepy and

213
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,320
 disturbing that i recorded it a couple days ago and was like i'm not gonna release this i you the

214
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,520
 sound of my voice towards the end i'm just like and i had that was an episode that i enjoyed

215
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,160
 recording from a technical standpoint and from a storytelling standpoint but it's so grizzly and

216
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,000
 early in the podcast we did more we did some darker stuff and as the podcast has evolved i've

217
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,360
 kind of moved away from that the spear gun story is far darker than anything we've covered before

218
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,440
 i think so i know there's a lot of people who are like oh i listened to that episode while i was

219
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,280
 eating Cheerios it was no big deal i didn't yeah that's fine but for me it was disturbing and

220
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,000
 just a sheer inhumanity of it so you know now that i've pumped it up i think what i'll do and it

221
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,080
 will actually it is a recorded episode and i am running out of time this week so i'm going to

222
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,720
 just use this as a teaser for that story and i will release that one tomorrow because i thought

223
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,080
 i was like i'm just gonna do a quick overview of it but i'm just gonna i'll release the episode

224
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,840
 that i recorded i'll edit it up and to be honest that helps because like i said i'm short on time

225
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,960
 this week to have recorded a full episode to not release was making it difficult but i'm gonna

226
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,800
 have to go in and put an ending in it or something some in the movie the episode just ends i was just

227
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,160
 like i'm done but it is a very interesting story it's and but i'll warn you now if you're not into

228
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,960
 it's not super gory it's just so inhumane um if you're not into that just skip it just skip the

229
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,600
 next episode because the whole episode is just going to be that 20 minute story so i know i said

230
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,480
 it in the beginning but i'm gonna leave it in there as a i don't even want to call it a teaser

231
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,440
 because the episode's such a downer i thought about re-recording it with a big smile on my face

232
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,800
 just so the tone was lifted a bit but um we're gonna go ahead so actually that works out for me

233
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,880
 because that means i don't have to record an episode tomorrow but see now i feel bad because

234
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,000
 basically i've spent the last five minutes talking about let me give you an other interesting new

235
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 news story how's that i don't want you to feel like you just had to listen to how the sausage was

236
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,440
 made for five minutes and it was kind of out so let's give you another new news story here

237
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,200
 let's go out on a good note let's go out on a happy note so what do we got what do we got this was

238
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
 something i was going to talk about later but i think we'll find a good one for you here

239
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,520
 um here's one this is a funny one the year 2004

240
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,160
 we're in the country of Bahrain which if my geography tells me right it is

241
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,880
 uh the middle east the mess i don't know why it's based on that it's the middle east okay

242
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,240
 predominantly muslim country now everyone's chilling in the mosque and they're getting ready for

243
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:43,200
 their sermon and everyone's just kind of hanging out doing the thing and this dude walks up big old

244
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,960
 beard kind of moving towards the podium like they're going to deliver a sermon and the cleric

245
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,960
 who's in charge of the church or the mosque i guess is the technical term but the cleric who's

246
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,600
 in charge of the mosque notices this stranger he's never seen before start to walk up to the stand

247
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:09,440
 to deliver a sermon and the cleric goes hey hey are you here to to do a sermon and the cleric's like

248
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:18,400
 yeah i'm here i'm here to do a sermon i'm here to speak to these these fellow muslim people

249
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:27,520
 here in this mosque and the cleric he said in a he said in his quote his voice was strangely soft

250
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,200
 and his beard slipped as he spoke so imagine this big dude comes walking up and you've never

251
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,640
 seen him before and you're like hey man what's up and they're like oh nothing and then every time

252
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,440
 they move their fake beard is moving farther and farther down her his face actually you know

253
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,320
 nothing about the story isn't funny it's kind of horrific but in a different way what happened was

254
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:02,400
 so the cleric realizes that this is a woman with a beard on and she wanted to give a speech because

255
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,920
 her brother got arrested or was being prosecuted or persecuted one of the two for something that he

256
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,400
 may or may not have done and she went she was going to deliver this impassion this story's

257
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,360
 horrible this isn't funny jason this woman was going to deliver this impassioned speech on behalf

258
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,000
 of her brother but once the cleric realized that it was a woman he's like no get out get out you

259
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,320
 because they have to in strict muslim countries the women and the men are separated well and that

260
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,920
 she wasn't wearing a burqa or anything like that that would have been a bad disguise she has a full

261
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,320
 burqa and a beard and anyways a bunch of guys showed up in the overpowered her sorry i thought this

262
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:49,920
 story was gonna be funny here the image of a woman in a beard try it came off as something from like

263
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,160
 kids next door or like someone wearing a really bad disguise like a really bad sanisuit was how

264
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,080
 i envisioned the story when i read it but now as i'm reading it out loud it actually is quite sad

265
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,720
 that this woman broke all these rules to try to get her brother free and then she got manhandled

266
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,360
 she was surprisingly strong it took five men to get her out she did get arrested she did get

267
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,640
 bailed out of course this was in 2004 so i don't know what happened afterwards hopefully her and

268
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:26,320
 her brother are out doing fine man that story was not a fun story either yeah i just imagined it more

269
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,880
 like a bad sanisuit and then i realized all of the cultural and sexual and religious implications

270
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,920
 in that otherwise a slipping beard story now whenever i see a santa with a bad beard i'm like

271
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,640
 i'm gonna be reminded of this episode and it's christmas time so that's gonna happen a lot

272
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,200
 well thanks for bearing with me this was a weird episode it was kind of off the cuff

273
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,480
 because i made that change in the end but we will do the speargun story tomorrow i'm not trying to

274
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,880
 hype it up too much but it is an interesting story but again i have no problem if you guys give it
