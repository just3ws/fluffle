00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 Paranormal events continue to swarm around the host of America's fastest growing paranormal

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,280
 podcast.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,280
 That'd be me.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,240
 And then we travel to the United Kingdom to hang out with a couple friends who are smoking

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,920
 some weed.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
 It was a beautiful night.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,560
 Everything was completely calm.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,400
 Until the phone rang.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,560
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,480
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,720
 First off, let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our Christmas livestream contributors.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,720
 Everyone give it up for Alex.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 Woo yeah!

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,920
 Come on Alex, come on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or can't support the show financially through

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,520
 live streams, that's fine too.

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,160
 Just help spread the word about the show.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,480
 That really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,080
 I haven't really talked about this a lot.

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,480
 I think I mentioned it at the end of the last season.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,240
 I have a vacation coming up.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,520
 I know I just got done with a two week break but I actually have, that was just me sitting

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,680
 in a chair playing Minecraft.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,120
 I'm actually going down to visit some family in a couple weeks.

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,480
 So I am going to start pre-recording a bunch of episodes and then we're gonna have some

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,920
 new classic episodes.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,760
 I've been wanting to bring those back.

34
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,560
 I got a lot of behind the scenes stuff I want to talk about.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,440
 We're bringing back the classics so you guys I think will only notice I'm gone for one

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
 week.

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,080
 We'll have one week where there's no nothing but we've got a bunch of episodes coming up

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,120
 and then some behind the scenes classics, some drama that's happened behind the scenes.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,920
 All this stuff are gonna go through that and I can't wait to share that with you.

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,520
 Anyways, Alex, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,320
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,560
 We're gonna drive around the corner because we're gonna end up back at Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,800
 Because I wanted this, this is an interesting story I think and it involves me.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
 It involves me.

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 I want to start this off.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,080
 The other day people were talking about this on the Patreon Discord.

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,120
 They were talking about the paranormal activity that I've gone through.

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,160
 Specifically we're talking about the episode, I wasn't talking about it, they were talking

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,360
 about it, but the episode where, I'll see if I can even find it in the show, I don't

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,960
 even know if I put it in the show notes I was doing an episode and I saw what could

51
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,800
 only be described as a dog's paws, like a little dog, not a little dog, a big dog, walking

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,440
 by my recording studio door.

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,600
 I just saw the silhouette of its paws outside the door and it totally freaked me out.

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,440
 I left it in the recording, it completely freaked me out and I talked about it a bit

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,520
 and then I went on with the episode.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,560
 And then when they were talking about that in the Patreon Discord, one of my mods and

57
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
 a longtime supporter of the show Hot Diggity Dane wrote this.

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,360
 I've always wondered what it is about Jason that draws so many paranormal experiences.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,120
 The amount of episodes where phenomenon happens while recording are much more common than

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,440
 they ever should be.

61
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,600
 I fully believe that the experiences Jason has are authentic, but why is it happening

62
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,680
 so much to him?

63
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,600
 At first I thought it was like the old, you look into the paranormal long enough, eventually

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,480
 something will look back.

65
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,880
 But I've lived, that's a famous quote, right, it's a famous quote.

66
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,120
 Be careful if you search for monsters, you may become one, or if you stare into the abyss

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,020
 too long the abyss dares back.

68
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,600
 But he continues, "But I have listened to a lot of paranormal podcasts and have only

69
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,920
 encountered one other host that has had a solid encounter in the last few years and

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,800
 never while recording the podcast."

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,160
 So it's interesting, I read that, I don't think I responded to that comment, because

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,160
 I don't know.

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,760
 I don't know the answer to that either.

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,360
 It could be because the show's daily, here I'm going to be honest with you guys, it

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,260
 happens more often than I talk about on the show.

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:21,500
 I'm constantly editing out weird noises, constantly.

77
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,260
 A lot of times I'm in the studio, which is in my closet, which was haunted long before

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,380
 I started even doing the podcast, right?

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,820
 There are so many times when I'm recording and I can hear something walking around.

80
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:42,040
 Now I always think, "Maybe it's a neighbor, maybe it's a squirrel with size 11 shoes."

81
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
 I don't know.

82
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,240
 And then sometimes people are playing their television really loud and that kind of can

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
 come through on the mic.

84
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,880
 There's a lot of times while I'm editing it, sometimes I hear it when I'm recording and

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,560
 I'll have to stop and let whatever it is pass.

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,440
 And again, I'm always thinking it's something rational.

87
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,760
 There's sometimes I'm editing and I hear a noise and I'm like, "I have no idea what

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,860
 in the world made that noise."

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,420
 None.

90
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,260
 But I edit it out.

91
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,460
 I think there might have been one or two episodes where I left it in and I don't remember if

92
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,020
 I ever jumped into the editing process.

93
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,220
 See that's the thing, usually I record the episode.

94
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,940
 Then a couple days later I'm editing it and sometimes if I'm in a rush I'm editing it that

95
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
 same day.

96
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,620
 I'm recording and editing the same day and I just like chopping stuff up to get it out

97
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,620
 there.

98
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,820
 Now obviously if I picked up, someone's like, "Help me!" or something like that.

99
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,320
 But I'm going to leave it in the editing process.

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,240
 I'm going to come in on the mic and say, "Oh, I don't know what that was."

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,520
 But usually I will just chop it out because I don't know what it is.

102
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,920
 I can't control my environment around me as far as like making sure no one else is playing

103
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,880
 loud music or anything like that.

104
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
 You know, who knows, right?

105
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,960
 I just chop it up.

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:58,120
 And I also have edited out whole segments about paranormal activity that's happened

107
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,320
 to me.

108
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,420
 I actually did this whole segment a while back and I cut it for time.

109
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,500
 You're like, "Jayson, what are you doing when I told you this story?"

110
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,300
 When I was putting the episode together, generally I just have notes, right?

111
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,220
 I'm going off the notes and I went into the segway.

112
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,220
 I think it was even during a live episode.

113
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,740
 So the Patreon Discord users heard me talk about this for like 10 minutes.

114
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,980
 I'm not going to talk about it that long.

115
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,780
 And then I edited it out when I was doing the episode to try to have them in underneath

116
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,560
 40 minutes just for convenience to you guys, right?

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,160
 You guys don't have all day long to be listening to stuff.

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,840
 So I figured I would talk about it again at some point.

119
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,600
 Going back to the paranormal dog story, I saw a, what looked like the paws of a dog.

120
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,400
 Like if a dog walked by a door and you only had that little half an inch to inch gap underneath

121
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,360
 between the door and the floor and you saw a dog walk by, that's what it looked like.

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 That's exactly what it looked like.

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,240
 And it totally scared me.

124
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,820
 There were probably about two, I might even be, I'm going to say two to three weeks, but

125
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,940
 honestly it might have been four to five weeks.

126
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,340
 When I was walking around town, right out of the corner of my, it happened so often,

127
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,420
 it was driving me nuts.

128
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,460
 I'd be having my headphones on, I'd be listening to my music out of the corner of my eye and

129
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,580
 it would always be about maybe like 20, 30 yards away.

130
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,660
 There would be a black dog.

131
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,240
 And I'd turn and I'd look because I hate loose dogs.

132
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,360
 You cannot understand how much I despise these things because I had to fight one once.

133
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,640
 I had to fight in a quita.

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,160
 Think I talked about it on the show before, but I had to fight in a quita and if I haven't,

135
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,560
 then I'll do it in a later episode.

136
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,720
 I had to fight in a quita.

137
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 I had to save this dude's life because he was being chewed up by this massive dog, bread

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,080
 for war.

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,780
 I hate loose dogs and I used to hate dogs.

140
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:02,820
 I had to go to dog therapy to not hate all dogs after that event because it bit him so

141
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,140
 hard and broke his wrist and he was just leaking, dude.

142
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,500
 This dude was just bloody everywhere.

143
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,540
 I think I've talked about it before on the show though.

144
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,700
 So I hate loose dogs.

145
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,940
 So whenever I see, and that's just one of my experiences of loose dogs, that's the

146
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,460
 most, that's the one that really set me up.

147
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,280
 Whenever I see a loose dog, it always draws my attention.

148
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,360
 It always creeps me out.

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,760
 I'm then looking for the owner while I'm reaching for my pepper gel.

150
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 Right?

151
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,120
 It's this thing.

152
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,520
 And after I saw the dog walk by the studio door for about, I'd say, for a period of time,

153
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,400
 for a good period of time, I kept seeing the dog out of the corner of my eye.

154
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,360
 Now because I'm so paranoid about loose dogs for the first dozen times, I just thought,

155
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,780
 you're just jumpy.

156
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
 You're just jumpy.

157
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
 It was weird.

158
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,380
 It almost always was on the left side that I'd see it.

159
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,740
 But I thought, you're just jumpy.

160
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,820
 But as it continued over the weeks, I started to make the connection that this could be

161
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,580
 related to the ghost dog in the studio.

162
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,500
 And I think the story I was, I think I can be able to find the episode.

163
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,740
 I think the story I was talking about was about a ghost dog.

164
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,620
 I started seeing this ghost dog walking around town.

165
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,100
 It was driving me nuts.

166
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,200
 And once I, again, at first I just thought I was actually seeing a real dog and then

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,260
 I would turn and I wouldn't see anything.

168
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,080
 May know connection that eventually I started thinking, what if it's related to what I saw

169
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,580
 in the studio?

170
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,320
 And I still continued to see this dog out of the corner of my eye, sometimes on the right

171
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,880
 side, but mostly on the left side.

172
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,480
 And then it totally stopped.

173
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
 The phenomenon completely stopped.

174
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,360
 And it was good because I was so jumpy.

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
 I was so jumpy whenever I saw this thing.

176
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,100
 And then one day, and I again edited this out of the episode, I'm sitting in the studio

177
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
 recording episode.

178
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,980
 I look and I see the pause walk back by the door.

179
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,100
 And I freaked out again and I was like, okay, I'm not even doing this anymore.

180
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
 I don't want this.

181
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,660
 People think this is some ARG or something like that.

182
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,700
 So I regained my, I opened the door.

183
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,500
 I was like, okay, this is just something that's going to happen now.

184
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,700
 And I was, I kept trying to figure out what it was.

185
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,940
 I, I thought I had figured it out for a moment.

186
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,080
 I thought it was my bathrobe, which would be a accurate thing.

187
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,840
 My bathrobe arm thingy.

188
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,880
 What's that thing on the, the bathrobe cloth.

189
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,000
 You're just describing a bathroom, the belt, the belt.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,520
 I thought that was swinging, but it's simply not low enough.

191
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,800
 But yeah, so I don't know.

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,400
 And now it's all, now I don't, I started to see that a couple more times.

193
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,640
 All I was recording, I was like, what, I was like thinking, am I doing, am I like gesticulating

194
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,140
 so much in the closet that I'm causing this?

195
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,380
 Like I was still trying to rationally think, and then it went away.

196
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:53,380
 And that's the interesting thing is if it was a physical cause and nothing changed, I'm

197
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,100
 doing the same gesticulations.

198
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,340
 My bathrobe is the same way, all of that stuff from the time I started recording in the closet

199
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,700
 really until that.

200
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,180
 And then after it's gone now again, I don't see the dog footprints outside the closet

201
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,940
 or the silhouette of the dog.

202
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,940
 It was weird.

203
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,140
 It was always walking from east to west.

204
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,120
 It was always walking like from east to west.

205
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,160
 I don't know how to explain any of it.

206
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,080
 Because again, if it was something I was doing, I started, I remember there was a point where

207
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,600
 I was going, I have to be doing that.

208
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,880
 This has to be something that I'm physically making the silhouette appear.

209
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
 But I don't know, man, it's super weird.

210
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,560
 And the reason that reminded me to really talk about that was again, just the other

211
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,180
 day Sabine, well actually months ago she made me this "Get Well" sign for Bigfoot because

212
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
 I was sick, right?

213
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,020
 I'm sure you guys, I'm sure a lot of you are listeners of this show now, I'm sick all

214
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
 the time.

215
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,100
 And it's always something either incredibly minor or incredibly rare.

216
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,900
 I have all sorts of weird ailments, but usually I'm just a big, big old baby, right?

217
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
 My tummy hurts, I'm sick.

218
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
 I'm just kind of rolling around on the ground.

219
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,620
 She made me this "Bigfoot, Get Well" sign and I hung it up and then a couple months later

220
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,620
 I lost it.

221
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,540
 It fell down behind something.

222
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,720
 She got all butt hurt.

223
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,360
 She goes, "I made you something."

224
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,560
 Come on man, you know how heavy that bookshelf is?

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,680
 I gotta move this wall, you know?

226
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,920
 So anyways, you know, of course guys, I moved the bookshelf and I went to go find it.

227
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,120
 And that bookshelf, when Jen came in to feng shui my apartment, we pretty much moved everything,

228
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,520
 but we didn't move the bookshelf because that's where my television was.

229
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,160
 I was like, you know, I don't watch television anymore.

230
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,060
 The bookshelf has really not been moved for at least, I would say, 11 years.

231
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
 Maybe 10.

232
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,020
 Maybe I'll quibble by a year, but I'm pretty sure it's been there for a long period of time.

233
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,620
 I moved it just a little bit and got my grabber.

234
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
 That's the thing that all old men get.

235
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,060
 So they don't have to bend over and pick stuff up.

236
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,940
 I got a little grabber from Walgreens, reached in and there were three things behind this

237
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,940
 bookshelf.

238
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,100
 Three things.

239
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,540
 Which is crazy considering how chaotic my bookshelf is.

240
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,880
 I might take a picture of it for the image for this episode.

241
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,400
 But three things.

242
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,760
 An old receipt, which was close.

243
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,480
 It was like just fell out of the garbage can like a week ago.

244
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,160
 The big foot, get well picture.

245
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,840
 And this letter.

246
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,560
 And I picked it up and it says to Grandma McGee.

247
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,460
 It was my great grandma McGee.

248
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,980
 And basically the letter, so I'm not going to read it in full.

249
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,700
 But the letter basically is me saying I'm afraid you're not going to get better soon.

250
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,740
 And I'm more afraid that when you die I'm not going to see you in heaven.

251
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,940
 Because I don't know if you're a born again Christian.

252
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,580
 That's what this letter goes on to say and it's asking her to take Jesus Christ into

253
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
 her heart.

254
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,060
 All of that.

255
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,440
 If you read this letter and believe then I will not have to be afraid of missing you.

256
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,840
 Love you dearly Jason.

257
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,280
 That's how the letter ends.

258
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,720
 And I look at this.

259
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,880
 I have no idea how this letter got behind my bookshelf.

260
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
 None.

261
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,240
 Zero.

262
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,800
 It's a full page.

263
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,080
 First off, okay so my great grandma died.

264
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,200
 I guess I should have given you a little bit of context.

265
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,800
 She died in August 2001.

266
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,900
 See this letter, in August of 2001 I was an adult.

267
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,700
 I could have sat down and had this conversation with another adult and say hey you know I

268
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,540
 know things aren't going well let's talk about what I believe in.

269
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,500
 Let's talk about the afterlife.

270
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,580
 So I would have had to write this, if I wrote this letter I would have had to have been

271
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,060
 probably under the age of 15, 16.

272
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,180
 Because at that point I was confident enough in my, I'm Southern Baptist right.

273
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,060
 I would have been confident enough.

274
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,060
 My religion doctor, she was Catholic right.

275
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,720
 It's not like she was from crazy culture or something like that.

276
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,000
 Or you know like a full on atheist or anything like that.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,720
 So this letter at the very least though is 21 years old.

278
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,680
 And again I don't think I wrote it then.

279
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,280
 She was in a rest home.

280
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,600
 But I think I wrote this letter closer probably to around the age when I was 12.

281
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,080
 Which would put this around 30 years old.

282
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
 More than that right?

283
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,320
 33 years old.

284
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,560
 That's a creepy number.

285
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,340
 This piece of paper, this piece of paper could be up to 33 years old.

286
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,940
 It looks like I wrote it, I don't know maybe a year or two ago.

287
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,740
 And the reason why I say that is there's hardly any yellowing on it.

288
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,980
 When I showed it to Sabine she goes, I don't know when you wrote it either.

289
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,980
 I couldn't, it's been exactly the same since you were a kid.

290
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,500
 But she goes I'll tell you this, this piece of paper does not look like it was behind

291
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
 that shelf for 10 years.

292
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,660
 And I said that.

293
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,100
 I go minimum.

294
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,560
 I go I will allow when I used to have a television set up there that maybe I moved it to one

295
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
 side or another.

296
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,720
 But for the past 10 years I've lived here for 11 years that thing has not moved.

297
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,200
 There were three things behind it.

298
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,960
 Bigfoot, not actual bigfoot but the bigfoot picture.

299
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,160
 The dirty receipt that had just fallen out of the garbage can and then this piece of

300
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 paper.

301
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,360
 Now this is one of those things that I don't necessarily classify as paranormal but I don't

302
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,520
 know how to classify it.

303
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,620
 I don't remember writing it but I'm sure that I did.

304
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,740
 This is something I would have done when I was a child.

305
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,340
 I just have no idea.

306
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,980
 The only thing I can think of is I did write this as a child and my grandma when she passed

307
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:42,900
 away she gave me a little box of her lighters.

308
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,940
 She had collected, she was a lifelong smoker.

309
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,700
 Smokers that she was 12.

310
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
 She died at 92.

311
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,120
 She had a collection of really cool lighters.

312
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
 When I say really cool lighters there was like a Zippo in there and then there was like

313
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,960
 an old lighter.

314
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,920
 Then she also tossed in a 98 cent lighter from Albertsons.

315
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,560
 It says Albertsons on it.

316
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,760
 That was in there too.

317
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,920
 My Albertsons lighter is up on my shelf.

318
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
 It has a spot.

319
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
 It has a location for that lighter.

320
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,360
 The rest of the cooler lighters are actually locked away in a box.

321
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,980
 The storage area with the Albertsons lighter which I also think is cool.

322
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,140
 It's like up among all of my Chachkeets, all of my toys I've collected over the years.

323
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,300
 That's how much I value that lighter.

324
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:34,020
 I can't imagine a scenario where I got this letter and then just tossed it on my bookcase.

325
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,700
 Now if I do take a photo of my bookcase you'll see a couple books by Joe McKinney, the famous

326
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
 zombie author.

327
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
 He's really good.

328
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,700
 Then I got like a copy of Star Trek meets X-Men on there.

329
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,760
 Then a few PlayStation games, some LEGO stuff.

330
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
 It's not really a bookshelf.

331
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,560
 I probably should stop calling it.

332
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,680
 You'll see a bunch of other greeting cards up there that I've collected over the years.

333
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,600
 But really I should say over the past two years.

334
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,240
 But I wouldn't have put something this valuable just sitting on there.

335
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,440
 So why am I talking about this?

336
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,040
 Did this manifest?

337
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,280
 This does not look like it.

338
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,240
 I'll take a photo of it for the show notes.

339
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,620
 It definitely does not look like it was sitting behind that shelf for ten years.

340
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,860
 I don't know how I would have gotten back there.

341
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,580
 And I don't know why I would have found it now.

342
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,260
 Like Sabine's been complaining about that stupid Bigfoot picture for like nine, ten

343
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
 months.

344
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,540
 That's the only crafty thing I make.

345
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,460
 I don't do any arts and crafts and I finally do something and you lose behind your bookshelf.

346
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,280
 I don't know whatever.

347
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,640
 So I finally go back there and I get it and then I find this.

348
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,040
 I don't know what this means.

349
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,520
 Now it's possible that it's just the letter.

350
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 Well it's not just a letter.

351
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
 I wrote it to my great grandma.

352
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
 I love my great grandma.

353
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,760
 It's possible that I did write that letter and then it came in the little box that she

354
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,040
 gave me the lighters in.

355
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,480
 That's most likely how I got possession of it at some point.

356
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,560
 And then I might have had it sitting up there.

357
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,060
 If you look at my shelf you realize well he has some greeting cards from his mom and then

358
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,780
 like X-Men comic books.

359
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,900
 The things covered in filth.

360
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,420
 I don't imagine myself putting it up there.

361
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,740
 My question is why did I find it now?

362
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,900
 And I'm going to wrap up this segment.

363
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,180
 Again I don't know if it's paranormal.

364
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,380
 I don't know if there's any meaning behind it.

365
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,500
 It's just a weird thing.

366
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,420
 I'm going to wrap this segment up by a weird Jason story.

367
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:34,060
 When a close associate of mine dies like a family member or a close friend.

368
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,440
 I don't have sex for like two weeks.

369
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
 I don't have sex.

370
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
 I don't masturbate.

371
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,980
 I do nothing sexual for two weeks minimum.

372
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,160
 Because I think their ghost might see me.

373
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
 It's a totally real story.

374
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,920
 Someone passes away that I know.

375
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
 I figure.

376
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,360
 Here's the reason why it's only two weeks.

377
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,400
 Because after week three or four being a ghost you're probably like going to movies.

378
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
 Probably haunting movie theaters.

379
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,100
 I know when I die I want to hang out to the bottom of the ocean.

380
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,060
 I want my ghost to check out all of those caves under water.

381
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,100
 Like the deepest points of the ocean.

382
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,860
 I think like maybe like my grandpa will be like oh yeah you know I didn't talk to my

383
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,340
 grandson Jason enough.

384
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
 Now that I'm dead maybe I'll go see what he's like.

385
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,380
 Oh gross gross oh no and he's flown away.

386
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,180
 So it's a it's not like there's no reason behind it.

387
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,180
 No one's ever told me like that that's a thing.

388
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,300
 Like it's a superstition or something.

389
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
 I just don't.

390
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,460
 I'm showering with all my clothes on.

391
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,120
 Don't look at me.

392
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,880
 Don't look at me naked you ghost.

393
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
 I don't.

394
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,600
 And it's so weird because generally every time someone close to me dies within about a week

395
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,960
 or two I dream of them.

396
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,440
 They come in and now it's not anything dramatic.

397
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,560
 It's not like I'm dreaming and they show up and they're like hey I'm just here to say

398
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
 goodbye.

399
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,200
 I really had fun knowing you and I was glad to be your friend.

400
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,520
 Nothing like that right.

401
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,080
 I'll have a dream and they'll be in the dream.

402
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,980
 They're just in the dream and sometimes I will I won't remember the dream that they're

403
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,580
 in.

404
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,220
 I'll simply wake up and I'll have the feeling whoa.

405
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,380
 Like that was the dream.

406
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,420
 Like I won't it's it's hard to say like sometimes I'll have the dream and I'll know that they

407
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
 are in it.

408
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,140
 And then sometimes I'll just wake up and I won't remember my dream but I go oh I dreamt

409
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,340
 about them last night.

410
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,620
 Like I got the feeling that they had said in some way not dramatically again saying goodbye

411
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,480
 is they're like fading away or anything like that.

412
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:41,200
 I have the dream about a dead relative and it's it's it's weird right.

413
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,080
 Again I just have the feeling like that was them appearing in the afterlife in some way.

414
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,160
 It's usually within a week or two I get the feeling that they have moved on except for

415
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,240
 one time.

416
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,160
 This is so weird.

417
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,440
 My grandma Miller great grandma McGee's daughter grandma Miller she died.

418
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,900
 We talked about this on the show to the phone call story but this was such a weird paranormal

419
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,220
 thing that happened to me.

420
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,660
 When my grandma Miller died it was a huge thing because once she was like the matriarch

421
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,620
 of the family and I remember knowing this right I lived with grandma Miller for a while

422
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,020
 and I lived with grandma McGee for a while.

423
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,540
 I spent almost every summer with grandma McGee and I lived one entire year when I was going

424
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,200
 to elementary school with grandma McGee and when I was adult I lived with grandma Miller

425
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,320
 and I remember knowing and saying when grandma Miller dies the family falls apart.

426
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,840
 I go the only thing we all have in common is grandma Miller like all these different

427
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,600
 groups all these different groups of people and unfortunately she did die.

428
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,100
 It was completely avoidable.

429
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:51,880
 It was 100% avoidable but there are this huge family drama going on at the time.

430
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:59,540
 I'm not going to get into the specifics of it but family always had a lot of drama and

431
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,540
 there is this huge family drama going on and she ended up passing away.

432
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,220
 You could have been avoided had she had.

433
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:16,580
 Anyways I did not have that dream for months months.

434
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:23,240
 I remember when she first passed away I was with my mom and that was her mom and it was

435
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,000
 one of the worst sounds I'd ever heard a human make when my mom got the phone call that her

436
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,640
 mother had died.

437
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:39,480
 I've been around all sorts of human suffering throughout my life but hearing a daughter cry

438
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,440
 out for her mother it was I was sitting in the car where the Dairy Queen drive through

439
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,580
 and she gets the phone call.

440
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
 I couldn't eat.

441
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,540
 I mean it was just it was gut wrenching and of course you know I'm my mom's son and I

442
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,980
 had to kind of you know calm her down you know get her back home.

443
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,580
 But grief right it was unexpected it was an unexpected death.

444
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,660
 My grandma Miller was old but what she died of could have been prevented.

445
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,820
 So anyways and I technically don't know the medical definition what she what killed her

446
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,240
 but this was a couple years ago this would have been like five or six years ago.

447
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,960
 But anyways the sound my mother made it was awful.

448
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,600
 I gotta I gotta be the straight man right I gotta get up this episode.

449
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,240
 I started going from ghost I did not plan on talking about this.

450
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
 So I get my mom to calm down.

451
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,280
 There will be two large blizzards please Oreo thank you.

452
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:46,420
 We get to her house and again you know just trying to console my mom and then talking

453
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,500
 to people on the phone because they're in Sacramento we're in Hood River and all this

454
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,420
 stuff and then we make arrangements to go down for the funeral.

455
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,620
 And I remember that it had been maybe three or four months after she had passed away.

456
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,780
 I gave myself a couple weeks before I could grieve right because I was trying to help

457
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,900
 my mom.

458
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,640
 I spent a lot of time with my grandma like I lived with her for many many years and then

459
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:19,120
 after a couple weeks I finally gave myself you know an hour or two to cry and then you

460
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,320
 know you you move on.

461
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,160
 And so anyways though it was probably like month three or four I had realized I haven't

462
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:35,160
 dreamt about her yet and that scared me because I always figured that the joy of my life was

463
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,160
 that the dream was them moving on to a better place obviously.

464
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,740
 I didn't dream about I didn't dream about Grandma Miller.

465
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,440
 Month four month five still no dreams not even that I didn't remember the dream but

466
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,600
 I had the feeling nothing.

467
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,520
 Grandma Miller made sure you are of this huge family and not only did we have the biological

468
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,440
 family but tons of step uncles and step cousins and all of this stuff.

469
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
 Huge family.

470
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,760
 I don't think it is she trying to figure something out is she like staying behind to does she

471
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,800
 have some business she needs to attend to like all of this classic ghost stuff because

472
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,080
 my great grandma McGee I loved incredibly dearly.

473
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:30,380
 I have very few regrets in my life very few and one of them is not stopping by more often

474
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,000
 when she was in the rest home because she never hesitated to take care of me but I thought

475
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,120
 she lived forever she was 92 years old 93 I think even thought she wouldn't live forever.

476
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,440
 I drive by the rest home on my way to my house and be like hey Grandma I just kind of wave

477
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,120
 she's like going from the window I just figured it doesn't matter if I go today or tomorrow

478
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,440
 she's never gonna die.

479
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,440
 It's one of the very very very few regrets I have in my life but I dreamt about her right

480
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,700
 in that two week period I had a dream about her.

481
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,420
 I did not have a single dream about Grandma Miller now we're on month five and I started

482
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:10,500
 thinking maybe she's handling some unfinished business or maybe something bad has happened

483
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,740
 other than her dying maybe something bad has happened to her soul.

484
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:24,180
 And I remember on month six I had a dream I was at Grandma Miller's house and she was

485
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:30,960
 there big smile on her face just being Grandma Miller just taking care of all of us.

486
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,800
 Nothing spectacular about the dream there were no omens or signs or symbols there was no

487
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,280
 kiss goodbye as she walked into the ether nothing it was just a normal dream but my

488
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:49,440
 Grandma Miller was in it when I go okay Grandma I'm a little worried there for a while thought

489
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,060
 something happened to you but you're in a better place.

490
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:01,660
 I don't even know why I started telling that story in the first place honestly I know we

491
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,700
 were talking about the letter but yeah I mean we're not gonna get to the phone story I hope

492
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
 this was entertaining.

493
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,140
 See the funny thing is like I edit stuff out when I talk about personal stuff because a

494
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,460
 lot of times like I did the whole segment about seeing the ghost dog out on my field

495
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,000
 of view and all that stuff and then I was listening to him I was like this isn't interesting

496
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,480
 this is boring so I edited out I edited out for time and then I never brought it back

497
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,760
 up I think I recorded that segment like three or four more than that because I just got

498
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,560
 done with a two week break it was like a month or two ago I did that segment I was like ah

499
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,520
 whatever it's boring it's boring then I'm getting haunted by this ghost dog when I was

500
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,080
 doing a segment again I think it was about a ghost dog and then I kept seeing this dog

501
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,420
 out of the field of view and no one would see it.

502
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,060
 So I hope that this story was entertaining I hope this episode was entertaining and to

503
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:56,260
 go back to hot diggity Danes thing we'll finish it up like this I find my life I'm not gonna

504
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,340
 say that my life is completely normal but I don't think it is incredibly interesting

505
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,460
 by any metric.

506
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,620
 I was watching the Dave Chappelle special the other day he was at his old college or

507
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,500
 high school and they were gonna put his name on the side of the building the side of the

508
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,240
 art center right and he was talking about his life and how he got into comedy and I'm

509
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,040
 sitting there and I was like oh my god this dude's life is so interesting I can't imagine

510
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,760
 being interviewed by someone and them asking me about my life and I'd be like well I can

511
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,640
 tell you a couple ghost stories I mean I can tell you a whole bunch of ghost stories I've

512
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,400
 read about and I can tell you a couple ghost stories that I've been in but I don't find

513
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,920
 my life particularly interesting.

514
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,080
 Obviously there's a few standout things I can say stuff like I saw shadow people I fought

515
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,900
 a witch I've seen demonically possessed people but see then I go well who hasn't you can

516
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,900
 read all sorts of accounts online of people who have done similar and more exceptional

517
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,500
 things so I don't think my life is super interesting and I don't think regarding hot diggity dogs

518
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:06,380
 question I don't think there's anything incredibly special about me either I mean I don't think

519
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,120
 I'm any more special than you I think we're all special in our own way but again if 8

520
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,400
 billion people are special in their own way yeah sure but I don't I'll be honest I don't

521
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:23,840
 think there's something about the show that's causing paranormal phenomenon to pop up I

522
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,760
 think the only thing I can think of for hot diggity dogs question was why does Jason seem

523
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,080
 to have this more I the only thing I can think of is one I'm recording in a place that's

524
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,260
 no one haunted which is the closet we didn't have these see I've been recording these past

525
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,180
 I don't know five six episodes and quite a few going forward in the living room where

526
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,540
 I used to record my podcast first 500 episodes were recorded in the living room now that

527
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,860
 it's so hot this is the coolest place to record in the audio quality takes a little bit of

528
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,940
 a hit but and there's more background noise but I there's been I as far as I remember

529
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,100
 there has been no paranormal activity I don't think I was talking about any of it when I

530
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,520
 was recording in the living room and even in those early episodes I talked about my closet

531
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 being haunted I knew my closet was haunted within a week of moving in here and since

532
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,840
 I removed the recording studio into the closet I would say the main reason I don't think

533
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,600
 it's anything about me I that could be it right I was also thinking this is the only

534
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,840
 as far as I know there's only two daily paranormal shows that are actively in production this

535
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,700
 one and then the ghost hunters have one the taps guys do a if it I'm pretty sure it's

536
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:38,300
 around a daily ghost podcast that's it so it could also be the fact that it's daily

537
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,540
 right recording stuff all the time but I'd say anything it's more of the location than

538
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,140
 anything I don't think it's anything about the show and I think it's anything about me

539
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,740
 I don't know but you know that's the thing with paranormal activity I said this on really

540
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,120
 yesterday's episode you doesn't always have a dramatic ending it doesn't always have this

541
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,140
 big thing it's not like this letter is going to burst into flames and my great grandma

542
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,120
 McGee's gonna appear to me tonight with three keys and she says one of these keys will unlock

543
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,600
 your destiny I don't know probably not probably not she has a ghost dog she's like get him

544
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,960
 boys the dogs maul me to death in my sleep my astral body is torn to shreds I hate loose

545
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,400
 dogs and I hate reading stories about people being mauled by packs of dogs and yet I read

546
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,220
 them all the time and I want to tell you guys this I am doing you a service by not covering

547
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:34,980
 it every time I come across it they are grotesque grotesque I think people should be criminally

548
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:42,220
 liable for whatever their dogs do they are like financially liable sure and sometimes

549
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,420
 people catch charges like a manslaughter charge but if your dog your dog should be considered

550
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:56,720
 an extension of you I should be able to reko act you which means if you are in a gang

551
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,760
 and a member of a gang commits a crime the entire gang is charged with that crime if

552
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:10,800
 you own if you own a dog that is mistreated you treat I'm not saying like a dog that goes

553
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,440
 wild right but if you get multiple reports that your dogs are violent in the neighborhood

554
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,100
 and that's what all of these stories are about every story goes yeah they got multiple reports

555
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,020
 they got multiple reports over the years of these dogs chasing kids and then one day this

556
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:34,180
 woman was walking down the street and they ate her colon these dogs ate her colon and

557
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:41,260
 her esophagus and both of her arms and one of her legs that's horrific and her face that's

558
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,400
 horrific that's the worst she's still alive right she's still alive they come on man I

559
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,160
 think I think whoever owned those dogs should be charged for eating a woman's colon I think

560
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:58,800
 you should be able to reko act them but I digress I digress in this sweet and I don't know
