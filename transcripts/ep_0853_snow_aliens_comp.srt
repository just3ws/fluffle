00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 What happens when you're recording a paranormal podcast and the world of the paranormal wants a sneak peek at your latest episode?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Then we travel to a lonely road in Georgia where an overnight attendant is besieged by a smelly vagrant.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 It's paranormal. It's not just some weirdo, it's not just some smelly oboe walking around. It's paranormal.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And then we uncover a brand new conspiracy theory that's currently making the rounds. Well, one guy's talking about it, so we're gonna talk about it on the show.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Is it possible that elderly people are actually grey aliens in disguise today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 [music]

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Also, I hope you're not over the age of 65 because you might be a grey alien and then you might want to kill me for the second story.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But before we get to that, before we get to your elderly enraged vengeance streak against me, let's go ahead and introduce our Patreon supporter.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I don't know how old this guy is. This guy might be 88.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give a round of applause to LecannionLifter.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Woo! Come on in, Lecannion. Yeah, give you a big round of applause. Checking your ID, seeing how old you are.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Lecannion actually used to be a Patreon and then something happened and they stopped. They're like, "Your show started to suck, bro."

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Now, something happened and they stopped, but they're joined back on. So thank you so much, Lecannion.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. You can scan to where the Patreon. I totally get it. Trust me, I do.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Lecannion, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jet.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Actually, no, we're not going anywhere right now. Give me those keys back, bro.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I want to tell you guys this. If you guys listened to yesterday's episode, it might have ended a little bit abrupt.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I haven't finished the final edit of yesterday's episode, but actually our first story takes place here in Dead Rabbit Command, here in the recording studio.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 What happened yesterday was I was finishing up the story about the ghost car. It was really cool.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I really liked the story of the guy walking around taking the trail through Georgia. Got some good Georgia stories this week.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Let me play you the audio. I edited this out because I thought it was too distracting. It's definitely too distracting, right?

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So here, let me set this up for you. When I'm recording, I do record in a closet.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I call it the haunted closet because I have sensed the ghost in this closet before, but it's really been a long time since I've seen anything in my house or really anything even in the closet.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Now, as a studio, it does what it does. It has pretty good audio, but it also gets really, really hot.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 These were my first episodes coming back from a long break. I was super nervous. I was just sweating the whole time.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 So what I did was at a certain point, I cracked open the door. I know that's not good for studio recording.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 They normally don't snoop dog. Normally it doesn't go, "Hey, I'm about to bust the track."

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Open the windows. Let's get all that outside noise. But I open the door.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Okay. The door's open maybe, I don't know, a little less than a foot.

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I'm getting some sunlight in here. I'm getting some fresh air.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And if you've never, I do a live show every Sunday morning for the Patreon supporters.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 They'll often see this. Sometimes I add video to it. They definitely hear it.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 None of this show is really scripted. It's all just notes. And then I just kind of go off the top of my head.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 That's why I'm always laughing at the jokes, because it's the first time I've heard those jokes too, right?

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But a lot of times I come to the end of an episode and I'll just kind of go riff for like 10 minutes trying to find the right combination of words to wrap up an episode.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And that's what was happening yesterday. And I'm sitting there in my closet.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I'm trying to figure out a good way to wrap up the story about a guy who saw a ghost car.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And I just can't find it. And you know, it's like 8 o'clock at night. I'm super tired and I'm super sweaty.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And I look out the little, I look out my door, right?

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I'm just kind of gazing around trying to think of a way to finish this episode. And when I look out the door, I see an apparition.

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I straight up see a ghost.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Well, okay, so what I see, it's so weird. I turn and I look.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And I see standing right outside my door like this thing was watching me record the podcast.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It was as if you took a ribbon. Now it was a black ribbon that was bold black on the edges.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And in the middle was like a translucent almost see through almost smoky material.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I turned and I look and I saw hovering there for a good few seconds, hovering there a ribbon.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And it looked like if you had an invisible woman, invisible man standing outside your closet, like you're like, "Oh, I know exactly what that looks like, Jason."

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 If you had an invisible person and you placed a ribbon on them, you could see, I could see the outline of the top of their head.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And then it came down and then was the outline of their left shoulder.

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 The ribbon was probably about maybe two feet long.

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And I'm turning, I'm going to play the clip for you without any audio processing or anything.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I'll play that for you in a second so you can kind of hear what was going on while I was experiencing this.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 But I turn and I look because I'm just trying to think of a way to end this episode.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I've been just recording for like two hours at this point. I did two episodes back to back yesterday.

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 So I look and I see this ribbony, this smoky ribbony thing outside of my closet in full bedroom light, you know, full lamp.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Jason's not saying to the term, you know, full light bulb light.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And I see it and it hangs there for a second and then it disappears.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And it doesn't go, "Bip!" It doesn't disappear like a flash. It just slowly fades from view.

62
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And you can hear the audio of me experiencing this. I just stopped talking and I'll play that for you right now.

63
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I think the answer to that is pretty clear. We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods or down dark alleys or inside houses.

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods and very, very few of them ever return.

65
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Would you be one of them? Would you be one of those that make it back to the world of our reality?

66
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Dude, no joke.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 [door opens]

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 There was something standing outside my closet watching me record that.

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 That was insane.

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Yeah. I turned. I don't know why I turned to look. You guys might have even heard me turn while I was talking.

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 This is not scripted and nothing like that. I don't mess around with this type of stuff.

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Like, I don't joke about this stuff. No, he profools or nothing.

73
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I turned and I looked.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And it was like a black ribbon.

75
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It would have been about maybe six feet tall, but it was a black ribbon.

76
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But it looked. Damn it.

77
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'm like, oh no, apparently there's a phenomenon in my house.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I do have to live here. I do have to sit in this closet.

79
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 It's probably, it would be like if you put a ribbon on somebody's head and like laid across the top of their head.

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 But there's no ribbon. I don't know how often you guys watch videos of my house.

81
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I'm not a big ribbon aficionado. That was weird.

82
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I got that was creepy.

83
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 There was straight up something watching me do that.

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I don't know how much of the clip I'm actually going to play for you, but what if I don't play at all?

85
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 What I do is then I get up and I walk around my bedroom.

86
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I'm kind of processing what I saw and I'm still talking into the microphone. I'm saying how tall.

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 So here's the thing. This is the weird thing about ghosts.

88
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 There's a weird thing about ghosts.

89
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 There's a weird thing about ghosts.

90
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 There's a weird thing about ghosts.

91
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 There's a weird thing about ghosts.

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 There's a weird thing about ghosts.

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 There's dead people or demons or whatever they are.

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 But one thing that I've had in my experience, because I've seen a lot of ghosts in my life, is ghosts don't,

95
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 if it's a real ghost in a place that I'm at, I'm not scared of it.

96
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I'm a little bit, be a little bit at ease, like uneasy.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 If it's real, I'm not scared. If it's fake, I'm scared.

98
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 So I saw this black ribbon materialized outside my closet, like it was peeking in, not scared.

99
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 When about my business, I actually went into the living room and while I was kind of editing episodes and stuff like that,

100
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I see something out of the corner of my eye in the living room.

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And then my black mouse, you know, my computer mouse is black and it's shiny.

102
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I actually see something move over the mouse, like the reflection changed.

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 So we also had that stuff going on as well.

104
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 So I wasn't scared, right?

105
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Came in, shut my light off to go to bed, pulled down my phone, goofing off, going to stupid websites, stuff like that.

106
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Went to bed.

107
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Even though I saw a ghost that don't know what it is, don't know what its intent is, I see it in here.

108
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Yesterday morning, I was walking to work. I just watched the movie The Bye Bye Man.

109
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I'd watched the movie The Bye Bye Man and I was walking to work and I was thinking of the Bye Bye Man

110
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and a squirrel jumped out of a bush and I almost peed my pants.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 It's so weird. It's so weird like something that's fake will scare me.

112
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 The Bye Bye Man, I'm like, "Ugh!"

113
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But when there's a ghost in my actual apartment, it doesn't scare me.

114
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I know I'm a paranormal researcher, I know I'm a ghost hunter, you don't want it in your house.

115
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Really. I mean, now it's attacking me.

116
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 No, I'm not saying you gotta leave, but it's more troublesome.

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I don't really think this, whatever this is, has any ill will towards me, so that's interesting.

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 But, like, if the goblins are supposed to be at your house and then I go to your house and investigate goblin activity.

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I don't think even a hunter, like, if you were a hunter, I don't think you want a bunch of rabbits jumping around in your house, right?

120
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 I mean, you're like, "I love shooting rabbits in the brain with this shotgun,"

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 but I like to go, I like to do it on my off time, not at home, so we'll see what happens.

122
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Like, this could have been a one-off thing.

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I didn't feel any ill will towards it.

124
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 If it does the sight of stick around, you know, I'll deal with it.

125
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I'm not gonna sage the place or anything like that if it has good intent, right?

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But that was really weird.

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 It was really weird to see something like that.

128
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It's been years since I've seen a ghost on that level.

129
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But there's one here now, apparently.

130
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Maybe it's just passing through.

131
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Maybe it's waiting for the ghost bus.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Maybe it's on the way to your house.

133
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And if so, then I think it's pretty chill, actually.

134
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I wouldn't worry about it.

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But, yeah, it's just weird.

136
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Just weird to be recorded.

137
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And you know what's so funny?

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I think it was in that episode or the episode before it.

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I was like, "Oh, that ghost can come to my house."

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I kept talking about someone who's trying to get a ghost to come to their house.

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I think it was the Monday episode.

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And maybe a ghost.

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Maybe a ghost didn't understand.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I was speaking in the third person.

145
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Who knows?

146
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 But a weird story, nonetheless.

147
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You know, that took a lot longer.

148
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And I know with all the processing and everything like that,

149
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 that segment's probably gonna be like 20 minutes.

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Let's go ahead and set aside the hobo vagrant story.

151
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 We're gonna save that for tomorrow.

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Let's move into a snowier region than my house.

153
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 So let's go ahead and toss the canning and lifter the keys to the carpenter copter.

154
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

155
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We're flying all the way out to a snowy mountain town.

156
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 This story's short.

157
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 We might have time for the Georgia story,

158
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 but I want to make sure I can give this story its full do.

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 And I've got to give a shout out to Ampus Allen.

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Ampus Allen, longtime supporter of the show,

161
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 sent us a lot of really good stuff for Dead Rabbit.

162
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I really, really appreciate it.

163
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 This story is just as good as the other ones.

164
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Like, sending me nothing but gold.

165
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Ampus Allen apparently posted this video the other day of a 70-year-old woman.

166
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Let me get this straight, actually.

167
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 So he videotaped, no, no, no.

168
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 He posted a video.

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 He's skiing and his mother-in-law is filming him.

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 His 70-year-old mother-in-law is filming him.

171
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Chirin' him on, "Go, Ampus Allen, go!"

172
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And he's like, he can't even hear her.

173
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 He's going down the hill so fast.

174
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And it was like, "Hey, look at this."

175
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It was from a subreddit called Praise the Cameraman.

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Because the cameraman's doing-- or Camerawoman.

177
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Don't be sexist, subreddit.

178
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So anyways, this actually was a woman.

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 They're going down the hill.

180
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So he posted this video.

181
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 It's like, "Hey, look at my mother-in-law's filming me as I'm flying down the slopes."

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 This dude actually is like a world-renowned athlete, Ampus Allen.

183
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So he posted this video and because the internet is a super, super weird place,

184
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 he gets a comment from a guy known as "Ohoyle."

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And Ohoyle tells this story.

186
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Ohoyle says, "You know what?

187
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 I used to live in a mountain town."

188
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And that's where we're walking around right now.

189
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 We're walking around this unnamed mountain town.

190
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 We got big mittens on in like the parkas and we're walking around.

191
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Ohoyle's story is this.

192
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 He used to live in a mountain town up in a snowy region.

193
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And he worked at the local pizza shop.

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 The local pizzeria where you'd go in and you'd get some delicious food,

195
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 maybe throw back a brusky or two and watch the snow fall outside.

196
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And he says, "You know what?"

197
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 He's referring to Ampus Allen's 70-year-old mother-in-law videotaping this.

198
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 He goes, "You know what?

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 You'd actually be surprised how many old people can ski in snowboard

200
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and do it fairly well."

201
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And he goes, "I have a theory.

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And to be honest, I'm kind of joking, but I'm kind of not.

203
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I believe that aliens hide out in mountain towns all over the world."

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So think about it.

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Old people look like gray aliens, right?

206
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Hold your questions until the end.

207
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Old people kind of do look like gray aliens, right?

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 They're balding.

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Gray aliens are bald.

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 They got skinny little limbs.

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Gray aliens have skinny little limbs.

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 That's kind of weird.

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 They're not gray.

214
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Most old people aren't gray.

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 However, they do start to get a little ashy looking, right?

216
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Why do they do that?

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Why do old people-- YouTube's going to shut this down for ageism.

218
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 But when you get old, you kind of lose a little bit of color in your skin.

219
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So why?

220
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Is it because they're old and they are having less nutrients

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 or they're out in the sun less?

222
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Is it because they're not human anymore?

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Gray aliens?

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 But he says it's weird because old people do kind of look like gray aliens.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 But that's not the only thing.

226
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That's not the only part of this conspiracy theory.

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 He goes, "Sometimes when I'm working at a pizzeria,

228
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I'd get these elderly people showing up to the pizza shop

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 and they would be paying me in cash."

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But the cash was always old money.

231
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Like the bills, the bills, the dates when the bills were printed were like the 1960s.

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 But they looked brand new.

233
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 So I was getting this money that was brand new that had old dates on it from like the '60s

234
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 and I thought, "Hmm, maybe they're gray aliens."

235
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Right?

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 These people up in mountain regions pay me in weird money.

237
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Now I would assume there's some sort of counterfeit ring going on.

238
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 That would be my first assumption.

239
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Did I ever talk to you?

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Did I ever mention that before?

241
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 My grandpa knew a guy who counterfeited money?

242
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Like my grandpa's dead.

243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 You can't come after him, FBI.

244
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 But my grandpa knew a dude who would counterfeit money

245
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 and he lived on a boat in Sacramento

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 and he would just have a water cooler of $5 bills, fake $5 bills

247
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 and he would just hand them out to people.

248
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 I don't know who the guy was before the feds come and asked me.

249
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I don't know who the guy was.

250
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 It's been 20 years since I heard that story.

251
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 But so you do have old people who counterfeit

252
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 and they just counterfeit very, very low bills.

253
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But anyways, anyways, now that it's a counterfeit ring,

254
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 he thinks they might be gray aliens.

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 But here's the interesting part, right?

256
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Ampestallan sent this to me.

257
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 We both had a good chuckle.

258
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But there was something that could be fact checked

259
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 with this conspiracy theory.

260
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And those are always the best conspiracy theories,

261
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 the ones that we can actually take a really close look at.

262
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 He said snow, this is what Ahoyle said,

263
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 snow is actually kind of a rare phenomenon

264
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 as far as the galaxy goes.

265
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Now I can't fact check that old people love to use new bills

266
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 other than the fact that my grandpa knew a counterfeiter

267
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 and elderly counterfeiter.

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And yeah, sure, old people do kind of look like gray aliens

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 if you forget the fact that they have giant eyeballs

270
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and they're three feet tall and they have these massive heads.

271
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Sure, they share some of the qualities of a gray alien,

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 i.e. they have arms and legs and they're bold.

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 But snow is a rare phenomenon galactically.

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 So me and Ampestallan were kind of joking about this

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 and then I looked it up.

276
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Snow is extremely rare.

277
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 H2, I know a bunch of scientists, I know a bunch of people

278
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 who are into science who listen to this podcast

279
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 are typing comments and emails right now, hold on.

280
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Snow as we know it, H2O snow that sticks and packs

281
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 and forms snow shelves and snowy mountains and stuff like that.

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 We're the only place in the solar system that we know that this happens.

283
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 There's other planets, there's moons that we think it snows,

284
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 but it's like volcanic ash coming down from the sky.

285
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's carbon snow.

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 It's like Mars, it snows like there's ice,

287
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 but snow, they said it doesn't stick, like it snows in the poles,

288
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 but by the time it hits the ground it's gone.

289
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 We think it might snow on Pluto.

290
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 As much as we know that Pluto is like super frozen,

291
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 we don't know for sure.

292
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And even then it's Pluto.

293
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Even then it's a dirt ball of a planet that's super far away.

294
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And this is super interesting because snow is,

295
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 snow is so rare in our solar system

296
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 that you would have to extrapolate that out.

297
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And it's probably very rare galactically.

298
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Something that for the most part we take for granted.

299
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I always thought it was interesting that the number one,

300
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 as far as we know, the number one rarest thing in the universe,

301
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 liquid water, we pour all over our bodies,

302
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 we splash it in our face.

303
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I mean we do drink it, right?

304
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 But we build holes in the ground and fill it full of the most precious resource in the universe.

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 As far as we know liquid water is one of the rarest things ever.

306
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 It rains diamonds on like Jupiter or Saturn or something like that,

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 or one of the moons.

308
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 But there's no liquid water anywhere else that we know of.

309
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And we put it in balloons and throw it at people, right?

310
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 We spray our dogs with a hose and they go,

311
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and they get it all wiggly all over you and it's fun.

312
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And then Charles Crudin yells at you, "Bate-O-Van!"

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 That's weird.

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 That is the detail that makes me go,

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 "Maybe there is something to this."

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 So again, YouTube and anyone else who thinks I'm being agist,

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I'm not saying that all old people are grey aliens,

318
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 but what I am saying is that if you could travel the galaxy

319
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 and you'd seen stars explode and you watch your buddies get sucked into a black hole,

320
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 you're like, "Oh, that prank went bad."

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 As you watch their entire starship get stuck on the event horizon,

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 you've seen all of these great things, but snow,

323
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 standing outside watching frozen water softly come down,

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 sticking out your little tongue, getting some on it.

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 That's be so rare.

326
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 You could experience so many other amazing things throughout the galaxy,

327
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 but if you wanted to see snow, you'd have to come here.

328
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 You wanted to ski, snowball fight, igloos, whatever.

329
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 You'd have to do it here.

330
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 That's so interesting.

331
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Think about this.

332
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 When you have old people here, or rich people, whatever, and they want to vacation,

333
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 sure, they could go to a tropical location anywhere on the planet.

334
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They could go to some deserted island.

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They're rich and powerful.

336
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They can go anywhere.

337
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 They can afford anything.

338
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But they still go to the same resort towns that everyone else goes to,

339
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 because the infrastructure is there to support them.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 If Bill Gates wanted to go to a tropical island,

341
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 but there's no landing pad there, and let's say that he goes,

342
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 "Build the landing pad, then he gets there."

343
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 There's no hotels.

344
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 There's no houses.

345
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 It's just a deserted island.

346
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 He's like, "Ah, this totally sucks."

347
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And you'd have to build the infrastructure.

348
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 All that infrastructure is here.

349
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So sure, even if there was another planet where it did snow, H2O,

350
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 there's no resorts, there's no pizzerias, there's no infrastructure for that.

351
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 This, it's interesting, because we always talk about Earth being a prison planet.

352
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 We talk about Earth being a zoo.

353
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 The aliens a long time ago put us here, and they crossbred themselves with the monkey people,

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and then that's where the Homo sapiens came from,

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 and we went to dig up gold for the Anunnaki, and da-da-da-da.

356
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It's always so dismal and dark and evil, right?

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 It's always, we were slaves, or we are prisoners,

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 or the Archons are drinking our luch when we die and we get stuck in a reincarnation.

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Why is it always so dismal with conspiracy theories?

360
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Why is it always so negative?

361
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Maybe Earth is the happiest place in the galaxy.

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I mean, okay, outside of all the wars, outside of all the wars,

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and the pestilence and stuff like that and all the horrible crimes.

364
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Galactically speaking, we don't have volcanoes that rip the atmosphere in two.

365
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 We are not sitting on the edge of a star system that's about to go supernova.

366
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 It's pretty chill, right?

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 The environment is stable.

368
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It snows, it rains, there's beautiful sunsets.

369
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 You can sit on a beach, and a day later, be scaling a mountain,

370
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 looking down at the valley below.

371
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It's really a beautiful place.

372
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 So maybe we aren't a prison planet, maybe we aren't some sort of zoo

373
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 where the monkeys have taken over.

374
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Maybe we're club med as far as the galaxy goes,

375
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 and that's why so many aliens are coming here.

376
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 That's why we're always hearing about these reptilians and Pleiadians

377
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 and the greys and all these other guys, right?

378
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Because you imagine, I don't think the Pleiadians have a bunch of reptilians walking around.

379
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And I imagine on the grey alien homeworld, if that even exists,

380
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 a lot of people think it's their bio-robots created by the reptilians.

381
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 But we're going to re-intuit into the weeds here.

382
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 We're the only planet that all these other different species can come to, right?

383
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Maybe we are a resort planet, maybe we are the cancun of the galaxy.

384
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And so it would make sense that you would have grey aliens coming down

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 to many aliens, right?

386
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I think a lot of alien, with an alien lore,

387
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 especially with reptilians, they're shapeshifters.

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 It would make sense for them to come down to a place that's peaceful,

389
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 that doesn't have all of their wars, it has our wars.

390
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But it doesn't have these galaxy-spanning conflicts.

391
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 We may actually be the Casablanca of the galaxy,

392
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 a neutral planet that people can come and relax.

393
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Very, very fascinating conspiracy theory, I think.

394
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And we need more positive conspiracy theories.

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I really do.

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 If you want to talk about the Archons drinking our lush,

397
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 the way you could generate the mo-

398
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 We did a whole episode on that.

399
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 You're like, "What in the world's lush?"

400
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

401
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But the idea is that there's this matrix built around the planet,

402
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and when you die, when it says go into the light,

403
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 that's actually a trick to get your soul to reincarnate on Earth.

404
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And these demons, Archons, whatever you want to call them,

405
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 these alien overlords are drinking all of your negative energy.

406
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 What produces more negative energy than telling somebody

407
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 that they're trapped in a matrix full of negative energy?

408
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 We need more positive conspiracy theories.

409
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And I think the fact that if you start looking at elderly people

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 thinking they're actually gray aliens on vacation,

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 that's pretty dope.

412
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Again, not all of them.

413
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Don't go to a retirement home and have a conga line

414
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 and be like, "Come on, Gray's, get on up."

415
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Actually, that sounds pretty good.

416
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 You should volunteer at your local retirement home.

417
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 It really helps out.

418
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 But do not retire just because you think they're gray aliens.

419
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 You're like, "Now I'll do the probing."

420
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Don't do that.

421
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 There's actually a lot of crimes that happen in retirement homes.

422
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 My point is, this is a good conspiracy theory.

423
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I like this.

424
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 We need more of this stuff.

425
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 We need more stories that don't inspire negativity in us,

426
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 but inspire hope.

427
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So, ohoyle, I hope you are correct.

428
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I hope there is a portion of the elderly community

429
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 that are gray aliens.

430
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Because then it would mean that this world isn't a dismal place

431
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 on the brink of annihilation every single day.

432
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It's actually stable enough for aliens of all races

433
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 to come here and hang out for a bit.

434
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 That's a great conspiracy theory.

435
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I really do like that.

436
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Or, I have to be very careful here because again,

437
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 I'm sure there's one guy right now probably grabbing his crowbar

438
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 and being like, "I got to take care of those gray aliens."

439
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 They're walking to their retirement home.

440
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 They're saying that all elderly people are gray aliens,

441
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 just so we are clear.

442
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 But, I love this conspiracy theory.

443
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Are some of them?

444
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Are some elderly people gray aliens visiting in disguise?

445
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Are really any aliens, right?

446
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Although, if I was a reptilian, I think I would take the form of like,

447
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Shaquille O'Neal and not a 80-pound old man.

448
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 But, I like this.

449
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I like this.

450
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 I like positive conspiracy theories.

451
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 And what a way to think of the world as a beautiful place

452
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 that other people want to come to visit.

453
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Not a dismal place of hate and vengeance and blood and ash,

454
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 but a place that is okay to be fair.

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It is those things.

456
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But, maybe it is better than those things combined.

457
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 I think maybe the love and the joy and the passion that humanity

458
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 truly has for each other reaches out and attracts aliens

459
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 of all stripes to this world.

460
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 We're that dope.

461
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 We're that awesome.

462
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 We're the only place in the known galaxy where it snows.

463
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 They may have the starships.

464
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 They may have the technology.

465
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 They may have the cure for all the diseases that plague us.

466
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 But, from the highest peak to the lowest valley,

467
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Earth is the place to be.

468
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 They're jealous of us.

469
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 They have all that technology, but they're jealous of us.

470
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 This is the only place in the known galaxy where you can walk outside

471
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 and watch it snow from the heavens.

472
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Powdery white bliss,

473
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 raining down on the beautiful planet known as our home.
