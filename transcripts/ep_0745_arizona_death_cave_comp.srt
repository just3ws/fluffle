1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,620
 A man who is such a huge pervert, he's not even allowed to have garbage bags at his house?

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,880
 Then we travel to a haunted cave in Arizona, where a group of Apache raiders made a final

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,480
 stand against a rival tribe.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,320
 To this day, people say you can still hear their screams deep below the earth, but the

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,320
 true story may have an even more brutal twist today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:40,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,400
 I'm your host, Jason Garminer.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,880
 I'm laughing because the introduction I just recorded is so absurd.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,280
 I'm going to put it at the end of the episode because you guys can hear what I edit it out

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,280
 of shows.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,880
 I just look at it, I'm kind of just trailing off because I realize it meant nothing.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,840
 But I'll put that at the end of the episode if you want a little behind the scenes thing.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,760
 But we don't want behind the scenes right now.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,000
 We want front of the scenes and walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
 superstar new patreons.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 Everyone take a picture, take a selfie with Waukeen Stick.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,040
 Everyone give a round of applause to Waukeen Stick as he's walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,560
 Waukeen, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,720
 You guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,840
 Just help spread the word about the show.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,760
 Really really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,680
 Really means a lot when I see you guys talk about the show online.

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 Super awesome.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,360
 Waukeen Stick, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys for the Jason Jet.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,760
 We don't take this out enough.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,800
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:50,040
 We are headed all the way out to Cheltenham in England.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,200
 High and high, flying proud, never give up, iron eagle.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,040
 Walking Stick is flying the Jason Jet out to England.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,160
 We're in Cheltenham, England, that's in Glowshire.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,760
 We're walking down the city streets and we see a guy named Warren Harris.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
 He's 46 years old, he's kind of waving at us.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,000
 We're waving back, we're like, "Oh, that dude's nice, he's waving to us."

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,240
 Must be a normal man.

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,200
 He must not be why we're here for this story.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,040
 And then we see him as he's walking on the streets.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,200
 Every time he passes a garbage can, he starts going, "Ugh."

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,520
 And we're like, "What?"

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,200
 Is he doing an impression of Billy Goat?

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,360
 And he walks to the next one and then he's like, "Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,040
 Yeah, I want to put stuff in there."

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
 And we're like, "What?"

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,640
 We're like in a drawer, standing awfully close to him.

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,680
 Then we can hear his moans.

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,440
 He walks to the next one and he's like, "Oh yeah, you would fit in there really well."

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,400
 We're like, "Gross."

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,280
 He's looking at you.

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,600
 He's looking at you when he said that one.

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,040
 And I'm laughing, I'm laughing so hard.

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,520
 You're like, "Jayson, are we in the story?

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
 In the story right now.

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
 Let's go home."

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
 And I was like, "Uh-uh."

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,080
 And we follow this guy in his house.

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,840
 I'm like pushing you in front of me.

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
 I'm like, "Go into the house first.

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,520
 Go into the house first."

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,160
 So we go in there and we're in Warren Harris' house.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,480
 He's this 46-year-old man and he's like, "Join me for some tea and crumpets, please."

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
 We're like, "Sure.

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,200
 Yeah, we love disgusting stuff."

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,080
 So we walk in there and we're drinking some bland, watery, gross drink and eating crumbly

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,720
 food.

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
 And we go to throw it away because we're polite.

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,320
 And I go, "Where's your garbage can?"

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,280
 He goes, "Oh, garbage cans."

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,240
 He puts his hand on your leg.

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,480
 He puts his hand on your thigh.

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,240
 He's like, "Ooh, garbage cans.

72
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,040
 Oh, I love garbage cans.

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,960
 But alas, the horrible totalitarian government of Britain won't allow me to have garbage

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
 bags."

75
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,920
 And we reluctantly ask why.

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,320
 Why aren't you allowed to have garbage bags?

77
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,900
 This story is so weird because I read a couple articles on this and it doesn't specifically

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,560
 say how he popped up on police's radar over the garbage bag thing.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,440
 So I had to do a little bit of forensic digging on this.

80
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,880
 We're going to tell the story in a weird way.

81
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:12,360
 But what happened was, as far as I could figure out, he was on parole for a sexual

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
 assault.

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,320
 He did nine years in prison for it.

84
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
 Then he's on parole.

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,000
 And in 2010, the police are doing a sweep on his place and they find that he's been watching

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,520
 videos of vacuum porn.

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,880
 And vacuum porn, like, damn it, Jason.

88
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
 Really?

89
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,880
 Really?

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
 Like, can't you just go a week?

91
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,920
 One week without talking about something creepy fetish I didn't know existed.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,520
 Vacuum porn.

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,800
 Vacuum porn is what you think it is.

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
 Well, actually, you know it probably isn't.

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,320
 You probably think it's someone having sex with a vacuum.

96
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,160
 And that's not it.

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,400
 It is people, specifically in his case, girls, being vacuum sealed in garbage bags.

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,840
 Or really any type of bag, any sort of plastic will do.

99
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,040
 So they get sealed in and he gets sexual arousal from watching women get sucked into vacuum

100
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
 bags.

101
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,200
 They sit in the garbage bag and they put the tube in the garbage bag and it gets skin

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,400
 tight on them.

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,960
 And not just that, because that's disturbing enough.

104
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,560
 He also likes to see them suffocate.

105
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,760
 So if they're a little head sticking out of the bag and it's, I mean, it's gross either

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
 way.

107
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,360
 He's allowed to watch those videos either.

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,760
 But some of the videos, they have plastic bags on their head too and they're suffocating.

109
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,520
 And even his defense lawyer said when he was trying to defend this creepo in court, the

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
 defense lawyer goes, "I thought you'd have to go to the dark web for this stuff."

111
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
 It's on YouTube.

112
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
 This stuff is on, I was able to find this stuff.

113
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
 I didn't want to.

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
 I didn't want to.

115
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,480
 I go, "Oh, you can find it on YouTube?

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,080
 This must not be accurate."

117
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 And I typed it in.

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,880
 I typed in, I don't think I typed in vacuum porn.

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,440
 I think I just typed in like garbage bag, tons of videos.

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,520
 Tons of videos of girls being sealed in garbage bags.

121
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,840
 I didn't see any of the ones where they were suffocating.

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,920
 But please don't send it to me.

123
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,720
 You're like, "Oh, you missed out on the best stuff."

124
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,160
 There's lots of videos of girls sealing themselves in garbage bags.

125
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,560
 It's super weird.

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,120
 But anyway, so since 2010, they said, "You can't watch vacuum porn anymore."

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
 And he's like, "Oh man, he's watching later.

128
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,000
 Unless on YouTube he has to delete it."

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,760
 On July 18th, 2021, there was a breaking update to this case.

130
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,480
 There was another surprise visit to his house.

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,560
 They found him, he was still watching vacuum porn.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,320
 That's an 11-year period.

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,000
 He's still watching vacuum packed porn on YouTube.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,440
 He went back there.

135
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,480
 He says that he watches it twice a day.

136
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,400
 He's like, "Officers, listen, I just watched it twice a day.

137
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,560
 What's the harm?"

138
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,880
 He watches it twice a day and he watches it for two hours each time.

139
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,440
 So yeah, that is he, the judge said, "You cannot own garbage bags at your house."

140
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,960
 And the judge also said, "Listen, you've broken parole twice, but this time it's super double

141
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
 serious.

142
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,680
 If you watch it again, I will throw you in jail."

143
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
 Of course he's going to be looking.

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,920
 He's probably looking out of the second he left the courtroom.

145
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,880
 He's went to Subway and got one of their plastic bags for the sandwich and he's like, "You're

146
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,640
 going to be seeing my foot long way."

147
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,720
 So if you ever go over to someone's house and they don't have garbage bags, you automatically

148
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
 assume that's right.

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,680
 Whenever you go over to someone's house and you're like, "Hey, where's your garbage at?"

150
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,360
 and their eyes shift from side to side, they're like, "Oh, we compost."

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,640
 I bet you they really, I bet you anyone who composts actually has a court order again.

152
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,840
 They're against them.

153
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,320
 That they're such perverts that they can't use garbage bags.

154
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,880
 So they made up this whole hippie thing.

155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,480
 Say, "No, we just throw all garbage in a big old bucket outside."

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,680
 Or inside, I was at a girls house the other day and I'm trying to like microwave a burrito

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,400
 and sitting on her counter was a mushroom growing.

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:04,320
 It was this disgusting thing of coffee grounds and orange rinds and who knows what else, right?

159
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,760
 Organic material in this pot.

160
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,560
 And I thought, "Why is it when I feed ants on my window sill or I don't clean my bathtub

161
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,080
 and it's covered in orange algae, which helps it stay sticky, you don't slip in a dirty

162
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,840
 bathtub.

163
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
 Why am I gross?"

164
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,640
 And girls leave after we've had sex.

165
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
 They never leave before.

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
 But afterwards they leave and they go, "Man, your place is gross."

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Sure, sure.

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,760
 I got naked with you, but your place is gross.

169
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,960
 Why is that gross?

170
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:45,000
 However, if I had a pot of disgusting stuff melting in my food space, that's fine.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,240
 If I'm just throwing garbage outside of my window and someone goes, "Why is there a

172
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
 bunch of fish bones out there?

173
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
 Looks like Heathcliff.

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,960
 Looks like Heathcliff walked on by."

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
 "Oh, I'm composting.

176
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 Good sir.

177
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,840
 Don't dare judge my environmentalism."

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,480
 It's not because I'm having sex with garbage bags.

179
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,920
 I don't know why you would assume that.

180
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,960
 The guy's like, "Well, I didn't think that at all."

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,880
 But now I'm thinking that.

182
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,280
 Why is that normal?

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,000
 We talked about that on yesterday's episode.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Consensus is reality.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And if everyone...

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,640
 Why is that normal?

187
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,640
 But I'm disgusting.

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 I'm not.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
 I'm just the head of the curve.

190
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 You like that?

191
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 You like that Joker impression?

192
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,240
 You're like, "I had no idea what it was."

193
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,960
 I shut the podcast off when you said your bathtub was orange.

194
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
 Walking stick.

195
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

196
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,840
 We are leaving behind.

197
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:44,000
 We are heading all the way out to the Little Colorado River in Arizona.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,160
 It's June 1878.

199
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,320
 And at the Little Colorado River in Arizona, there's a Navajo camp hanging out there.

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
 They're just like...

201
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
 They have their tents up.

202
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
 And the Navajos are doing their morning stretches.

203
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,200
 They're getting ready to go hunting.

204
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,760
 And some of them are going to catch fish.

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,360
 And the kids are going to run around and play.

206
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,120
 It's just a beautiful day, right?

207
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,760
 Everyone's going to do whatever you do on a sunny...

208
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,200
 They look over and they see one of the Navajos has an arrow sticking through his neck.

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,720
 He's bleeding out on the beach of the river.

210
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,280
 And then someone goes, "Oh no, dude.

211
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
 That happened.

212
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 That's super gross.

213
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
 No, don't look.

214
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
 Don't look."

215
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,360
 And then another arrow pierces his heart.

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,400
 "I needed that to live."

217
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,840
 And then a volley of arrows begin to fly down from a nearby bridge.

218
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
 And they spare no one.

219
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
 Men.

220
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 Oh!

221
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
 Women.

222
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
 Ah!

223
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
 Kids.

224
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,080
 I don't want to do the noise of a kid getting killed.

225
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
 These just...

226
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,360
 These Apache raiders have appeared out of nowhere.

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,520
 And who they don't kill with the arrow, they kill with the blade.

228
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
 Shrink!

229
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
 Or whatever they had.

230
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
 What are the hatchets?

231
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,640
 What are those things called?

232
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,920
 I'm sure they had swords.

233
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
 They were in 1878.

234
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,440
 I'm sure they've taken a couple off of dead soldiers at this point.

235
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,120
 But anyways, it doesn't matter.

236
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
 They're killing people.

237
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
 What were those things they had?

238
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 Were they hatchets?

239
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
 Tomahawks!

240
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
 Tomahawks!

241
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,280
 I had to make the noise.

242
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,320
 I had a picture of it spinning in the air.

243
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 Tomahawking people.

244
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,200
 And they lay waste to this camp.

245
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,520
 There's only three survivors, three young Navajo women.

246
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,480
 And the Apaches have other plans for them.

247
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,160
 So they throw them on the back of their horses and disappear into the Arizona wasteland.

248
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
 Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.

249
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,440
 The Navajo leaders find out about this raid.

250
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,520
 They know that now one of their outposts have been destroyed by these Apache bandits.

251
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,480
 So they assemble a team of 25 Navajo warriors and they say, "You will go off and fight them,

252
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,280
 kill them, or, barring that, we do have a tradition that they can actually sue for peace.

253
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,800
 They can give us all of the stuff they've stole, plus all of their stuff.

254
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,140
 And if they do that, we'll let them go.

255
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,040
 But you have to find them first."

256
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,000
 And the 25 warriors go, "We will."

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
 They practice this, they all say it at the exact same time.

258
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
 It sounds magnificent.

259
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,040
 So then they ride off into the wilderness of Arizona looking for these Apache warriors.

260
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,880
 They can't find them.

261
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,400
 And they figured it would be kind of hard because the raider group of the Apaches, they

262
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,800
 have to have a hideout somewhere.

263
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 They're not just doing this.

264
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,080
 They're just going out into the middle of a flat barren wasteland in Arizona and being

265
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,560
 like, "No one will find us here."

266
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,740
 They know they're probably pretty well hidden.

267
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
 They're looking all over for them.

268
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,580
 They can't find them anywhere.

269
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,620
 They get to Canyon Diablo and they're like, "Well, if we were going to hide, if we were

270
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,180
 going to hide someplace after murdering a bunch of innocent people, we'd hide in a place

271
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,580
 named after the devil."

272
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,140
 So they begin to scour the canyon.

273
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,260
 They can't find them anywhere.

274
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,540
 They're starting to kind of lose hope.

275
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,860
 They track them at least to this area, but then the tracks kind of ran out.

276
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,620
 There are two young Navajo warriors.

277
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,160
 They're walking through an offshoot of this canyon and all of a sudden one of them feels

278
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
 incredibly warm.

279
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
 They go, "What?

280
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
 Where'd that come from?"

281
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
 And he's looking around.

282
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
 He looks up at the sun.

283
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 He's like, "No, that's not it.

284
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 That giant fireball in the sky.

285
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,560
 That's not what's making me warm."

286
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:15,440
 I feel warmer on my ankles and my knees and my thighs than I do on my head and my torso.

287
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,280
 The point is he realized that he was coming from underground.

288
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,120
 I don't know why he told that in the most convoluted way.

289
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,140
 But he realizes it feels hotter where he's standing.

290
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,700
 He looks down and there's a hole in the ground.

291
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,700
 And he motions over silently his other teammate and they realize that the camp is underground.

292
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,060
 They're literally on top of the Apache hideout.

293
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,900
 So they go back and they tell the rest of the warriors, "Hey, we figured out where they're

294
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
 at.

295
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,660
 There has to be a cave underground and we could feel the flame from the fire.

296
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,540
 We could feel that coming up through the hole in the ground."

297
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,760
 So the Navajo warriors are searching for the mouth of this cave and they find it.

298
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,400
 They find the mouth of the cave.

299
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,680
 There's about 40 Apache warriors in there and their horses.

300
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080
 So it's a massive cave.

301
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,920
 And the Navajo's go, "Okay, we've got to be smart about this.

302
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,640
 Let's set the mouth of the cave on fire.

303
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,960
 We'll smoke them out."

304
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,200
 By the time they come out, they'll be like, "Hoo hoo hoo hoo, coughing and everything."

305
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,080
 Maybe kind of burned, right?

306
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,960
 No one wants to fight when they have a bad burn.

307
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
 So this is perfect.

308
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,600
 So they start gathering all the sagebrush and driftwood they can find.

309
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,220
 They put it in the mouth of the cave and they light it on fire.

310
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,660
 Now the Apache warriors are sitting in the cave and they're like, "Man, this sure was

311
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,220
 a good plan to hide out under the earth.

312
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,980
 That's a great plan, right?"

313
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,780
 Until there's only one way out and one way in and smoke begins billowing in.

314
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,380
 They immediately know that they're under siege.

315
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,860
 They totally figured this out.

316
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,820
 And so they're trying to like fight the flames and this is what they do.

317
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,580
 First they're throwing all their water on the fire.

318
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,660
 They get close to the entrance.

319
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,100
 They're trying to put the fire out.

320
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,840
 And although warriors are standing on the other side being like, "You have probably

321
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
 a good chuckle about this."

322
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
 Right?

323
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,480
 And these people are slowly suffocating.

324
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,600
 They're like, "Better you than me, buddy."

325
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
 They're trying to throw all of their water on it.

326
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 They run out of water.

327
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
 They didn't bring enough water in there to put out a giant fire.

328
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,640
 So then they slit the throats of their horses and begin throwing horse blood on the fire

329
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
 to help put the fire out.

330
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,600
 I don't know how much blood a horse has, but I'm going to guess.

331
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,640
 I'm going to guess it's a lot.

332
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
 But here's the thing.

333
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,260
 Let's say I cut a horse's throat and he's bleeding.

334
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,100
 Let's do a math problem here.

335
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,460
 A word math problem.

336
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,900
 Blood squirting out of the horse's neck.

337
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
 Sure.

338
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
 But it's not like a fire extinguisher.

339
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
 It's not like a pest dispenser.

340
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
 I'm like, "Hold up."

341
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,660
 He goes, "Spray, spray it back and forth on the base of the fire."

342
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,500
 You would have to get the blood in some sort of bucket and then you're throwing the bucket

343
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,100
 on the fire.

344
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,260
 And then you would run like you're doing like throwing the blood in the bucket, throwing

345
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,260
 it on the fire.

346
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
 And then that doesn't work.

347
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,380
 So you need more.

348
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,340
 So then you go keep going back to the horse and getting blood.

349
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,340
 The whole time blood.

350
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,500
 I'm chasing this is so gross.

351
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,780
 Please, please go to where there's ghosts.

352
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,900
 Please start to tire up.

353
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:03,900
 I did not turn on your podcast to hear you try to describe in graphic detail, mind you,

354
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,020
 on how to put out a fire using a horse's arterial blood.

355
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,660
 What I'm saying is there'd be a lot of waste.

356
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,220
 Unless you literally had the horses right next to it, it was shooting out of their veins

357
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,780
 onto the fire.

358
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,260
 You'd keep scooping it, you'd be like slipping on the blood.

359
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,860
 It'd be kind of hilarious to watch, actually.

360
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,300
 The Navajo really missed out on this spectacle.

361
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,500
 That doesn't work.

362
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,100
 But the surprises, surprisingly, right, that doesn't work.

363
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,340
 But they also say what we'll do is we'll move the horses' carcasses to block the smoke.

364
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,740
 So they're building like a wall of dead horses in front of the mouth of the cave.

365
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,700
 And then finally there's an Apache warrior being like, "This is madness.

366
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,300
 This is making no sense at all."

367
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,580
 Like we're just blocking ourselves in with a bunch of dead horses that are going to get

368
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
 cooked eventually.

369
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,700
 And then we're going to be super hungry.

370
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,460
 And then there's just going to be more fire pouring through.

371
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,620
 So he actually forces his way through the horse guts and through the burning woods.

372
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,380
 And he hops on the other side.

373
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,820
 And he tells the Navajos, "Listen, that was a great plan.

374
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,440
 That was a really good plan.

375
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,020
 We should have had a defense against this."

376
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,420
 They actually did have two watchmen.

377
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,340
 I should have given the Apache more credit.

378
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,060
 There were two watchmen at the mouth of the cave that were killed before this whole thing

379
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
 started.

380
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,460
 But the Apache warrior goes, "Good plan.

381
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,900
 A really good plan.

382
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
 We give up."

383
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,380
 Like let's do this whole sue for peace thing that we've talked about that our tribes have

384
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,500
 in relation to each other.

385
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,540
 We will give you everything we have, plus the stuff that we raided.

386
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
 If you let us go.

387
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,220
 And the Navajo goes, "That is...

388
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,500
 We consider that just."

389
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,740
 And the Apache warrior goes, "Okay."

390
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,340
 So he starts kind of like kicking dirt on the fire and stuff like that.

391
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,500
 He's like, "Okay, so we'll put this out.

392
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 Hey guys, we're good.

393
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 We're good down there."

394
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,460
 And then the Navajo go, "Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

395
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
 We'll do that whole thing."

396
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,100
 But also, how are those three girls doing?

397
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,020
 Those three girls that you kidnapped?

398
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,020
 And the Apache warrior is like, "Uh..."

399
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,860
 He doesn't want to answer.

400
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,020
 He does not want to answer.

401
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,300
 And the Navajo know at this point that those three girls have been killed.

402
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,860
 They weren't even killed in the initial combat of the village raid.

403
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,100
 They were killed after the fact.

404
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,900
 And most likely other horrible things happened to them.

405
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,060
 So the Navajo, because the three girls are dead, deals off.

406
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
 And they just start...

407
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,060
 They start shooting arrows into the cave.

408
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,300
 They relight the fire as they're smoking these guys out and just massacring anyone who, including

409
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,580
 the guy who'd popped out of the cave.

410
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,900
 They start to hear Apache death songs emanate from the bowels of the cave because they know

411
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,140
 that their time is up.

412
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,580
 And eventually they are all slaughtered.

413
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,060
 Once the smoke is cleared, they move aside the wall of dead horses and steal everything

414
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,340
 back from the Apaches.

415
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,980
 There was 42 of them in total, all dead.

416
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,580
 From that point on, this was considered a cursed cave for nearby Apache tribes.

417
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,700
 They refused to use it.

418
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,500
 As settlers began to come into Arizona, they would say, "Hey, you know, this is a pretty

419
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 cool place.

420
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,140
 It's sure it's super hot all the time, and it's kind of just barren wasteland.

421
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,820
 I'm surprised that you want to come here, but don't go to that cave.

422
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,380
 That place that is called Canyon Diablo, don't go there, because it's cursed.

423
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
 It's a cursed cave.

424
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,780
 A bunch of people died there, and the European settlers were like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever."

425
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,340
 So they began to put up cabins in the area, and at night you could hear the sounds of

426
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,260
 the dead and the damned coming from that cave.

427
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:32,460
 It sounds like a spooky sounds tape that you hear on Halloween, and they were like, "Okay,

428
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
 that's kind of spooky.

429
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,140
 I just won't go by that cave at night anymore."

430
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,760
 But what they started to realize was they would often hear footsteps walk around their

431
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,220
 cabin late at night.

432
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,900
 So it was considered a cursed place for a very, very long time, and to this day, people

433
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,500
 still like to go out there and explore the remnants of the Arizona Death Cave is how

434
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 it's known.

435
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,620
 You can't go into the cave itself, but you can walk in the area above the cave, and

436
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,020
 you can hear these legends about what happened underneath your feet.

437
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,860
 This haunted cursed ground.

438
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,700
 Or can you?

439
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,820
 This was a super interesting story, because that alone was really fun to read, and really

440
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,260
 fun to tell you about.

441
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,960
 But as I began research this, I found out a little bit more about this cave.

442
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,220
 This location is where Highway 40 is.

443
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,180
 It's between Flagstaff and Winslow.

444
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,060
 There's a place called Two Guns Interchange.

445
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:34,820
 It was pretty much just a small western town at a certain point, and then it became a gas

446
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:41,600
 station/gift shop at some point, and then, like in the 50s, and then it became a gas

447
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,140
 station/gift shop/zoo, which sounds like the greatest place to ever stop.

448
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,300
 It doesn't exist anymore.

449
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,600
 If all of a sudden you're hopping in your car to drive out there, it doesn't exist anymore.

450
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
 It just ruins.

451
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,080
 But you can still visit these ruins.

452
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,000
 Two Guns Interchange.

453
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,440
 Gas station/zoo/gift shop.

454
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:06,760
 And the gift shop would sell trinkets that were supposedly from the Death Cave, which

455
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,280
 would be considered illegal, but in the 1950s people weren't really caring about that stuff.

456
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,760
 And so there were some people who said it was just a tourist trap, that the Death Cave story

457
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 didn't exist.

458
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,580
 And other people were like, "No, no, no, the Death Cave story's been around for a long

459
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,580
 time.

460
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,180
 I remember hearing about that story back when I was a kid."

461
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,140
 And other people were like, "It's probably just a tall tale."

462
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:32,980
 Well there is a journalist named Blue Miller who has a blog called Never Quite Lost, and

463
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,420
 Blue really dug into the story of the Arizona Death Cave.

464
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,500
 Fascinating backstory to a fascinating story.

465
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:50,640
 The story of the Arizona Death Cave did not exist until the year 1967.

466
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,640
 There is no trace of this story being told before 1967.

467
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:02,020
 It was written in an article written in Big West Magazine by Maurice Kildare.

468
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,980
 And then in 1968, there was a book written called Two Guns Arizona.

469
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,720
 That was written by a man named Gladwell Richardson.

470
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,540
 And in that book also tells the story of the Arizona Death Cave.

471
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,980
 And every other story about Arizona Death Cave can be traced back to that article and

472
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
 that book.

473
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,780
 But Maurice Kildare is a pseudonym for Gladwell Richardson.

474
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,660
 So Gladwell Richardson wrote both the article and then a year later the book that's a collection

475
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,580
 of short stories that is about Two Guns Arizona.

476
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,380
 And one of those short stories is the Apache Death Cave.

477
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,680
 Some of you may recognize the name Gladwell Richardson.

478
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:50,240
 He's written hundreds of stories about the West, nonfiction and fiction.

479
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,920
 So it would make sense, right, that a guy who really loves Western culture, cowboys

480
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,280
 and Indians, would write about the Apache Death Cave.

481
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,840
 Just the fact that it wasn't written until 1967 doesn't necessarily mean it's not true.

482
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,520
 He may have heard it and may have just been a tale being told in the community.

483
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,160
 And because he's writing a book about Two Guns Arizona, he tells the story.

484
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,780
 That's not unheard of.

485
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,940
 But the story goes a little bit deeper than that.

486
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:22,740
 In 1950 Gladwell Richardson's dad bought Two Guns Arizona.

487
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:30,580
 He bought that little piece of land with the gas station/zoo/gift shop on it.

488
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,180
 He bought the little patch of land with the gas station.

489
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:39,820
 And so Gladwell Richardson actually has financial stake in Two Guns Arizona.

490
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,840
 Now you go, okay fine, he's still in the area.

491
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,480
 That would make sense that he would hear these tales.

492
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
 It doesn't mean that it's fictional.

493
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
 And that's true.

494
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,520
 It does not necessarily mean it's fictional.

495
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,360
 It does make it look more like the tourist trap argument.

496
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,200
 Because otherwise it's just this little mini mart in the middle of nowhere.

497
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 But if it's the location of the Apache Death Cave and where Billy the Kid hung out, which

498
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,840
 that turned out not to be true.

499
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 We know that's not true.

500
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,580
 It was in another state when Gladwell said that he was supposed to be in Canyon Diablo.

501
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
 So we know that part's not true.

502
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,060
 But the Apache Death Cave may be true.

503
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,740
 He's in the area.

504
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,220
 He's hearing these stories.

505
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,500
 But that's not where the story of Gladwell Richardson ends.

506
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:28,820
 To see where it ends, or to see the twist, we have to go back in time even further.

507
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,560
 This story is so bizarre and thank you Blue Miller for digging this up.

508
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,060
 It turns out on April 23, 1923.

509
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,080
 Gladwell Richardson was arrested.

510
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,560
 He's 19 years old at this time.

511
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,060
 This is long before his dad buys two guns, Arizona.

512
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,300
 He's a 19 year old kid.

513
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,020
 He's in the Navy.

514
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:54,400
 He's supposed to be on the USS Vigilant, a ship that's stationed outside of San Francisco.

515
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,080
 But in 1923 he's in Phoenix, Arizona.

516
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,700
 He's dressed like a hobo and he's riding in a rail car.

517
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:09,380
 And the rail authorities, when they're checking the cars, they find this bum in there.

518
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,580
 And they pull him off and on his possession is a diary.

519
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,620
 And one of the, I don't even know, like legally you can't do this.

520
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,100
 But again this is 1923.

521
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,980
 As they're pulling this bum off, the dude's reading his diary.

522
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,460
 He's like, "Ah, dear diary.

523
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,100
 Today I had my first kiss."

524
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:30,840
 He's going through the diary and he finds this story in Gladwell's diary.

525
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,040
 "Dear diary, I just had to leave San Francisco.

526
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,760
 You won't believe the horrible thing that happened to me.

527
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,440
 I had gotten off my ship.

528
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,040
 I'm walking through San Francisco and a man shows up.

529
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,520
 He seemed a little nervous, a little excited.

530
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,200
 And he offers me a night in a hotel room.

531
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
 And I'm thinking, "Well, golly.

532
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 That sure sounds nice.

533
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,820
 I don't think there's anything homosexual about this at all."

534
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,820
 So I go up into the hotel room with this guy and it was the bee's knees.

535
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,260
 We were just sitting there.

536
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
 I don't know.

537
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
 It's 1923.

538
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,780
 What would you do in a hotel room with a total stranger?

539
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,300
 It's not like you could sit and watch Deep Space Nine.

540
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,420
 We just sat there and we stared at a blank wall.

541
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,940
 It sure was swell.

542
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,300
 And then I went to sleep.

543
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:26,480
 And at 3.30 in the morning, that man, that dangerous man, he aroused me.

544
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 Not that way.

545
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,000
 I'm in the old-timey way where he woke me from my sleep, but he sure had arousal on

546
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,440
 his mind.

547
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
 He wanted to have carnal relations with me.

548
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,200
 But I didn't want to do it.

549
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,560
 I didn't want to do it, diary.

550
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,400
 Forget those other entries where I talked about kissing Clark Gable.

551
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
 I was infuriated.

552
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,780
 And I grabbed a spittoon off the floor because it's 1923 and those came standard in hotels.

553
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:58,580
 I picked a spittoon off the floor and I bashed his head in with it.

554
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,780
 Sure he got a few good licks in and again, not sexual.

555
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,980
 That's old-timey for punches.

556
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:09,180
 But I used the spittoon and I beat him so badly, I actually at one point hit him and

557
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,620
 his head got wedged in between the metal bars of the bed frame.

558
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,680
 Like the headboard of the bed thing.

559
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,440
 His head got wedged in there.

560
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
 And I bounced.

561
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,240
 I saw him kind of just wiggle there for a bit and I got out of there.

562
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,720
 Well, wouldn't you believe it?

563
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,880
 On the very next day, I found out that that man that I hit with a spittoon, I hit with

564
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,160
 a metal object several times in the head and left with his brain wedged into two metal

565
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
 pipes.

566
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
 Would you believe that?

567
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
 Golly!

568
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
 I got hit.

569
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:49,580
 And he was a rabbi.

570
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,260
 So all the police knew.

571
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,500
 All they knew was that a religious figure at a hotel had his brains bashed in and was

572
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,320
 left to die slowly.

573
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,980
 What monster could do such a thing?

574
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,120
 And I knew no one would believe me.

575
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,660
 So I sold my clothes and bought the bummiest clothes I could find and hopped on the rail.

576
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:14,140
 And diary I hope no one ever knows my secret.

577
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,000
 And the police are like, "Uhhh..."

578
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 This has to be real.

579
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,920
 So the train officials got in touch with the San Francisco police department and said,

580
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,200
 "You don't happen to be working on a case with about a rabbi.

581
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
 They got murdered, right?

582
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,720
 Got his head stuck in a headboard and they like described it perfectly."

583
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,640
 And I mean, there's 1923, so I'm assuming it was all telegram.

584
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,040
 But in San Francisco, they picked it up and they're like, "Uhhh...

585
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,400
 We need to go to Arizona right now."

586
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,780
 That was the exact murder that they were investigating.

587
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,980
 The entry in the diary was true.

588
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,100
 So he went to trial for this.

589
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,820
 And his argument at first was there was work of fiction.

590
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,580
 I made it up.

591
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,300
 I totally made it up.

592
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,020
 And people were like, "Well, you made it up exactly like a real crime."

593
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
 So then he goes, "Okay, okay."

594
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:06,180
 I was hoping you guys were all idiots, but apparently you aren't.

595
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,100
 You guys are very, very smart and they're like, "Ooh, he's complimenting us."

596
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,260
 He goes, "It did happen, but it was self-defense.

597
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,520
 I was afraid I was going to get raped."

598
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
 So I beat his head in with a spittoon.

599
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,720
 And he goes to trial and he is found not guilty.

600
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,280
 It was self-defense that he beat this man to death with a spittoon.

601
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,160
 The Apache Death Cave story may be true.

602
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
 And hopefully it is true.

603
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
 I'm not saying that I hope...

604
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,120
 I'm not saying that I hope a Navajo camp was destroyed and a bunch of Apache warriors

605
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
 were brutally killed.

606
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,920
 I'm saying that it sounds cool.

607
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
 We want it to be true.

608
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
 It may not be.

609
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,540
 There are little inconsistencies there.

610
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,060
 The fact that it was never told until it was written by a guy who owned the area.

611
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,620
 Stepping back from that, we have an actual true story that's been lost to time.

612
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,620
 Blue Miller said no one ever brought this story up during Gladwell's career about this

613
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,260
 murder charge and acquittal.

614
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,740
 It was never in any of his biographies anything.

615
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,560
 I mean you're not going to be like "Gladwell Richardson wrote 300 books and he murdered

616
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
 a rabbi."

617
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
 You can buy more of his books at pingwins.com.

618
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,720
 Like, you normally aren't going to include that.

619
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,320
 It's such an obscure footnote in his life that it disappeared.

620
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,840
 A man writes a story about a cave that may be fake to help his father's business.

621
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,720
 Is the same man who writes a story and says it's fictional about killing a rabbi who tried

622
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,200
 to rape him.

623
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,900
 And that story turned out to be true.

624
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,980
 The whole thing is bizarre.

625
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,780
 The whole package is bizarre.

626
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,380
 The Arizona Death Cave is just a great ghost story.

627
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:54,060
 But the blood and the guts come from a true crime case involving the author himself.

628
00:30:54,060 --> 00:31:01,260
 And that type of winding path would seem completely unbelievable if you read it in a novel.

629
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,320
 There's no way that chain of events can happen.

630
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:29,120
 Sometimes truth truly is stranger than fiction.

631
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,940
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

632
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,940
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

633
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
 I'm having a great day.

634
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,580
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

635
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

636
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,000
 And I'm going to give you guys a little advice.

637
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,380
 Stop drinking caffeine for like a couple months.

638
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
 Then drink some.

639
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,820
 Then make yourself a cup of coffee.

640
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,020
 I am running out of drinks.

641
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,480
 I'm not a water drinker.

642
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,480
 And I have instant coffee.

643
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,880
 And that is like water.

644
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 But without the gross non-taste.

645
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,640
 So I've made some instant coffee and my eyeballs are popping out of my head like judge doom.

646
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,160
 So yeah, if you don't, I gave up caffeine a while ago.

647
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,680
 I've had it sips here and there.

648
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,800
 Not much at IPEPSY every once in a while.

649
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,520
 But yeah, I feel like.

650
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,100
 I feel like I'm 10 and I fell into a vat of chocolate.

651
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,780
 I feel like a gustus glump or whatever that kid's name was.

652
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:39,700
 Speaking of falling into chocolate, Segway, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

653
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,740
 covered in the delicious gooey dark substance we all know and look at.
