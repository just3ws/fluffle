1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 We often hear stories of people seeing ghosts, but what happens when the ghost sees you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we finish off close encounters of a canine kind week, with one more showdown between a dog and an alien.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 When a hiker and his 7-year-old golden retriever are up in the mountains of Washington, they're just expecting to enjoy the beauty of nature.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Little did they know they were about to be thrust into a deadly battle between a loyal dog and an alien that defied the laws of physics.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 [music]

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 [music]

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I'm gonna apologize in advance. I am recording this episode apparently during rush hour.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 In my neighborhood, every single car that can possibly drive by will drive by at least twice while I'm trying to record this episode.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But someone who's always welcome to make a bunch of noise while I'm recording, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Everyone give it up for Thomas the Dink Engine.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Woohoo, yeah! Woohoohoohoo! Come on in, chug your way on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Thomas the Dink Engine, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That helps out so much. It really does help the show grow.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Thomas the Dink Engine, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Everyone climb on board this magical floating vehicle and take us all the way out to Florida.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 [car engine revving]

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 The reason why we're in Florida, let's take a look at this story. It's actually very short, but it's super interesting.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I find stories where we have that Venn diagram of the world of the paranormal and the world of just generalized high strangeness combining.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And I guess it's kind of the same thing, but let me be more specific. Ghosts and time rifts. That type of thing, right?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Ghosts and portals to another world. Technically you could say ghosts.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I mean, they're the horror portal to the other world, the underworld. But no, let's take a look at this story.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And again, it's like, it's so short. It's almost like a couple of sentences, but I think we can extrapolate some stuff out of this.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Plus, the second half of the episode's nuts and it's really long and I want to give that room to breathe. So this is a good combination.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 The reason why we're in Florida is there's a city called Apopka.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And in Apopka, there's a place known as the Orange Blossom Trail.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And the story is thus, if you're driving down Orange Blossom Trail,

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 sometimes if you're driving down Orange Blossom Trail late at night, you'll see a Native American warrior cross the street.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 But while he's crossing the street, he looks at you.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Like, what? Is that it? Wow.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Are you trying to set a record for a world short as a ghost story?

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 No, well, no, no, no, no, no, no. The thing is, let me explain it a little bit more. Let me use more words to tell the same story.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 He doesn't just cross the street. He's not like looking at you as he's crossing the street.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He crosses the street and then looks at you.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 You know what I'm saying? It's the same thing. Think about it this way.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 If I was crossing the street, staring, looking to see if cars were coming that way so I don't get hit,

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 you go, oh, he was looking the whole time. But imagine if I'm walking across the street and I don't look,

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I never look while I'm crossing the street and I'm like, ah.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 But the point is, is like, if I'm crossing the street and then I turn and look, something's caught my attention.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 As opposed to if I was constantly looking across the street.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 So the way I read this story, this three sentence story that I'm not going to talk about for 15 minutes now,

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 it's not going to be that long. The way I saw this story was that it's possible that we have different types of ghosts.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 One of the types of ghosts is a recording of an event.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And these are what are considered non-sentient ghosts.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 This isn't actually somebody's spirit. It's for whatever reason.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Some event happened. It could be a mineral event like underneath the earth that recorded things.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 This is what's known as the stone tape theory. Some sort of magnetic geological formation that's recorded in an event that's playing over and over again.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 They're non-sentient. You can't go up and talk to these types of spirits.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 If you go to some old timey castle in England and you see Marie Antoinette being dragged down the hallway,

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 go, "No, no, not my head. Not my head!" That's not actually Marie Antoinette's ghost.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 That's a recording of the terror that she was feeling as she was being led to the chopping block.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Then there are sentient ghosts or sentient spirits.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And these are the ones that you can actually interact with.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 These are the ones you wake up in the middle of the night because you need to get them in a night snack.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 You walk into your kitchen and there is a little boy crouched down in the darkest corner of your kitchen.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 He goes, "Help me!" And then vanishes.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 That could just be a recording. That could just be the reason why you're in heaven.

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And they're like, "Hey, how'd you die?" And you're like, "Massive heart attack! Massive heart attack!"

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 A little boy popped up in the middle of the kitchen or in the darkest corner. The creepiest part.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Probably should have been installed in the nightlight over there.

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 But let's imagine you walk into your kitchen and you are getting a midnight snack and there's a little boy crouched in the corner.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And he goes, "Help me!" And you go, "How can I help you?" And he's like,

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 "Oh no one ever asked me that question before and no one even answered!"

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 He's like sitting there and he's like, "Hmm, how could you help me?

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Do you think you could give me some of your daughter's toys and I could play with him in the kitchen?"

69
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 He's like, "He's being super noisy!" He's all crashing the dolls together.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 He's like, "Bang, bang, bang! You die!" And you're like, "Oh man, why did I give that ghost kid all those toys?"

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 "Oh yeah, because he's terrifying and I don't want to die in my sleep.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 I don't want him to crawl up my nostrils and possess me."

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Sometimes ghosts can be recordings. And the interesting thing is you don't really know which ones are which

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 until you interact with them or try to interact with them.

75
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 You don't know.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 But the ones that you can do generally like EVPs with where you're recording it, those would be interactive spirits.

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Sentient spirits.

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 This ghost, I think, is neither.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Yet it acts like both. I've never investigated this one personally.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 These are all just hunches.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 But it crosses the street in the exact same location every single time,

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 which would make it seem like a recording of a... a... a non-sentient ghost, a stone-tape ghost.

83
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It crosses the street in the same place. It turns and looks each time,

84
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 which would make you think it was a stone-tape ghost.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 What I think it is, is, and this is where I've nothing to back this up on, just call it paranormal researcher hunch,

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 is that it's in a time loop.

87
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And the difference between that is, is that at one point... this is what I imagined happened.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I feel like we've covered something like this similar before in the podcast,

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 but I could never find it. I've been looking for it the past couple of days.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I'm trying to find it. What I imagine is, let's go back in time. Let's go back to 1413 in Florida,

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and there's a Native American warrior crossing this field.

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 There's no road. He's just crossing a field.

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 He's hunting a deer.

94
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 He's hunting deer through Florida, or I don't know, alligator, whatever they had down there.

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 He's hunting, and he... something... see, this is the difference.

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 If he was just looking the entire time, then he's just looking the entire time.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But something catches his eye.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He's crossing this field, something catches his eye, and he turns, and he looks,

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 and he sees a Honda Civic sitting in the middle of the field.

100
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 He continues on his journey.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And this time loop, he's basically seeing us in the future.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But remember, this ghost story is repeated multiple times. It's not like he's trapped in a time loop.

103
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 It's not like he's like, "Oh, if only I could kill that deer."

104
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 But I just keep seeing all these vehicles from an era that I don't even know what a car looks like.

105
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I don't know that this is a Tesla, and that's a Ford.

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But I just have this weird feeling again. To be honest, this story could be made up.

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 It could be an urban legend, but if this ghost... it's not a ghost.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 If this traveler is actually stuck in a time loop, but yet in our timeline, he walked across.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Something caught his eye. He looked. He saw a vehicle.

110
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Chevy, two guys on a motorcycle.

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 A guy riding a horse, right?

112
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Well, you probably would have been like, "Yeah, I know what that is."

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Actually, not in 14, 13. They didn't have horses in America.

114
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 But he would turn and he would look. He would see something.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 He would go on his way. And that's the main timeline we're in.

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And yet there's still enough...

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Every time we see him, it's replaying him seeing us.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And each time he's seeing a different vehicle and a different group of people in said vehicle.

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Yet in the main timeline, he still collapses, so he only sees one.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Or he only remembers one incident, I guess I should say.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 He's seeing it each time. Each time he looks and sees you in the vehicle, he sees it.

122
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But the timeline collapses. The wave closes or crashes would be a better term.

123
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 The wave crashes when he continues on his journey.

124
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He'll go back to his tribe and say, "Hey, I was walking across this field.

125
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I saw this four-door... I saw this four-door sporty electric car.

126
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Newest truck by Chevy. He's all given the sales.

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 What are you talking about, dude? Where's that deer you're supposed to kill?

128
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Oh, an alligator ate it. It collapses. He only remembers one.

129
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 What are you talking about? Wait a second. You just read four sentences on Shadowlands.net.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Yeah, I do. I think that's it. Do I have anything to back it up? No.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Again, I think I love stories where you have ghosts and feel like Jason. Yeah, the stories are cool too.

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 But this story is not one of them. He read four sentences and extrapolated all this stuff.

133
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I just have a feeling, which is the thing you always want every scientist to say, right?

134
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Every researcher. They're like, "Can you cite your evidence?" You're like, "Well, I could, but I just have a feeling."

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And everyone's like, "You know what? Well, except that. He has a feeling. That's all only..."

136
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I don't know. I find it fascinating. If you live in Napauca, check it out.

137
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Here's actually to be super interesting. What if you drove really fast?

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Don't take this advice. You're like getting pulled over by the cops.

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They're like, "Why were you going 100 miles an hour?"

140
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 "Well, dead rabbit radio told me to drive super fast down this road late at night."

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 What if when you see the warrior crossing the road, you gun it?

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Maybe you could actually drive into the past.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I mean, most likely you would drive into a fence or drive into a tree, lining the road.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But what if you could go back into... 14, 13's a little too far back for my taste.

145
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 What if you could go back to, say, 17, 70?

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 You're driving around in your Ford pickup truck now and you're like, drive to Philadelphia,

147
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 and you're like, "Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin, before you crack that bell,

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'm going to tell you all about the future of America."

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And then I'm telling him all this stuff. He's like, "I don't know. I don't know if that's accurate."

150
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 "I'm pretty sure, good man, that I do not crack this Liberty Bell.

151
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I don't know where you got that part of history."

152
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure that happened."

153
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And then you get electrocuted when you tie a key to a kite.

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 He's like, "That would kill me. What are you talking about? Is this what you guys are told?"

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I said, "Yes. A fascinating story. Maybe involves time travel. Maybe it's just a ghost."

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And if you live in the area, maybe find out for me.

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Maybe travel into the past and put flyers for Dead Rabbit Radio all around the colonies.

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And that would be awesome.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And you're like, "Hear ye, hear ye, Dead Rabbit Radio, have a big bell.

160
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 You're ringing in people's ears as they're trying to sleep. Listen to this podcast."

161
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 They're like, "Ah, that would be great.

162
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 That would actually be pretty funny if there was a wood carving of you doing that."

163
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Thomas the Dink Engine, let's go ahead and tie the keys to the world's famous carbonicopter.

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 We are leaving behind at Popka.

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Take us all the way out to Washington.

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 [imitates car engine]

167
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 We're headed up to Washington.

168
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Specifically, we're headed to Snow Qualomy Pass, Washington.

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 It's October 1996.

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It's three in the afternoon. It's a beautiful sunny day.

171
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Well, I guess it's October. I guess October 1996 is pretty cold.

172
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 But still, it's beautiful and the sun exists.

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 The sun is shining down on this forest.

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And we're going to meet a man named Dr. Jonathan Reed.

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 He's a psychologist from Seattle.

176
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And we're also going to meet his loyal puppy, Susie, a seven-year-old golden retriever.

177
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 We're like petting. We manifest long enough to pet Susie a bit.

178
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Actually, I do want to take a little bit of time here to say this.

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 This story is pretty gross. This story is pretty gross.

180
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And if you love dogs or have a dog or have ever petted a dog, strap in.

181
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Or shut the podcast off.

182
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Because the first episode of Close Encounters of the Canine Kind Week, we covered

183
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 a very neutral encounter between dogs and aliens.

184
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And the second one, we covered the story of two dogs that brutally ripped

185
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 an 18-inch man into pieces.

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He was a little alien. He wasn't a human.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 But still, you probably shouldn't do that, dogs.

188
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So it was a draw the first episode. The dogs won the second episode.

189
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Well, in this third installment of Close Encounters of the Canine Kind,

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 dog lovers beware.

191
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 You're still petting Susie. You're like holding on to her.

192
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 You're like, Jason, just don't tell the story. And that never happened.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Jonathan, Dr. Jonathan Reed and his seven-year-old golden retriever, Susie,

194
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 are hiking around this area. They're about an hour and a half out from their car.

195
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's a beautiful day.

196
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 They're walking around, watching little blue jays land on trees and squirrels,

197
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 going like, "Yeah, and they're eating nuts." And it's saving some for later.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They're like, "Oh yeah, winter's coming."

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 "I shouldn't eat all my nuts!" "Oh, man, he's got a big stomach ache."

200
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He's like, "I'm just going to sit here and let my stomach rest for a couple months."

201
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "I'll be fine."

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 When all of a sudden Susie ran ahead.

203
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And you thought he was going to do that, right? He didn't have an unleash.

204
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 You don't take a dog on a leash in the middle of the woods.

205
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 He's just kind of like running around and stuff like that.

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 But this time Susie actually like runs into the forest,

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 off the trail now into the forest.

208
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And Jonathan's like, "You know, Susie will be back."

209
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 That's what dogs do. They probably smelled a squirrel.

210
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 They probably smelled a fat squirrel who can't run because they ate too many nuts.

211
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Susie will be back soon.

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But when Jonathan starts to hear his dog just frantically barking,

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 "Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

214
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 maybe she smelled a bear.

215
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Maybe she stepped on a porcupine.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Could be all sorts of dangers out here.

217
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And Jonathan's fearing the worst.

218
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I don't think he's so much worried about a dog stepping on a porcupine.

219
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 He's looking for a weapon as he's running through the woods towards the sound of the barking.

220
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And he sees this large tree branch on the ground.

221
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And he picks it up and he's like, "Ah, the mighty club."

222
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Neanderthals use this to crack open the skulls of their prey.

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And I too shall use it to defend Susie, no matter what.

224
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I don't think he actually gave that monologue.

225
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 He stops and he poses with the stick.

226
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 He's like, "Stick, branch, weapon of all mankind, the first weapon we've ever used."

227
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 He picked it up and he started running. He's continuing to run.

228
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And he estimates that from the trail to the sound of the barking,

229
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 it's about 150 yards.

230
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So I imagine that he's also out of breath.

231
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That's what, like a football field in a half.

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 He's like, "Ah, he's all stepping on porcupines the whole way."

233
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 But he kept going. He's got to save his dog.

234
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 He runs over and he sees Susie standing and kind of like a bit of a clearing.

235
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And she is continuing to position her body around like she's trying to find something.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And she's barking in anger, yelping in fear and gnashing her teeth,

237
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 "Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr!"

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Trying to bite something.

239
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And he's watching Susie do this.

240
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 He can't really see where the threat is, but that's when he realizes it's everywhere at once.

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He's watching a figure move around Susie so fast.

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 It looks like the air itself is being disturbed around it.

243
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It's like even more faint than a blur.

244
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 He can almost just see the trails of the motion of where it once was.

245
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's whipping circles around the dog.

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 He's watching this play out and that's what Susie is.

247
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Susie is trying to get a bite of this thing.

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And this thing is constantly moving away from Susie's jaws.

249
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 But at the same time, Jonathan realizes that whatever this is could just leave.

250
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 The fact it's trying to outmaneuver Susie, he realizes that whatever is moving so quickly,

251
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 it's like he can see the air being disturbed around it.

252
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's trying to also get his dog.

253
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The thing could just leave.

254
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 It's obviously fast enough, right?

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But as Susie is trying to get a bite, this blur is moving away from her mouth

256
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 to almost try to get a good strike in itself.

257
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 He's watching this play out and it's not long before, almost in an instant,

258
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 this happens instantaneously, Susie is able to reach out and lock her jaws onto this creature's forearm.

259
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But the reason why Susie was able to strike a blow was because this creature had stopped

260
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 because it was now ready to attack as well.

261
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 It could move, it could evade, but if it wanted to take down Susie,

262
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 it had to come to a complete stop.

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And that's what Jonathan is seeing going on right here.

264
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 He said Susie grabbed ahold of this thing's forearm.

265
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And he gets a better view of it later on in the story,

266
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 but I'm going to give you the description of it now just so you can kind of picture what's about to happen.

267
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 He describes it when he's able to get a closer view of it.

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 We'll get to that in a second, but he didn't take all this detail in right now.

269
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Things are happening way too quick for him to be able to take in all this detail.

270
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 But he describes this as a four foot tall humanoid.

271
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 The term he ended up using as he became more comfortable with the UFO community,

272
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 at first he was just saying it was like this four foot tall humanoid with bulging eyes,

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 like these big bulging eyes that were a, not like a pitch black,

274
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 like you would traditionally have, picture a gray alien's eyes,

275
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 it was more of a lighter eye, these big bulging light colored eyes.

276
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He uses the term nowadays, he said it looked like a reptilian gray hybrid.

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 But at the time he wasn't huge in the UFO community when he first saw this.

278
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So he probably knew what a gray alien was just from, because X-Files was really big at the time.

279
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 But nowadays when they talk about the story, they say it was a reptilian gray hybrid.

280
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Just so you can picture this, it's a four foot tall reptilian gray hybrid,

281
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 bulging eyes, but a kind of a lighter color, not that pitch black.

282
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 It was also wearing a black jumpsuit that covered it from feet to neck.

283
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Everything else was basically wearing this black jumpsuit and it was just one piece with no seams in it.

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Again, he can't see the seams from where he's at as his dog is locked in mortal combat with this alien.

285
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 He's like, "That's so bizarre, I don't see any stitching on that suit."

286
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 But this is, I wanted you to be able to picture this.

287
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 So Suzy has a hold of this alien's forearm and the alien...

288
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Sounded like the drop ship was coming for me.

289
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Aliens have finally figured out where I broadcast this podcast from.

290
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Suzy had the alien by the forearm, the alien at the same time,

291
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 reached out and grabbed Suzy's snout.

292
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 In a single motion, the alien began to pry off Suzy's jaws from his arm.

293
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And then it turned and looked directly at Jonathan,

294
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 who's standing there at that huge tree branch just watching this creature attack his dog, attack his loyal companion.

295
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And the alien looked at Jonathan with what Jonathan described as murderous eyes.

296
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 He saw the human emotion, saw the hate and the anger in this creature's eyes.

297
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 This alien has now grabbed a hold of the top of Suzy's jaw, the snout, and begins to pull her head back.

298
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But really, the lower jaw is still underneath his forearm.

299
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It bit onto the alien's arm and now he's pulling the top of her snout back.

300
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He frees his arm and then completely tears off the top of Suzy's skull.

301
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 In an instant, just removes the top jaw, the eyes, the brain, and shreds it off of Suzy's body.

302
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Jonathan's stunned and horrified.

303
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 He's staring at Suzy's body, sands the top of her head, right?

304
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 He's just watched Suzy's body kind of take a step or two and then collapse in a heap.

305
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 What happens then is something that Jonathan's looking at the remains of his dog and the gore involved in such a violent act.

306
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 He can still see the tongue, he can still see the lower jaw, everything else is intact, the top of its head has been removed.

307
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And while he's taking, I mean, such an amazing level of violence.

308
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I mean, I guess the last episode in this series, we had two aliens rip apart a little man, but they had no connection with the little man.

309
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The little man probably had a family, people may have been watching from the bushes crying, but Jonathan's looking at his loyal dog, his loyal dog's corpse at this point, laying on the ground.

310
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And through his sorrow and his rage and his terror, he can't even begin to comprehend what's about to happen next.

311
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 He said, what it looked like was he's looking at Suzy's corpse, he's looking at the body of Suzy.

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 He said it began to crumple in on itself.

313
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He said it was almost as if somewhere unseen within her body was a black hole.

314
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Because she began to compress and crumple and contort and crush into a singular point.

315
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And he's watching this body go [makes a sound of a body being torn apart]

316
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Golden retrievers are big dogs.

317
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Even if it was a Twawha, it would be pretty impressive, it would be pretty freaky.

318
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 But to watch this dog basically melt into a singular point, and melt's not even the right word, like getting sucked into a black hole is probably the best descriptor for it.

319
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 It just got sucked in and then all that was left on the forest floor was a small pile of white ash.

320
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 How could you even comprehend what you just saw? Like how shocking would that be?

321
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 It's bad enough your dog got its head ripped off.

322
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It's such a gory fashion too, right? If someone chopped your dog's head off, that would be horrible.

323
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 But if someone ripped its head off, you're like, "Please, go talk to my killing dog so we know you've had bad experiences with dogs in the past."

324
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I'm not pro killing dog, by the way. I'm not pro killing dog in any way, shape, or form.

325
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 I'm not pro killing dog. I'm just saying that there are, if you came out in your back, you're like, "Okay, I'll just stop. I won't start listing ways that you can find your dog's head."

326
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I love dogs. I do. I'm not, I don't want to make it sound like I'm some sort of maniac. I was like, "I can't wait to tell this story."

327
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Anyways, let's move past the dead dog. It would be shocking, that's what I was going to say.

328
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Jonathan, finally, his rage overcomes his shock, and he begins charging this alien, a tree branch firmly in hand.

329
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 He begins charging the alien, and he sees the alien kind of takes a step back, and he figures it's going to attack me.

330
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Whatever happens next, I'm doing it in self-defense.

331
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 He's running towards this little guy, four foot tall dog murderer, and he brings that tree branch down on his head so hard, splits its skull right open.

332
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And he said, he goes, "I thought it was going to attack me."

333
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 It took a step back when I was running towards it, and I thought it was going to attack me. Maybe it was going to start running around in front of me,

334
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 and also get behind me, find my weakness, rip me to pieces. I didn't know. He goes, "I figured it was going to kill me too. It already killed my dog."

335
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I had to hit this thing as hard as I could to save my own life.

336
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And that's totally possible, right? If this thing had started moving again, there's no way Jonathan could have gotten it to it.

337
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And he saw what happened the last time.

338
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Two living things, an alien and a creature from Earth. His dog Susie went toe to toe, so he came in and ferociously smashed this creature's head open.

339
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And it is so violent. The way he describes this story, the way he describes these wounds, it's interesting because, again, we don't see this level of violence typically in alien stories.

340
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 He goes, "I hit it so hard, I cracked its skull open, blood begins spurting out. I can see brain matter."

341
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 This creature falls to the ground, and there's just blood soaking the soil of the forest.

342
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Pieces of flesh still stuck to shattered skull, just laying there on the ground.

343
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 His, after everything he's seen, after everything that he's been through, just in the past 10 minutes, right? 5 minutes, probably. 30 seconds. I mean, this was such a short encounter.

344
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Despite everything that he'd seen previous to this, he thought when he was looking at the brain and the busted skull and the blood, he thought, "Oh my God, I just killed a kid."

345
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 "I just killed a human child who was pulling a prank. A kid was wearing a costume and I bashed his head open." "Oh my God, I just killed somebody."

346
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And this is a super interesting reaction. He actually goes into shock. That's not the interesting part. I imagine that would happen. He goes into shock.

347
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 He sits on the ground, he's feeling completely nauseous, and despite everything that he's seen previous to this, right, I'm not talking about his life experiences.

348
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Again, I'm talking about just the past minute or two. This thing moving completely fast, ripping his dog's head in half, turning the dog into ash with some sort of internalized miniature black hole.

349
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 He goes, "I think I just killed a kid." Now, kids these days are on some crazy things, but black holes are not one of them.

350
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 He honestly sits there for a while and he thinks, "Oh my God, my career's over. I'm going to go to prison. I murdered someone. How am I going to explain this to people?"

351
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 That's so interesting because obviously at this point is when we get the description of the creature. When he bashes its head in, that's when he says it had this suit on and it had these bull-gine eyes.

352
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 The bull-gine eyes are probably because you just bashed its brains and the eyes are popping out, but this is when he gets a close-up view of this alien.

353
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I'm wondering if that is some sort of self-defense technique for aliens. We've covered stories before where people have had their guns drawn on aliens and guns drawn on cryptids and they can't pull the trigger.

354
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Not because they haven't changed a heart. These are experienced hunters that are out in the middle of the woods that have a bizarre encounter and they literally cannot pull the trigger.

355
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 They want to, but they physically cannot. We've covered a story recently about two hunters who went out to go kill wild boars who encountered a wolf man, a werewolf, and they didn't remember dropping their guns, but they did.

356
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 They were ready to shoot other animals and kill them. That's why they went out there. When they got back home, one of their wives was like, "Where are your guns?" and they didn't realize that they had left them there.

357
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Is this some sort of self-defense mechanism? Because obviously kids can't run so fast they're a blur, although some parents may argue with me on that.

358
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Kids can't run so fast that they're a blur. They definitely can't rip the skulls off of dogs and then the dog body just shrinks into nothingness. But he's sitting there for a good while and he's thinking, "Oh my God, I just killed a kid. I just killed a kid."

359
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Eventually, though, he starts to realize that what has happened here is truly a bizarre event and that is a creature of some sort.

360
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Alien, possibly some sort of cryptid government laboratory, who knows, but that is not a human. He starts to kind of come to a sense.

361
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 That's when he begins taking photographs. He was up in the middle of the woods. It was a beautiful day. He figured, "I'll bring my camera with me."

362
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 He brought out what the rest of his gear. He begins to take photos of it. There are photos of this alien. He takes photos of this thing.

363
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And at that point, he begins to hear this strange humming coming through the forest.

364
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 He encounters it like as if the story could not get any weirder.

365
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 I found out about this story from a thing about it, Docs.com. They got it from a book called Unsolved UFO Mysteries, which I bought a copy of just so I could get more details on this story.

366
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I found this fascinating. And the book got it from Dr. Reed had called into coast to coast AM with Art Bell and actually had told this story on the radio.

367
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 He had multiple call-ins about this story. We'll get to more of that in a second.

368
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 He sees or hears something in the woods nearby. He goes out there and sees a, what he describes as a black obelisk floating about three feet off the ground.

369
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 He described as being 10 feet tall, four feet wide, letting off this strange humming sound. He's taking photographs of that.

370
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 He walked up to it. He touched it. I guess probably he still is in shock.

371
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 At this point, it's been about an hour or two since the encounter. Like he was sitting there for that long trying to convince himself that he didn't actually kill another human.

372
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 He goes up, he touches this obelisk and the humming stopped. And then he said the humming returned again. But this time it sounded friendlier.

373
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And then he slipped and said that he slapped the obelisk and his hand began to burn.

374
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 So he's like, okay, I'm done with the obelisk stuff. I don't know what this is. It's getting late. Again, it was three when all of this started around 3pm.

375
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 He's been sitting out here for a couple hours. He's still an hour and a half from his car.

376
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 He's like, I gotta get back to the car. I don't know what else is out here. There's an alien killing my dog. There's this. There's this giant floating hand burning thing.

377
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I definitely don't want it to be dark around this. So he's like, okay, I'm going to time to hike back to my car.

378
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And again, and just kind of a weird, I don't know, he could just be a human or he could just still be in shock.

379
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 He gets back to the site of the alien showdown and he goes, I better bury this guy. I should bury this alien, right?

380
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 I can't leave it out here. I can't turn it into a pile of ash.

381
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 He realizes he doesn't have a shovel, but he does have a thermo blanket.

382
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 It's one of those foil blankets and he goes, you know what's even better than burying an alien? Bringing it home.

383
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 So he threw that little four foot alien on top of the thermo blanket and then carried it like a hobo.

384
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Like just bundled it up and he said it was incredibly light. Not the blanket. This is an advertisement for the thermo blanket.

385
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 He said the body of this alien only weighed around 50 pounds.

386
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Now 50 pounds is still an hour and a half hike back to his car and it's getting darker rapidly,

387
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 but he does wrap this alien up in the blanket, throw it over his shoulder and carries it through the woods.

388
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Back to his car, opens up his trunk and tosses the alien inside.

389
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 And as he's driving back to his home in Seattle, he begins to think, you know what the best outcome would be?

390
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 When I pull up to my home, I open the trunk and there's nothing in there.

391
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 This was all just some sort of horrible dream, but little did he know the nightmare was just beginning.

392
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 I don't do many two-part episodes on Dead Rabbit Radio, but this story gets even weirder and I wanted to save the rest.

393
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 There's a whole other part of the story.

394
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Now we've changed locations like a good horror movie.

395
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Started off in the woods, now it's in the suburbs.

396
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 We're going to see what happens at Dr. Reed's house.

397
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 We're also going to take a look at, there's some people who say the story is completely made up.

398
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 There's a UFO watchdog group that has taken particular, it's very interesting, out of all of the, the story may be made up, right?

399
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I will say this, I wasn't able to find the photograph yet of this alien's body.

400
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 I did find a YouTube video.

401
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 I mean, I listened to it, I've tied up all my notes for this, all my notes for this story and I was like, I'll do the rip the dog apart.

402
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 This is crazy.

403
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 I know my listeners are going to love this.

404
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 And then like after I got everything prepped, I go, oh, there's a YouTube video of the alien.

405
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 What?

406
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 And I looked it up and I was like, oh, okay.

407
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 So there is a whole other side to the story.

408
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 There's actually two more sides of the story, but we'll have it wrapped up in the next episode.

409
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 We'll talk about what happened when he brought the alien home and then we'll talk about, there are people who say this whole thing was fate.

410
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Everything was fate.

411
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 And what's interesting though, is there's only one group that's saying that.

412
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 This isn't a super disputed case.

413
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 A lot of people go, no, yeah, the YouTube video is kind of goofy.

414
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 YouTube video is kind of goofy.

415
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 There's a lot of people who say this story is 100% authentic and then there's one UFO watchdog group that completely says that not only is this story fake, it's actually a scam.

416
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And that involves identity theft or changing identities, all sorts of crazy stuff.

417
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 So we're going to take a look at that on the next episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

418
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 I'll put the YouTube video on the show notes.

419
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 They're like, oh man, that story was so good.

420
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 The story is good.

421
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 It might be true.

422
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 It might just be a bad video.

423
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Who knows?

424
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Maybe the FBI made the video like that on purpose.

425
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Disinformation.

426
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be our email address.

427
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 You can also do this up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.

428
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 TikTok is @DeadRabbitRadio.

429
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

430
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

431
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
