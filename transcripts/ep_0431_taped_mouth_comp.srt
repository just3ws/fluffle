1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A pirate makes a deal to save the lives of his crew.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,920
 And then something impossible happens.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,660
 And then we take a look at a terrifying case of abduction.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,360
 This is the story where true crime and aliens meet.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,200
 Is it possible that UFOs are kidnapping blonde women today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:39,600
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,320
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 Hope you guys.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
 It's beautiful here.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
 Little town of Hood River.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
 It's quite beautiful.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,320
 I'm gonna do a little science experiment on myself.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,820
 I just bought this new stuff.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,560
 You know everyone's a little stressed nowadays.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,960
 Everyone's a little stressed.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
 Sabine.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,720
 She's a big old hippie.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,920
 She hangs out with a bunch of hippies.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,680
 I'm not a hippie and I don't hang out with hippies.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 Sabine is my only contact to the portal of hippie dumb.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:13,160
 Anyways, you guys, long time listeners of the show know how much I despise anything homeopathic,

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
 right?

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
 I think it's useless.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,480
 Well anyways, I've been stressed out a lot and she goes, "You should try this stuff."

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,480
 It's called Formula 303.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,360
 It's like Valerian root and passion flower and all bunch of other stuff.

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 I'm gonna give it a shot.

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
 I'm gonna give it a shot live on the air.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
 It's not live for you.

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,880
 You could be listening to this weeks from now.

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
 It's not live for you.

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
 I'm gonna give it a shot.

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,000
 So if I start to get all "Uuuuh" by the end of the episode, it's not a normal episode.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,040
 It's Formula 303.

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,560
 And actually it kind of makes me think this does work because it smells so terrible.

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,720
 It smells like butt crack.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,880
 That's not an exaggeration.

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,840
 If it was cheaper I would say buy some just to smell it.

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,000
 It smells like butt crack.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
 Let me take these real quick here.

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,880
 You thought you were just gonna hear about Ghost instead a live science experiment.

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,880
 Also let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon someone who's been supporting

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
 the show for a while.

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,360
 Mellow Rooze.

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
 Mellow Rooze.

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,360
 Thank you so much for supporting the show all this time.

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
 Really, really appreciate it.

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
 You are going to be our captain.

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,480
 Our first story hop on board the dead rabbit dreadnought Mellow Rooze.

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,320
 I want you behind that big old steering wheel.

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
 We are headed off.

54
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
 Pfft.

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 Pfft.

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,560
 Giant boats.

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,520
 Battleship floating through the waters.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,240
 We are leaving behind the Pacific coast.

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,280
 We are going to take our time floating in our custom battleship, the dead rabbit dreadnought.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,800
 Having a good time.

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,360
 We are also going back in time to the 1300s.

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 So BING!

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 We are all pirates.

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 Oi, hoi, hoi.

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,840
 Matey, matey, mate.

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,600
 Pirate songs doing this stuff and we are all just drinking ale and we are making parrots

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,920
 fight each other to see who has the privilege to sit on my shoulder.

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
 Spoiler alert, none of them.

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,320
 I used to have a parrot, a big giant parrot and it always chased me around the house and

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,800
 it would try to bite me all the time.

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,000
 And the weirdest thing is, is it tried to bite two people, me and women.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Like it hated women and then hated me but other dudes it would be like *mimics* just

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 like walking on their arm and stuff like that.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,160
 My grandpa would like feed it.

75
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,680
 Just open up the cage and feed it.

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,920
 The bird would hop out and one day I woke up and I was sleeping at my grandma's house.

77
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,920
 I woke up and the bird was just walking down the hallway and I'm like "No, no, he's going

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 to attack me!"

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,280
 A little terminator bird.

80
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
 He might still be alive actually.

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
 He was like 20.

82
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 Last time I saw him.

83
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,480
 Anyways, he was a drug dealer's bird.

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,080
 But that makes the story even longer.

85
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,000
 I have to shorten it.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,160
 So we are leaving behind the intriguing story of the drug dealer's parrot who always tried

87
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,680
 to attack me and women.

88
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
 We are headed back to 1300s.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,600
 Now we are actually in the area between Denmark and Sweden.

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,080
 So there's like a little sea there.

91
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,560
 I don't know what it's called and I'm not going to look it up because it's not germane

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
 to the story.

93
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,520
 So anyways, we're in there.

94
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,680
 We're floating around in this place.

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,440
 And Melrose is like "Dude, you got to tell me what sea we're in.

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,160
 I'm crashing into shoals and stuff.

97
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
 I don't have a map."

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
 Ah, whatever.

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,720
 Back then there was a group of pirates.

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,920
 Technically they preferred to term privateers.

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,520
 They were called the "victal brothers."

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,840
 It was just kind of a term.

103
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,480
 They weren't actually all brothers.

104
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,280
 The Bloods aren't a gang made up of a bunch of hemoglobin.

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,800
 So you know, it's just a name.

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,480
 But anyways, you have these "victal brothers."

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,440
 They're out and originally, like Sweden hires them to just mess with Denmark.

108
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,280
 But then eventually the war ends.

109
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,640
 They're like "Oh, we don't need your help anymore.

110
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,480
 I hope you guys go become productive citizens with the years of experience you've had destroying

111
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,960
 boats on the high seas and plundering them."

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,560
 Bye, Sweden government just kind of goes away.

113
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,720
 So they become pirates because they're like "What have I spent the last five years training

114
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
 for?

115
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,600
 I'm not a good job as a cook?

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,560
 Maybe, but I'm actually an even better pirate."

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
 So they begin committing piracy.

118
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
 These pirates are doing their thing.

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,360
 And they're doing it quite successfully.

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,640
 Now one of them, his name was Klaus Stortbecker.

121
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
 Klaus Stortbecker.

122
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,160
 I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that.

123
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,880
 Sorry Klaus.

124
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
 But this guy stands above them all.

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,920
 He's a German based pirate who was running around with the "victal brothers."

126
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,360
 And his last name Stortbecker actually is like pirate code.

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,400
 Stortbecker means I can drink an entire mug of ale with one gulp.

128
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,280
 Basically something that Paul Bunning would be like "I don't know, that's a little exaggerated.

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,880
 I can't even do that."

130
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,000
 But apparently there was a legend that pirates "Give me that ale."

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Gulp.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Pfft.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Another one Barkeep.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Ohhhh.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Everyone's cheering in the bar.

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Obviously not possible.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,080
 I mean maybe if you're grimace and your mouth is basically three fourths to your head then

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,680
 possibly but this guy wasn't grimace.

139
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,160
 He was a normal human being.

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,960
 He wasn't a purple mascot.

141
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,240
 But anyways he took on the name Klaus Stortbecker and everyone would be like "Oh I guess the

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,640
 legend is true but that wasn't..."

143
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,400
 I'm not talking about him just because he was some sort of freak with a giant mouth.

144
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,280
 I'm talking about him because he became this legendary pirate.

145
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
 A level of Robin Hood fame.

146
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,960
 And back in the 1300s I don't think people even knew who Robin Hood was.

147
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,520
 This guy might have predated Robin Hood.

148
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
 People would have been like "Robin who?"

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,720
 They just stare at the camera with their hands like this that I'm doing that you can't see

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 on the podcast.

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,680
 And then Klaus would be like "I don't know who this Robin Hood character is but I'm the

152
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
 real guy.

153
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
 I don't know why.

154
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
 Where's the...

155
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,040
 I had the formula through a threeskeg and in."

156
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,000
 So anyways, anyways.

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,240
 The point is this is that he stole from the rich and gave to the poor.

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,320
 Now some people say he didn't do that.

159
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,920
 It would be interesting to look back.

160
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,800
 Like if you had a time machine that in and of itself is interesting but it's possible

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,680
 that these Robin Hood type characters, these Klaus Stortbecker type of characters, it

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
 was political right?

163
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,080
 Like he was stealing and the people would go "Oh but you know he gives stuff to us."

164
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,200
 And the people in power would be like "Nah he's just a common thief.

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,080
 The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

166
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,080
 Just like you have drug dealers in New York who on Christmas and Thanksgiving will provide

167
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,480
 turkeys for everyone in the neighborhood.

168
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,200
 But the other 363 days of the year they're selling crack.

169
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,040
 So you know there are stories of drug dealers like giving out cash for like electric bills

170
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,120
 and stuff like that to keep the people in their apartment complex going.

171
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,240
 But outside of that apartment complex they're selling crack.

172
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,080
 So you know they're still criminals.

173
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,360
 But anyways so Klaus Stortbecker is known really for two things.

174
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,440
 You know Robin Hood type character, probably again predating Robin Hood.

175
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,800
 I don't know how old that legend is.

176
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,000
 But also for how he died.

177
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,840
 This is why Fenris 218 sent this to me.

178
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
 So here's the story.

179
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,760
 In 1401 Klaus gets caught.

180
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,480
 What happens is the story because see again he's kind of a, he was a real person.

181
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,400
 The details, people question whether or not certain detail of his life are accurate but

182
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,040
 he was a real person.

183
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,560
 And what happens with mythology, with real people who have been turned into myths.

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,840
 You don't want to just have him be like uh oh where did I put the keys to the boat and

185
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,160
 then they get arrested right?

186
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
 You don't want to make him look stupid.

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,920
 This is interesting.

188
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,080
 He gets caught because a crew member of his turns on him.

189
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,240
 A Judas type thing.

190
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,480
 So he was a man of the people.

191
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,120
 He was doing the Lord's work by destroying these rich ships and giving the gold to the

192
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,800
 people.

193
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,080
 He can't fall apart on his own.

194
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,880
 The story is one of his own crew betrays him and just disables his rudder of a ship or

195
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
 the steering wheel of a ship or both.

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,760
 It's just something that makes the ship not move and eventually the authorities find him.

197
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,440
 Now he goes listen, if you let me and my men go, I have enough gold that you can make a

198
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,560
 gold chain that will go all the way around Hamburg.

199
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,760
 He had it that part in the end and they're like did you say Hamburg?

200
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
 Like a gold chain that goes around the province of Hamburg?

201
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,200
 Or did you say a gold chain that goes around a hamburger?

202
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,400
 And he's like a gold chain that will completely encircle Hamburg.

203
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
 They're like you're saying hamburger.

204
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
 I don't want a gold chain.

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
 Every gold chain that circles a hamburger.

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,560
 No in real life that was a bit.

207
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,680
 But in real life he did say this stuff gets in real quick.

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,720
 In real life he did say I'll have a gold chain that encircles Hamburg, the city of Hamburg,

209
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,440
 the province, whatever it was.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,640
 But anyways they go no dice.

211
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
 We're not playing that.

212
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,560
 And then they decide to chop his ship up and they found his mast.

213
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,540
 Like that big ol' giant wooden thing that sits in the middle of the boat that sails

214
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,720
 are attached to and I'm sure you know what a mast is, was stuffed full of gold.

215
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,040
 I don't believe that for a second because there's no way that boat isn't immediately

216
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,400
 tipping over in every storm possible.

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,120
 Oh no, slight breeze.

218
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
 You know that type of thing.

219
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,800
 So anyways, I don't buy that at all.

220
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,360
 But anyways, so this is what made him famous.

221
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
 His legend is this.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 He gets caught.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,520
 They don't want, he can't pay them off.

224
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,320
 They're not gonna accept that.

225
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
 So he goes okay I tell you what, new deal, new deal.

226
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 As he's eating a hamburger, a little gold chain around it.

227
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,960
 If only they could have had all of this.

228
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,220
 Here's a new deal.

229
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,440
 You line up all of my men.

230
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,640
 There's like 73 men, right?

231
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,280
 You line up the entire crew of my ship except for that one loser who turned me in.

232
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,760
 Line them up.

233
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,320
 And then you chop my head off because you're gonna execute us, right?

234
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,720
 And the authorities are like yes, chop my head off.

235
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,200
 Every man I can walk past after my husband chopped off, you have to let go.

236
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 Authorities are like what?

237
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 When?

238
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
 When?

239
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
 The world are you talking about?

240
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
 And he's like no, no, no, no, I have a plan.

241
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,840
 And they're like yeah, and it's funny because he's really, he's going to be condemned to

242
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 death.

243
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
 He's probably in the position to be making deals.

244
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,080
 But the authorities of Hamburg go yeah, sure.

245
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,000
 You chop your head off and they're all kind of looking at each other.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
 We'll chop your head off.

247
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,080
 You can walk and whoever you walk past we will spare.

248
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,360
 So the executioner gets his giant axe, shling, sunlight glistens along the blade.

249
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,560
 Klaus looks up at it and goes oh, this is gonna suck.

250
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,760
 And then cuts off Klaus's head.

251
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,720
 Now the other 73 people in line are like oh, well that, I mean I was kind of hoping he

252
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,440
 was going to be walking around.

253
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,880
 But that's kind of what I expected.

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,480
 He was just going to wait what?

255
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:48,160
 And then Klaus's headless body staggers up, hands digging to the bloody soil, pushes itself

256
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,040
 up, takes a step and another step and another step.

257
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,920
 Everyone's in shock.

258
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
 Everyone's in complete shock.

259
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,560
 And the person who's the most shocked is the guy who's 73rd in line.

260
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,520
 He's like there's no way he's getting all the way over here, right?

261
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,920
 Like it's kind of cool that he's going to spare those dudes and I really should have

262
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,640
 jumped to the front of the line, but I'm doomed.

263
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,720
 So anyways the headless body's walking by.

264
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,840
 It makes it past 11 dudes.

265
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
 And it's still going.

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,600
 The executioner at this point man, this is his bread and butter or this is his head and

267
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 blooder.

268
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 Because bloody, get it?

269
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 Get it?

270
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,760
 So anyways, he's like I can't let this guy take away my head and blooder.

271
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,800
 So he trips, Klaus's headless corpse.

272
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 Corpse falls under the dirt.

273
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 He's motionless.

274
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,520
 Now the people of Hamburg, the city council, the executioner are all completely shocked,

275
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,960
 but their word is their bond.

276
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,800
 They told this man, his dying wish, that if he could perform the impossible and walk

277
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,440
 past his men, whoever he walked past would be spared.

278
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,600
 And then the city council goes, nah, stupid.

279
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,120
 So they executed all 73 men.

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,040
 Which at that point the guy at the end of the line was like, I am glad I was at the

281
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,000
 end of the line because I was the last one executed.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,360
 But you could add a little bit of hope.

283
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,000
 They executed everybody.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,080
 And to make the story even more bizarre, put a little twist on it, the executioner is

285
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,200
 sitting there chopping these people's heads off one after another.

286
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,400
 And one of the city councilmen come to the executioner and is like, aren't you getting

287
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
 tired doing this?

288
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,880
 And the executioner is braggart.

289
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,360
 He's a big old braggart.

290
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,640
 He goes, pfft, I have enough energy that I can finish chopping all these heads off and

291
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,680
 then I can chop off everyone's head in Congress too.

292
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,840
 So they executed that guy too.

293
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,880
 After he ended up chopping off 73 heads, the town council, the leadership, the Congress

294
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,560
 of town executed the executioner for being so insolent that he said he would have enough

295
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,840
 strength to kill everybody.

296
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,800
 Now, what's interesting is Fenra has actually had, because it's a legend, Fenra has had

297
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,880
 another version of it, which is slightly more believable and still not very, but the executioner

298
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,040
 held out a sword or an axe and Klaus ran towards it and then got decapitated in his body.

299
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,400
 Basically, the momentum carried it past 11 people.

300
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,760
 It still ended with everyone being executed and still had the same amount of people.

301
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,600
 You can't run into a sword like that.

302
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
 It's hard enough to commit suicide.

303
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,600
 It's a lot harder to do it if you're watching.

304
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,120
 You would have to stop and then you'd back up.

305
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
 You're like, "Okay, this time I'm going to do it for sure."

306
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,400
 It's very, very hard to commit suicide and to let alone run towards a sword.

307
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,120
 But anyways, both stories are impossible.

308
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,120
 The thing is, is that they actually do have a little bit of proof to one part of the story,

309
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,680
 and that was the mass execution.

310
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,520
 In the 1400s, so actually a year before this supposedly happened, in the 1400s in the Hamburg

311
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,600
 records, there is a bill.

312
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
 There's a bill from a grave digger to the city.

313
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,560
 It was a bill for digging 30 Victor Brother graves.

314
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,800
 They dug them up trying to get their money from the government.

315
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,960
 That receipt, that bill, survived all this time.

316
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,600
 Survived 600, 700 years, which is insane.

317
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,000
 So they do believe that Klaus was executed in Hamburg, that it was a mass execution.

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
 There's no record, physical record of him running towards a sword or walking or anything

319
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 like that.

320
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,960
 But at least that part of the story is true.

321
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,080
 It wasn't the 73, but it does look like there was a mass pirate execution around that time.

322
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,560
 So interesting story, I really appreciate the recommendation.

323
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,680
 It's one of the stories that's definitely based on some historical fact, with a little

324
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,120
 bit of legend worked into it.

325
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,000
 And it's interesting how the legend changes over time, because all the versions I found

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,520
 were him getting his head chopped off, getting up and walking.

327
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
 That's impossible.

328
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,000
 So the story is now morphine, where people who are younger, Fenris is age, they're hearing

329
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 it as they're running towards a sword.

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,920
 That's slightly more possible, but there's no proof either happened.

331
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,240
 But still an interesting story.

332
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,280
 Nonetheless, I appreciate that very much.

333
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,200
 Melrose, let's leave behind the dead rabbit dreadnought.

334
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
 Let's hop in the carbon helicopter.

335
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,320
 We are headed to Canada.

336
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
 We're headed up to British Columbia, Canada.

337
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,760
 So let's hop in that carbon helicopter.

338
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
 Let's leave behind all of our pirate clothes.

339
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,560
 You're like, I didn't bring any other clothes, bro, I'm naked.

340
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,840
 We'll give you a jumpsuit.

341
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,040
 We're going to give you an official dead rabbit jumpsuit.

342
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
 It's pretty cool.

343
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,320
 It has a big giant logo on the back.

344
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
 Not a dead rabbit logo, just like an Exxon mobile logo, because I couldn't afford custom

345
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
 jumpsuits.

346
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
 You're like, what?

347
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
 This is lame.

348
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
 We're fine.

349
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
 Now we're all making fun of you for not bringing enough clothes to listen to this episode.

350
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,720
 You should bring extra clothes when you're listening to this podcast.

351
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,480
 Melrose, take us up.

352
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 We're flying.

353
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,120
 We're going to the year 1994.

354
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
 This story.

355
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,280
 This story is creepy.

356
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:47,760
 I was reading it on that thing about it, docs.website, and I was like, okay, I'm lucky I was able

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,600
 to find more information on this.

358
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
 It's definitely an incredibly bizarre one.

359
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,120
 Here we go with this.

360
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,080
 We're headed to the Dollarton Highway.

361
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,720
 That's in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

362
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,120
 Helicopters flying over this highway.

363
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
 It's very busy.

364
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,240
 It's rush hour traffic time.

365
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's 5.30 in the afternoon.

366
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,560
 It's 1994 in the month of June.

367
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
 Helicopter lands.

368
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:28,240
 We all get out and we see a young mother sitting in her kitchen.

369
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
 She's cooking dinner.

370
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
 She's preparing dinner.

371
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,440
 Now, the way her apartment's situated, she's on the second floor.

372
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,200
 She can not look out her window, but she can hear out her window.

373
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,160
 That's where her four kids are out right now.

374
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,640
 They're not hanging outside of her window.

375
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
 "Help, mom, help!"

376
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
 "I can't hear you!"

377
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,600
 No, they're out playing in the yard and she can hear them outside of the window.

378
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,720
 You got Susan, a little five-year-old girl.

379
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,680
 You have Edward, he's seven.

380
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
 Kathy, she's seven.

381
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,360
 I don't know if they're twins or not.

382
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,080
 I would assume, biologically speaking, I would assume so, but maybe she just had a real busy

383
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
 year.

384
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
 Edward's seven.

385
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
 Kathy's seven.

386
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,200
 And then Nathan is eight.

387
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 So she definitely had a busy couple of years there.

388
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 All the kids are playing out in the yard.

389
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,400
 Now, she can't see him from where she's at, but she has to make dinner.

390
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,200
 She can hear him and she feels that's safe.

391
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
 "Dudu dudu dudu, dudu dudu dudu."

392
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,440
 "Hey, Edward, throw me that ball!"

393
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
 You got it, Susan!

394
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
 "Yay, let's go!

395
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
 Come on, go for a touchdown, go for it!"

396
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
 Yeah, yeah.

397
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,080
 It takes the mom like a minute or two to really start to realize that there's no sound coming

398
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
 from outside.

399
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,040
 Because you wouldn't notice it right away unless there was like a high-pitched argument

400
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,640
 and then it stopped immediately.

401
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,360
 Our ears get used to sounds.

402
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,280
 That's why babies freak out all the time because they hear every single sound and see every

403
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,600
 single color.

404
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,720
 As were adults, and even kids have this problem too, that's why they can't sit at a restaurant

405
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 and eat food.

406
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
 They're constantly getting distracted.

407
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,360
 As adults, we tune out so many things all the time.

408
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,760
 So it's going to take a minute or two for you to realize that there's no noise coming

409
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
 from outside.

410
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,720
 She has the cooking going on, she's singing that jaunty tune, but then she does realize

411
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,200
 that she does not hear the kids outside anymore.

412
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,240
 Chill runs up her spine.

413
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,720
 So she runs downstairs.

414
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,320
 This is a little apartment complex.

415
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,600
 She's running downstairs and she now sees her kids inside the complex.

416
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,000
 They're no longer playing in the yard that her apartment overlooked.

417
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,920
 They're talking excitedly and they're a little bit terrified.

418
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,480
 They're still trying to process what's going on.

419
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,160
 The mom goes, I don't know if I told you her name yet, Karen Manning.

420
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,000
 She gets the kids, she's like, "What are you guys doing in here?

421
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Like it was weird.

422
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,560
 I heard you guys outside and then you guys stopped."

423
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,800
 All the kids at the same time start telling her that a flying saucer just appeared over

424
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 their yard.

425
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,360
 Now she does something weird when they mention that detail.

426
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,400
 I don't know if it makes the story fake or if it adds an air of authenticity to it.

427
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,720
 I don't know if it's something that I would do and again I don't think she did it.

428
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,280
 I don't think they said that and she's like, "Do this."

429
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,120
 But after a period of time, she's asking what happened and they're talking and they're

430
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,280
 talking and talking.

431
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,600
 She goes, "She separated the kids and she said, 'I want you to draw what you saw.'"

432
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,920
 Now that's something that a UFO investigator would do or paranormal investigator would

433
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 do.

434
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,960
 A little leery of a mom who would do that.

435
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,080
 Mom, mom, this car just pulled up and almost tried to kidnap one of us.

436
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,400
 Okay everyone, separate, go into your own dark room and draw a picture of the car.

437
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,280
 Like, I mean maybe that's more extreme example but she had them all draw the UFO.

438
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,440
 Now after they all came out of their isolation, the kids are like, "I don't know how to draw."

439
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,400
 She's like, "You learn perspective and then you have me a picture."

440
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,960
 After the kids come out, again, I don't know if that was a matter of minutes after they

441
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,480
 say we got abducted by a UFO.

442
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,160
 She immediately banished them to their rooms or if they talked for half hour.

443
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,600
 But anyways, they all come back with a picture.

444
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 It's the same thing.

445
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
 It's a traditional flying saucer.

446
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,520
 A little people inside of it.

447
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
 And that's when she goes, "Okay, these kids aren't making this stuff up."

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,840
 Again, it doesn't seem kind of harsh, but anyways, anyways, the kids aren't making this

449
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
 stuff up.

450
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
 What did you guys see out there?

451
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
 Like, what exactly happened?

452
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
 Draw it!

453
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
 No, no, she didn't do it.

454
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,080
 She's like, "I want you to draw.

455
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,360
 I want you to make a 32 page comic book about your adventures."

456
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,520
 This is what the kids say that they saw.

457
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,160
 It's 5.30 PM, rush hour traffic.

458
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,320
 Now, they're watching the cars drive by on the freeway.

459
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,960
 None of them stop.

460
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,120
 No one else saw what was going on.

461
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
 These kids did.

462
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,000
 And we've actually covered UFO stories like that before where the kids are either the

463
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,720
 only people who see it or the first people who see it.

464
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,280
 This UFO is floating over the freeway, broad daylight.

465
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:03,120
 It's floating over the freeway and it comes into the kids yard.

466
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,880
 Now this UFO has portholes in it.

467
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,720
 Little windows that you can look out of.

468
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
 Little portholes in it.

469
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,400
 I mean, the space shuttle has windows, right?

470
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
 Even though it's flying through space, you still want to be able to look out the window

471
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,600
 and be like, "Look out, asteroid!"

472
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,720
 So it makes sense that it would have windows.

473
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,520
 But anyways, it has little porthole windows and these kids are watching this UFO.

474
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,560
 It's quite close to them because they can see a lot of detail.

475
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,440
 They're kind of frozen in place.

476
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,520
 They see at two of the portholes.

477
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,520
 Women.

478
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 Human women.

479
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,560
 Both blonde women.

480
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,400
 One of this porthole, one of that porthole.

481
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,960
 Kids kind of look at each other.

482
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,040
 What is going on in there?

483
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,560
 Because it's two human women, unmistakably human women.

484
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,000
 Not Nordics, not aliens, hybrids.

485
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,440
 These are human women with a terrified look in their eyes.

486
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
 Panic.

487
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,560
 Fear.

488
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,520
 But that's all they could really see.

489
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,760
 They could make out the expression from the eyes because their mouths were taped shut.

490
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,480
 And although they were struggling, trying to say something.

491
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,520
 They couldn't move.

492
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,680
 They couldn't speak.

493
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,920
 They could only convey the sheer terror of the situation they were in.

494
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,120
 By their eyes.

495
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,980
 A door opens up on the still hovering UFO.

496
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,520
 And a male alien figure.

497
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,400
 It's not described as a gray.

498
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,480
 It's not described as a robot, a reptilian, or anything like that.

499
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,360
 We know that he's green.

500
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 So he's not human.

501
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,680
 I mean, unless you know several green people.

502
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:57,160
 He's green with pointy ears and three eyeballs.

503
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:03,600
 The middle one is shining bright blue.

504
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,380
 Now the kids are starting to panic at this point.

505
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,500
 I mean, obviously seeing kids aren't stupid.

506
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,020
 You see a human in distress.

507
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,220
 You know something is wrong.

508
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,660
 Maybe if you're baby dumb, you wouldn't get it.

509
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,100
 You'd be like, "Me, crawl on you!"

510
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,620
 As the person's like, "No, no, go away!

511
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,140
 There's a bomb on my chest!"

512
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,380
 Kids aren't dumb.

513
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,740
 Even the five year old will recognize panic or fear.

514
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,780
 They'll recognize it because they'll see their older brothers or their parents get worried

515
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,580
 and then that will make them worried as well.

516
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
 So they see this.

517
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,060
 The door opens up and someone who's unmistakably alien.

518
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,640
 Okay, could be someone in a costume, but he's hovering 50 feet off the ground in a giant

519
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
 UFO.

520
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,480
 So it's most likely an alien.

521
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,200
 What's interesting is that a great alien is, this story takes place in 1994, a great alien

522
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,960
 really became super popularized not by the book communion.

523
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,880
 That did bring that to the forefront, but shows like the X-Files really made the great

524
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,320
 alien part of pop culture before that it was little green men.

525
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,220
 So I think it's interesting these kids are seeing and these kids weren't watching X-Files.

526
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,980
 I don't think X-Files was on June 1994.

527
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,740
 The idea of these aliens, these little kids seeing what they would consider an alien as

528
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,740
 green, pointy ears is also something that's very inhuman, almost animalistic.

529
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,060
 We think of animals having pointy ears or mythological creatures like elves and stuff

530
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,060
 like that.

531
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
 Green, three eyes.

532
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,940
 Obviously, I don't think there's any species on the planet that has three eyeballs.

533
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,720
 None of them have glowing blue eyeballs and again none of them pilot UFOs.

534
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,680
 Anyway, so now they're totally freaking out.

535
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
 Now it makes sense.

536
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,440
 Oh, these women have been kidnapped by this giant monster who's flying a UFO.

537
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,840
 The kids kick bricks.

538
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,320
 They just start running in every direction.

539
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:52,840
 What happens is a yellow light starts chasing Susan as she's running around the yard.

540
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,000
 It is being projected from the UFO and it's described as being a yellow light with sparkles

541
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,800
 in it and it begins chasing her around the yard.

542
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,500
 And as she's running from it, she hears a voice in her head.

543
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:17,060
 We are going to pick you up and take you is the exact quote that she remembers it saying.

544
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,380
 None of the other kids hear this.

545
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,340
 It was completely in her head, but she hears an alien voice say quote, we are going to

546
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,660
 pick you up and take you.

547
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:36,860
 The beam hits her and she says from her waist up she was completely enveloped in the light

548
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:42,140
 and then her little feet as much as they wanted to run slowly started to lift off of the ground.

549
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,620
 Now the other kids see this.

550
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,160
 They don't hear the voice, but they definitely see the beam.

551
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,380
 They see their little sister floating up in the air.

552
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:58,940
 She says the beam felt she described it as quote, hot, burning and cold.

553
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,580
 Which is an interesting combination.

554
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,260
 Yeah, you can have something that's so cold that it burns, but hot, burning and cold.

555
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,140
 It's almost just like her nervous system is being overpowered by this thing.

556
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,820
 She gets up about six inches off the ground and then she hears another voice in her head.

557
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:21,560
 Same voice as before, but this time it's saying, I'm going to let you go now.

558
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,000
 The light shuts off, she falls to the ground, she was only a few inches off the ground.

559
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,480
 And then a bizarre detail, absolutely bizarre detail to this, all the kids ate something.

560
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,600
 So they all ate something in this brief amount of time.

561
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,320
 They all, all the kids said that while this was going on, they had a meal.

562
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,940
 They don't know what they ate, but they knew what it tasted like.

563
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,300
 This is absolutely bizarre.

564
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,820
 This is absolutely bizarre.

565
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:58,280
 The, um, one of them said it tasted like oranges.

566
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,700
 One of them said it tasted like curry.

567
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,740
 One of them said it tasted like rice and tomatoes.

568
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,120
 If I ever meet an alien and they put the taste of rice and tomatoes in my mouth, I will spend

569
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,840
 the rest of my life dedicated to destroying an entire alien civilization.

570
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,000
 I don't care which one.

571
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,440
 I don't care if an alien ever came down, shot me with a beam and made me taste rice and

572
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,320
 tomatoes.

573
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 It's war.

574
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
 It's Starship Troopers level genocide.

575
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,320
 That's disgusting, bro.

576
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,960
 That is so gross.

577
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,480
 And then the last kid just tasted something greasy.

578
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,580
 I would much rather taste grease in my mouth than rice and tomatoes.

579
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
 That poor kid.

580
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,460
 That poor kid's traumatized to this day.

581
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,460
 Rice and tomatoes.

582
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,260
 Rice and tomatoes sitting in some padded room.

583
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
 What happened to him?

584
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,380
 Well his sister was almost abducted by an alien.

585
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
 That's terrifying.

586
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
 No, no, no.

587
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
 That's not even the worst part.

588
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,820
 The aliens made him taste rice and tomatoes.

589
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
 My God.

590
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,820
 Those bastards.

591
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,820
 Anyways.

592
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
 UFO.

593
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,820
 [makes weird noises]

594
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,040
 The mom is like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait."

595
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
 Like, okay.

596
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,960
 You're telling me that you saw UFO with two kidnapped women in it.

597
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
 And they're like, "Yeah?"

598
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
 And you ate something?

599
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,280
 And they don't know what they ate.

600
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,520
 The weird thing is, the whole thing is weird.

601
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,320
 But they were super hungry after this.

602
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
 They're like, "Food.

603
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 Food.

604
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
 Food.

605
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
 Food."

606
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,820
 Little Susan who almost got captured was like, "Food.

607
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,820
 Food.

608
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
 Food."

609
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,960
 They were ravenous.

610
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,040
 They were super, super hungry after this event.

611
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,460
 Even though they all said that they ate something.

612
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,060
 That kid, poor kid.

613
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,060
 Rice and tomatoes.

614
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,780
 But I don't know if that's considered eating something.

615
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,380
 That's more just like eating a punishment.

616
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,900
 She had to like, "Oh, hurry up.

617
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,940
 I'll finish making dinner."

618
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,440
 Because the kids were super hungry.

619
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,020
 Now, what happens is ending the kid's dad comes home.

620
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,340
 "Hey kids, how you doing?

621
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
 How was your day?"

622
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,380
 They're like, "Shaking in the corner."

623
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,940
 Karen's like, "It was kind of rough."

624
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,320
 They tell the dad that story.

625
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,480
 And he's like, "What?

626
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
 You guys ate something and you ate rice and tomatoes?"

627
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
 I know, I know.

628
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,960
 He's like, "You bastards!"

629
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
 Loading up his shotgun.

630
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,460
 The whole story is creepy.

631
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
 Like there's multiple...

632
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,720
 Obviously, if the kids are eating something and not remembering it, you probably have

633
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,200
 a little bit of lost time.

634
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,680
 Why were they trying to abduct a little girl?

635
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
 Why the little girl in the first place?

636
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 That's also creepy instead of the other kids.

637
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:30,300
 The two adult women bound and gagged on a UFO is a terrifying image.

638
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,820
 Although you'd have to say, I mean, are aliens using duct tape?

639
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,420
 Like are they like, "Nothing beats good old duct tape."

640
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,140
 Like they're using it to patch up their ship when they're getting hit by a macrameediarites.

641
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,180
 Was it space tape?

642
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,460
 Who knows?

643
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,020
 But definitely, I guess what they're bound with, I guess that doesn't matter.

644
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:53,240
 Whether or not it's a hollow chain or they're just duct tape to a chair, they're still

645
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,040
 kidnapping women.

646
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,560
 The story obviously could be totally made up.

647
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
 Right?

648
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
 And let me finish it actually first.

649
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
 Let me finish it too.

650
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,640
 So, the after effects of this.

651
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,440
 Susan, little Susan was absolutely for sure that the aliens were going to come back for

652
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
 her.

653
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,360
 For the longest time, she 100% believed the aliens were not going to leave her alone.

654
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,720
 However, at five years old, she was a little kiddo, right?

655
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,920
 "Mommy, can I get a blanket?"

656
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,460
 "Yes, honey, go get a blanket."

657
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,780
 "Will you come with me?"

658
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,540
 "Yeah, I'll come with you."

659
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,540
 That type of thing.

660
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,180
 After this, she became very independent.

661
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,220
 Very very strong-willed independent girl.

662
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,660
 Her personality basically matured after this event.

663
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,380
 She started to be able to take care of herself.

664
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:44,620
 But her older sister, Kathy, used to be very independent, strong-willed.

665
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:51,600
 Now she was terrified of ever being alone, to the point that she needed her mom or her

666
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,080
 sister to be with her, even in the bathroom.

667
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,880
 She went backwards.

668
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,520
 Not necessarily acting more childlike, but her fears became childlike.

669
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,520
 She became far more withdrawn.

670
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,160
 And even though she wasn't a target of the aliens, she also became petrified of what

671
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,940
 they represented, which is kidnapping space pirates, right?

672
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,540
 You don't need to have any overwhelming psychological answer to that.

673
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
 They're kidnappers.

674
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,580
 Nobody likes kidnappers.

675
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,140
 Is the story true?

676
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
 Who knows, right?

677
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,820
 It could be a bunch of- it could be a complete work of fiction.

678
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,140
 It could be a bunch of kids misremembering something.

679
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:37,100
 But for the sake of argument, what these kids saw was true for the sake of argument.

680
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,040
 It opens up a whole floodgate of things.

681
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,600
 Because I know a lot of people.

682
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,520
 You have people who go missing, and they're runaways.

683
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
 That's the bulk.

684
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,040
 That's like 80% of everyone who goes missing.

685
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,280
 They're found within the first couple weeks, months, or runaways.

686
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,920
 Then you have people that go missing, and unfortunately they're the victim of a crime.

687
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,560
 Those things are found out fairly quickly.

688
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,200
 And then you have people who just disappear off the face of the earth.

689
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,820
 99.9% of the time, obviously, it's still death by misadventure, fall into a criminal act,

690
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,300
 something like that.

691
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,620
 Or got a new life somewhere.

692
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,980
 Those things are all possible.

693
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,260
 But when we start talking about the realm of paranormal, you start getting stuff like

694
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,980
 missing 411, or we've covered people on this show before as well who just disappeared.

695
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,060
 Like they're on an island at night, and they've never been found.

696
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,300
 It was that young girl who just kinda, in that story, is creepy.

697
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,260
 Just vanished.

698
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:38,200
 So that's when people who are into the paranormal start to look at stuff like ghosts, dimensional

699
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,000
 portals, UFOs, as ridiculous as that stuff may sound to a normal person.

700
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
 To us it's in the realm of possibility.

701
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,000
 What makes this story creepy is that it's basically combined two already creepy things.

702
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,640
 Kidnapping.

703
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,880
 People disappearing.

704
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 That's just creepy.

705
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,240
 And then UFOs.

706
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,960
 Aliens.

707
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:05,380
 A dark force in the universe that we can't stop coming here and taking humans.

708
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,100
 If you saw that happen in a car, if a car drove by and you saw two women with their mouths

709
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,860
 duct taped shut, being driven by a guy, green or not, it would terrify you, you would most

710
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,800
 likely call the authorities.

711
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,940
 But in this case, there's nothing you could do.

712
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,100
 Whether it was four kids in the yard, or four adults in the yard.

713
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:33,880
 To see this sight would show truly how powerless we are in the face of paranormal phenomenon.

714
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,840
 And what if the ship had decided to take Susan?

715
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,920
 Decided to just suck her up into the UFO.

716
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,600
 Those kids would have run into the house, they would have told their mom, the mom would

717
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,640
 have called the police, the police would have shown up.

718
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,960
 How long do you think it would take before the police started investigating the parents

719
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,300
 for the disappearance of little Susan?

720
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,560
 They wouldn't believe that story.

721
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,540
 They wouldn't buy that story at all.

722
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,420
 They'd start investigating the parents, they'd start investigating the kids.

723
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,540
 They wouldn't go, "Well, I guess that's just that.

724
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,180
 Investigations over UFO kidnapped this girl, she simply would have disappeared."

725
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,340
 Those two other girls who were already on the UFO, whether they were hiking out in the

726
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,060
 woods by themselves, whether they were truck stop prostitute, maybe they were just getting

727
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,300
 off their job at a yogurt shop.

728
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,300
 Who knows?

729
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,600
 It would just require them to be alone for a short enough time to get sucked up.

730
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,400
 And as long as there were no witnesses, it would just be an unfortunate statistic.

731
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,760
 Young women disappear.

732
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,520
 Young blonde women just vanish.

733
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,960
 Start looking into it.

734
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,160
 Hit a couple dead ends, goes into a cold case file.

735
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,360
 Had Susan been walking down the street alone, would she have been taken?

736
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,980
 The UFO could definitely hide itself from large groups of witnesses if no one on the

737
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,540
 freeway saw it, if only the kids saw it.

738
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,860
 So if there hadn't been three other kids there, would Susan have simply vanished?

739
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:09,140
 And this story would go from being a bizarrely terrifying UFO story to a true crime story.

740
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:16,020
 What happened to little Susan on that day in June 5.30 PM?

741
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:23,280
 No leads, suspicion falls on the parents, but in the end, nothing is ever found.

742
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:34,120
 How many of our true crime stories actually have a paranormal answer?

743
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,760
