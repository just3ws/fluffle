1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
 Get your dancing shoes on because we're doing the cabbage patch and we visit a small town in Utah

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,040
 Or at least we would if it still existed

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:23,060
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I hope you're having a great day

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,060
 I'm having a great day. It's a little hot. You know what's funny?

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,280
 How are these intros gonna go when I'm freezing cold and I just gonna keep going. It's so cold. It's so cold

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:36,160
 I'm one of those guys that I I'm kind of the minority because I'd rather be hot than cold

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,860
 I feel like I am still a little more energetic when it's hot when I get when it gets cold and just miserable

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,600
 You know, I can just take my clothes off or drink a bunch of water and I can cool down

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,800
 But when you're cold when your bones get cold

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,620
 That's the worst I came across the word. Let's start off with our food-based conspiracies

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,320
 This is our week of food-based conspiracies

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,840
 So honestly, I found what I would consider one of the dumbest conspiracies and I know what you're thinking of flat earth is stupid

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
 The moon landing being faked stupid all that stuff like there's a lot of stuff

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,240
 There's a lot of competition the reason why this is so dumb because it's so easily disproven

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,200
 And yet a ton of people believe in it

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,040
 A ton of people believe in it. So this conspiracy theory is

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,680
 that China is

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,620
 Making cabbage out of plastic and selling it to people to fool them

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,380
 so you go to the store and you buy a head of cabbage and

21
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:43,300
 When you pick it up, you don't immediately feel like you go. Oh, that feels waxy and weird

22
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,700
 I'll put it in my shopping cart and then you take it home and you're cooking it and you're like that's weird

23
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,500
 It's not really cooking right but I mean who am I who am I to guess how cabbage is supposed to be cooked

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,940
 And then you eat it and you go wait a minute. This is wax

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:05,240
 Like that's one of the dumbest conspiracy theories, but people believe it in the big group of people like it's it's a conspiracy theory

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,680
 It's not so much in the West but people in Indonesia were having a big problem with it and how it started was that

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,320
 They were making this Chinese

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,120
 Business was making wax

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,100
 Copies of food for restaurants. So when you walk into the restaurant you could look at a bowl of

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,400
 I don't know wontons or dim sum or whatever because it was a lot of Japanese food on Lena

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,640
 So you could go in you could see like

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,220
 Some orange chicken and it looks perfect. You see each little piece of rice and

33
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,020
 You see chunks of orange and the sauce and that little gross piece of orange peel that they leave in there for some weird reason

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,440
 You're not supposed to eat and from that people then begin to suspect that China was making

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,360
 Wax cabbage and selling it now they were making it and there's a YouTube video showing how to make wax cabbage and we'll include that

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,200
 But that's a pretty big leap to go from here's a YouTube video showing how we manufacture this stuff to

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,800
 They're selling us wax cabbage and people were complaining about this people in Indonesia were like you check your cabbage man because it's made of wax

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,100
 They're tricking us. They're tricking us because very she's stupid because one like I said it's easily

39
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:22,100
 Let's say even if they were doing that what would be the end result you would pick up a head of cabbage immediately

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,020
 Realize it doesn't feel like a head of cabbage that it's a lot heavier

41
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,060
 And it's feels waxy and then you would put it down

42
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,320
 You're not going to and people are like oh no people are getting sick from this stuff

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,020
 if you eat a ball of wax

44
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:45,080
 You deserve to get sick if you're over the age of six and you eat a wax apple and you're not stoned

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,440
 You deserve to get a little sick don't deserve to die, but you deserve the tummy ache you get from eating that

46
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,020
 So you pick up some cabbage you go home you prepare it and then you eat it and you get sick

47
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,300
 And so people were complaining about this and there's a couple

48
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,080
 You know they've been trying to dispute this conspiracy theory, but it's like I said

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
 It's done because it's easily disproven and it's also

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,220
 vaguely racist it's a vaguely racist conspiracy

51
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,860
 When we were talking about how to build a can how to tell make up a good conspiracy theory when you do it

52
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,940
 I've always used examples of we don't trust governments and we don't trust the military or the media

53
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,140
 This conspiracy theory is don't trust the Chinese

54
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:30,380
 Don't trust anyone from China and people who believe in the conspiracy theory would go. Oh, yeah, man. Those Chinese. They're pretty shady

55
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,980
 Like you have to take that leap of logic

56
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,600
 So anyways that is just kind of a I mean that's all there is the conspiracy theory

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,080
 But again people believe in it it would you know

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,240
 We obviously know that if I watched they showed a YouTube video on how to make a wax apple people aren't going to say that

59
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,960
 The government's making us eat wax apples, but now that I say that I'm sure I'm sure that's a conspiracy

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,520
 I'm sure people believe that one out of every 85 apples is fake

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,700
 But yeah, so fake cabbage now you may be a little more

62
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,240
 Discerning when you go shopping for cabbage. I've actually never bought cabbage. I'll eat cabbage every once in a while like

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,180
 With what do you eat cabbage with?

64
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,220
 When have I eaten cabbage? I think the only time I've really eaten cabbage was with Mongolian barbecue. I love

65
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,820
 Mongolian barbecue

66
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
 The second story is

67
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,660
 An interesting story so we got the cabbage taste out of our mouth second story

68
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,260
 I find very interesting. It's on the conspiracy list on the iceberg list that we talk about all the time

69
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:41,580
 And it's one of those stories that there's so little information for it. It is hard to disprove you

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,860
 You know when you have the more information you have the easier it is to disprove

71
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,860
 This is one of those stories that started off with just the phrase and

72
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,580
 Then people begin digging into it and seeing what they could find and

73
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,140
 Then I'll present that to you and then we'll kind of go through it. So this one is called

74
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:07,700
 The Bel Ray Surge now the conspiracy goes like this in the city of Ogden or near the city of Ogden, Utah

75
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:14,260
 There was a neighborhood called Bel Ray Estates. This happened relatively recently

76
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,020
 1993 so again, it's far enough back that we can't confirm a lot of the stuff

77
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,340
 But more recent than you would feel comfortable if this is a true story. So the story starts off

78
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,340
 That first there was a sheep herder herding sheep out in the area and

79
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,140
 there was a

80
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,460
 lightning storm just appeared

81
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,300
 Reno relatively out of nowhere

82
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,860
 It

83
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,060
 Came for it was like static in the sky. So you imagine this farmers out there with a sheep and there's like

84
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,420
 Static in the sky it hits the ground and then moves across the ground crawls across the ground and begins just

85
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,660
 electrocuting the sheep kills 12

86
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,860
 Just shocks them to death here

87
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,980
 And it's a weird people in town were like that's weird there was no storms in the area and the

88
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,780
 The sheep herder who apparently survived

89
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,100
 Said you know, I don't know what happened. I was just sitting out there

90
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,820
 And I felt the electrical discharge and the next thing I know it was crawling across the ground and it

91
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,460
 Killed my sheep

92
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,300
 No one paid it in much mind, you know, there's freaks of nature these things happen

93
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,340
 In the little neighborhood nearby of Bel Ray estates people just kind of went about their business went about their lives chalked it up

94
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,060
 to a freak event and went on and

95
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,860
 Then one day the town was empty completely empty

96
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,660
 Not a person not an animal nothing

97
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,260
 Wasn't a city wasn't a town there weren't a ton of people there

98
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,900
 but enough

99
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,540
 That people in the city of Ogden noticed that they were missing and

100
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,660
 When they went out there

101
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,820
 All they found was buildings

102
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,620
 Empty buildings the wind cutting through the streets

103
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,860
 The government bulldozed the town

104
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,940
 Wiped it off the map

105
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:25,580
 And it was lost to history that is the initial mystery of the Bel Ray surge

106
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:34,140
 To get that much of the story first I started off on I have to find a source here a source there a source here little bits of information

107
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:41,780
 Eventually I stumbled across somebody linked a YouTube video explaining it in more detail. It's pretty similar to the story

108
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
 I just told you

109
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,180
 So a couple things they left out of the YouTube video

110
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:54,540
 They do say that they believe that this was caused by the accidental discharge of a weapon

111
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,380
 It was basically a neutron bomb style weapon that was meant to destroy

112
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,620
 Biological life but leave the buildings intact with low levels of radiation

113
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,260
 So an invading force could take out a city and they just march right into it and that's similar to the neutron bomb

114
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,860
 That's what they were going for with the neutron bomb. So they would leave infrastructure

115
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,220
 Standing but eliminate the enemy. I

116
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,740
 Did some more so that was their hypothesis. I found a few other ones. I

117
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,820
 Actually found that the name of the technology supposedly is called the ghost circle

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,980
 Now I ran across that and when I tried to find that info again

119
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,940
 It took me a while which you know can be weird or it could just be that I didn't should have bookmarked my links

120
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:50,100
 So we'll chalk it up to should have bookmarked my links. But anyways ghost circle technology is the name that's been given to this weapon

121
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,140
 Basically just clears out an area

122
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,980
 What's interesting about it is that it doesn't a

123
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:05,620
 Neutron bomb will disintegrate human matter or biological matter what the ghost circle is supposedly does is it turns

124
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,460
 living

125
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,980
 biological entities into energy so it's not only a weapon

126
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,820
 But it's an energy source you could then destroy the entire city

127
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:25,460
 Destroy and like you're going into Moscow you drop the ghost circle into Moscow and then you use the excess energy and

128
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,700
 Store it so you're basically both removing an obstacle and creating an energy source

129
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,700
 How likely is that it makes a good story

130
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,820
 Makes a good story. Let's assume for right now that this incident happened of the Bell Ray estates was wiped off the map

131
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:53,940
 That story is interesting. I don't really know how the science would work. You would discharge that energy so quickly after evaporating people

132
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,900
 I don't know how you would be able to then harness it. You bring a big giant Duracell along with you on a flatbed. I don't know

133
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,300
 So I think that this tape you can start off with the story of

134
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,580
 The estates and say that's true the weapon testing

135
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:16,060
 May be true and then the people being turned into usable energy. That's that's where you're starting to lose me

136
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,060
 That's where you're starting to lose me

137
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,620
 Then I came across a couple others there or one other theory

138
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,060
 Well, there there was two other theories

139
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,580
 But one of them even the person who was stating it said this came from my uncle my uncle makes stuff up and it was that the Bell Ray surge

140
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,780
 Wasn't a weapon testing. It was a UFO

141
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,100
 And I don't want to say like invasion, but it was multiple UFOs

142
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,900
 Over the over the neighborhood of Bell Ray and they were shooting lights down into the city and things like that

143
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:50,180
 And that's I will completely dismiss that because even the person posting it says this comes from an unreliable source

144
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,500
 however, the third one was was that

145
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,220
 This gentleman talked to someone in Ogden because he lived in the area and the man says oh, no

146
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,540
 I know exactly what you're talking about Bell Ray surge. What happened was they were having a massive

147
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,840
 They're doing a mining operations in the area and when they were blowing the rock apart

148
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,340
 What happened was there was a chain reaction underneath the earth and what made it?

149
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,940
 odd

150
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,260
 Was that the chain reaction when they detonated this bomb when they detonated this dynamite?

151
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,180
 It didn't break in the way that they thought it would it traveled through tunnels almost like something was propelling the

152
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,300
 Force through the tunnels in multiple directions and it caused this release of this gas

153
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,740
 That caused a lot of people to get poisoned and they had to leave the area and then to cover that up

154
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,780
 It was an industrial conspiracy basically the mining company said, you know what? We're just going to cover this up

155
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,460
 Here's some hush money. Everyone leave town. We don't want to get fined and they just shut everything down. I

156
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:56,380
 Actually think that as unlikely as that is that's probably more likely than the ghost circle

157
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,800
 And here's why something like the ghost circle technology if it was real

158
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:09,000
 It would be in more widespread use even if you couldn't control it even if you had trouble controlling it

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,860
 You would still we would still see it pop up in

160
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,900
 Across the planet like you can cover up one event maybe

161
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:22,540
 And also if they lost control of it, then why didn't they just keep creeping through this, you know

162
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,860
 To the farther cities of Ogden and stuff like that

163
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:32,580
 But if it was successful then they're go, okay, let's go stage two. Let's we can use this to clear out a room

164
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
 We can make just people disappear

165
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,820
 No one will ever know what happened to them. There's no evidence that they even disappeared and we're not seeing that

166
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:46,460
 So those are the three three theories that we have we have that it was in a accidental or maybe even purposeful

167
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,580
 Could have been an accident

168
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,020
 It could be in a purposeful test of the weapon because it was such a small community

169
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,940
 It could have been UFOs it could have been a mining accident that got out of control

170
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,940
 If this story is true, I

171
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:07,740
 Don't think it's any of those three one and we'll go backwards. There's no record. There's no name of the mining company

172
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,980
 There's no record of any sort of industrial accidents in that area

173
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,860
 even the person who told the story couldn't name the mining company and

174
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,180
 Conveniently the mining company pays all the money to keep everyone hushed up

175
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,380
 So, you know never reached court. So there's no records for that the UFO story is

176
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,900
 You know again came from an unreliable source the ghost circle technology

177
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,940
 As intriguing as that is that we've built a weapon that can do that again

178
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,740
 We already have a weapon that can do that. It's a neutron bomb. You're just trying to eliminate people and

179
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,300
 Keep the infrastructure up

180
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,920
 and if we're going to test a weapon like that

181
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,260
 There's a thousand other communities that we could have done it in one thing that the people

182
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,060
 You know I've run into this a lot of with conspiracy theories and stories like this that you notice that

183
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,460
 Like harp when they're talking about the weather control system

184
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,580
 It's tested in the United States like they think that because the US government is testing the weapon

185
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:13,220
 They test it on their own population. We have tested, you know acid and aerosol weapons on Americans sure

186
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:20,600
 But in a global on a global scale if you wanted to test this ghost circle technology

187
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,800
 Why would you do it to a city?

188
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,700
 In America in 1993 so this wasn't like back in pine, you know pioneer days or even like in the 50s

189
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,740
 You would put it on a plane and take it to Venezuela and find a village to use it on

190
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,140
 Or you'd go to the farthest outskirts of Siberia and use it over there

191
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,220
 You you do it you could just use it to see how it affects animals. Why would you do it on a town?

192
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,260
 It's about 30 miles

193
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,260
 South of Ogden, Utah

194
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,700
 It's this isn't some desolate area where no one's ever been this was a nice neighborhood supposedly if it existed

195
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,820
 So I don't buy any of those explanations. It's possible that the city next so we'll go back to the original story

196
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
 It's possible that the story is completely made up

197
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,820
 It's possible that the neighborhood existed at some point and people just moved out of it. That's not likely

198
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:21,260
 Generally especially again, this is fairly recent 1993. It's probably in most of my listeners lifetime. It's definitely in mine

199
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,140
 So that leaves us with the story not being true

200
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,580
 There's two caveats to that one is that supposedly there's satellite footage of before and after

201
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,060
 So we see satellite footage of the town satellite footage of nothing and they talk about that in the YouTube video

202
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,420
 And they actually show some photos. Here's the problem. I can't find the photos

203
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,060
 And if you're testing a weapon if you're that level of the government where you're testing weaponry on the US population

204
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,500
 And then completely covering it up. I think you have access to the photos of the satellites

205
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,780
 I think they could easily call up the 1993 equivalent of Google and

206
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,220
 Say hey remove those because we know that they do that now

207
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,460
 We know they draw black boxes over secure area. So again, that doesn't wash

208
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:13,300
 But this was something interesting I came across and all of my research going back and forth and watching YouTube videos and things like that

209
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,500
 We'll take this with a grain of salt. I thought this was interesting and I'm gonna read portions of his post there

210
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,100
 This is back in 2016 when he wrote this I've decided that after collecting all of the images

211
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,940
 I will attach that the bell ray bell ray bells ray or bell rays surge

212
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,660
 Those are all the different spellings of it is simply a myth

213
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,140
 I think the original person who mentioned it was inventing the name then and there

214
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:47,440
 There is no local history to the area and although things like this are really easily covered up nothing matches and logic prevails

215
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,380
 logic prevails

216
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,060
 Pickle party, okay

217
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,180
 Then he goes on to say there is literally no coordinates maps

218
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:01,580
 No towns people made maps or sketches of the hill range nearby and no local authority to that section of land south of Wildcat Road

219
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,980
 Which makes it hard to go back in history and find what was originally there before 1993

220
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,340
 so

221
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,180
 We just have this empty area and he's saying we don't have any maps people haven't got any maps

222
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,260
 Which again leads the credence to is always empty because why would you need maps and structures?

223
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:28,180
 There was nothing there. Why would you need maps showing structures or even people going out there and doing detailed maps if there is no reason to be out there?

224
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,460
 So again, he's debunking it, but this was what I thought was interesting

225
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,380
 He goes but I did make some success and I admit some of the things I found were a bit strange like the abandoned landlines

226
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,980
 These things I found in the road that I think are movement

227
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,660
 Detectors and the fact that if you compare my satellite images of the area between February 2nd 1992

228
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,980
 And April 1993 there is a massive change in nature and landscape

229
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,380
 The waterholes appear

230
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,620
 Property lines disappear phone lines go up. Yes, that's right in 1992

231
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,660
 There is no telephone poles by the side of the road and in 1993 onwards

232
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:13,220
 There is all connected and leading to one unconnected pole by the edge of another watering hole

233
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,300
 WTF

234
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,800
 And then he includes a link to a

235
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,900
 zip file

236
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
 with all of these photos

237
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,540
 So

238
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,460
 Let's take him at his word that he's done this research

239
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,860
 He can come across and I think the most suspicious thing

240
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,660
 I think the fact that the telephone poles went up after 1992

241
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:44,420
 Isn't necessarily that suspicious because of the areas. I mean the area is still getting civilized at that area putting that up

242
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,460
 I do think it's weird that they all kind of connect to an unconnected pole and

243
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,340
 The fact that there's what he considers massive change in the nature in the landscape of the area

244
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,980
 Interesting I applaud this guy for going out and doing his research and really digging into it

245
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,060
 It's also suspicious that that zip file that is on the mega upload site. It's gone now

246
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:09,220
 Does all of that mean that the Bell Ray surge story is true

247
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,180
 Just on the facts no I think it's a story that feels good and it's creepy and

248
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,520
 It could be true and I think it's kind of like the Dublin, Wisconsin story where it's a

249
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,220
 Scary to think that an entire group of people can go missing

250
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:30,120
 But the interesting thing about the Bell Ray surge if you were making up this conspiracy

251
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,340
 I think one one place they tripped up is they provided too much detail

252
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,660
 It's a weapon called the ghost circle

253
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:44,380
 That can eliminate biological matter and leave building standing and it may or may not convert them to energy

254
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,460
 And it was a weapons test and Dublin was just people disappeared

255
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,860
 So your brain gets to feel it fill in the blanks was it demons was it interdimensional?

256
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,580
 Did the town never exist was it a ghost town was it a military test?

257
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,300
 Was there some sort of madness in the area did people just up and leave was there like a zombie attack?

258
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:13,620
 Your brain fills in the area fills it in so you get to pick and choose what conspiracy you works best for you

259
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,220
 If you believe in interdimensional aliens invading that's what happened

260
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:26,300
 If you believe that ghost the Indians of Native Americans ran through the town shopping people's heads off and dragging them off to some horrible

261
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,140
 Hell that happened

262
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,660
 Do you believe UFOs abducted people that happened it left it so open-ended?

263
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,620
 And it was far enough back that there were like yeah, there's no maps

264
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,660
 None of this stuff is just a few

265
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:48,040
 Or Mandela effect that was an actually another one that could have worked with Dublin, Wisconsin this one the the conspiracy is so specific

266
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,900
 That you can go well, you know like I can dispute the weapon testing

267
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,340
 They're not going to use an energy-based weapon in 1993 on American soil

268
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,380
 They're going to do that anywhere else in the world

269
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,060
 And I know what you're thinking Jason they still crack an LA they don't still crack in Venezuela and if fair enough

270
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,860
 I'm not saying the American government has been amazing to its people a hundred percent of the time

271
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,540
 There's a lot. There's a big difference between the CIA moving crack from South America moving cocaine from South America

272
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,300
 Turning it into crack and having the bloods and the crypts sell it on the streets

273
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,740
 Versus running a weapons test that eliminates

274
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,220
 3000 people from the city of Compton

275
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:38,340
 One's plausible and been proven honestly and the other one is you know fantasy science fiction

276
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,260
 I will say this though. I'll give the story this

277
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,900
 If it's true

278
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,660
 The best thing that they could have done is to make up a crazy story like this

279
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:58,100
 You can make it this ridiculous and people would just automatically poo poo it and that was kind of the idea with the is Simpsons real life

280
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:05,660
 You take a real event that is completely tragic and turn people to mutants you cover it up in so many ridiculous theories and

281
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:11,540
 Then if anyone ever exposes the truth you go no no, that's ridiculous

282
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,060
 My personal feeling is that I

283
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,740
 Think that this the Bell Ray surge story is

284
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,740
 As intriguing of as Dublin, Wisconsin

285
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,460
 But I don't think it holds up to the scrutiny of Dublin, Wisconsin

286
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,100
 I think that whoever created this I don't think it's true and I think whoever created this story

287
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,940
 should try to rein it in and

288
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,540
 Turn it back into something completely vague and

289
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,780
 That may have honestly been the intention

290
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:47,060
 It may have honestly just been the phrase and over time this myth is grown first

291
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,180
 It was like the Bell Ray surge and someone goes well, what's that and someone goes?

292
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,980
 Town disappeared and left it vague

293
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,580
 But once you started once it started to gain a bit of traction. This is a very very

294
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,660
 This is this conspiracy theory is not very well known at all

295
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,580
 I'm going to assume that 80% of the people listening to this have never heard of this conspiracy theory

296
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,940
 So it may have started off to be suit a super big conspiracy theory

297
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:20,180
 And it's just gotten too much information. It sags the story down a town in a town 30 miles away from Ogden, Utah

298
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,220
 Disappearing off the map and the maps being changed. You have a perfect follow-up to a devil in Wisconsin

299
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,220
 And people can fill in the blanks which always makes it more terrifying saying that it was this that and the other thing

300
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,300
 None of that

301
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,540
 It takes away from the this type of myth. It makes it less scary

302
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,940
 I was watching a horror movie the other day called the autopsy of Jane Doe and it was absolutely terrifying

303
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,940
 I was on the edge of my seat

304
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
 So well done

305
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,140
 Super tense

306
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,140
 great acting

307
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,500
 Creepy the stakes were high for the people involved

308
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,740
 And I remember just being like oh my god. Oh my god. I getting so tense and then they

309
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,780
 Revealed spoiler alert

310
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:18,300
 They revealed that this body they were doing an autopsy on was a witch and I immediately felt all the tension leave my body

311
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,500
 Wasn't the movie's fault the movie was still really good and had a had a good ending

312
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,780
 But I don't find witches scary at all. I think I know just that's not a

313
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:36,180
 That's not a creature type that I find scary. I don't find vampires scary. I don't find mummies scary

314
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,820
 So

315
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,900
 Right when they revealed that piece of information. I just complied all the tension

316
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,700
 Dropped left my body and I was like oh they're fine a witch and I don't find that particular creature scary

317
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,100
 So and I think it's the same thing like this when I was doing the research

318
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,740
 It took me a while to find all this stuff too

319
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,460
 This is all spread apart in these bits and pieces and when you look at these links

320
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,260
 You'll see that it's just like huge posts that I had to go through

321
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,580
 But as I was reading and I'm like oh, that's really creepy this town disappeared and then they're like yeah

322
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,860
 It's a weapon and the US military was testing it. I'm like

323
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,700
 It's just not a scary. It's not as fascinating

324
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,540
 So I'm gonna call I don't I don't believe that the Bell Ray surge is anything real

325
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,020
 But I hope it's stoked your imagination. Maybe you have more information than me

326
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,900
 It's funny

327
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,340
 This is also one of those ones that people are like oh my god

328
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,900
 I was just investigating this and two cops just showed up at my door at midnight

329
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,980
 And they're like do you know anyone in Utah and other people are like oh my god, please stay safe and that's you know

330
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,380
 They're just playing around. I don't I don't know if the people saying please stay safe or joining in on the joke

331
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,300
 But I mean I I've seen whole YouTube videos about this and that guy's not arrested and you know

332
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,100
 Even though I'm getting these little pieces of information. It's not because it's being covered up. It's just because it's not well known

333
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,180
 so if you have more information if you lived in the Ogden area or

334
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,060
 You know I

335
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:05,300
 Go nuts if you believe that it's absolutely true and you have some evidence or proof for me or anybody post it out there

336
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,100
 But if you don't and you want to be part of this legend this though

337
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,660
 I you know could be you know, this is one of those growing myths

338
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,620
 Go at that too. I

339
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,540
 Think that's just as fascinating sometimes the story for me

340
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:28,980
 Finding this information for me was more fascinating than the story itself. I'm putting together this puzzle

341
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,660
 It's funny because at the very end I found the YouTube video and that kind of just summed everything up

342
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,860
 But in the beginning I'm finding this post and this post and this post and this post and to me assembling the puzzle was the best part

343
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,860
 Whether or not it was true

344
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
 became irrelevant I

345
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:51,940
 Was happy that the term was actually a quote-unquote real term because sometimes I'm looking up sexual assault missiles

346
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,100
 That's on that list. I can't find anything

347
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,180
 I think someone just put it in there as a joke and the jokes on me because I spent a half hour

348
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,540
 Trying to look up sexual assault missiles

349
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
 And that's just part of the job

350
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:10,740
 But this may be something you know if you know more information or if you think you can make this story better go nuts

351
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,740
 it's still super unknown and

352
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,780
 It's malleable enough malleable enough to really just kind of get in there and put your own personal imprint on it

353
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,340
 I'm not saying go out and make up your own conspiracy theories

354
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,900
 but again sometimes this stuff moves out of the realm of a true conspiracy theory and

355
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,940
 becomes a thought exercise becomes a

356
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,380
 shared narrative among fans of this stuff

357
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,020
 So that's gonna be it for tonight's episode I hope you had I hope you had fun

358
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,540
 I hope you had a good time listening to that. I like I said, I really like that Bell Ray story

359
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,900
 I do like the story the Bell Ray search and I do like I

360
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:55,580
 Did like the journey to get to the answers that I wanted and again that doesn't make it if somebody

361
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,500
 Disproves ghosts to me. It doesn't make me not like hearing ghost stories even skeptics

362
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,820
 Will love to hear a good scary ghost story. I

363
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:09,900
 Do want to say that I want to give a shout out to a listener of mine

364
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,500
 Ash black

365
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,340
 Ash black if you've noticed on your podcast stream or on the website, we have a brand new logo

366
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,740
 Ash black made that it's amazing and that was just something that he put together

367
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,420
 He put together and like an evening if that

368
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,220
 Sent it to me sent me a bunch of different variations of the artwork

369
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:33,700
 It looks amazing and what I love most about it is that I think it sums up the show

370
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,320
 It has a real kind of punk rock vibe. I like the color choice. I love that third eye

371
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,820
 Hanging off of in the middle of the dead rabbit. It's just all of these great elements

372
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:49,060
 So hats off to you ash black and truly is amazing truly is amazing artwork. I'm stoked that you did it

373
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:56,580
 I'm stoked that it's just a great-looking piece of art. It's now my desktop wallpaper. It's my phone wallpaper

374
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:03,860
 I'm just flattered and humbled that you took your talent and your time to make that for me. So I mean legitimately I'm

375
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,460

381
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,020
 That's gonna be all of it for tonight. This episode looks like it's running very long

382
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,900
 So if I'm able to get it into the 30 minute range, I

383
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,180
 Stayed up quite late. I don't know why it went so long

384
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,820
 I think I just talked a lot about Bell Research because I had a lot of fun research in that story

385
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,220
