1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 An urban legend in the city of New York that was so real the police had to intervene.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,280
 And then we take a trip through a graveyard to see some of the creepiest, most odd headstones

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,240
 possible. It's an interactive adventure so today you'll find out how you will die today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,920
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I think you guys probably

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
 noticed by now last week and this week, last week we only did four episodes this week. We're

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,840
 only going to do four episodes. That's just a byproduct of me being here with the family. I

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,560
 don't have as much time to actually prep and record episodes so I apologize for that. So you'll get,

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,840
 you got four episodes last week, you'll have four episodes this week but that's not going to be a

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,680
 continuous thing starting the following week. We'll be back on regular schedule. Let's hop on

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,600
 board the carpenter copter. We are headed to New York City, the big apple, home of Statue of Liberty.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,440
 I saw a documentary once, a bunch of goo when it never ran out of here. Okay so all aboard.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:22,400
 Dude, why don't we have a train? We should have a Dead Rabbit train. The Rabbit Railroad. Hop on

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:32,480
 board the Rabbit Railroad. Choo choo. We're on the Rabbit Railroad. We're taking it across the

15
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,880
 country. We are headed to New York City and this train, like most of our vehicles, have teleportation.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
 Wait no, then they don't need to be a vehicle. They have time travel ability so as we're on the

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,520
 Rabbit Railroad, which has every seat is first class so you guys are eating well. The carpenter

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,840
 copter just has like MREs. This time you actually like get fine dining. We're going through a time

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,960
 portal and we're in the 1980s. We're in the late 1980s and we're in New York. Oh, aboard. Wait no,

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
 no, everyone get off. How do they tell you to get off? How do they tell you to disembark? I guess

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,840
 they just, the train's stopping at your destination but anyways we get off the train and we're walking

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,680
 around New York City late 80s and we see a young kid walking through the streets. He just left his

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
 high school in Brooklyn. He's walking through the streets of New York, backpack over his shoulder,

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
 one shoulder because he's a cool kid. He's walking through the streets of New York and he keeps looking

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,760
 over his shoulder. He's clutching his backpack super tight and we're like, well man this kid must be

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,960
 super paranoid. He's looking around and we're like, hey kid, what's going on? What's going on? He's like,

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,880
 don't you know? They're everywhere. He looks around, darts around. He's seen groups of kids just kind

28
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,360
 of pass them by and every time a kid walks by him, he looks over. We're like, dude, what's going on? He's

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,320
 like, the Decepticons. He says it in the near whisper. We barely hear him over the hustle and

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:05,440
 bustle of the city. He's like, don't say it so loud idiot. And then we're like, you mean Decepticons as

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,000
 in like the Transformers? And he's like, no, no, I'm not worried about fighter jets turning into

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,160
 robots. That would be cool. I'm talking about the Decepticons. And at that point we realized during

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,840
 the course of our conversation, we seem to be surrounded by about 15 to 20 teenagers and we

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,960
 realize that even though they're not wearing any gang colors, they're not dressed like hoodlums,

35
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,360
 they actually are dressed quite preppy. They have their eyes on what we have. Now I don't know what

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,560
 I have on me. I guess I have the keys to the rabbit railroad. This kid has his backpack and I'm

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,960
 assuming you at least have something. Whatever's to your right of where you're sitting right now

38
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,440
 is the only weapon that you have available. I have an antique chair from my mom's desk. So that

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,520
 magically appears and I'm swinging into these kids and he's like, no, no, no, those aren't the Decepticons.

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,000
 Those aren't the Decepticons. Those are the Decepticons and we look and there's a bigger crowd of

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,040
 kids that now there's a huge fight going on. So I've started a fight with a bunch of innocent kids.

42
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,920
 The real Decepticons have showed up. You're bashing people with whatever you have. Hopefully

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,400
 it's more than a hot pocket. Hopefully it's like a weapon. But that was this gang. Back in the late

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,360
 80s, these three kids got together and they called themselves the Decepticons. The three original

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,440
 members were Cyclonus, Rumble, and Megatron and those are actual characters from the cartoon.

46
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,360
 And they said, this is the way this gang's going to work. We are Decepticons. We are not robots in

47
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,240
 disguise. We are gangbangers in disguise. No gang colors whatsoever. We dress really preppy. We wear

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,720
 like nice shirts, nice pants. We look like the average high school student and we rob people

49
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,040
 blind. They also like grouped up to protect themselves from other people. But you had this

50
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,120
 group, this gang that kind of defied expectations of what a late 1980s gang were. And the kids at

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,520
 high schools, it started off in Brooklyn and it spread throughout the city of New York. And it

52
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
 started off with just these three kids and then eventually they graduated, not literally from

53
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,320
 high school. I don't know if they ever graduated from high school, but they graduated to more bigger

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,200
 thefts where they would do mob thefts. About 10 to 20 people would surround you, beat you up, take

55
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,760
 your stuff, and then disappear into the city. The police for a while thought it was an urban legend

56
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,400
 because these kids were terrified. And their parents were like, my kids are telling me there's

57
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,560
 this gang that nobody knows about that's beating people up. And the cops are like, that's not how

58
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,720
 gangs operate. But as more and more reports came through, the police were like, this is a real gang.

59
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
 And there's no way to track them. There's absolutely no way to track them. They're not,

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,440
 you can't look down the street and see three dudes wearing all red and be like, oh, those are

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,120
 bloods. Like you would just be walking through a department store and a guy would come up behind

62
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,800
 you and hit you over the head. That was a Decepticon. The rumors got to the point where the Decepticons

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,560
 were going to start laying sieges to high schools. They were going to attack high schools on a certain

64
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,360
 day. And parents were going to the police and saying, you need to stop the Decepticons. And they're

65
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,320
 like, okay, lady, I know how awesome the name sounds, but they do not have the ability to lay

66
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,960
 siege to a school. Parents began pulling their kids out of school. It was this nightmare for the

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,600
 schools and for the kids. It wasn't just a nightmare for the schools. And the thing was, you'd think

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,200
 it's, it's funny because they don't identify themselves by color. You didn't want two groups

69
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,960
 of Decepticons walking into each other. They may not even know they're in the same gang. That's how

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,480
 deceptive that's how good their technique was. Two groups of three kids each walking down the

71
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,640
 street and they're thinking about robbing each other. They don't know the other group is actually

72
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,520
 in the same gang. So they developed a code. They developed a series of sayings or hand signs. We

73
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,760
 don't know because it was one of the most valuable secrets in New York for a teenager in the 1980s

74
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,600
 to know this code. Because that way, if you were approached by a Decepticon, you could say the right

75
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,920
 thing or do the right thing. They would think you were in the group and they'd leave you alone.

76
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,640
 So you would want that information. And everyone was like, thought they had a piece of the code or

77
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,800
 knew a piece of the code, but the Decepticons weren't willing to share that information with any

78
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,040
 outsiders at all. And they, they're wet when they use weapons. A lot of times they beat you up when

79
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,320
 they use weapons. They use box cutters and hammers, which again, they're, which that'd be kind of hard

80
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,640
 to pull off a preppy look with a hammer. But I guess if you had in your backpack in March 19th,

81
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,520
 1989, the New York Times ran a profile on these guys saying this was a quote from the article.

82
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,520
 It said, the police first became aware of the Decepticons in 1986. Sergeant Galea said the

83
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,040
 gang has lasted longer than he expected, probably because of its catchy name. Other gangs with more

84
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,240
 bulky titles have come and gone in the last three years. One group calling itself the Tonka

85
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,080
 trucks lasted but a few months. I would love to roll with a gang called the Tonka trucks. And

86
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,240
 then just watch them get annihilated and like, be like, I told you guys that told you guys that was

87
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,000
 a dumb name. Call yourself the micro machines. Like, come on, like Decepticons is a catchy name.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,360
 They eventually died out in the 1990s. They're not around anymore. Or are they? Who knows.

89
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,600
 So hats off to you Decepticons for having a cool name, having an entire city in fear of you.

90
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,240
 And as well hats off to you because you probably stole my hat right off my head.

91
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,800
 But let's hop on backboard. That was weird. Let's hop back on board the rabbit railroad. We are going

92
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:50,640
 to a cemetery. That's cemetery fog being blown by cemetery wind. You know what? You can talk trash

93
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,520
 all you want about the Transformer movies. There's so many awesome elements in it. You think that's

94
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,160
 a, you think I'm going back to my old story but I'm not. And Transformers 4, Age of Extinction,

95
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,840
 the military set up a group that their job was to hunt down Transformers and melt them and turn

96
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,360
 them into Transformium. That part's dumb. But the name of the military group was Cemetery Wind.

97
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,640
 And I was like, I remember watching the movie because when you start watching Transformers

98
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,600
 movie, you think it's going to be good for the first 20 minutes. The third one was brilliant.

99
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,640
 First one was okay. But whenever I watch a new Transformer movie, for the first 20 minutes,

100
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,560
 I think it's going to be a masterpiece. And sometimes I'm right. So for the first 20 minutes

101
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,840
 of Transformers 4, I was like, Cemetery Wind. Oh, that name's so badass. I want to get a jacket.

102
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,760
 I want to get a cemetery wind military jacket. Not like join the military to get one for real.

103
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,000
 I would actually if there was, we were hunting Transformers. But I wanted, I was like, can I

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,040
 get like memorabilia, like cemetery wind patch and put it on my backpack or something? And then I

105
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,000
 continued to watch the movie. I was like, oh my God. But cemetery wind is still a dope name for

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,120
 like a paramilitary group. Anyways, that being said, Transformer episode is full of stuff.

107
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,320
 This episode is full of Transformer stuff. I don't know why I keep saying stuff backwards.

108
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,080
 We are going to the graveyard. We're going to the graveyard and we're going to take a look at some

109
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,240
 crazy gravestones. Crazy gravestones. Seriously? Is that what you're doing this episode? Yes,

110
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,400
 because these gravestones have some really interesting backstories to them. I'm not just

111
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,800
 reading stuff like Papa farted and then he died. Like, yeah, I'm not doing that. And there are

112
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,520
 gravestones out there like that. So I want you to pick a number between one and six. Pick a number

113
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,680
 between one and six. And before we do that, I'm going to read you a gravestone. Well, while you're

114
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,520
 doing that, I'm going to read you a gravestone that actually took out of the list because I just

115
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,400
 thought it was too dark. So if you picked zero, this is you. There's a gravestone in Blairstown,

116
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,280
 New Jersey that says this episode might be a little depressing. It might be a little depressing.

117
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,960
 I found some interesting ones, but some of them are kind of depressing. This one says

118
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:03,760
 Princess Doe missing from home dead among strangers remembered by all born question mark

119
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,160
 found July 15th, 1982. So the story behind that one, I mean, imagine we're walking through this

120
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,680
 graveyard. I guess I should have set this up first. Me and you are walking through this graveyard.

121
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,840
 And once you pick the number that you win, you magically become that corpse like you travel back

122
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,320
 in time and die the way that died. I didn't want to put someone through this one. This is tragic.

123
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,440
 The story is they found the body of a girl in Blairstown, New Jersey with her head bashed in

124
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,000
 thrown into a ravine. And she was between the ages of 14 and 18. She's never been identified.

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,280
 They've never caught who did it. They just found a body of a young teenage girl.

126
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,000
 She's just a heartbreaking tombstone missing from home dead among strangers remembered by all.

127
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,840
 So I didn't want to do that when it'd be like, ha ha, you picked a 14 year old girl whose head

128
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,040
 got bashed in. I thought that was a little tasteless. Some of these other ones, you might argue

129
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,920
 are tasteless too. But let's continue our journey through the cemetery. We look down at a gravestone.

130
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,200
 These are all real, by the way. These are all real. Look down at a gravestone. And it says,

131
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,640
 we see a gravestone. We're very, very somber in the moment here. Baby monster. Baby monster is what

132
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:20,720
 it says. Born October 23, 1888. Died February 3, 1989. Now, this is a real gravestone in Kent,

133
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,800
 Washington. Now, the most likely scenario is that it was a baby who comes from a family with the

134
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,320
 last name of monster. That's the working theory with this gravestone. Nobody knows. Because it's so

135
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,960
 old. But there's a couple of questions about it. One, who has the last name monster? How did you

136
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,480
 get that surname? Your ancestors were the ugliest people in Europe and they're like, ah, you're

137
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:55,280
 the son of a monster. And he was born October 23, 1888. He died February 3, no wait, not 1989.

138
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:01,040
 That would have made my 100 years old. I don't know if I said 1989 earlier, but I'm seeing it on

139
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:09,600
 my notes now. I hope I didn't say that. He died February 3, 1889. So he lived, what is that,

140
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,800
 five months. They never even named him. They just called him baby. So if you picked number four,

141
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,320
 I turn and look and you're like, you're doing Benjamin Button style. You're shrinking down

142
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,760
 into a little baby monster or a regular baby who just doesn't get named for five months.

143
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:40,080
 I'm sorry. This episode, this one was a little dark too. So if you picked number four, you're

144
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,760
 either a cool baby monster who lived from 1888 to 1989 stalking the wilderness,

145
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,520
 or you're just a unnamed baby in a grave, one of the two. I'll let you choose. If you pick

146
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:59,120
 number four, you're either a baby monster who lived 99 years, no, 101 years, or you're just a baby,

147
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,880
 just a regular baby whose dad's name was monster. Okay. But assuming you didn't pick number four,

148
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,600
 you're not shrunken into a little ball in the ground. I'm sorry, it's dark. We're moving on.

149
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,720
 And even if you did pick number four, you can come along. So now we have a little baby monster

150
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,680
 following us along. We come to another gravestone. Now this gravestone is from a graveyard at the

151
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,160
 Ohio Asylum for the Insane. And you're like, great, I wish I had picked the baby monster.

152
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,320
 There's two gravestones. There's two of these gravestones. They both say the exact same thing.

153
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,920
 They're at the Ohio Asylum for the Insane's graveyard. And they have one word on them,

154
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,880
 specimens. No one knows what they mean. No one know what people know what the word specimen means.

155
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,160
 They can get a dictionary, but no one knows why they're on these gravestones. But if you pick number

156
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,920
 one, you know, because you either turn into a bunch of body parts, because that's one of the

157
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,440
 theories that they're basically gravestone. It's like caskets full of random body parts. So if you

158
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,680
 pick number one, you either become a collection of nothing but arms and feet, no torso, no legs,

159
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,520
 you're just a pile of body parts, medical specimens, or I'll give you an option to there's another

160
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,880
 theory. There's another little creepy theory about this, that the Ohio Asylum for the Insane was

161
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,560
 running experiments on the people there, hooking electrodes up to their brain. That's actually

162
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,480
 not an experiment. That was actually a legitimate treatment back then. Anyways, they were like

163
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,400
 making mutants in the asylum. They're trying to, they're trying to create the perfect insane person.

164
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,160
 They're like having insane people bang each other and then having insane babies and then

165
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,200
 raising them and then having them mate as well, creating the genetically perfect insane person

166
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,680
 who has every, that's actually a pretty good idea for a movie. You have a guy who has every

167
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,200
 possible insanity from like schizophrenia to like sexomnia, which is a real thing. It's where

168
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,080
 you bang people in your sleep. You just have the most insane person ever. And then he gets out.

169
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,160
 Don't, don't write that. I'm going to write that. Don't, don't steal my idea. So, but if you pick

170
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,800
 number one, you're either a collection of body parts or you're the plot of my new movie and, and

171
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,040
 interesting about this, why are there two of them? Do they have that? Whatever they were doing,

172
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,040
 did that, they have that many of them? They needed two gravestones. Let's move on with this one. Now

173
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,840
 we're going to go keep going through this graveyard. We got a pile of body parts following us.

174
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,960
 We got a baby monster following us and we come to another gravestone and this one is very simple,

175
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:42,720
 very simple gravestone. Doesn't say specimens. It says Sir Jeffrey Hudson, 1619 to 1682. And if you

176
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,160
 picked five, you're this one. If you pick number five, you're this one. I want to tell you that

177
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,640
 before so you can imagine if you picked five. I want you to understand the logic that you have

178
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:00,080
 to go through to make this work. It's on a gravestone. Sir Jeffrey Hudson, 1619, 1682, a dwarf

179
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,080
 presented in a pie to King Charles I. And I remember reading that. I go, "Isn't that how he

180
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:12,800
 died? Was he a dwarf and baked into a pie and he died? Like, how was that on your tombstone?

181
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,600
 Normally how you die is on your tombstone. What is this? Did King Charles eat a dwarf?

182
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,440
 So I had to look this up. I don't look all these up, by the way. I'm not just reading these off.

183
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,520
 So I had to research on all this stuff. Sir Jeffrey Hudson was also known as Lord Minimus,

184
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,000
 which was Mad Max's most least threatening villain. Lord Minimus was 19... I see what's

185
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,480
 weird is all this stuff is supposedly historically accurate because there is a ton of records kept

186
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,840
 on this dude, but some of the measurements don't add up. Lord Minimus, at age 10, he was 19 inches tall,

187
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,600
 which seems impossible. Seems absolutely impossible. The baby monster has given him the

188
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,880
 run for his money. The baby monster could beat up Lord Minimus. Anyways, Jeffrey Hudson was this

189
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,960
 little dude in the village and someone said, "You know what? You should go see the king." The king

190
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,600
 loves to laugh at people with deformities. Jeffrey's like, "Yippee! Let's go!" And they

191
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,920
 thought of an ideal way to present him to the king was to bring the king a pie. And they go,

192
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,240
 "Here, your highness. Here's a pie." And the king's like, "That's kind of a letdown. Like, I thought

193
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,040
 I was going to have some entertainment." And Jeffrey Hudson jumped out of the pie and goes, "Hi,

194
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,640
 everybody. I'm Jeffrey Hudson. I don't have my name yet." He's waving everyone covered in blackberry.

195
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,440
 He's covered in pie crust. And they didn't slay him as a demon right there. They actually thought

196
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,720
 that was an awesome trick because it's a human the size of a pie. It's a 10-year-old boy the

197
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
 size of a pie. The queen falls in love with him in the sense that she thinks he's the most fascinating

198
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,680
 man in the world. This is before Doseki's. So she begins taking him every-- she took some everywhere

199
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,000
 that she goes. And he would actually ride in the pocket of the-- they had this super tall porter

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,200
 who would carry the bags and stuff like that. And Lord Minimus would ride in the pocket. So it was

201
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,720
 like this total-- just basically a circus in your-- you'd go to see the king to discuss taxes

202
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,240
 or something like that. There's basically a bunch of circus freaks living there. He ended up being

203
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,080
 sent on missions. He became a diplomat. He was not an official diplomat. He's not signing treaties.

204
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,120
 But he would travel around on the king's bequest. He ends up getting kidnapped by Dutch privateers.

205
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,760
 They forced this boy-- he's not 10 at this point. He's like 16. But he's still only 19 inches tall.

206
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,520
 They forced him to become a slave. And you're like, what-- what good is a 19-inch slave? Well,

207
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,000
 they found good for him because they made him fight a turkey. They put him both in like a little

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 fight club cage match and he had to beat up a turkey. And he won. He ends up becoming a spy,

209
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,880
 gets kidnapped again, and then gets involved in a plot to kill a king, not the king he liked,

210
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,000
 another king. He goes to prison and died in an unmarked grave. Now, you go-- wait a second.

211
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,920
 You said all this stuff about a grave. This is a memorial to him. It is a grave. But they don't

212
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,520
 know where he was actually buried at. When he did die, he did reach the height of four feet. So he

213
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,480
 was four feet tall when he died. And he died at the age 30. So he lived a good life. I mean, I never

214
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,040
 fought a turkey. So if you pick number five, you did not get baked into a pie and get killed by the

215
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,280
 king. You got baked into a pie and when you hopped out, your life changed. You became an adventurer.

216
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,960
 Yes, you were a slave as part of the time. You did have to beat up a turkey. But you got involved

217
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,040
 in a world of political intrigue and royal courts and all sorts of great stuff. But let's continue

218
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:44,000
 our trip through the graveyard because now we are coming up to-- okay, I'm calling an audible real

219
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 quick. I'm calling an audible real quick. I was looking at one of them and I'm like, that's lame.

220
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,720
 So we're not doing to the count of six anymore. You can only choose up to five. So I know that's

221
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,840
 kind of late in the episode. But you can choose now. So if you chose six, if you chose number six,

222
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,840
 now choose two or three. Because the number-- I had one that was dumb and I really considered not

223
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,120
 to do it. But it's such a famous grave stone. I'm going to go over it real quick, but I don't want

224
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,960
 to get too much into detail with it. In Salt Lake City, Utah, there's a tombstone because I know

225
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
 people are going to email and say, hey, you missed out this one. It's really-- it's actually not

226
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,200
 fascinating at all. In Salt Lake City, Utah, there's a grave stone that says Lily E. Gray,

227
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,160
 June-- it has her date of birth, date of death. It says, "victim of the beast 666." Some people freak

228
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,600
 out and they're like, oh no, was that Alistair Crowley? Was he in? Did he have something to do

229
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,400
 with her death? I looked into it. She was 77 years old. She died of being 77 years old. She was married

230
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,760
 to a man who hated the government, thought the US government was the beast, and that the Democrats,

231
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,840
 the Democratic government, killed his wife. He was a convict who had these prepper things. He

232
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,880
 believed the government was going to take over the world eventually and so on and so forth.

233
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:04,000
 He had that put on her gravestone because he was a lunatic. Then her family hated him so much that

234
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,840
 when he died, they buried him as far away as possible in the graveyard. That's that. That was

235
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,560
 that one. A lot of people-- that's one's really famous because it seems mysterious, but when you

236
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,200
 look into it, it was just some crackpot who believes the government is the beast, which is a very

237
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
 common conspiracy theory, especially back then. So if you picked number six, that would have been

238
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,680
 you, but we'll let you pick again. Pick two or three. I'm going to get something to drink real

239
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,440
 quick. Okay, I'm back. I got my sparkling water here. I put on so much weight since I went on

240
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,520
 vacation, but it'll all come off the bike within a week or two. Let's go ahead and move on. We're

241
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,720
 going to move on to another gravestone here. Walk through the cemetery. Come across this big slab,

242
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,320
 this big, big grave-- you know what a gravestone is. You come across one of those and it says

243
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,520
 Geospenser. You're like, "Oh, that's interesting. Sounds like a sci-fi channel show." No, it doesn't.

244
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,640
 It sounds like a Disney channel show. It doesn't even sound like that. Anyways, we look-- I'm like,

245
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,680
 you're like, "Jason, just shut up. Just shut up and tell me how I'm going to die." I'm like,

246
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,080
 okay, we're looking at this gravestone. It says Lost Life-- this one is grammatically weird,

247
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,000
 and I'm wondering if they got paid if they hadn't got charged by the letter, because it took me a

248
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,880
 while to make sense of it. Lost Life by Stab and Falling on Icaracer evading six young women.

249
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
 Here, let me start over. Let me try reading it like an actual sentence rather than it appears on

250
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,440
 the gravestone. Lost Life by Stab and Falling on Icaracer evading six young women trying to

251
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,120
 give him birthday kisses and office metropolitan life building. Like, what? So much of this stuff

252
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,400
 doesn't make sense. Icaracer, there's little soft spongy things that used to like dry Icaracer,

253
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,280
 right? And he lost life by Stab. Anyways, someone was really cheap when they got this guy's gravestone.

254
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,280
 True story, actually reported in the newspaper, people got arrested or one person got arrested

255
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:07,600
 over this. The year is 1909. We're back in New York City. And if you pick two, you are young George

256
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,640
 Spencer Millay. You pick number two, you're walking through is 1909 New York, you're like,

257
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,960
 "Hey, everybody read all about it. The papers, the papers, bustling noises, it's fested with rats,

258
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,680
 surly Irish. Might even be a member of the Dead Rabbit Gang." They're still around back then,

259
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,800
 which would be pretty dope. But you right now are at work. Your name is George. You're 14 years old,

260
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,960
 and you work at the Metropolitan Insurance Company. 14, by the way, worked in the accounting office.

261
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,280
 1909, they had no laws against child labor. 14-year-old boy working in the accounting office.

262
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,800
 He wasn't like cooking the books or nothing. He was helping with manual, well, erasing ink is

263
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,640
 what he was doing. He was working like, he wasn't actually doing the calculations from what I can

264
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,000
 understand. He got the job only four months earlier. And the girls who also worked there were like,

265
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,200
 "Ooh, he's so cute. He's so, like, mannered, and he has, like, clear skin, and he's not covered in

266
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,320
 boils, like the rest of these kids." I added the boils part. But anyways, they did say that he was

267
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,360
 super hot, and he had really good manners, which is nerd. But anyways, so they all were like pining

268
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,680
 for him. Now, he was about to turn 15, and the girls in the community, the girls in the building,

269
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,000
 thought, "Wouldn't it be nice if they were like bobbing their hair? Wouldn't it be so nice if we

270
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,520
 walked up to George and we kissed him once for each year that he's been alive, that he's existed

271
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,920
 on this planet?" And the other girls were like, "Yes, that's a great idea, and I have a normal

272
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,800
 sounding voice. I don't sound like a freak." And she's like, "What do you mean?" So all the girls

273
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:47,440
 decided to chase down Georgie and kiss him at the end of a shift. Now, that would be one thing if

274
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,640
 he was like, "Well, what?" It would be one thing if he was an adult, and he could prepare for it.

275
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,000
 These girls, one of them was a 23-year-old woman. He was like, "Oh, I'm totally going to like tackle

276
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,120
 this 15-year-old boy and kiss him. Ooh, that would be hot. It's so gross." But anyways, he's 14. He

277
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,160
 just sees a bunch of girls coming at him. He doesn't do a crane kick. Like, he doesn't get in a defensive

278
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,440
 position, but he doesn't know how to react. And they tackle him. Now, he had an ink eraser in his

279
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,040
 pocket. An ink eraser back then was actually like a metal wedge-type tool with a sharp point that

280
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,600
 they used to like scrape ink off stuff. And so when they were kissing him and they tackle him,

281
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,560
 they hear him go, "I'm stabbed! I'm stabbed!" And they back up and blood is just shooting out of the

282
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,760
 chest wound, and everyone totally freaks out. And they're like, "Hurry up! Someone invents a telephone

283
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,040
 and then use it to call an ambulance and then invent an ambulance." But officially, they do get

284
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,120
 an ambulance there. They send like telegraph or carrier pigeon. They had phones back then. I'm

285
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,920
 just joking. But anyways, they get the kid in the ambulance and he dies. He doesn't make it to the

286
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,360
 hospital. The 23-year-old woman gets arrested, not for like sexual predator stuff. She gets arrested

287
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,320
 for murder, but as the police- because they just see a bunch of women descend on a young boy and

288
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,600
 then blood shoot out of his chest. Once cops start an investigation, once some surly Irish cop on the

289
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,720
 take from the dead rabbits who were paying them off, once they investigate the crime, they realize

290
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,560
 it was an accident and she is found not guilty. Not guilty of murder. Guilty of being a pervo,

291
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,920
 but not guilty of murder. The age thing, I mean, I think most of them were around his age. You just

292
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,880
 have this weird 23-year-old woman also in this scene. But you get rid of her. Just assume that,

293
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,080
 let's say, you're in your 20s. You're going to get kissed to death by six beautiful age-appropriate

294
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,360
 women, but then become fatally stabbed because you put something in the wrong pocket. Not a

295
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,160
 terrible way to go. Not a terrible way to go. I would much rather be a dwarf, would not want to

296
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,880
 be a pile of feet, but let's go ahead and move on to our last one. Now I'm walking you over,

297
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,320
 we're walking to these gravestones and I go, "You know if you pick number three, you're this one."

298
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,000
 And they're like, "Well, actually I picked number six. You forced me to pick number three."

299
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
 I'm like, "Silence. Silence. Come over to this gravestone. Come over to this gravestone."

300
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:15,200
 It says, "In memory of Mary Jane McCoon, wife of James W. Forer, born about 1838,

301
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,520
 we don't know, born about 1838, died 1855." And then there's more. Bitten, this one's pretty

302
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,640
 self-explanatory. This gravestone has all the backstory you need. I did go research, but

303
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,200
 it pretty much explains everything that happened. So if you pick number three, this is you.

304
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:41,040
 Bing! You're out on a prairie all by yourself. A little shack. You're pregnant. You're like

305
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,360
 eight months pregnant. You're like, "This is totally weird. I'm in all of a sudden,

306
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,360
 I'm not there anymore. You are alone if you pick number three. You're standing out

307
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:58,640
 outside of a farmhouse pregnant." Feeling really weird. And then you see a coyote walking through

308
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,320
 the prairie. I think it snuck up on her. I don't think you looked right at it. And you see its

309
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:15,280
 mouth is foaming. Now, the tombstone says, "Bitten by a rabid coyote, developed rabies,

310
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:22,480
 became violent." So now you're beating up a bunch of people. You got your mouth is foaming. You go

311
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,960
 into town. You're throwing people out of the saloon, kicking them. When they're down, you like

312
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,600
 flatten their head and go, "Pfft!" They're like, "Stop that pregnant lady. She'll destroy us all!"

313
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,480
 And the lawnmowers shooting at you, you're bulletproof. Throwing tables across the pool hall.

314
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,520
 You're actually throwing not pool tables. I'm not giving you that much strength. You're just

315
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,920
 throwing tables around a pool hall. Do they have pool back then? Anyways, the point is,

316
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:52,000
 is that you become violent. You raise your fist to the moon as the towns people are chasing you

317
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,840
 with torches. Let's go back to the actual epitaph. It says, "So dark. So dark." It says,

318
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,680
 I'll read the whole thing because it made more sense in context. "Bitten by a rabid coyote,

319
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,840
 developed rabies, became violent." We've already experienced that part. "Was smothered with feather

320
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,840
 bed. When husband returned, she and her unborn child were dead and buried."

321
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
 So the towns people did get you and you're like, "Oh, just rip your guts out."

322
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,680
 And you do that. You're actually ripping people's guts out. They finally hit you over the head with

323
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,200
 an anvil, drag you back. Actually, no, they don't need to do that. That would have killed you.

324
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,400
 But at some point in the real story, you get tied down to your bed because you're so violent.

325
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,240
 And when they were, when she was restrained to the bed, she basically like got buried in her own

326
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,240
 blankets and suffocated because she was just thrashing about and she was pregnant. And the

327
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,600
 dad was gone. Her husband was long gone. He was on a trip. He was on like a hunting trip or something

328
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,000
 like that. And business trip, business trip. Maybe his business was hunting. I don't remember,

329
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,960
 but anyways, the husband comes back and she'd been dead for months because they definitely didn't

330
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,840
 have phones back then. He comes back and he's like, "Honey, I'm home. The house is completely trashed."

331
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,400
 He's like, "What is going on? It looks like some violent activity took place here."

332
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:25,200
 "Honey, I'm home." Okay, sorry. That, that's, that, it's getting dark. It's getting dark. The

333
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,680
 point of the matter is if you pick number three, you are pregnant woman eaten by rabid coyote,

334
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,720
 tore through a town. In reality, she just tore her house up. But I'll give you a little bit more.

335
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,680
 Tore through town, villagers, the townspeople, I mean, had to fight you and then eventually

336
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,760
 they tied you to a bed where you suffocated and you and your baby died. Sorry, I knew it was going

337
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,880
 to be really, really dark. I tried to lighten the mood as much as I could, but I knew it was going

338
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,360
 to be dark. So you know your fate. You know how you're going to die. I'm going to tell you guys

339
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,320
 this right now. This is a little uplifting message from the end here. You, people don't have grave

340
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,160
 stones anymore. They're super expensive. I plan on just getting cremated if my body just isn't

341
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,480
 dumped in the middle of the forest. I don't care. Whatever. You, your life is your epitaph. How you

342
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,360
 interact with other people is the legacy leave on the world. You don't need to have a witty saying

343
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,560
 or a grave marker or anything like that. The legacy you leave, the way you interact with other people,

344
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,720
 the way you help people is your epitaph. You will be remembered forever by your actions,

345
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,960
 long after stone has been washed away by the elements. Go out there, do great things, interact

346
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,600
 with people in a great way, be a great person, be positive. That is your legacy. Even if you're

347
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,840
 been by rapid coyote, you can still go out there and say, I'm going to change the world. I'm going

348
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,400
 to change the world around me in even little ways just by being extra nice, just by being

349
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,440
 a good person. That is your legacy. And I know it's mine. I absolutely know it's mine.
