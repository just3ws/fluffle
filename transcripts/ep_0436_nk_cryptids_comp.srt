00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Today we take a tour around the Korean Peninsula to take a look at some of their most memorable creatures.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,500
 First off, we journey to the lair of a unicorn that was recently rediscovered in North Korea,

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 and then we visit an all-girls school to see if there's any truth to the legless floating apparition of a spirit bent on revenge.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 And then finally, get your unitards ready because we are going to wrestle with one of Korea's most dangerous cryptids today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna slide right into this one.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 First off, we're going to give the keys to our vehicles, it's one key fits all the vehicles, to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, Gary.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,500
 Gary, thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really means a lot. You are going to be our tour guide on our journey through Korea.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's totally fine. Just help get the word out about the show. That helps a lot.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And also, I want to give a shout out to listener Stealthy Steve. He is the guy who actually suggested looking into North Korean cryptids

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 and really helped me create North Korea Week, which is what we're in the middle of right now, so really, really appreciate that Stealthy Steve.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Gary, fire up that Jason Jalopy. We're gonna take a little drive through Korea.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Now, a lot of these legends, because you know, Korea, we see it now. It's two countries, the North and the South.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 But a lot of these legends are going to blur the two because they're Korean legends. Some of them are specifically North Korean, and that's actually where we're going first.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So, Gary, I want you to drive our Jason Jalopy along the roads leading from Seoul, Korea, past the 38th parallel, and up to Yongyang, the capital of North Korea.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Now, we have an invisibility cloak on our vehicle, so we don't get asked for passports. Everything is smooth sailing.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 But once we get to Yongyang, we have to shut off our invisibility cloak, and we go looking for a newspaper.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And that's when you check your watch, and you're like, "Uh-oh. It's November 2012."

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And I put my hand on your shoulder, and I say, "Yes, I know. The Mayan gods are coming to destroy us."

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Like they promised two so long ago, but before they do, let's check out this newspaper.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 This is from the Korean Central News Agency, state-run media for North Korea.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Now, luckily, this newspaper is printed in English, so we can read it, and it says, "Unicorn Cave found by archaeologists."

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 "Everyone stunned!" exclamation point. Whoa, that's awesome.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Now, you guys might remember the story, and it's actually kind of an interesting take on how the media plays with people, plays with their minds.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 You know, I'm a journalist. Technically, this is journalism, but this isn't what I went to school for.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I did do have a journalism degree, but print journalism was what my angle was.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But anyways, journalists are all about getting the facts across that to what it should be. That's how I was trained.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But a lot of it, you get manipulation through your bosses trying to sell a slant to a story or government interfering with newspapers.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Well, so this is interesting. So North Korea has been basically a "bad actor" for a long time in US politics, really, since 1945.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 We have a lot of issues with them. So when they released an article about finding this cave, it got printed in the US media and most Western media,

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 as they found a unicorn cave. What a bunch of goofy little dudes who think that unicorns exist.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I remember reading those articles and being like, "That is kind of weird. Like, who thinks unicorns exist?"

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Even though in Iceland, they stop road construction because a bunch of elves are hanging out.

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 They don't get mocked for that. They don't get mocked for that because they're an ally.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So I think that's an interesting side note to see how this story was played up.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 A lot of you guys may remember when that story was in the media and how it was a big joke.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And it is, but again, we give a pass to countries that are aligned with Western media, i.e. Iceland.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So it was a big joke and it kind of went away. Actually, I started looking into it because I'm looking at these cryptids.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 They never said that. This is a really interesting story. So let's take a look at what this cave actually is.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 It's known as Kyryongol. Now, North Korea believes that they are the true owners of Korea.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And the South is Western-owned, US-occupied. It's their property.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And one of the ways that they are able to connect themselves to true Korea before the Japanese invasion, when they wore a unique nation, is that the government of North Korea, the Kims in particular, believe that they are connected to the emperors and kings of old.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 That old game romance of the three kingdoms for the NES and people are like, "Yes!" and then the historical documents regarding them.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But romance of the three kingdoms that's referring to this whole time when you had a king of Korea actually had conquered parts of China.

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Very powerful nation in the past. So you have the North Koreans go, "Listen, we have a connection to these guys. We actually found the cave of the Kyryongol in North Korea."

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So what is the cave of the Kyryongol? Way, way back in the day.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Way back in the day there was a guy named King Dong-Yong. Dong-Yong, right?

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And he... I'm 43, okay? And I think I've lived a pretty interesting life. My life's going pretty awesome, right?

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 This dude, he died at 40. And from the time he was born to the time he died at 40 years old, three years before I'm three years older than this guy will ever be,

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 he created an empire that lasted for 700 years. And it conquered all of Korea and chunks of China.

51
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It makes me feel bad. I'm putting out a podcast that this dude was able to do that. That's the ambition. 700 years.

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So of course they want to be linked to such a powerful leader.

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Could you imagine if a US presidential candidate could connect himself to George Washington? This is even better. This dude basically is the Alexander the Great of Asia.

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So one of the things... So he's a historical figure, but you end up having a lot of myth mixed in with it.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And apparently, King Dong-Yong wrote a quillen. So what's a quillen? Now this is where it gets dicey.

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So quillen is generally translated into English as a unicorn. And that cave is supposed to be where the king got his quillen.

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Karen Gull was the cave, and that's where he got his quillen. His mythological beast, very, very powerful creature that he wrote into battle was his personal pet.

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 His Pokemon, you may say. And so it's translated into English for whatever reason as a one-horned creature, i.e. a unicorn.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So of course the media ran with it, came in the unicorn. This is an interesting cryptid, because we actually know what this was.

60
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 This story is so fascinating, it's such a disservice that the media really portrayed the story the way that it was.

61
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 This is how the quillen was described in the ancient text.

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Sightings of this thing went back to the 5th century. It had antlers. It wasn't a single horn. It had antlers sticking out of its head.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 It was vegetarian. It was very quiet. It doesn't sound like the type of beast you would want to write into battle.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I guess being quiet is probably a boon to that, but I would want to write like a coniferous monster into battle.

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

67
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It's a monster that has a lot of land animals that are big enough to ride that have armor on them. And if they do have armor on them like a rhino or a hippo, one, you're not getting on the back one of those things.

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And two, it disturbs the grass. But during the Ming dynasty, so at some point during the Ming dynasty, and that was from 1300 to 1600 AD, the emperor had discovered a quillen.

69
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 He had discovered them, actually. And he bought them from Somalia. When his traders saw them in Somalia, they go, "Oh my God, dude! This has to be it. This has to be the creature that we've heard about."

70
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So they ship them out to the emperor of China and he goes, "I am truly the king if I have the quillen."

71
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And he kept them and everyone would come and be amazed by these things. You know what they were? Antlers, vegetarian, quiet, had reptilian or fish scales, could walk on grass without disturbing it.

72
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 They were drafts. And it fits everything and it's funny because people go, they go, "That actually is how you would describe a draft."

73
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Did you have the little antlers? They don't have the big deer antlers? And you probably could ride one. People go, "He may not have been riding it into battle. That might be part of the myth."

74
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But he may have had a draft. This king, this ancient Korean king, may have had a draft with him. And I know I'm probably mispronouncing such a comment.

75
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 "Jaraff?" "Jaraff." "Jaraff." "Jaraff," right? Anyways, the long-necked creature. That would look like a-- they look like a cryptid, really, to us.

76
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 But they have those patches of fur, like the black and the yellow. It doesn't look completely like-- it's not armor, but it looks like fish scales, the spots. They can walk without-- such a big beast with such little legs, they can walk without disturbing the grass.

77
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 So what scientists and what, like, mythologists, people who study-- sociologists, probably a better word, study, they believe that that's most likely what they were referring to. And there may have been wild giraffes in the area, in Korea at some point.

78
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Maybe they were imported. Maybe someone bought them for a pet and then they got too big. They flushed them down the toilet and they popped up in Korea. We don't know.

79
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But it's most likely that the great king, Dongmyung, had a giraffe with him. And then people described it as this great beast. And then it's not indigenous to Korea, so it would have simply died out, it wouldn't have made it.

80
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And then we fast-forward 800, 900 years. Yeah, China begins expanding their trade. They discover there's an entire consonant full of mythological beasts.

81
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 That's an interesting story. I love that story because, one, it's a cool little cryptid story and, two, we have an answer to it.

82
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic. Now, our next topic's a little bit shorter, and I think it's fascinating because it shows how quickly mythology changes.

83
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So, Gary, let's fire up that Jason Jalapie. We are headed out to an all-girl school in South Korea. Now, these ghosts are seen everywhere, but we're seeing a huge uptick in this phenomenon in South Korea. Here we go.

84
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Now, every culture has a ghost legend. Every culture has a legend of somebody passing away, coming back as some sort of phantom. Our earliest forms of literature deal with this. It's the big question.

85
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I think it's interesting that it's the big question, and yet the answers are always kind of the same. Like, you can take a tribe of people who have never been contacted by any other culture.

86
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They will have a story about being visited by their dead relatives. So, I think there's something to it. But anyways, in Korea, there are no--

87
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Ghosts are generally known as "guis-en." Now, typical ghost stuff, right? You die. You haven't finished everything you wanted to do in life. You come back. You haunt people. You get the job done.

88
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Or you can't bear to leave your loved ones. You kind of float around some. Basic ghost stuff. Basic, basic ghost stuff. We're not breaking any ground here.

89
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 What's interesting about these ghosts in Korea is, one, the longer--and I've never come across this. I've always come across evidence to the other side. The longer they stay on Earth, the stronger they get.

90
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Now, we've actually covered stories that's the opposite of that, where you have a house that's haunted and there are reports of it being haunted in 1890 and 1910 and 1930 and 1950 and then they just kind of trail off.

91
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And I think it's always been common--I don't want to say common knowledge, because nobody knows, but I think it's always been kind of a common idea that ghosts get weaker over time.

92
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Whether it's some sort of electromagnetic--like, if you want to look at a rational answer and it's some sort of like electromagnetic field that's just recording stuff in the air that's going to dissipate over time.

93
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 If it's an actual ghost over time, it just gets weaker, its power gets weaker. No, in Korea they get stronger. At first off, it's just the phantom of a girl walking down a hallway.

94
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 But within a couple years, she can begin moving things, a couple more years, slamming doors.

95
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So they just become more and more powerful over time, which to me would be a selling point to be a ghost. If someone's like, "Go through the tunnel of light."

96
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 If I didn't, over the course of 80 years, I would simply dissipate in a haunted house anyways. I wouldn't.

97
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 But if I knew in 80 years, I'm basically going to be Hulk-level ghosts. I'm going to be picking up haunted houses and throwing them at lame haunted houses.

98
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I'm like, "What? You only had one family tragedy."

99
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Smash and stuff. Godzilla-sized Casper just walking through town, kicking over buildings. I'm staying.

100
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 So that's an interesting thing, that these ghosts hang out and get stronger. But these ghosts also commonly inhabit places, ghosts you would think they would be.

101
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Abandoned buildings. Houses, obviously houses, the term on and out, cemeteries, forests. They're all pretty typical haunted places. Basic stuff.

102
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Where we see the most hauntings in Korea are schools. And you go, "Jason, there's haunted schools."

103
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And you've actually covered haunted schools in a lot of your episodes. True. But here's the thing. It's predominantly in schools.

104
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 There are more of these ghosts seen in schools than there are in haunted houses, abandoned buildings, graveyard and stuff like that.

105
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Now, it could be for one of two reasons. One, if a ghost is hanging out in an abandoned building, there's no one there to notice that it's there, right?

106
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 There could be a thousand ghosts in there for all. You know, there could be a ghost gala going on right now. You would never know.

107
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Because it's abandoned. You have people in school all the time. So if there's a ghost there, it has more likelihood of being seen. That's true. That could be.

108
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 It's also, though, most likely because of the movie industry over there. This is fascinating. Ghosts, again, have been around since the beginning of mankind.

109
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 People have been talking about ghosts forever. The reason why ghosts are so popular in schools in South Korea, because there's a film series about ghosts in schools in South Korea called Whispering Corridors.

110
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It was a cultural phenomenon in South Korea made for $600,000 and it was like the third highest grossing movie in South Korea that year. There's been like six sequels made to it.

111
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So because of these movies, this is so interesting, it basically created a phenomenon. The ghost existed and the ghost existed in normal ghost places.

112
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And yes, ghosts are seen in schools all over the world. But nowadays, that's the number one spot they're located is in schools, specifically all girls schools.

113
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Because these ghosts and other interesting thing about them, they are very, very rarely male. If you see one, it's a woman and they're dressed like a movie ghost. All white, long black hair.

114
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Now people go, "The reason why that's in the movie is because it's based on real life." And that's probably true. But it's interesting how it's become a self-perpetuating thing.

115
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 The ghosts in the movies are female. These ghosts are almost exclusively seen as female. Ghosts in the movies were at school. These ghosts are almost exclusively now seen in school.

116
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Now we're walking through this hallway in this all-girl school. We're dressed up like teachers so we don't look too bizarre that we're a bunch of adults in here.

117
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 We're walking down the hallway and we see every so often we hear, "Oooh, the place is full of ghosts." It's like they predicted. Here's my question to you guys.

118
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Is there a sex disparity between ghosts? Now think about it. Think about it. Before you jump to an answer, because we have told stories about ghosts that were men and ghosts that were women.

119
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 But thinking about it in my head, I think most of the ghosts that I can think of off the top of my head were women when they were alive, right?

120
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Like, isn't that weird? It's so funny because I was researching this stuff way before doing this podcast. And I think of all the ghost stories I've ever come across, they... I personally think off the top of my head it's like a 70/30 split.

121
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 70% of the ghosts are women. 30% are men. And I could be wildly off on that. And if I am, I think it's even higher women ghosts. Isn't that bizarre?

122
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 I never thought about that before. Ever, ever thought about that before. We don't have a racial disparity in ghosts. We have ghosts of all different ethnicities in America. We've come across that.

123
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And then you have Korean ghosts in Korea, Russian ghosts in Russia, and stuff like that. But as far as sex goes, I think South Korea may be pointing out something that hasn't been recognized in the paranormal community that most ghosts are women.

124
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 When you look at the Wikipedia page for this ghost, for this gwisin, it lists why these ghosts exist. Again, this is basic ghost stuff. So here's this list of reasons why these ghosts may stick around.

125
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Again, you have basic ghost stuff. They wanting to stay longer, not wanting to say goodbye to loved ones. Revenge is one of those things.

126
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Now, both of those are unisex, right? There are women wanting to get revenge. There are men who want to get revenge. But when we get down to stuff like unsuccessful birth, that is only something that a woman can experience.

127
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 So right there, you have a right there that's going to skew the numbers. And even when you think, this might sound callous, but even when you think about it, not wanting to leave somebody, this is going to sound super callous, but not wanting to leave someone or having unfinished work.

128
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I think a ghost, a dude would be like, "Ah, I gave him my best shot." Goes in the tunnel of light while a mother may be looking at her children. And again, this might be out of line, but a mother looking at her children may be like, "I don't want to leave."

129
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Think about all of the ghost stories we've come across about a man going out to war, dying, and then the woman jumping off a building and killing herself. We've covered quite a few of those stories just on this podcast, and I haven't even covered all of them.

130
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 How often does the other side happen? Now, I know it happens, but as far as like, I know it unfortunately happens and men kill themselves because of bad relationships. But when we look at origins of ghost stories, I have not seen that.

131
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I have not seen a story where a young woman dies before her time and the young man kills himself and then is haunting an area. I don't think I've ever seen that.

132
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 I've seen couples die and the couple haunts the area, and I've seen the man dies and the woman kills herself. So there may actually, and I'm not saying obviously men do kill themselves because of trauma and losing loved ones, but I'm talking into this ghost story realm.

133
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Never come across that. There may actually be a discrepancy between the sexes, male versus female. And if that's true, that's huge, because that's actually a measurable thing we can look at.

134
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And that's one thing that science is always grappling with when it comes to the paranormal. If everyone who died became a ghost, it would be super easy to measure. There would be millions upon millions of ghosts everywhere, but there's not.

135
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 So not everyone who dies become a ghost. But if we can start looking at demographic breakdowns of a ghost, even if it's something simple, saying it's more likely if you're a woman to become a ghost than if you're a man to become a ghost, that's something you can actually begin to plug into steadies and factors.

136
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Fascinating stuff. I think there might be something there. I think there might be something there. But as we continue to analyze whether or not there is something there, we have one more story to cover.

137
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So we're saying goodbye to the all-girls school. We're saying goodbye to the mo- There's an entire classroom, just 30 ghosts just sitting there, the teachers and ghosts.

138
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Fire up that carbonar copter. We are headed to the skies, Gary, because we got one more cryptid tube visit. We're gonna go see the Dokebi.

139
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Now before you guys start flooding my YouTube comments with "Did you know Dokebi is a character in Rainbow Six Siege?" I do know that.

140
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I've also learned that when people listen to my show on YouTube, they begin commenting halfway through the episode, and then I address what they're commenting about, and then they put in an edit.

141
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 "LOL, sorry, I didn't know you were going to say that." But anyway, so I had to get that right out there.

142
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Dokebi. This is an interesting cryptid. Again, I want to waste your time with something else. And we're gonna end with the story that I honestly have mixed feelings about.

143
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 What is the Dokebi? An easy way to say it is a Korean goblin. "Monsterous figure, long fangs, sling, claws, snick. Monstrous man, argh."

144
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Coming at you. It's interesting because depending on where you live, these guys either suck. They're either the worst thing you could possibly run into, or a local god.

145
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 These creatures have existed for thousands of years. We can look back into legends of Korean mythology and find these things. Very, very powerful creatures.

146
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 They definitely look goblin-like, but sometimes they're quite passive. So let's say you have a fishing village. One of the things that the Dokebi can do is control the waves.

147
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Can control the creatures of water. So you'd have a fishing village prey to this thing.

148
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You've seen what these have looked like. This is a very traditional face of an Asian monster. In fact, the Red Devils, it's the national football team in South Korea.

149
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The Red Devils, their logo is the Dokebi. It's just this monstrous face. If you saw it, you'd instantly recognize it.

150
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But you would have fishing communities worship this thing because it would bring about a good harvest. You'd have other communities that would see it as what it looked like.

151
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 A devil, a monster. They can be aggressive. They can be mischievous at best, really. Downright, pathologically aggressive at worst.

152
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And it's interesting because these are not the spirits of the dead. These aren't a-- When I say goblin, that's what they look like, but a goblin's kind of a separate species from humanity.

153
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 What these things are is they're the spirits of inanimate objects that have come to life generally by having blood spilled on them.

154
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 We covered that in our first episode of North Korea Week, of the story of the pole gassari. You have a broom. Sweep, sweep, sweep, you're sweeping stuff up.

155
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 It's a good broom. You've had it for a long time, sweeping stuff up. Ow! It got a splinter. I'm going to stand right over this broom and accidentally drop some blood.

156
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Drip, drop. Ding! And then a Dokebi jumps out of it. Now, you may be upset that you pretty much just lost your broom, but again, depending on where you live at, that might be cool.

157
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 You might be like, "Yes, dude! It's like a sitcom. It's like Perfect Strangers, except one of you is a mythological creature."

158
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 But again, some villages hated these guys. Absolutely hated these guys because they would walk through town and just start pushing over apple carts.

159
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And you're like, "Oh no, that's the only apples in all of North Korea." And he's stepping on them. Definitely a creature that you don't want to run across.

160
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 But what's interesting is there's a breakdown for these guys as well. And I think a lot of this has to do with the region, but one of them, probably the most feared one.

161
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And you're going to say, "Really, dude? This is the most feared one? Think about it, though. Think about this for a second."

162
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 There was a guy named Odori Dokebi. Now, you'd be walking through the woods, right? Humbin' a jaunty tune, looking for more apples since that other Dokebi knocked over your apple cart.

163
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And a Dokebi jumps out, "Ugh! I won't let you pass unless you can beat me at a wrestling match."

164
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And we're doing Korean wrestling, which is called ss-s-siremi, or something. He can't even pronounce it. "Ugh! It doesn't matter. I'm a monster. I don't have to pronounce stuff."

165
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Now, ss-siremi is traditional Korean wrestling where each person has a belt. And it actually sounds kind of fun.

166
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 The point is, is if any part of your body above your knee touches the ground, the other guy gains a point. That's kind of interesting.

167
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So you can wrestle on your knees. I think that's usually where the match starts. And you can bring them down to- if they stand up, you can bring them down to their knees,

168
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 but you don't get a point until an arm or an elbow or a head or shoulder touches the ground. It's kind of fascinating. It's national wrestling over there.

169
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 So this dude jumps down. Now, obviously his whole thing- one, he's a goblin. And two, his whole thing is wrestling. So you figure he's going to be pretty good.

170
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 My questions are this. One, what if you don't have a belt on? You need to have these looped belts to really do the match, because that's what you grab onto.

171
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Does he loan you one? Actually, you know, that's funny because these guys do have invisibility cloaks.

172
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 That every so often they'll give one to someone. That's OP technology.

173
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Like an invisibility cloak is anyone could become the worst person ever just by having an invisibility cloak.

174
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I don't think any good would ever come out of someone being able to turn truly invisible. These guys gave them out like they're cupcakes.

175
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And then they also had magic wand. So again, the level of power- these guys aren't tree gnomes. The level of power these guys had available to them was far beyond what most of them had.

176
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Far beyond what most cryptids have. So you go, I got to wrestle a monster. I haven't been pretty good shape. Here's the thing. You got to wrestle the monster.

177
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 He's super good at it. Totally can lay you out. But his name is O'Darey Dokeby, which means one-legged Dokeby.

178
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 So now you're wrestling a dude with just one leg and apparently he's pretty easy to beat. It's funny because I'm reading this and it's like that you meet this guy and he wants to wrestle you and he has this special wrestling ability and all this stuff.

179
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Then you read a couple more paragraphs down and they're like, oh by the way, he only has one leg. Well, that should have been- you should have just told me that in the beginning.

180
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Apparently though, it's quite strong, but they say just sweep the leg and you win and you get to go on your way.

181
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 There's Gaxi Dokeby, which means maiden Dokeby, and Chonguk Dokeby, which means bachelor Dokeby. They're the smooth talkers.

182
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 You run into these monsters in the middle of the woods. You're getting some action, dude. It may be with a monstrous looking dude or gal, but you're banging something tonight.

183
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 They may be banging your head against the rock when you're done, but you know, going home. You're going home with somebody.

184
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 In this time of self-isolation, that's a win, right?

185
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And then we have the wrestling one. We have Gim Sabang Dokeby, which literally means Mr. Kim Dokeby. He's just a farmer.

186
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 He's specifically a dumb Dokeby that looks like a farmer.

187
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 So you win the wrestling match, you end up banging this chick Dokeby, who, you know, any poor in a storm, and then you meet a dumb one, dumb one, who has a farm.

188
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And his name is literally Mr. Kim Dokeby.

189
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 So that's kind of a nice little- that should be like- remember those Mr. Smiley books when we were kids? Mr. Happy and all that stuff?

190
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 They should do one where it's just Dokeby, but I guess you don't have to- I guess you can't have the one who's like the sexy Dokeby trying to bang you.

191
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 So that's a little tour of the Dokebys, but I wanted to end it with this. This is an old legend involving a Dokeby.

192
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 There's a lot more Dokebys out there, but let me end this with a Dokeby story. This is an old legend.

193
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I thought this was an interesting legend. I have mixed feelings about it.

194
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 A long time ago, in a cabin up in a mountain, there was an old man who lived all alone.

195
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 One day there's a knock at his door. He opens the door, and there's a Dokeby standing there.

196
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 A monstrous man at his doorstep. Now, the old man doesn't know what to do, but he wants to be polite, so he invites the Dokeby into his house and gives him a beer.

197
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And Dokeby is very grateful for this, and he's drinking with the old man.

198
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 They begin talking, and they talk for a bit, and the Dokeby goes, "It's time for me to leave." He leaves the house.

199
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 But the Dokeby had a really good time there, so he returns to the old man's house.

200
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "Hello, you know who it is?" The old man's like, "Oh, Dokeby, what's going on, my man? I got some more drinks for you."

201
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 "They come in, pourin' more drinks." And the Dokeby began to visit his house pretty regularly, and they became good friends.

202
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 They'd have long conversations as the sun set in the sky.

203
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Dokeby would leave, and the old man would go to sleep with a smile on his face.

204
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 It had been a long time since he had a friend like that, and it had been a long time since the Dokeby had met someone who accepted him.

205
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 But one day the old man was out by himself, and he was walking through the woods, and he comes across to stream.

206
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And he leans over to get a drink of water, and he sees his reflection.

207
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 His teeth are sharper, his eyes more fierce.

208
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 His face was being transformed into that of a fiend.

209
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He realized that he was slowly becoming a Dokeby himself, so he hatched a plan.

210
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 The next time the Dokeby came over, the old man, him and the old man spoke like they normally do, and then the old man finally said,

211
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 "Dokeby, what do you fear the most?" Dokeby sighed heavily and said, "I'm afraid of blood."

212
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 The old man goes, "Okay." Dokeby goes, "Old man, what are you afraid of the most?"

213
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 The old man looked around, with fear in his eyes.

214
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 He leaned close to the Dokeby and said, "Money. I fear money more than anything. That's why I live up here alone."

215
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Dokeby nods.

216
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 The next day, before the Dokeby can return to the old man's house, he slaughters one of his cows and covers the house in blood and hides inside.

217
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 The Dokeby is walking through the woods to visit his friend that day. He sees the house slathered in fresh blood.

218
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 "You fool!" the Dokeby raged, "I'll be back with your greatest fear!"

219
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Dokeby runs into the forest. The old man sits and waits.

220
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 A few hours later, the Dokeby returns and begins throwing bags full of gold coins into the old man's house, smashing all of his windows.

221
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And the Dokeby turns and leaves.

222
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 The old man takes all the gold into town. Now, the wealthiest man in the area, he no longer has to live alone in the mountains.

223
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 He can afford a house wherever he wants.

224
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 That's an interesting story, and it's funny. When you first read it, it's kind of a funny thing. It's almost set up like a joke.

225
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 I can imagine a parent telling that story to their kids in Korea and the kids laughing.

226
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 "Can you tell me the story about the Dokeby again?"

227
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Because it's a story that involves a monster getting outwitted, and it kind of has a funny ending.

228
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 The old man couldn't afford to move anywhere else. This is a trick.

229
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 The second time you read it, though, I feel so bad for that Dokeby.

230
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 That story actually makes me really, really sad.

231
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Because I've been in that situation. I think we've all been in that situation, right?

232
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 You think you've made a good friend. You think you've met somebody who understands you, and it turns out they don't.

233
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 So heartbreaking. This monster walking through the middle of nowhere finally finds someone who doesn't worship him, who doesn't fear him, who just wants to be his buddy.

234
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And then, imagine that. Just imagine that. You're going to your friend's house. You reveal your worst fear to your friend.

235
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 You're going to your friend's house, and he makes your worst fear true.

236
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I mean, I get the old man, he doesn't want to become a monster and all that stuff, but I don't know, man.

237
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 That story just really hits me in the feels, dude. Is that just me?

238
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 It takes a lot to get an emotional reaction out of this old, salty conspiracy theorist, but that little story that'll keep you do, I feel bad for that dude.

239
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I'm not saying I would necessarily invite him or invoke him to hang out in my apartment.

240
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 But I hope you did find a friend out there, buddy. I hope somewhere out there, somewhere in the Korean Peninsula, you finally found a friend who likes you for you, even if they end up turning into another you.
