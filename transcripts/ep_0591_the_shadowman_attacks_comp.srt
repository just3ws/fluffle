00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 When a long time listener of the show contacted me needing help with shadow men in his house,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,520
 I was more than willing to help.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,560
 But as I was trying to figure out a way to help him banish these entities from his house, it led me down a very bizarre path.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,480
 I found a man who claims that you can command shadow people to assault your enemies.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,240
 And then I found a few cases of a very troubling nature which leads us to ask the question,

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
 "Is the shadow man a sex offender today on Dead Rabbit Radio?"

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,760
 [Music]

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,720
 I'm your host, DaysandKarperner, and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,600
 It's okay.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
 Man, I just, I got a stomach bug.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
 I know I've been talking about medical stuff this whole, the last couple of episodes,

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,320
 and everything's going fine, and now I have like a 20, I hope it's a 24 hour bug.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
 There's everyone saying, "My little tummy hurts.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,360
 My little tummy's all rumbly."

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
 As my tummy, as my tummy is...

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,560
 In comes one of our legacy Patreons bringing me some Pepto Bismol.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
 It's Brian Kim.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,120
 Everyone give a round of applause to Brian Kim.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,040
 He's so awesome delivering me Pepto at this late hour.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,440
 Brian, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,520
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
 Just help spread the word about the show.

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,880
 That really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
 So as we're hanging out in Dead Rabbit Central, and I'm drinking this Pepto Bismol,

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 we're all sitting around this giant table, and there's this like map behind us with like

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,560
 little lights and stuff like, "Do you like this theater of the mind?"

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,160
 You can totally picture it.

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,200
 We're standing there, and Brian Kim is standing next to me like a bodyguard.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
 He has cool sunglasses on.

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,800
 Nothing else, totally nude except for his sunglasses.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,840
 I don't know how many vehicles we're going to take on this one, Brian,

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
 but I'll make sure I'll get you into the Carbentercopter at some point.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
 But first off, let me give you a little bit of introduction to the story.

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,120
 So the other day, a listener of the show named Dan reached out to me via Facebook and asked me

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,920
 if I knew a way to get rid of shadow people.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,960
 Now, this is a really interesting topic, and it's one that I've talked about once or twice on this

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,240
 show. I talked about my own experiences with shadow people.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,760
 And the very infamous episode, The Shadow People Invasion, that was the first episode

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
 that sparked off the whole forest finned debacle.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,080
 But Shadow Man, it's really like it's up there with aliens and Bigfoot,

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,360
 and it's like a top tier paranormal thing.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,120
 So I've mentioned it here and there, but I've never really done a deep dive into it

45
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,760
 outside of my own experiences, because it's so mainstream.

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,640
 And Dan reached out to me, and he goes, "Do you know a way to deal with shadow people?"

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
 He tells me this story. This is what's going on with him.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
 The other day was about four in the morning, and him and his father were in their house.

49
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,560
 And as they were walking through the living room, Dan looks over and he sees what he can only

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,920
 describe as a shadow man, a being an entity made entirely of darkness.

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,560
 If you needed a description, you're like, "Dude, I know what a shadow man is.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,120
 This isn't my first go around on the paranormal world."

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,440
 He sees a shadow man crouched behind his couch.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,760
 And when Dan and his father notice it, the shadow man moves.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,720
 He reacts to their gaze. He hides.

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,960
 And startles Dan, and he talks to his dad about it.

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,800
 And at that point, he finds out that his dad and his brother, Dan's brother,

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,280
 have been seeing shadow men for quite a while.

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,920
 There's other personal family information that he involves, like where his dad works

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,160
 and stuff like that, that I don't really want to go into, just because I don't want to dox the dude.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,400
 I don't want more shadow people to find him.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,240
 But just throughout the father's life, really since the late 80s, early 90s,

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,080
 he's been seeing these things and he works in a job where he may encounter those things.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,960
 He works at shadow man conglomerated.

65
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,560
 It's the factory where they make them.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,320
 No, he's seen these throughout.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,000
 And from what I gather through the messages that we traded,

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
 the father's also been seeing them in the house as well.

69
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
 I thought it was a really interesting story because my experiences with shadow men

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
 are pretty standard.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,880
 Shadow people seem to, for the most part, move through human environments

72
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
 the same way we would walk through a park.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,880
 We're totally unaware of the insects and the birds and little kitty cats and everything.

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
 We may stop and go, "Aw."

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
 But for the most part, we don't care.

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,960
 We'll walk right over a gopher's house and not think twice about it.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
 To us, we're not even thinking there's a gopher under our feet.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
 Basically, they seem so supreme.

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,440
 They truly are alien.

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,240
 So I thought it was really odd that this shadow man reacted the way that it did,

81
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
 because that's not part of the lore.

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,800
 The shadow man should have been standing in the hallway.

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,640
 Dan had seen it.

84
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,280
 And maybe the shadow man moves.

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,160
 Maybe it just stays there and then it flickers out of existence.

86
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,320
 But it wouldn't react to human interaction.

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
 So I thought that was really, really interesting.

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,360
 But like I said, shadow people are really, really mainstream.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
 So while I was trying to help out Dan, the same time,

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,600
 I'm thinking maybe I can find a new spin on the shadow people phenomenon.

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
 So I begin looking around.

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
 Brian, go ahead and put some clothes on.

93
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,440
 You gotta get dressed for this.

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
 Go ahead.

95
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,440
 Let's hop in the hair hang glider.

96
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
 We don't use this very often.

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
 We're all gonna grab on a Brian's ankles.

98
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,520
 We're all gonna fly away and we are headed out to the United Kingdom.

99
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:46,720
 And in Britain, we're gonna see a spooky castle.

100
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,040
 And this castle contains a supervillain.

101
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,640
 Now, longtime listeners of the show will know who I'm talking about.

102
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,200
 Once I say his name, you probably don't have enough clues now.

103
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,160
 We go into the spooky castle and there we meet S. Rob.

104
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
 S. Rob is someone I covered, what was it, like 200 episodes ago.

105
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,720
 It's a man who has unlocked the secrets of the universe and has crafted the most powerful spells

106
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,080
 known to man that you can master for $2.99 through the Kindle app on Amazon.

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,360
 He writes all of these books.

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,640
 He wrote How to Be a Supervillain.

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,480
 I think that's what we covered on the show.

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,520
 But he's written books on how to control armies of goblins.

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,360
 He wrote a book on how to use cartoons for magic.

112
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,480
 Now, I had planned on doing more episodes on him, but a lot of his stuff is wackier.

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,080
 Like the titles sound wackier and then when you read it, it's kind of a slog.

114
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,760
 Sure, I did learn to become a master of the dark arts from reading all of his books,

115
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,920
 but I didn't share that information with you.

116
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,880
 Actually, a big reason I didn't share it with you was because

117
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,320
 his spells became increasingly more demonic.

118
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
 And I'm not an idiot.

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,080
 Like on that supervillain episode, I read out a spell and I was thinking,

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,240
 even when I was reading it and then when I was editing it, I was like, I'm okay with this.

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,920
 Like sure, the spell might work and I might be casting a curse on all my listeners,

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,360
 but I think it's fine.

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,200
 But then as I was reading his goblin stuff and his cartoon magic, it was like,

124
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,960
 open the gates of hell into your house, Jason Carpenter.

125
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,640
 I was like, yeah, how does he know my name?

126
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
 It got really, really dark.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,600
 Bennett, I want to give a shout out to Bennett too, a long-time listener of the show.

128
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,760
 He's the one who turned me on to the SROP phenomenon.

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,080
 So Bennett's like, I don't want credit for this dude.

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,680
 In his original email, he goes, I don't want to give this guy any money.

131
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
 But I did.

132
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
 I've been giving this guy money.

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
 I've been reading his books.

134
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,760
 But when I was looking for a novel way to explore the Shadowman phenomenon,

135
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,760
 to discuss on this show, because I didn't want to just go over the normal Shadowman stuff,

136
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,680
 I found SROP's book, How to Command an Army of Shadowmen Against Your Enemies.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
 Now I saw the title of that book.

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
 I've given this dude so much money, so much money,

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
 and I stopped reading his books a while ago.

140
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,440
 I saw the title of that book and I was like, well, okay,

141
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,920
 do I really want to pay three bucks to read?

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,280
 I know what his books are going to be.

143
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
 All of his books are exactly the same.

144
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
 There's one spell in each book, and then there's 10 chapters,

145
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
 and each chapter, the wording of the spell changes a little differently,

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,680
 and it's three bucks.

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,880
 Or if you use the Kindle app, you still read it and he still gets paid.

148
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,560
 I don't have a problem with paying him.

149
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,200
 I don't have a moral problem with paying him.

150
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,480
 I just got tired of giving.

151
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,640
 I think I've given him total of like $30 or $40 from reading all of his books.

152
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,920
 This is not like a moral thing.

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,560
 I just don't want to keep spending money.

154
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,240
 So when I saw the title of this book, I go,

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,920
 I'm just going to go through the table of contents.

156
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,080
 Maybe that'll give me much of the money, Jason.

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,920
 That's really good to admit on your well-researched paranormal shirt.

158
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,720
 I'm just going to go through his table of comments and see,

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,360
 because he lists the different spells in the book.

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,480
 I'll just read those, right?

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,040
 Looking through the spells,

162
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,400
 how to command them to attack your enemy, obviously.

163
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,720
 Then another chapter is how to command Shadowman to steal someone's luck.

164
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 Like what? Does everyone have a personal leprechaun?

165
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
 The Shadowman are tying him up, throwing him in his shadow van.

166
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,880
 Then I get to getting the Shadow people to steal someone's looks.

167
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
 I'm like, what? That's intriguing.

168
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,000
 That's kind of intriguing.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,880
 It's not 2.99 intriguing, but it was intriguing.

170
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,080
 The chapter after that, getting an army of shadowmen to partially reverse a person's gender.

171
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,520
 I was like, okay, he got me.

172
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,160
 I got to click the buy now button, because I have no idea what that is.

173
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
 You got me, Esra. You got me.

174
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
 Dang it.

175
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,880
 Your Shadowman army took over my Amazon account.

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,760
 So I did read partially.

177
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
 I only read the chapters that I wanted to read.

178
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
 I did purchase though how to command an army of Shadowmen against your enemies.

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
 Esraab isn't using the word army lightly either.

180
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,720
 In his book, you're sending three battalions of Shadowmen against someone.

181
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,840
 Which he has as around 1500 Shadow people.

182
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,640
 So he talks about them going and stealing people's luck.

183
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,960
 Oh, and of course the spell is Leviathan mouth of hell.

184
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,560
 Open up all these horrible.

185
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,960
 I'm like, no, I'm not reading the spell.

186
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,840
 It's not funny.

187
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,680
 But anyways, he has all this stuff.

188
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
 Attacking your enemies and stealing their luck, stealing their money,

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,480
 which I can just imagine 1500 Shadowmen carrying out bags,

190
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,400
 Scrooge McDuck bags with dollar signs on him out of a bank.

191
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,680
 That's a lot of Shadow people.

192
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,640
 But anyways, so when he's talking about the ceiling people's looks is pretty self-explanatory.

193
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,600
 The Shadowmen show up.

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
 You're like, no, it's not.

195
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,840
 It's super bizarre.

196
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,440
 Shadow people show up and they suck away someone's good looks and give it to you.

197
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,680
 So if you're ever like, no matter how much you're working out,

198
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,960
 you start to look, you start to look hideous.

199
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
 You start to look like the witch from Snow White.

200
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,440
 You might want to look around for 1500 Shadows.

201
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,280
 And if your greatest enemy starts to look more beautiful, then you absolutely know.

202
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,880
 Just go to their Amazon order history, see that they bought this book.

203
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,840
 You buy it and take your looks back.

204
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,080
 The Shadow people says basic stuff like that.

205
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,320
 But I pay $299 to see how it's possible.

206
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,200
 Not how it's possible.

207
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,160
 It's impossible.

208
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,560
 But what did he mean by partially change or partially reverse a person's gender?

209
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,600
 You give a man boobs and you give a woman a beard.

210
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,360
 I'm like, what?

211
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,120
 First off, Taco Bell will give a man boobs.

212
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,680
 You don't need 1500 Shadows to do that.

213
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,840
 You just need 1500 Chalupas.

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,680
 Bearded, who cares?

215
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,400
 First off, I would, if I was a Shadow man,

216
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,000
 if I was a Shadow man coming through the mouth of Leviathan with 1500 of my buddies,

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
 I'd be a little upset if the only thing you're using before is to give some chick a beard.

218
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
 That she can just shave off.

219
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,560
 And you're like, oh man, you use the powers, you use the elemental forces of the dam to do that.

220
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
 Giving a man boobs, that's nothing.

221
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
 He also says you can shrink the man's genitals.

222
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,920
 But you're like, Jason, that's a little more important.

223
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 You left out, but I mean, who again, like that, who cares about that?

224
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,520
 But shrinking genitals probably did, probably did bury the lead on that one.

225
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,040
 But he says giving a man boobs first too as well.

226
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
 But again, there's a lot of easier ways to do that than opening the mouth of hell.

227
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
 But I will give S-Rob it credit for this.

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
 I also want to thank my Patreons for supporting the show once again,

229
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
 because I wouldn't spend my money on this.

230
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,720
 I'm using your money.

231
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
 I do give S-Rob credit for this.

232
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
 This is really interesting.

233
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,840
 I've studied the Shadowman phenomenon for a long time,

234
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,280
 because I was actively had to engage with it.

235
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,320
 If you're interested in more of that, I'll put the episode in the show notes.

236
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,600
 He has a theory about the Shadowman phenomenon.

237
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
 So I mean, a broken clock is right twice a day.

238
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
 He says that in his theory, Shadowmen are not demons,

239
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,880
 but they're entities that are native to the dimensional plane of hell.

240
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
 Which is an interesting way to look at it,

241
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,480
 and it would kind of explain why they usually act the way they do.

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,320
 In the sense that they just seem to wander around and seem to not really care what humans are doing.

243
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,680
 A demon, a demon's whole purpose is the destruction of humanity, soul by soul.

244
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,920
 A normal resident of hell, though, that wasn't thrust into hell,

245
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,360
 but something that lived there long before the demons entered it,

246
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
 they wouldn't care about the petty war between God and Lucifer.

247
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,160
 The same thing if that if you were an indigenous person of a continent that God invaded,

248
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
 and then the people who invaded it go to war with another country,

249
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,800
 you're like "I... you guys can both blow up for all I care"

250
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,000
 or just "I don't... it doesn't matter, you guys are both of a nuisance,

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,960
 I'm just gonna float around and give women beards."

252
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,000
 So that was a really interesting theory, I've never heard that before,

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
 so I'll give SROP credit for that.

254
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
 We don't know if it's true, it's just a theory,

255
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
 but it's an interesting way to look at it.

256
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,720
 They definitely have some sort of interdimensional properties.

257
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,760
 I've always thought of them not as aliens,

258
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,600
 in the sense that spacecraft, galactic federation, anything like that,

259
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
 or even aliens in the sense that they're explorers from another dimension,

260
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,920
 they almost just seem like we're seeing something, not of our reality,

261
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,960
 and they really don't care about us, one or the other.

262
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,800
 But as much as we love reading about SROP and paying 299 to find out that you can give a man boobs,

263
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,400
 that wasn't really the answer to Dan's question.

264
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,000
 He did not go "I'm afraid Shadow Man's gonna give me boobs, please help."

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
 That was not his question.

266
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,520
 He asked me specifically how can I get rid of him,

267
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,520
 but I still was looking for a way to talk about it on this show,

268
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,840
 in a way that we've never talked about Shadow People before.

269
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,360
 Brian, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

270
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
 We are headed out to a very dark place, ladies and gentlemen.

271
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,640
 This episode is gonna get real creepy, real quick.

272
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,440
 Carbonar copters flying over creepy place and real quick lane,

273
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,120
 we're flying over there, we know exactly where it's at, we've been here many times on this show.

274
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
 Brian, bring that carbonar copter down.

275
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 We are going to meet a young person named Screaming Bagel XXX.

276
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,840
 That's the user handle.

277
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,880
 Now Screaming Bagel XXX, I'm not for sure what the person's gender is.

278
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,920
 I, part of me thinks it's a girl, could be the two X's in the name.

279
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,440
 I don't know, doesn't X also mean kisses?

280
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
 But I mean Screaming Bagel, you just throw anyone off.

281
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,840
 But we're just, it doesn't really matter.

282
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,000
 I'm gonna refer to most of the people in this story.

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
 I know one of them, but we're gonna refer to all of them as women.

284
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,440
 Screaming Bagel XXX post on Reddit.

285
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,240
 Shadow Man in Intimate Dreams?

286
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
 Question mark.

287
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,640
 I'd been looking, Shadow Man, I'd been looking up Shadow Man information.

288
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,360
 This popped up.

289
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
 Shadow Man in Intimate Dreams.

290
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,480
 Screaming Bagel asks a question on Reddit.

291
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,840
 And they actually posted it in several different subreddits related to paranormal phenomenon.

292
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,600
 They posted it in paranormal, they posted it in dream interpretation,

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,280
 and they posted it in shadow people.

294
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,200
 And really the threads died off after two or three comments.

295
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,360
 No one else really wanted to talk about this.

296
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,920
 Screaming Bagel says, "I'm having issues with these dreams, nightmares.

297
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,520
 I don't really know how to describe them."

298
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
 Kind of mixed bag on them.

299
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,600
 "I have a dream and the Shadow Man has sex with me."

300
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,160
 And not only does the Shadow Man have sex with me, it becomes a wet dream.

301
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
 I actually orgasm while I'm sleeping.

302
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,240
 It's the only time I've ever orgasmed while I was sleeping was during the Shadow Man dream.

303
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,960
 It's interesting because someone responds to Screaming Bagel,

304
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,880
 but they deleted their responses.

305
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,240
 But we can see Screaming Bagel responding to their comments.

306
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,120
 Where she fills in more information as to what is actually going on.

307
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,240
 She says, "The Shadow Man will appear in her dreams, and it is a typical shadow figure.

308
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
 But the eyes in the mouth, which are normally completely invisible on shadow people,

309
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,520
 are there."

310
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,760
 Kind of.

311
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,280
 She said, "When you look at the eyes in the mouth, they're see-through."

312
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,320
 That's actually creepier than not having eyes or mouth at all.

313
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,480
 When the Shadow Man's approaching her, when she looks into the Shadow Man's eyes,

314
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,360
 she can see what's standing behind the entity.

315
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,680
 Same thing with the mouth.

316
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,760
 She says when the Shadow Man moves, it looks like a scribble.

317
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,040
 She said it actually looked like a swarm of something.

318
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,920
 If you had a bunch of gnats in a very, very close form the way they vibrate,

319
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,560
 that's the way it would appear as it was moving.

320
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,720
 Now neither of those match up to normal Shadow Man lore,

321
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,200
 but Shadow Man lore is you seeing them in real life and they don't do a ton of movement.

322
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,240
 They'll walk.

323
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,480
 But I've never had one really approach me with any intent, so I can't completely dismiss it.

324
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,400
 Also, the way that a Shadow Man appears in reality may be different the way

325
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
 than a Shadow Man appears in a dream.

326
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,960
 She said the Shadow Man will approach her and have sex with her.

327
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,520
 And she'll orgasm in her dream and she'll wake up.

328
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,800
 And she goes, "That's the problem.

329
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,160
 I don't want to have sex with the Shadow Man,

330
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,200
 but my body is having a physical reaction to it.

331
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,760
 Mentally, I'm tormented by it, but because the way it makes my body feel,

332
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,920
 I'm having a hard time dealing with this whole thing."

333
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,360
 Now this type of stuff is really out of the realm for paranormal researchers.

334
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,480
 So I can understand why these threads didn't really take off.

335
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,280
 People who are going in haunted houses looking for ghosts and stuff like that,

336
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,600
 these stories get far grimmer than that.

337
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
 Because what she's describing is sexual assault.

338
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,960
 It's unwanted.

339
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
 Whether or not her body is having a reaction to it is irrelevant.

340
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
 It's unwanted.

341
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,320
 To add something even creepier to this level, she says,

342
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,400
 "Sometimes the dream will start off, and I'm in a red room with no walls."

343
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,920
 That's a very, very creepy image, because where is the red coming from?

344
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,360
 She goes, "I'm in a void.

345
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,280
 There's a floor.

346
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,640
 There's a bed.

347
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,800
 The room is red, but nothing else.

348
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 It's just a void.

349
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 The Shadow Man approaches, and we have sex."

350
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,200
 That's creepy enough.

351
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,000
 That's creepy enough.

352
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,840
 She says, "Other times she'll be having a normal dream,

353
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,760
 hanging out with her friends, bungee jumping, capturing Donald Duck.

354
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,440
 And the Shadow Man will appear in that normal dream.

355
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,800
 And while everyone else is just reacting normally, it will approach her."

356
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
 So there's no safety for her.

357
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,200
 She could be having a normal dream, and then this dream interferes with that.

358
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,640
 She says that once the act begins, she doesn't really remember anything.

359
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,520
 She just knows that she orgasms when she wakes up.

360
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,720
 And she traces it back to an event that happened when her and her friend were

361
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,400
 staying at her grandmother's house, where they were experiencing

362
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,160
 poltergeist activity at this house.

363
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,320
 And one night she was there with her and her friend,

364
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
 and they saw a Shadow Man in the hallway of the grandma's house.

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,760
 One night she was laying on the couch, and she heard the sounds of a man stomping

366
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,400
 through the house, opening cabinets, even though there should be no adult male there.

367
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,880
 She tried to ignore it as best as she could.

368
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,560
 She was too scared to even look to see what it was.

369
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,640
 And it turned out there was no adult man in that house.

370
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,080
 She found out that the person who had constructed the house had died of a heart attack in the garden.

371
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,160
 It was a man who had built the house himself, but he eventually died in the garden connected to the house.

372
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:46,640
 So it's possible that this is a ghost of this man who's doing these things.

373
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,280
 Which would explain the discrepancies in the Shadow Man lore.

374
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,840
 It could be this man is presenting as a Shadow Man.

375
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
 It could be a Shadow Man, but again you have to look at the lore.

376
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
 What does the lore say?

377
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,120
 Well in this Reddit thread, even though they're all really short,

378
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,560
 somebody else does pop in.

379
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,520
 Hadasa11 says the same thing has happened to me.

380
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,800
 I have these dreams where the Shadow Man shows up, and we have sex.

381
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,160
 Both of these stories could be real life trauma that they've blocked out,

382
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,800
 and this is the way their mind is trying to process it.

383
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,240
 Which makes the story infinitely more sad and terrifying.

384
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,640
 But it could be a paranormal event, and neither-

385
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,840
 The first story that I read that's really not part of the Shadow Man lore,

386
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,040
 there's some discrepancies there, but having two of them makes these creatures far more menacing.

387
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,720
 Than just standing in your hallway as you're getting ready to go to bed,

388
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
 you see something out of the corner of your eye.

389
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,680
 Even seeing something hiding behind your couch and moving.

390
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,240
 That's creepier than simply seeing something motionless at the end of your hallway.

391
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,440
 Seeing something reacting to you gives it the thought process that

392
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,920
 it's trying to hide from you.

393
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,800
 The one at the end of your hallway doesn't care whether or not you see it,

394
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,680
 or you don't see it.

395
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,160
 The same way, human doesn't care if a duck sees it unless he's hunting ducks.

396
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,360
 But to give the Shadow Man a motive of sexual assault, sexual pleasure,

397
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,400
 turns it into a completely different phenomenon.

398
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,680
 But we have the Shadow Man assaulting these two girls.

399
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,840
 I do have another example that I don't really want to get into detail with,

400
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
 just because we're running out of time.

401
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,720
 And because the person who experienced it was using meth at the time.

402
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,360
 That's the problem.

403
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,040
 It's an interesting story.

404
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,600
 This woman, she claims that one night she's in bed after a meth binge,

405
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,880
 and she sees this is farther out of the Shadow Man lore,

406
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,920
 but I wanted to include it just because it does fit the narrative.

407
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,880
 She sees jet black tentacles appear underneath her bedsheets.

408
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 And something dark and cosmic.

409
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,880
 Something horrific begins to rape her for hours and hours and hours.

410
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,680
 She's assaulted by this dark tentacled void creature.

411
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,720
 And she was looking for help.

412
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,160
 And you know, that was an unfortunate story, obviously, for the experience.

413
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,520
 Whether or not it happened, whether or not any of these happened,

414
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,800
 they're definitely psychologically damaging.

415
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,000
 This woman, she posted this on May 8th, 2020, and she was smoking meth.

416
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
 She said that this went on and on.

417
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,000
 She posted this on the meth board, on the meth subreddit.

418
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
 And people just said, "Stop smoking meth."

419
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,800
 Now that absolutely could be the answer.

420
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,240
 That probably is the answer.

421
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
 She's probably having meth psychosis.

422
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,400
 But the scary thing is, is what if she wasn't?

423
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,640
 Like the whole idea of people who do meth, they see shadow people.

424
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,560
 Are they seeing them because they're up all night?

425
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,200
 Are they seeing them because they're an imital meth psychosis?

426
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
 Or are they real?

427
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
 And the meth psychosis allows them to see them.

428
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
 That's the big question, is it the chicken or the egg?

429
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,040
 She may have actually been assaulted by some sort of cosmic entity.

430
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,400
 I know we're really, really stretching credulity at this time.

431
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,600
 If it really happened to her, the fact that she was using meth at the time

432
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,440
 completely demolishes the narrative.

433
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,200
 I actually had that story researched and ready to go since May of last year.

434
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,040
 And I decided really to never cover it.

435
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,120
 I thought it was a little too dark.

436
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,200
 But as I was looking at this stuff, I said, well,

437
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
 it fits this.

438
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,560
 It fits this idea that the darkness, the shadow people,

439
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,480
 are far more malevolent than I gave them credit for.

440
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,880
 If you listen to my shadow people invasion episode

441
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,640
 and listen to this episode, you can tell my tone is different

442
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,080
 when talking about these things.

443
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
 So are these things sexual predators?

444
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,280
 We won't know the answer to that.

445
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,120
 But I know the question you guys are really wondering is Dan's question.

446
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
 How do you protect yourself from these things?

447
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,040
 Especially now.

448
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,080
 You got armies of them walking around trying to give you boobs.

449
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,240
 And then you got this far more gruesome story that I'm not cracking jokes about.

450
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
 How do you protect yourself from these things?

451
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,960
 Now, if you listen to my early episode, I don't,

452
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,400
 I want to sound like I'm pitching that episode.

453
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,920
 I just gave a lot of information on that.

454
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,920
 And then I gave more information on the episode entitled The Angel,

455
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,240
 which I'll put that in the show notes as well.

456
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,280
 There's a couple of ways to do it.

457
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,400
 The way I did it is not a way that I recommend people to do it,

458
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,520
 because I don't know what the long-term effects of it were.

459
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
 And that was, I know I say a lot of outlandish things,

460
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,840
 but usually they don't involve me.

461
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,120
 This is one of the most outlandish things I can say that involves me.

462
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,760
 I meditated.

463
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
 I used to be really into that type of stuff.

464
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,360
 I meditated and I tore out a piece of my own soul.

465
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,480
 You guys are really gonna want to listen to this whole episode,

466
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,440
 see if you haven't heard it.

467
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,680
 I tore out, in my mind, in my mind,

468
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,440
 that didn't rip off a piece of flesh.

469
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,560
 "A moth, pound of flesh!"

470
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,480
 In my meditation processes,

471
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,360
 I removed the small chunk of my soul and turned it into a soul blade.

472
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,320
 I don't want to say soul sword, because that's what magic uses.

473
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,720
 Ileana Resputin.

474
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,680
 But anyways, I basically craft,

475
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,760
 I basically turned a piece of my soul into a weapon that I could use externally.

476
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,120
 I know it sounds super exciting,

477
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,160
 it's not as exciting as I made it sound,

478
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,680
 but I don't know what the long-term ramifications of that act was.

479
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,000
 And it took me a long time,

480
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,280
 I used to really be into meditation and cleansing rituals and things like that.

481
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,480
 Cleansing my spaces, and I really steadied it,

482
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,920
 and I really worked hard on it.

483
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,520
 So for me, that was something I was willing to do,

484
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
 but that was the thing when Dan asked me,

485
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,760
 I go, "My first thing was cleansing rituals."

486
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
 And I was asking him,

487
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,720
 "What his experiences are with those things?"

488
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
 You can't do them if you don't know how to do them.

489
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
 Some people just get sage and smudge places,

490
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,520
 you put it around the corners of their house,

491
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
 but if you don't know what you're doing,

492
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,880
 you could be making things worse.

493
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,040
 So I don't recommend doing that,

494
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,600
 unless you want to put in all of the time and all of the self-practice

495
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
 to learn those skills.

496
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,200
 And again, even then,

497
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,880
 I don't know where the long-term ramifications are of me doing that act.

498
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
 But you can do, don't do that, don't do that.

499
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,080
 But you can do cleansing,

500
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
 this is what they recommend.

501
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,000
 I looked at a couple different sources,

502
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,920
 and this is pretty much what they recommend

503
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,240
 to take care of shadow people.

504
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,840
 My first thing would be to consult a member of your religious community.

505
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,960
 That would always be my first thing to do,

506
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,160
 because they're going to have more information on this than you are.

507
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
 But, or if you're not a member of a church,

508
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,160
 but you sway of a particular way,

509
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,680
 just consult them.

510
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,880
 You don't have to be a member of a church

511
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,800
 to call up like a priest or a cleric.

512
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
 You can say, "Hey, I'm having,

513
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,600
 I'm having these issues.

514
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
 I know I'm not a member here,

515
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,960
 but I'm having these issues.

516
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,840
 For the most part,

517
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,120
 they'll be willing to help you.

518
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,480
 That's kind of their job."

519
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,520
 So consult a member of your religious community

520
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,880
 would be my first thing.

521
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
 Make a phone call and say,

522
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,040
 "I'm having trouble here."

523
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,200
 Secondly, the cleansing ritual,

524
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
 and you can look them up online.

525
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,360
 They do talk about smudging places with sage.

526
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,000
 For that,

527
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
 the any instructions I give you in this podcast

528
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,640
 are not going to be sufficient.

529
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,160
 You can look at the show notes,

530
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,360
 but I would specifically look at cleansing rituals,

531
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,240
 in-depth rituals on how to cleanse an area.

532
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,480
 They're not super elaborate,

533
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
 but it is how you smudge,

534
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,600
 where to smudge,

535
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
 what time of day to smudge,

536
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,680
 and all of that.

537
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,680
 They also make an interesting thing

538
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
 involving the shadow people,

539
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,840
 as opposed to other entities.

540
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,120
 You need to completely declutter your environment.

541
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
 So it's not enough of just

542
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,840
 moving white sage all over your area.

543
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,800
 You got to clean up.

544
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,400
 You got to clean your room.

545
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,720
 I know everyone says they sound like Jordan Peterson.

546
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,960
 You got to clean your room is what you need to do.

547
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
 For two reasons.

548
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,160
 One, a decluttered space is a decluttered mind.

549
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,840
 And two,

550
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,400
 this interesting just a little bit of science here,

551
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,680
 you're physically eliminating shadows from the area.

552
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,800
 You got to declutter the environment physically,

553
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,120
 as well as spiritually.

554
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,240
 And very important,

555
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
 and this again is why you would be good

556
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,840
 consulting a religious leader.

557
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,600
 You got to cleanse yourself spiritually.

558
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,280
 Banish out those dark thoughts.

559
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,600
 You can still enjoy dark content.

560
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,240
 You can still enjoy ghost stories and watch horror movies.

561
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
 But like we've talked about on this show as well,

562
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,320
 intrusive thoughts, unwanted thoughts.

563
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,000
 You want to release those out of your system as well.

564
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
 Because that may be what's attracting the shadow people

565
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240
 in the first place.

566
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,280
 It's okay again,

567
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,560
 because I always like to say this,

568
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,320
 because people enjoy dark content.

569
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
 It's okay to read ghost stories

570
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,600
 and true crime stories and things like that.

571
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,360
 It's okay to think about those stories,

572
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
 but when you dwell on them,

573
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,320
 when it goes from beyond a spooky story

574
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,640
 to a story you can't get out of your head,

575
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,040
 a story that is consuming you,

576
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,400
 you're no longer enjoying it,

577
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,000
 you're a prisoner to it.

578
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,960
 That's the difference.

579
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,760
 You got to purge all that stuff out.

580
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,800
 So it's not easy.

581
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,640
 And that might be the hardest step of all,

582
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,280
 is to purge the darkness out of ourselves.

583
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,320
 But cleanse your environment spiritually,

584
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,840
 cleanse your environment physically,

585
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,000
 and then cleanse yourself.

586
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,280
 We all know the bad habits we have.

587
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,120
 And dark entities are attracted to bad habits.

588
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
 I've given you a little bit of hope,

589
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,800
 but to end this episode off,

590
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,320
 I'm going to have to snatch it away.

591
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,920
 S. Rob, the powerful wizard,

592
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,240
 has another theory involving shadow people.

593
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,440
 He said that because shadow people are citizens of hell,

594
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,960
 but not actual demons,

595
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,800
 they are not beholden to exorcisms.

596
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,200
 A demon cannot stand up to the word of God.

597
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,800
 But a cat could, a duck could.

598
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,240
 You could read Holy Scripture all day long to a gorilla.

599
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,520
 He's still going to pick his nose.

600
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,240
 But a demon is commanded by those texts.

601
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,960
 A shadow man is not.

602
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,880
 However, S. Rob's theory is that a shadow man

603
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
 are also very savvy,

604
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,640
 even though exorcisms don't command them to leave.

605
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,240
 They leave anyways.

606
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,160
 Or at least they pretend to.

607
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,600
 They disappear back into the darkness.

608
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,640
 The family once again thinks they are back to normal.

609
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,160
 The house is at peace.

610
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,920
 But the shadow man still lurks there in the darkness.

611
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,160
 Waiting, biting its time,

612
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,240
 watching the family from the corner of the room

613
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,920
 underneath the table,

614
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,080
 watching them smile and laugh,

615
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,000
 watching them enjoy each other's company.

616
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,680
 And slowly from the corner of the room,

617
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,960
 drain that energy from them.

618
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,200
 Appears at the foot of their bed,

619
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,720
 stands behind them in the shower,

620
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,520
 crawls through the cabinets

621
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,600
 late at night when you're looking for a snack.

622
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,120
 It's always there.

623
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
 It just pretended to leave.

624
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,640
 If S. Rob's theory is correct,

625
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,320
 could Sage stop one of these things?

626
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,920
 Could mental cleansing stop one of these things?

627
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,680
 Or does it just appear to delay the inevitable?

628
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,400
 Does it just seem to stop the shadow man in this moment?

629
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,200
 But really he is just waiting.

630
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,120
 Because you felt empowered when you did those things.

631
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,640
 And it needs to attack you at your weakest.

632
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
 The shadow man is always watching.

633
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,600
 And when the time is right,

634
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,960
 is when you will see him at the end of your hallway once more.

635
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,720
 No, I'm just kidding. We totally beat him up.

636
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,160
 Please don't leave me with shadow man.

637
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,600
 You hold him on and punch him in the stomach.

638
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,280
 I'm not going to give this guy a win.

639
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,080
 I'm going to take away.

640
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
 I'm not giving this guy any hope.

641
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,560
 You hold him on and punch him in the stomach.

642
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,960
 We'll take turns getting him giving little noogies.

643
