1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And otherwise happy family has to deal with a haunting noise echoing through their house.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we travel to Oklahoma to meet two men out on a mission.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 As feral hogs are tearing up the landscape, these two men are sent out to end the menace.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 However, they quickly realize there is something much more fierce in those woods.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Something they can't explain.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Robert Reif.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Woohoo! Yeah, walk on in buddy! Come on in!

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Come on into Dead Rabbit Command. I don't know why I sound like some hillbilly.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 People are like, "I don't want to come into your Dead Rabbit Command. What is that? A shack?"

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Robert, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That helps out so much.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Robert, I'm going to go ahead and give you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Drive us all the way out to a house in the suburbs.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 This story, we don't have an exact location. We don't have an exact time period.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It was posted online by someone using the handle carelessevent8675.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 We're going to go ahead and call her Becky.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Becky says, "Listen, life is pretty good."

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Not to brag, not to brag, but life is going pretty good for me and my family.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And it's quite the big family. You have me, Becky.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 There you have her husband and then five kids aged 13 to 1.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 So, there's a lot of people.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And on top of that, literally on top of the one year old every time that baby goes to sleep, are two Siamese cats.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 The saga that Becky lays out is for the past three or four months,

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 her and her husband have been hearing this very...

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 On the other hand, it's an extremely bizarre noise.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And on the other hand, it's something you would expect to hear once in a while in a family of seven.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 She says, "It usually happens between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. So this is a late night phenomenon."

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 She says, "Me and my husband will be up watching television. All of our kids are asleep or at the very least in their rooms."

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And she wrote this out, it was really interesting. She knew people were going to be like, "Maybe it's this. Maybe it's this."

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And she wrote it out like, "This is the reason why it's not that. This is the reason why it's not that."

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 She goes, "What will happen is Becky and her husband will be out on the couch watching television.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And this only happens late at night. It doesn't happen during the day."

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 All of a sudden, they begin to hear the sound of somebody crying.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And she says, "Not only is it the sound of someone crying, it is the sound of sobbing, echoing through the house."

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, every single time it happens, because they have five children, one or both of the parents would get up and go to the kids' rooms to see what it is,

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 because you hear someone crying. And again, it's that painful sobbing noise.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And they would check on all the kids, and the kids would either be asleep, or the older ones, the 13-year-old, maybe kind of trying to stay up late or whatever.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 But it wouldn't be them. It was never them crying, and then Becky and her husband would go back down to the living room, and a couple of nights will pass,

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 and then they'll hear that deep, mournful sobbing, and it's so loud.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And so worrisome that each time Becky and her husband would get up to check.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Now, the kids in their rooms could not hear this noise, and I think that's the first thing that was starting to clue the parents off that this may not be a natural phenomenon.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Obviously, if your little brother is sobbing in his room, everyone would hear that, especially the people whose rooms are next to him.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But only the parents were hearing it. And she goes, "Listen, again, to clear all debunking possible."

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 She goes, "It's not the children. We know it's not the kids. There's no TVs in their room, so it's not like they're watching the crying channel."

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 When we go in and check, their tablets are all off, so it's not like some YouTube video on a loop.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And she says, "There are no baby monitors in the house, so we're not getting interference from other...

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Like, maybe there's a baby in the house next door." And it's crying all the time, super loud, super loud.

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 No, we're not getting any interference from baby monitors, all the technology in their rooms.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 We know it's not our television, because we're watching a show, and then the house is echoing with the sobbing.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And she goes, "Listen, I know, because I have two Siamese cats, that Siamese cats, when they cry, can sound human."

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I'm gonna have to... I should fact check that. I should watch some YouTube videos of cats screeching. Siamese cats screeching.

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 She goes, "I know Siamese cats can sometimes sound like they're human. However, we know it's not the cats, because the cats are either in the living room with us when the noise happens,

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 or they're sleeping in the kitchen." I guess there's like a heating vent over there.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So she goes, "It's not coming from the kitchen, and that's where the cats are. And it's... when the cats are with us, we know it's not them."

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 So she says this crying when it happens. And she says it doesn't happen every night, but she says once or twice a week, which is pretty...

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I mean, again, every time you hear this, you have to check on the kids. You have to make sure that it's not them.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 While the children never hear it in the rooms, there is one time that our 13-year-old heard it.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 The 13-year-old was staying up late with them one night. I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, but the 13-year-old is up one night with the parents in the living room late after 10.

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And that is when all three of them heard the loud sobbing coming from somewhere in the house.

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 When the 13-year-old is in bed, though, when the 13-year-old is in the bedroom, they can't hear it at all.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Every other single time this has happened, none of the children hear it until one of the older ones was in the living room with the parents.

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And Becky goes, "It's actually..." She goes, "Now..." It didn't start off this way, but now we're starting to hear this.

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 She's making it extra terrifying, right? It's already the sound of someone crying from somewhere in the house.

71
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Becky says, "Sometimes we'll hear the door to my daughter's bedroom opening and closing while this crying is going on."

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 An interesting phenomenon, but it gets even creepier, because while a phantom deeply sobbing in your house would be unsettling at least,

73
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 it gets creepier than that. Becky says this all started... So this has been going on, like she said, for about three or four months.

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 There was actually a phenomenon that manifested three years ago, and then there was nothing until the past three or four months where they have this crying from somewhere inside the house.

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 She said three years ago, Becky was at home with her daughter, who was two at the time, and this might be the same daughter whose bedroom door is opening.

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 She didn't specify that, but she said, "I don't know if she has all boys and just the one girl," but Becky said at this particular moment three years ago,

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 she was at home alone with her daughter, who was only two at the time, when all of a sudden, both of them heard this, all of a sudden,

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 they both heard what sounded like a child crying very loudly, but she describes it in a very interesting way.

79
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Let me read this to you. She goes, "We both heard the sudden and extremely loud sound of what I can only describe as something or someone pretending,"

80
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 this is super interesting, "something or someone pretending to cry like a baby."

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I know that sounds weird, but it's the only way I can describe it. Imagine a grown adult almost mockingly pretending to cry like a newborn.

82
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 That's what it sounded like,"

83
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So she didn't hear the sound like a baby crying.

84
00:09:41,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 She heard a boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-

85
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Mockingly sounding like a baby crying, she took her daughter and she left. She's like, "I'm not being in this house."

86
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 She left and she said, "For the next couple of days, I refused, refused to be on that house without my husband. I was terrified of her own home.

87
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I refused to be there."

88
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 There is a sinisterness to it, the fact that this thing was trying to, and first off, failing to perfectly imitate a human child crying, getting in that mocking fashion,

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 but over time, it's like it learned how to do it.

90
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Remember the first time it scared Becky out of the house? That was the first thing that happened.

91
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But now, it is so perfect a mimic, right? It so perfectly sounds like a child crying, that now, once or twice a week, they check on their kids,

92
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 but they know that this phenomenon is happening over and over again, right?

93
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 They know that there's something weird going on in the house. It sounds so perfect to a child crying, they have to check.

94
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's creepy. It's a really interesting story, right?

95
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 We have this, I mean, I guess we're attaching a level of sinisterness to it, but what else could it be?

96
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 You figured if it was a ghost of a child crying, then it would just be, they would have gotten it right the first time, right?

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Because it's a ghost, the children know how to cry, and then, unfortunately, one of the worst sentences you can say, a child dies,

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 its ghost would also know how to perfectly cry, but this is something else.

99
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It's really interesting. It's almost like it's making the crying noises, and it's testing the parents, and at one point, they'll go,

100
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 "There's the crying again. Let's not check on the kids. We know it's none of the kids we've checked every single time.

101
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 We won't check tonight. We'll just let the sound fade out."

102
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 What happens then? What happens when they get tired of getting up each time they hear the crying noise, and they decide to not check on their children?

103
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 What happens then?

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 It's an interesting story. I really, really am glad that I came across it, and thank you, CarolusEvent8675, for posting that on the internet.

105
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It's a really creepy one. Robert Rice. Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world-famous Carbindercopter.

106
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 We are saying goodbye to this family, and they're two same-ies cats. We pet them a little bit before we leave. The cat's not the family.

107
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Take us up, up, and away from this haunted house, and Robert fly us all the way out to Oklahoma.

108
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 [imitates cat's sound]

109
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Specifically, this is really cool because unlike the last story, and unlike a lot of stories we cover on this show, we have a very specific location for this.

110
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 In Oklahoma, we're headed out to West Cache Creek. It is over by the North Red River.

111
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And I'll say this, you know the story takes place in the middle of nowhere, where we are given no cities or towns for reference.

112
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 We're basically like, "Go to the creek! Go to the creek, son!" That's where this story took place.

113
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 We really are out in the middle of nowhere for this story, but we do know it takes place nearby West Cache Creek, just north of the Red River.

114
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 This story was posted anonymously, but we're going to go ahead and call the person who's posting the story, Toby.

115
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Toby is a rancher up in Oklahoma, and he gets a call from his neighbor/rancher, Bruce.

116
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And Bruce goes, "Hey, Toby, I got a bit of a problem here. We got to go feral hog hunting."

117
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 That actually sounds fun. That sounds super fun. That's not a problem, Bruce.

118
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 If anything, it sounds like an opportunity to shoot monsters, right? What could be more monstrous than a feral hog?

119
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 "Toby, they're destroying my field. These feral hogs keep coming out of my property. They're tearing everything up. We got to take care of these things."

120
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Now, in Oklahoma, apparently it's not only legal to hunt feral hogs, it's encouraged, because these guys are a menace, right?

121
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 They're feral. If they were tame hogs, you could ride them around your farm and say, "Gitty up!"

122
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But if they're not, they got big old tusks and stuff like that.

123
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 If you're imagining porky pig, you're wrong. It's imagine porky pig with tusks on all fours, and he's not wearing a jacket, and he's trying to kill you.

124
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 That's a feral hog. And they're like, "Jason, I have no point in the story that I imagined porky pig."

125
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Or that these things were nice at all. They're called feral hogs.

126
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Anyways, Toby and Bruce, they grab their infrared scopes. They got their rifles ready.

127
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 They're about to have a really fun night hunting monsters in the woods.

128
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Now, again, to show how remote this is, Bruce and Toby are neighbors.

129
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Toby loads up his ATV into his car and drives 40 miles away is where his neighbor is.

130
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 He drives 40 miles away to get to Bruce's house, and he's like, "Hey, Bruce, you ready to go shoot a living creature in the brain?"

131
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And Bruce is like, "Yeah, you had me at brain. Yes, let's go hunt down these feral hogs."

132
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 So they get out their rifles, they got their thermal scopes, and they get on an ATV.

133
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 [imitates gunfire]

134
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 They're driving off towards a nearby wooded area. That's where they believe that these feral hogs are going to be hanging out.

135
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It's nighttime because that's when feral hogs are most active. They drive out towards West Cache Creek,

136
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 and then they shut off the ATV, and now it's time to go on foot. So they're walking along the creek,

137
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 and they walk quite a good distance, and then they take up positions behind a fallen log,

138
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 and they just sat there in the darkness. They're just waiting for something to show up.

139
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Something hog-like. [laughs]

140
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 He's like, "What? I'm in the real world! I want to be late for the space jam!"

141
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 They're looking for not animated characters or just any movement whatsoever.

142
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 They're not blowing everything away. They're waiting for the telltale signs of a feral hog,

143
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 probably winking would be one of those signs wearing a jacket.

144
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They're waiting there, and Toby goes, "We are there for about 30 minutes, just chilling."

145
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 They're probably talking about hog-related stuff. I don't know how hot dogs are made.

146
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Anyways, suddenly the calm night is shattered. Shattered by screaming.

147
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 [screaming]

148
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 That's not the exact voice that they heard. It's not an audio file that was sent over by Toby.

149
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They hear the screaming, but it doesn't sound like a hog. They can't really place it.

150
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 At first they think cougar. The noise that this was making was so deep and guttural,

151
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 they figured it might be a cougar. And then when they begin hearing a hog squealing,

152
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 [mimics hog squealing]

153
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 this hog squealing just to the right of them, they go, "Oh, we might be watching a clash of the Titans."

154
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 A cougar may be attacking a feral hog right now. Who will win?

155
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I mean, we will in the end, we both have guns and thermal scopes.

156
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 We're going to blow one or both of these animals away.

157
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 But it'll be interesting to watch a cougar attack a feral hog.

158
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Toby says he looks through the thermal scopes attached to the rifle.

159
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He lifts his rifle up, and he's now looking through the thermal scope to where he hears the noise.

160
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And what he sees is no cougar.

161
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 He sees a hog. He surely sees a feral hog under attack, it squealing, echoing through the wilderness.

162
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But then he sees what he can only gauge, right? He's looking through this thermal scope.

163
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 He goes, "I see what most people would describe as a werewolf."

164
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 "I'm not going to call it a werewolf," Toby says. "I'm not going to call it a werewolf."

165
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Because I'm a grown adult living in modern times America.

166
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 The term often used, the werewolf sounds so childish, the term often used, and I found this on Phantomsandmonsters.com.

167
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Again, guys, it's a great website. I know I've been talking a lot about them.

168
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 They haven't bought advertising space on the podcast. I just really love them.

169
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 We've been covering a lot of their stuff lately. It's a really good website.

170
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The term usually used today is dogman, or dogman.

171
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But it's basically a werewolf.

172
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 What I'm looking at is an 8-10 foot tall dogman.

173
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 I'm not a series of books your kids are reading. It's basically this fear.

174
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It's a werewolf. It's this 8-10 foot tall werewolf. It's standing on two legs.

175
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 It's covered in head to toe with hair or fur.

176
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 It looks like a human or a bigfoot, really, except its head is that of a dog or a wolf.

177
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 It has a very dog-like snout. This one also had a pretty long beard.

178
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 This is a pretty heavy metal-looking monster.

179
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 When you're reading an article about it, when you would be standing there,

180
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 really the only protection between them and this hog-attacking monster.

181
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Remember, they're just hiding behind a fallen tree.

182
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 He looks over and sees this 8-10 foot tall beast fighting with this hog.

183
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And fighting is a bit of an understatement.

184
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 The wolf man has this hog and he goes, "Listen, this thing has to be at least 250 pounds, at least, the hog."

185
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 He goes, "I watched this wolf man pick up this feral pig and it was squealing."

186
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 It was squealing in the grasp of this werewolf and he's just holding it there.

187
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And then, with barely a care in the world, with almost no effort required,

188
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 this giant monstrosity standing in the darkness ripped the hog into.

189
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Steaming piles of hog guts falling on the ground.

190
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I'm seeing it all through my thermal. I saw exactly how warm the guts were.

191
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 He ripped this hog in half and then threw both pieces onto the ground.

192
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And then, the dog man towering over everything else in the area turns

193
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 and begins to walk towards Toby and Bruce.

194
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Toby had his rifle ready. He's looking through the thermal scope and he's seeing this creature

195
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 and it's walking towards them, but he couldn't pull the trigger.

196
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I couldn't pull the trigger. I wanted to. I was thinking about it.

197
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 But I physically couldn't move my finger and fire a shot.

198
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 He just couldn't do it. It was like he was frozen.

199
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Just then, he set a massive log.

200
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 He estimated at about 30 feet long, which is huge, right?

201
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 At that point it's not a log, it's just a fallen tree.

202
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 A 30 foot long fallen tree comes flying towards them.

203
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 He goes, "This thing was so huge. It was about 30 feet long, maybe 3 feet thick."

204
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 It's flying right towards them and it flies right over Toby and Bruce's heads.

205
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 At that point, Toby took off running and Bruce took off after him.

206
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 There's no words given. There's no "On the count of three, let's run for the ATV."

207
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Toby just felt it and he just took off running and Bruce was right behind him.

208
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 They get on the ATV, they peel out and speed off from the sighting of this creature.

209
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 He said, "Man, we were going so fast. We were going 60 miles an hour."

210
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Which was the top speed that he could go on this thing.

211
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And when we got to Bruce's house, which was quite a ways away, right?

212
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It wasn't the 40 miles, but it was far away from where they went

213
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 because it took them a while to get there on the ATV.

214
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 He goes, "We were going so fast on the ATV and when we got to Bruce's house,

215
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 we didn't even stop to open up the gate to the pasture."

216
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 We just ran right through it. We were so terrified that whatever was out there was chasing us.

217
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 We smashed through the gate and he goes, "Listen guys, if you don't believe this story yet,

218
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 it gets even weirder."

219
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Because he said, "What happened was we smashed through the gate,"

220
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 which was not, they knew that was not a smart thing to do.

221
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 They smashed through the gate. The ATV hits a ditch.

222
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 It goes airborne. The ATV and both men are holding on.

223
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 The ATV goes airborne, starts to roll, starts to do a front roll.

224
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And then Toby says the next thing I remember is the ATV is on all four wheels.

225
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It landed perfectly. It's sitting completely still.

226
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Both me and Bruce are completely unharmed.

227
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And we are right next to my truck.

228
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 He goes, "That was absolutely impossible. When we started flipping, I realized we were both dead."

229
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Bruce's wife is going to come out.

230
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 I was fine. Two people crushed by an ATV. The gate smashed open and no one would have any idea what we saw out there.

231
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 No one would have any idea why we were running away so quickly.

232
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 We smashed through the gate because we were both dead, right?

233
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 You would find two people crushed by an ATV in your front yard.

234
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 You're like, "Ah, you wouldn't think this must be the work of the wolf man.

235
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 They must have seen one of those werewolves in the wilderness."

236
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 No, there's just two dead people in your front yard.

237
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 He goes, "But that didn't happen."

238
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 The ATV, and I don't remember landing it. I don't remember not having my head smeared across the ground.

239
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I don't remember anything. I just remember us doing a front roll.

240
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And then we stopped. We just stopped. We're perfectly stopped there on all four wheels.

241
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I can't figure that out. And that's not even the weirdest part of the story.

242
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So we already have a werewolf man ripping a hog into.

243
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 We have an insane and some would say impossible stunt done in the middle of the night on an ATV and nobody got killed.

244
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 We both have no idea what in the world happened, not just with the werewolf, the dogman, but with this.

245
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 When they come into the house, when they go to Bruce's house, Bruce's wife, she sees them.

246
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 They're all just completely shaken up by the events.

247
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 But one of her first questions was, "Where are your guys' guns?"

248
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And that's when Toby realized, "Oh, what? We left the guns there."

249
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Like, it was so terrifying what was going on that we actually dropped our guns and ran, which is completely uncharacteristic for really any hunter,

250
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 especially if they think they're going to be pursued.

251
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I mean, if you're going through like really tight branches, you may not want to have a long, barreled rifle you're fighting through,

252
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 but over the most part, you take your guns.

253
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 They didn't even remember losing their guns.

254
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 They had no memory.

255
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 They had no memory of dropping their guns there.

256
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And when Bruce's wife said that, "Where are your guns?"

257
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Toby goes, "It can keep the guns."

258
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 We are not going back.

259
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 We'll go to Walmart and buy brand new rifles tomorrow.

260
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 There is no way we're going back out there tonight.

261
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 There's zero possibility I don't care what's out there.

262
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 We're not going back out there.

263
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Well, Bruce is safely home.

264
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Remember, Toby lives 40 miles away.

265
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Toby is like, "Oh, man, I have to drive back to my house at night by myself."

266
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So he gets in his truck, heads home.

267
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 He drives the 40 miles.

268
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He gets to his house, parks the car, hops out.

269
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 And as he's walking to his front door, he sees sitting there on the ground, his rifle.

270
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 That's a crazy story.

271
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 It's one of those stories, right, that if it's true, this was a real experience,

272
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 it ranks up with one of the weirdest stories that you can come across.

273
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 There are so many different things happening in the story.

274
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 If it's fake, I apologize for wasting your time.

275
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 It's an interesting story, but I just don't like telling fake stories on here.

276
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 It's almost too good to be true because there's so much amazing stuff going on here.

277
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And it's one of those stories we'll never really know whether or not it's fake or true

278
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 because the people who told it, it was told anonymously, right?

279
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And then it was published on Phantoms and Monsters.

280
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 But man, what an insane story because we do have three big different elements going on here.

281
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 We have a werewolf, right?

282
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 We have a werewolf story, which we don't cover a lot on this show,

283
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 not because they aren't cool, but because they're barely rare.

284
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 I do come across dogman sightings from time to time, but they're basically like,

285
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 they're the equivalent to a Bigfoot story, right?

286
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I was in the middle of the woods, I saw a dog walking on two lakes through the woods,

287
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 and then it walked away.

288
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Even those are rare.

289
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 So we have a werewolf ripping a hog in half right there that's interesting.

290
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And then we have the story of this, which this, the story of the ATV accident in and of itself is interesting.

291
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 We've covered stories like that before as well.

292
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 These guys, they should be dead.

293
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 They should have been killed in this ATV accident.

294
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And remember, he doesn't remember it.

295
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 He goes, "We went airborne. I start to notice we're rolling,

296
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 and the next thing, the ATV is perfectly sitting right next to his truck, and they're still on it."

297
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 He doesn't remember anything after the front roll, which I imagine,

298
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 of all the different ways that an ATV can roll, they're all dangerous, but a front roll,

299
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 he's in the top four directions that you can roll, that would probably kill you on an ATV.

300
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And it's not like he remembers it coming to a stop, or they, all their heads nearly touch the ground.

301
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 No, he doesn't remember what happened.

302
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 That in and of itself, we would classify as a quantum immortality story,

303
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 an accident that should have killed two people, not only did not kill them,

304
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 but then just had some odd factor to it.

305
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It just didn't happen.

306
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Like, basically, like, it didn't happen at all.

307
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 The ATV had perfectly come to a stop, and they don't remember it.

308
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 They don't remember stopping.

309
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 They just remember it being stopped.

310
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And he does say, he goes, "I have a feeling that something unnatural saved our lives."

311
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Like, he goes after this, he goes, "I did not go out."

312
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I still don't.

313
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 I do not go out after dark unless I absolutely have to.

314
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And he goes, "I've never been back to that creek or that river ever."

315
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 But when he thanks back to the flip, it's so funny because you have both of those things happening.

316
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Two unbelievable things.

317
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 You have a quantum immortality event where you should have died,

318
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 but then reality switched, and now you and your buddy are alive.

319
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And then you have a werewolf showing up.

320
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And then, on top of that, you have the werewolf attack.

321
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 You have the ATV accident/quantum immortality story.

322
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And then you have the fact that whatever this beast was in the woods that could pick up

323
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 a 30-foot tree and throw it at you, knows where you live.

324
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Right?

325
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 He knows where you live.

326
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 He doesn't make a mention that Bruce got his gun very politely dropped off at his house.

327
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 It's almost like whatever this creature was wanted Toby to know,

328
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 he knew where he lived in a fairly subtle way.

329
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Like a mafioso's threat, right?

330
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 The wolf man could have easily been waiting at the house for him,

331
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 or Toby gets home and his entire family's been gutted by this beast,

332
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 and then the creature hops out of the closet and goes, "Miss me now?"

333
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 You know what I mean?

334
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 It's not like he showed up and there were giant claw marks on his door,

335
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 or his kids, all their guts had been ripped open and the wolf's like, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

336
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 but it got home before he did.

337
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It's a fascinating story, really.

338
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 It's the fascinating story of two men with modern hunting equipment,

339
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 state of the art, almost, you know, science fiction, being able to see in the dark.

340
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 They're out to track down a feral hog,

341
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 but instead they find themselves in the crosshair of a beast long rumored to just be a fable.

342
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 A half-man, half-wolf creature living on the outskirts of society,

343
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 with the strength of a dozen men, and it knows where you live.

344
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Terrifying, terrifying story.

345
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 I love this one.

346
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
