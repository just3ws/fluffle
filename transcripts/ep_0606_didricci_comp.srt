1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 As the Ethiopian Civil War continues to ravage that country, refugees are trying to escape the

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,080
 violence. But what happens when those refugees end up at the church that holds the Ark of the Covenant?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,880
 And then we travel to Prussia to take a look at the story of a man, a captain in the Prussian

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,960
 military who was accused of stealing a ring. After he is sentenced to 40 years, he does the

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,440
 only sensible thing, turn into mist and float away. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:44,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,280
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Sometimes I'm even stunned

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,320
 at how ridiculous these stories sound. Speaking of ridiculous, it's ridiculous how much you guys

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,200
 support this show. And speaking of supporters, two segues for one. Coming into Dead Rabbit

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,280
 Man right now, we have Ryder Blue. Everyone give a round of applause to Ryder Blue. Ryder is currently

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,480
 riding a white horse. Pegasus, we didn't know it. We didn't know it. The wings were folded up.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,160
 Ryder, thank you so much for supporting the show. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,400
 episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
 the show. Really, really helps out a lot. So Ryder, dismount that horse. We're going to put you

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,160
 in a much, much better vehicle than that. The Jason Jalopy. It is cooler. You don't have to feed it.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,280
 You got to put gas in it. It doesn't poop though. I don't know if Pegasus poop actually, but it's

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
 still better. It's still better. It's an old-timey chitty-chitty bing-bing car. It can fly too. We

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
 don't use that option much, but it can fly. Ryder, I'm tossing you your own set of keys so the Jason

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,160
 Jalopy, ah-ah, hit that old-timey horn. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,720
 out to Ethiopia. So we're going to use our flying thing and it has like the two umbrellas that go,

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
 "Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo." People are like, "Jason, no, never watch chitty-chitty bing-bing,

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,120
 you big weirdo." Anyways, flying car. It's an old car. Ryder doesn't even know how to pilot it.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,920
 He thought he was just going to drive it around. We're headed out to Ethiopia. This story was

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,280
 recommended to me by Gray of PTA via Twitter. So really, really appreciate it, Gray. We wave to

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
 him. He's in a little life raft in the ocean. We don't stop to save him, but we wave to him as we

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,560
 fly over the ocean. Ryder is now driving us through Ethiopia. Guys, put on your helmets. Put on

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
 your, put on more than your helmets. Put on your full body armor, your mech suit, because there's

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,240
 currently a civil war going on in Ethiopia. This story just happened. This story just happened

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,200
 January 2021. We're driving through Ethiopia and you have the Tigray People's Liberation Front

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,400
 versus the Ethiopian government. And the Ethiopian government to kind of show up their defenses

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,520
 has started recruiting local militia groups as well. Never really goes well when you do that,

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,680
 because you'll have like a dedicated team of people who are like professional soldiers and

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,440
 then a bunch of hillbillies. Then a bunch of hillbillies. We're like, "We love to shoot stuff.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,080
 We shoot stuff on the weekends. So why don't we join up?" Now, I know like, you know, militias can

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
 be good like with the American Revolution and things like that, but you got to be careful,

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,480
 because the militias are all going to have their own end goal. So that's what's going on right now.

37
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,360
 Basically, there's a civil war or insurrection, depending on what side you're on. This has been

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,640
 going on since November 2020. So it's fairly a new war. Now, you have the people who are fighting the

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,960
 war and you have the hillbillies who are running around, being like, "Yee-haw!" And then you have

40
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,200
 the people who just like live in a normal life. They just want to put a chicken in their pot and

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,360
 have a car in their garage and there's this war popping off. So they're like, "I'm out." You have

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,000
 tens of thousands of refugees leaving these areas as these combatants are moving in. One day,

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,840
 a thousand of these refugees end up at the Church of St. Mary of Zion. Now, it's actually a complex.

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,680
 There's quite a few buildings here, but it's this complex that's in Ethiopia. It's a church.

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,280
 But this church is known, we actually covered this on the show a long time ago, this church is known

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:11,440
 as possibly holding the Ark of the Covenant, aka the biblical super weapon, aka the pot device in

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,600
 Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's basically a box with these huge wooden sticks through it. You're

48
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,240
 like, "Jeez, please don't describe the Ark of the Covenant." Because I know you're going to watch it.

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,400
 It's this box that has like two angels on it. I'm actually describing the prop from

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,920
 Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I've seen drawings of it too. I've never seen the real thing. It's this

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,720
 big box. Apparently, the Jews were like, when they were getting beat up back in old time days,

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
 they carried this box with them. And every so often, they'd open it up and a bunch of people

53
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
 would die. And I think they used it and a wall fell down, although that may have been a guy

54
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,920
 playing a horn. A guy on a horn made a fault with a wall. It's been a long time since I've been a

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,720
 church, but I think they were like knocking over buildings with it and they're killing people

56
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,600
 with it. You might as well do that episode. Don't do it. Don't just gloss over the biblical super

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,440
 weapon. I think you guys are all familiar with the Ark of the Covenant. And apparently,

58
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,880
 if you touch it with your bare hands, you drop dead. It's in the Bible that this isn't an apocryphal

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,200
 story like the Book of the Giants or anything like that. Like this is a plot device in the Bible.

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,360
 And some people have said maybe it's some sort of UFO. They're not actually carrying a flying

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
 saucer, but maybe it's some sort of UFO technology. Some people say it's radioactive, and that's why

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
 if you touch it, you die. But that doesn't make sense because radiation doesn't stop when you put

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,720
 wood in pulse through it. Apparently, you have to have the wood in pulse through it to carry it.

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
 But you can't open it. You can't touch it. It'll kill you on the spot if you open it.

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,960
 Your enemies will die, but you won't die. It's kind of a cool concept. But there's always been

66
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,040
 this thing of where has it been? Why can't Indian Jones find it? Will he find it before the Nazis do?

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,160
 And so there's been different locations of where the Ark may have ended up,

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,080
 because in the Bible, I don't think they ever state that it was destroyed. So who knows,

69
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,920
 but one of the claimed spots of it is the Church of St. Mary of Zion. And you have this religious

70
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,560
 compound, for lack of a better term, and one of the buildings in it has the Ark, and only one

71
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,480
 person can really deal with the Ark, and he can never leave the building. I mean, I don't think

72
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,840
 he can never leave the building. He can never leave the compound. He's not like, "Help, help,

73
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,440
 let me out." The Ark sneaking up behind it with the dagger. I think he can leave the building,

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,080
 but he can't leave the religious compound. He can't go out and get snacks, and then go back to

75
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,200
 it. Guys, what I miss is the Ark has opened up a bunch of school kids, pushed it open on a dare.

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:42,800
 Anyways, it's a super weapon. If this is actually the location of the Ark, and there is, like I

77
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,880
 did discuss in an earlier episode, there is a reason why people think it could have been there,

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,320
 because a lot of stuff was shuffled out of the Middle East into Africa. So it may be there.

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,880
 It may be there. We don't know. We're not the one guy. You have to be the one guy to know the truth.

80
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,160
 That's the perfect way to keep everything hidden. But it's claimed to be there, and now you have

81
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,440
 all these refugees running around trying to escape the battles. But then you have, like, the two people

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
 who are fighting, the liberation friend, the Ethiopian government, when you see a bunch of people run

83
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,680
 around, you don't know if they're like enemy reinforcements. You don't know if they're civilians.

84
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
 You don't know. So they're keeping track of them. Now, obviously, a normal person would go,

85
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,760
 "Oh, those people who are just carrying, like, sleeping bags on their children,

86
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,800
 probably refugees from this horrible war going on." But for whatever reason, the Ethiopian government

87
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,880
 and their militias were following these thousand people to the Church of St. Mary of Zion.

88
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,360
 So they all go into the church, and that's generally, a lot of times, we see that happen

89
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,600
 in these types of situations. You try to find sanctuary in your place of worship. It's kind

90
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,240
 of like neutral ground, like Highlander. But unfortunately, reality is far more grim than

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,160
 Highlander. It's actually more like Highlander 4, because the Ethiopian army gets there, and you

92
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,280
 have a thousand people in this compound. The Ethiopian army gets there, and as the church leaders

93
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,520
 are talking, they go, "Okay, this is what we're afraid of. The Ethiopian army is going to come

94
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,040
 into the complex, and they're going to take the Ark of the Covenant." So what do you do in that case?

95
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,920
 This is a very, very interesting story, and I really appreciate that gray of PTA sent this to me,

96
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:26,480
 because on the one hand, you have a biblical super weapon, a holy relic, and on the other hand,

97
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,520
 you have a thousand people. And, you know, even if you're just casually aware of the Bible, a lot

98
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,160
 of it is about, you know, like, self-sacrifice and turning the other cheek and things like that.

99
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,720
 Martyring yourself. Martyring yourself. When I was raised in the church, a lot of it was about

100
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,280
 how the Christians martyred themselves to the Romans, even though their body is destroyed,

101
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,200
 their soul lives on. So it didn't matter that the Romans were slaughtering them, throwing them into

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,480
 the lion cages. That was part of the test of faith, and you just did it. You didn't fight back. You

103
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,880
 got eaten by the lions. Maybe you'd fight the lions, but there wasn't any real sort of armed

104
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,360
 resistance. The Christians just let it happen. So you do have this thing about martyrdom in

105
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,920
 Christianity, but you don't know if these thousand people, you don't know how to vouch these thousand

106
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,840
 people, or they're like, "I don't care, but I'm not Christian. I'm atheist. I'm just running from

107
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,640
 this army." They get to this compound, the Ethiopian army is there, and the church leaders make a

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,480
 decision. As long as these thousand people are here, they're actually threatening the ark.

109
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,360
 So they pushed these thousand people out of the complex, where they were very quickly

110
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,840
 slaughtered by the Ethiopian government. 750 of the 1000 people were killed on that spot.

111
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,640
 The ark is safe, however. That's such a, I mean, it's such a bizarre trade-off, because I think,

112
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,400
 even though like you could think about the martyrdom and stuff like that, that has to be a personal

113
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,120
 decision. They might have not even been Christian. So you can't be like, "Go martyr yourself." You're

114
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
 like, "What? No, I'm Scientologist. No, no, no, they're getting pushed outside." You can't do that.

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,680
 It might not even be the real Ark of the Covenant, which makes it doubly tragic.

116
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,200
 And what's even weirder about this whole... So on the one hand, you could go,

117
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,360
 if the Ethiopian army wanted to take the ark, why wouldn't they just go in? Would be your question.

118
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,960
 If they really wanted, that was their end goal, why wouldn't they go in? Well, they wouldn't have

119
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,000
 a reason to. If the 1000 people were in there, they could go in and take the ark, or at least take

120
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,240
 a look at it, and say, "Well, we had to go in." There was 1000 members of this liberation front

121
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,560
 group running around when it was really just refugees. But you go, "Jason, are you just

122
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,920
 giving them motives? Now you're trying to make it sound..." First off, they murdered 750 people.

123
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,240
 So they did do that. I'm not casting dispersions on the Ethiopian government and their militia forces.

124
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,640
 They massacred 750 people. In January 2021, this just happened. The reason why we know about it was

125
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,360
 250 of them were able to escape, and they reported this to the local media, being like, "Oh, dude,

126
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
 a bunch of people got killed over there." And of course, the Ethiopian government's like,

127
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,080
 "Nothing to see." They're like, "Can we go visit the bodies?" They're like, "No, no, the bodies...

128
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,600
 I mean, there's no bodies, there's no bodies!" But you can't see it anyways. They're kind of blocking

129
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
 off that whole area. But as far as we know, they didn't get the Ark of the Covenant, but

130
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,800
 you go, "Jason, is there any..." Maybe it was. They were just after the Liberation Front. Maybe

131
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,280
 the Ark of the Covenant had nothing to do with this. Check this out. There is a religious bent

132
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,120
 to this whole thing. Because in November, so back when this first started, government troops were

133
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,640
 shelling this town, bombarding this town with artillery fire in Ethiopia, and it had one of the

134
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:45,040
 first mosques in Africa. It's been there since the 7th century. It's actually so well known. It's

135
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,360
 considered a holy site in the Islamic religion. They built this mosque in this town, and they had

136
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,120
 documents and writings. They had the badly bones of these people from the 7th century. This all

137
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,000
 happened in the 7th century. You had writings and everything like that. This was a holy site.

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,280
 It was being shelled by the government. The whole town was. And they were telling people,

139
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,720
 "Nothing to see here, nothing to see here. Smoke is rising from the mosque." They're like, "No,

140
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,360
 no, no. We didn't hit the mosque." It turns out that not only did they bomb the mosque,

141
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:23,440
 but when people went in afterwards, the writings were gone. And the memorial, the shrine where the

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,320
 bones were, was disturbed. So they're thinking that the theory is, actually it's more than a theory,

143
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,520
 I gotta throw allegedly in here real quick, but that Ethiopian troops went in and sacked

144
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,360
 the mosque after they bombed it. And were taking all of these ancient religious writings out of

145
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,960
 the mosque. Not for safekeeping, by the way. It's not like the guy has a museum back at his house.

146
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,040
 They're gone now. So there is a precedent of them. And you know, now that I say that,

147
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,480
 they had covered that up for months. Like that happened in November and they covered up. Maybe

148
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,680
 the ark is gone. We wouldn't know. No one would know, really. There's only one person who can

149
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,400
 confirm that it was there. Bizarre story. It's a bizarre story all around. One, all the people dying

150
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,720
 because of this insurrection, civil war. And then them dying to protect a relic that may not even be

151
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,440
 the actual relic. And then the fact that it may be the relic and the government of Ethiopia may

152
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,560
 actually be running around collecting holy relics for who knows what reason. It's a triple threat.

153
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,680
 It's just a bizarre story all around. So hopefully they don't have the Ark of the Covenant because

154
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,520
 it doesn't sound like they're the most stable government to begin with. Masticurying 750 people

155
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,120
 because they don't know if they're the good guys or the bad guys. That generally makes you the bad guy.

156
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,840
 Rider, let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Ethiopia. We are

157
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:55,840
 headed out to old timey Prussia. We're waving goodbye to Ethiopia. Hopefully this war is very

158
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,080
 short and the good guys win. Sometimes during a war it's hard to tell who the good guys are.

159
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:07,120
 It tends not to be the people who murder 750 people outside of a church. I'm just saying.

160
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,600
 As we're leaving behind, I wanted to do this real quickly. I wanted to give you guys a

161
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,840
 Dead Rabbit Recommends. We've been having a lot of these recently. This isn't a Dead Rabbit Recommends.

162
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,080
 This is a Dead Rabbit Insists. I insist you watch this movie. I'm a very busy person.

163
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,080
 I have a daily podcast which Lin hindsight is a ton of work. I love doing it. It takes up a ton of

164
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,240
 my time. Plus I have all the other normal stressors that everyone else has. So when I take the time

165
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,840
 out of my week to watch the same movie twice by myself, it's a Dead Rabbit Insist you watch

166
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,800
 this movie. It's very rare that I watch the same movie twice by myself and especially within the

167
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:58,080
 same week. The Night Eats The World. It's a zombie film. It is on point. It's like an hour and a

168
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,400
 half long. It's the perfect length. Every scene works. The cinematography is great. The directing

169
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:13,360
 is great. It's terrifying. It's realistic. It's amazing. I just stumbled across it on accident.

170
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,880
 I was scrolling through Amazon Prime. The Night Eats The World. I watched it twice and maybe about

171
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,040
 four days. And even if you're not a zombie fan, you have to watch this movie. If you're not a

172
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:32,800
 zombie fan, this movie is the reason why people love zombie stories. It is just boiled down to

173
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,560
 its pure essence. And I don't want to tell you anything else about it. I knew nothing about

174
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:50,000
 the plot going in. It is an amazing zombie movie. So good. And you guys know I watch a ton of them.

175
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I watch zombie movies all the time. So yeah, I still don't know. There's Train to Busan,

176
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,360
 Dawn of the Dead, and this. And that list, that order keeps changing. This is so different.

177
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,280
 Those two movies are action movies and this movie has action in it, but it's realistic.

178
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's-

179
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,600
 It's a good movie. But yeah, The Night Eats The World. Really, check it out.

180
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,840
 Ryder is flying. He's like, "Dude, you're telling me to go to Old Time Russia? We're like Stone Age

181
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,280
 Russia." He went too far back in time. Sorry, Ryder. Let's not talk about the movie anymore.

182
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,480
 We're headed to late 1700s, early 1800s Prussia. He's like, "Oh, there we go." Dials it in.

183
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:07,200
 Carbindercopter is now in early 1800s Prussia, to be specific. Ryder flies us over this old town.

184
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,800
 He hits a button so the Carbindercopter is disguised. Now it just looks like a windmill.

185
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,640
 It's a flying windmill. No one notices it. We land. We get out. We're wearing a bunch of

186
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,720
 old-timey Prussian clothes. And I just shrugged my shoulders. I don't even know. I don't even know.

187
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,960
 I imagine those pointy hats. We look like colonial people. We look like we're American

188
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,640
 colonial people. We're walking through Prussia and we get to this little town. And we see there's

189
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,600
 a man on his knees on the street. And we can tell there's a mob scene. There's a bunch of

190
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,720
 authorities standing around with their billy clubs. All the town population is surrounding them.

191
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:48,160
 The mayor is openly weeping. I was like, "That is son or something like that?" And we see the man

192
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,320
 in the center of the circle. He's on his knees. He's really in trouble because the police don't

193
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,920
 look too happy about it. He's a military man. We can tell from his uniform. I don't know what

194
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,720
 Prussians wear, but I'm an expert at their military uniforms. He's on his knees and they're

195
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,160
 taking his medals off of his uniform one by one and throwing them on the ground. And they're like,

196
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,240
 "You disgrace to the military. Take another medal off. You suck. That word hasn't been invented yet,

197
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,920
 but you're the reason why we invented it." They're taking these medals off. They're throwing them on

198
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,440
 the ground. The mayor's like, "He's my buddy. Very surreal image." But here's the thing too. It's like

199
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,160
 you know how these mob scenes work. The population should be throwing tomatoes at this guy. They

200
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,560
 should be like, "Boo, boo. We don't know what he's done at this point." But it's weird to have a mob

201
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,520
 scene where it's pretty quiet. And the only ones who are really pissed off about stuff are the

202
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,280
 authorities there. The townspeople came out and it almost seems like they're there to give the criminal

203
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:56,080
 some moral support. Who we're looking at is Captain Fritz Alswanger. He's on his knees and they keep

204
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,920
 taking these medals off of him. You have military officials there and they're just shaking their

205
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,680
 head the whole time. Their necks are getting sore. They're like, "Dude, can we hurry this up? I'm so

206
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,120
 tired of shaking my head." And eventually Colonel Fritz Alswanger, they pick him up off the ground

207
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,920
 and they go, "His sentence for his crime is thus. He will be taken to prison for a short while.

208
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:25,360
 Then we will brand him on the back the word thief." Which actually would be kind of badass.

209
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,440
 And then, this part's not badass, and then he is going to be sent to the galleys.

210
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,080
 Which is the big rowing things. You know, like when you're in the boat and you're like rowing the

211
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,240
 oars. Not like, "Row, row, row your boat." Not like the song. It's like the guy with the drum,

212
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,360
 "Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom." You're rowing like that. He's going to be sent to the galleys for the

213
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,280
 rest of his life. That is the sentence that we have laid down on Colonel Fritz Alswanger

214
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,760
 for his horrible crime. His crime against you all. His crime against the nation of Prussia itself.

215
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,920
 And everyone's just quiet. And the mayor's like, "Oh, my buddy." And as they're leading Colonel Fritz

216
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,960
 Alswanger off, he turns to one of the military officials and goes, "Hey, before you do all

217
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,280
 that stuff, before you throw me in prison and brand me and make me do the galley thing, I'd like to

218
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,000
 have a one-on-one with the general." Not for his car insurance. The general of the military. And so

219
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,080
 they, yeah, yeah, sure. Because no one really wanted to do this. So he sits down with the general

220
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,760
 and he goes, "I'm not Captain Fritz Alswanger. I did the crime. I committed that horrible atrocious

221
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:43,840
 crime. But I'm not Captain Fritz Alswanger. My name is Did Ricky." Then we go back in time.

222
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,800
 We're headed back in time just a couple years. Did Ricky, did he? I don't know. I'm almost positive.

223
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:57,600
 That's not even pronounce his name. But anyway, Did Ricky is the son of a shoemaker. He's this poor

224
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,400
 boy in Prussia. He can never really do things quite right. He's always trying to run like some

225
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,840
 little scam. He's basically a little, he's like a little rascal, but he's an adult. So it's no

226
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,560
 longer cute and endearing. You're actually a petty criminal at this point. But he's kind of just

227
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,080
 moving from job to job. At one point he was like making ice cream, but not like real American

228
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,200
 ice cream, like just ice and then like gross berries on it and stuff. So that didn't last very long.

229
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,600
 That didn't last very long. Eventually he's just standing on the street corner, not like selling

230
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,800
 his body. Or is he? Did Ricky do that? No, he's just standing on the street corner one day and he

231
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,440
 hears a bunch of people laughing at him. Did Ricky is standing there and he looks up and he sees a

232
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,320
 bunch of army dudes laughing at him. He's like, "What?" He can't really do anything. Right? There's

233
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,720
 a bunch of army guys. What's he going to do? Fight him. And one of them goes, "Yeah, you're right.

234
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,440
 You're right. He does look like me." That's when Did Ricky kind of looks a little bit closer to the

235
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:02,160
 group of people and sees his clone standing there. Standing in this group of military officials

236
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,960
 is Lieutenant Fritz Alswinger. And he's kind of leaning up against his, back in the 18th,

237
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,600
 they didn't have cars. He's kind of leaning up against his wagon. So he'll try to be wagon.

238
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,560
 It's like there's a mule in front of it. He's leaning against his wagon and he's like, "Hey,

239
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,680
 you look just like me." And did Ricky is like, "Yeah, yeah, I guess I can kind of see the resemblance.

240
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,480
 I mean, obviously you've shaved and you've eaten well and there's a lot of things that show that

241
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,120
 you're richer than I am, but other than that, other than the malnourishment, we look exactly like."

242
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,320
 And Lieutenant Fritz goes, "Hey guys, you know what would be hilarious? I'm going to hire this dude

243
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,680
 as my valet. This guy's going to be my butler. He's going to do a bunch of stuff for me.

244
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,160
 And it'll be so funny because he looks just like me. Now I'm sure everyone else is going,

245
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,480
 "Yeah, that's kind of funny for like a day or two. How long can you, I mean, sure, like,

246
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,320
 would Mike Tyson hire a butler that looks like Mike Tyson? And how long would that gimmick be good?"

247
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,360
 But anyways, Lieutenant Fritz goes, "Are you doing anything?" And did Ricky's like,

248
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,960
 "No, I'm actually petty criminal. It's just in between jobs right now." So what happens is

249
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,280
 Lieutenant Fritz hires did Ricky on the spot and becomes his valet. And sure enough, Fritz thinks

250
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,920
 it's so funny to do this. Now Fritz, he's like the military class. He was raised in these families.

251
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,520
 He was destined to be in the military. Though he's well off. He has his house. He has all the

252
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,960
 servants and things like that. Did Ricky's walking around? He's like, "Whoa, dude, this place is totally

253
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,280
 awesome. There's tons of stuff I can steal from here, but I better not. I better not steal any

254
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,880
 thing." And Lieutenant Fritz keeps doing this. He thinks it's so funny. He'll change clothes with

255
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,680
 did Ricky. He'll be like, "Okay, so let's go to this big party where they're expecting me,

256
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,600
 but I want you to be dressed in my uniform and I'm going to be dressed like a hobo." And then

257
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,120
 we'll, did Ricky's like, "I don't dress like a hobo?" He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you kind of

258
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,680
 dress like a hobo, but we go in there and then it'll be so funny because they'll think it's you,

259
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,160
 and then I'll be like, "Ha ha, I'm the real Lieutenant Fritz." They did this all the time.

260
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,920
 And did Ricky was living the good life? He gets to do all this cool stuff with his buddy. Not really

261
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,680
 his buddy, it's his boss, but he gets to eat well. He gets to sleep in a nice bed. He gets to sleep

262
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,320
 in a bed. It doesn't matter if it's nice at this point. He's living in a mansion. So one morning

263
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,400
 he wakes up. He's like, "Hey boss, we're going to do that whole thing, the same thing we do every

264
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:29,600
 single day." He opens the door to Lieutenant Fritz's room and Fritz is dead. Stone cold dead.

265
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:37,040
 And did Ricky's like, "Damn it. This sucks because he's going to be fired." They're like,

266
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,600
 "That tends to happen when the master dies. All the servants have to go get other jobs,

267
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,440
 but he's not even a real servant. He's not part of this long tradition of butlers and maids.

268
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,920
 He's just some dude off the street." So thinking incredibly quickly, he undresses the corpse,

269
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,280
 puts on the corpse. Maybe he didn't wear the corpse's clothes. The guy had a full closet

270
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,080
 behind him. He just put on regular clothes. He wasn't taking off poop filled underwear from when

271
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,080
 he died. He probably just put on regular clothes, but he did take the body and put his old clothes

272
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,200
 on it. Carry the body to his room and then wake people up and be like, "Oh no, did Ricky is dead?"

273
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,240
 They looked exactly alike, but obviously their education was different and did Ricky knew that?

274
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,760
 He knew that if he was going to pull this scam off for a long enough time, preferably forever,

275
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,280
 because he's now a very wealthy respected man. He had to change some stuff. He had to get it figured

276
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,360
 out real quick. First off, part of the thing that was so funny about him was did Ricky normally has

277
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,920
 a very kind of rough and tumble way of talking, "Hey, matey. He wasn't a pirate, but you know what

278
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,960
 I mean? He was from the streets." He wasn't this well educated man, so he's like, "First thing I

279
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,080
 have to do is change that. Get to speak more intelligible." For the first three weeks,

280
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,800
 he doesn't really say anything because this is when he's the most vulnerable, because he's around

281
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,240
 all the servants. He knew that he had to be very careful, so he's silent for three weeks. He's not

282
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
 a monk, but he doesn't talk a lot for the first three weeks. He's really trying to limit it,

283
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
 and people just figure and he says, "Well, you know, I'm depressed. That was my buddy,

284
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,640
 my poor buddy, the amazing guy, D-Drick. He pretty much kept his mouth shut." Then he is able to

285
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,080
 secure a transfer away from Prussia. He's able to secure a transfer to a totally new location.

286
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,840
 So now he's like, "This is going to work. I'm not going to be around my servants.

287
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,560
 Any my coworkers slash servants, so I don't have to worry about them figuring it out."

288
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,560
 I keep going to work. They keep asking me about like battle plans and stuff like that. I don't know

289
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,520
 about that. Plus, my coworkers know the old Lieutenant Fritz. I'm going to get transferred

290
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,080
 to this new location, brand new start, and I'll be super rich. I'll just hire new servants there,

291
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,800
 or no servants. I don't need servants, but I'll probably get some anyways. So he gets that transferred,

292
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:56,240
 but before he can transfer over, he gets contacted by his family, Lieutenant Fritz's family in Italy,

293
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,120
 and they say, "Oh, we heard you got a transfer. We want to celebrate it. Come visit us."

294
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,480
 He's like, "Damn it. This is not going to work. This is so amazing, and this is

295
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,080
 one of the reasons why I love this story. I just stumbled across this the other day,

296
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,880
 and I want this to be a reminder. We're doing that 90 days to a better you challenge,

297
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,480
 where I want everyone to be in a better position at the beginning of May than they are right now.

298
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,000
 This guy, who was the son of a shoemaker, who grew up on the streets, who was a petty criminal,

299
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,960
 he has to go to Italy to visit the family of the man he's impersonating.

300
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,240
 He learned Italian in three weeks. I mean, it was life or death, right? He learns Italian in

301
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,640
 three weeks. He goes out to Italy, and he meets his dad, his sister, and his mom, and he fools his

302
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,680
 father and his sister, because they look exactly alike, but the mother knows something is wrong.

303
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:04,960
 The mother consents that something's wrong with her son, and so he starts avoiding her.

304
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,640
 You can almost do a spin-off sitcom about him trying to outwit his own mother and get out

305
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,600
 of town before she figures it out, but he does. He's actually able to evade her long enough.

306
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,480
 Then he's sent to his new position. While he is working in his new position,

307
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
 makes a ton of friends, he actually becomes good friends with the mayor. The people in town

308
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,880
 love him. He is such a well-respected official. Everyone's like, "This is one of the best military

309
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,160
 minds we've ever met," and he's so nice. It's almost like he wasn't raised in the military. It's

310
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,880
 almost like he was one of us who achieved a high status. Super nice guy. He's hanging out with

311
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,920
 everyone. Everyone loves him. He gets promoted. He was Lieutenant Allswanger. Now he gets promoted

312
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:55,760
 to Captain Fritz Allswanger, but this all falls apart when one day a man is approached about a

313
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,600
 ring he has. They go, "That ring's stolen," and he goes, "What? No way. This ring's not stolen. I

314
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,280
 bought it." Then they go, "Maybe you bought a stolen ring." He goes, "That's impossible,

315
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,760
 because the man I bought it from," Captain Fritz Allswanger. You're like, "What?" But the ring was

316
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,840
 stolen. It's not like nowadays if you found some ring from Kay's Jewelers on the ground,

317
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,280
 you would never prove that it was stolen. But back in old-timey, everywhere, there were hand-making

318
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,320
 jewelry. So we were like, "No, that's obviously my jewelry. My fingerprints are still in it from

319
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,160
 when I was pressing the gold down." They are able to track this ring back to Captain Fritz Allswanger,

320
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,840
 and he was boarding in this house when the ring went missing. So he stole it. He wasn't unjustly

321
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,120
 accused. And at this point, did Ricky knows the game is up? I mean, I was reading this, I go,

322
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,160
 "Why did he steal the ring?" First off, your first question is, "Why did he steal the ring in the

323
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,240
 first place? Once a thief, always a thief. Secondly, life in the galleys, rowing a boat,

324
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,000
 for stealing a ring." That was his sentence. He was going to spend the rest of his life rowing

325
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,440
 in some galleon as it was shooting cannonballs at Napoleon or something like that. It'd be the

326
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,400
 rest of his life, but imagine you want to be living that long and get branded thief on his back for

327
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,520
 stealing a ring. Insane, dude. But anyways, they do the crime, and back then, that you do the time,

328
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,160
 which was the rest of your life. And then we're back to the point where when the authorities are

329
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,880
 doing this big public display to shame him, no one wanted a part of it. The people all loved this

330
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,280
 guy. The mayor was weeping. No one wanted to see this happen. And then he admitted what the story

331
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,720
 was. And when the story gets out, it obviously is big news. It turns out that the mother in Italy

332
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,840
 was actually very relieved. She said, this is kind of a touching thing. She goes, "It's sad to know

333
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,760
 that my son died, but on the other hand, what really broke my heart was when I saw my son,

334
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,200
 I could tell he didn't love me. And I couldn't figure out why. I couldn't figure out why my son

335
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,400
 didn't love me. And that broke my heart." So it actually gave her peace to know that her son had

336
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,840
 passed on and not that her son didn't love her. Isn't that it's just kind of a, I mean, she's not

337
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,080
 like, "Good, my son's dead." You know what I mean? But she's saying like people, it was just a different

338
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,160
 feeling for her. She was sad that she lost her son, but it even hurt her even more. She can figure

339
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,360
 out why her son no longer loved her. Because Did Ricky Didn't Love Her? So here's where we get to the

340
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:29,040
 story. I mean, that story, very fascinating. But when you look up Did Ricky in the internet,

341
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,040
 don't try pronouncing his name, just type it in, that whole story is compressed into two sentences.

342
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,200
 I actually had to dig for that story because I was very, very curious. When you look at

343
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,400
 lists of like five crazy people who just up and vanished on like Lister or Gawker lists,

344
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,600
 or Buzzfeed lists, or whatever, any of those things, you'll often see Did Ricky pop up.

345
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,520
 Because his ending is what made him famous. That story was really popular at the time it happened.

346
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,880
 But the reason why we know about Did Ricky now is because of how he

347
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,680
 vanished. He was sentenced before he had to get the thief thing and the galleys. He was sentenced to

348
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,400
 Weichschlegmund Prison. And they were actually doing a switchover. They were switching it over

349
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,080
 from like a Prussian prison to a French prison or one way or the other. So they were moving these

350
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,440
 prisoners around. Now Did Ricky is just a normal prisoner at this point. He had tried escaping

351
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,200
 before, so he's in leg shackles. And while he's walking with these other prisoners, as they're

352
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,040
 being shuffled in front of these prisoners and these guards are standing there, Did Ricky kind

353
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,800
 of turns from side to side and goes, "Nah, I'm through." Snaps his fingers. I don't know if he

354
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,680
 snapped his fingers, but I'm adding that. Everyone turns around and they watch him turn to mist.

355
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:56,240
 And he floats out of his shackles. Now you'll see that story repeated a lot online. If you look

356
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,120
 up Did Ricky, that's what you'll see. Then you'll see they'll go, he impersonated his boss, he got

357
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,040
 arrested for that. Then he turned into mist and no one's seen him since. Obviously you want to keep

358
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,400
 digging on a story like that. There's a lot of witnesses, but it's also old-timey. So you have

359
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,280
 to say like maybe just a cloud went by. He just shuffled off real slow and then they didn't see

360
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,560
 him walking around the corner. So did he actually turn to mist? You're like shaking your head. You're

361
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,880
 like probably not. Let's take a look at this. One of the stories is that he turned to mist. The other

362
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,840
 one is that the same situation, he was walking with these other prisoners and there's guards around

363
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,840
 and in a moment he's able to figure out a way to unhook himself and then he runs away and everyone

364
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,560
 turns and looks and they see him running away. No mist involved, no paranormal activity involved,

365
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,120
 but he did escape. They looked for him, they never found him. So you'll see that sometimes,

366
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,040
 even in these lists where they're like people who disappear, oh my, they'll usually give a

367
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,000
 rational answer, they'll say, but other people say he just, he didn't turn to mist. Most people

368
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,040
 would say you can't turn to mist. He just unlocked himself and walked away. So again, I dug into the

369
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,120
 story and I was able to find a really cool account on anomalyinfo.com. That's where I got that full

370
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,720
 story about did Ricky and all of those, that's a true story and how he did that. Most of the times

371
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,440
 you'll just see a brief explanation that he traded places with his boss. So I'm thankful to anomaly

372
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,280
 info for bringing out that full story, but they also got this part of the story. It is true that

373
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,960
 he did disappear, but again the truth is somewhere in between him just unlocking the

374
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,600
 leg shackles and him turning himself into mist. Apparently when he was being transferred,

375
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,080
 when the French troops were handing this stuff over to the Prussians, they gave him this sheet

376
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,080
 and there's 30 names on this list and one of them has next to the name missing. Impression guards go,

377
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,160
 that's the way we work. He kind of got to give us some information. Well, you know, here's the thing,

378
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,800
 he did try escaping before we had him in leg shackles. We were actually bringing him over

379
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,680
 this wall, like this landing area and on one side of it is a bunch of guards escorting these troops.

380
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,400
 On the other side of it is the Vistula River and then we turned around and he wasn't there anymore.

381
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:18,480
 So he may have escaped into the river, which I mean he's wearing heavy iron chains. It would be a

382
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,600
 very short escape. It could be that he fell into the river. Some people have thought that the

383
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,000
 French just got tired of listening to him, talking about how dope he was and what a great military

384
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 commander he was, and they pushed him into the river. Some people think that he was killed

385
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,440
 on purpose, but it's interesting because all of that stuff, it was dark at night,

386
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,960
 all of that stuff, you can imagine the place was swirling with mist

387
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,640
 and you turn around and someone's just gone. Someone who was there is gone.

388
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,720
 So I find that very fitting in for a man who was able to slip out of the chains of being a lower

389
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,840
 class citizen. Whether or not he turned into mist or he butterfingered himself and drowned in the

390
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:11,520
 river, it doesn't really matter. Did Ricky is a legend? A legend whose name will be mispronounced

391
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,520
 throughout the ages, but a legend nonetheless.
