00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
 The following episode of Dead Rabbit Radio contains crimes of a graphic nature.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,880
 Listener discretion is advised.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,320
 What would you do if one day you walked out in your front yard and a tree had fallen down?

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,400
 But the next day, it falls up?

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,080
 And then we meet a disgusting criminal with horrible crimes on his mind.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,480
 Is it possible that someone will stop this man before he does the unthinkable?

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,080
 Or will his fantasies become a reality?

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,400
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,960
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started by inviting in one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,960
 He requested to be on a gross episode.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
 Here you are, buddy.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,680
 Everyone give a round of applause for Rabbit Fish.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
 Woohoo!

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
 Yeah, come on in.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
 Come on in.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
 He's looking around.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,120
 He's like, "Oh no, what did I ask for?"

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,680
 Hey, you did ask to be on a gross episode.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,760
 Rabbit Fish, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,920
 You guys can't support the show financially.

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
 That's fine.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
 Just help spread the word about the show.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,120
 That really, really helps out a lot.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,840
 Dead Fish, hop on out of your portable fishbowl device.

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,520
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,280
 We're going to drive all the way out to Ghana.

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 Should have taken a boat.

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,600
 I figured that halfway across the Atlantic Ocean, but here we are in Ghana.

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,720
 Specifically, we're in the community of Dambi in Ghana.

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,800
 And it's earlier this month, July 2022, is when this story takes place.

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,920
 So we're walking around Dambi and we're like, "Oh man."

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
 And this storm starts to roll in.

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
 We're like, "Ah, we're running for..."

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,120
 It's not that bad of a storm.

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
 It's not acid rain or anything.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,200
 But anyways, it's a rainstorm.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,440
 It actually is pretty windy and things like that.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
 And the next day, people are kind of out walking around trying to figure out what got knocked

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,720
 down, what needs to be fixed, right?

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,440
 Picket fence, got a couple things blown off of it.

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
 Baby carriage.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,240
 Baby carriage flew off a bridge.

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
 People are kind of licking over.

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
 "Ah, there's no baby."

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,000
 And this woman named Mary Boma, Mary Boma, comes out of her house and she sees this pretty

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,280
 large teak tree completely ripped out of the ground.

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
 So you know, that's a pretty big storm, right?

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
 Ripping out trees and stuff like that.

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,680
 And Mary's like, "Well, you know, you gotta make milk if you spill milk."

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,200
 I guess they were all saying, "Right?"

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
 Isn't that what people always said?

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,640
 So this tree's knocked over and she goes, "You know, what am I gonna do?"

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,600
 I'm gonna chop off a couple branches to use for firewood, right?

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,120
 I mean, it's in the middle of summer.

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,640
 Do people really like firewood in the middle of July?

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
 I don't know.

63
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,280
 But she starts cutting off branches and she takes them home and she's like, "Well, I'm

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,480
 sure got a lot of firewood.

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,440
 Now I just need a place to put it for 10 months."

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,800
 And then a week later, another resident of Dambi, a man named Abraham Sapakou, is sitting

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:45,800
 at home when he hears a "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,160
 down and she's like, "Oh, and behold, when she gets to the tree, it's standing straight

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,680
 up again."

70
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,920
 She's like, "What in the world happened?"

71
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,640
 That tree was knocked down.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,960
 I have proof.

73
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
 I cut off all these branches.

74
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,480
 I took them home for firewood.

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,920
 Now a week later, that tree is standing back up straight and the branches are removed from

76
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
 it.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,120
 The branches I cut.

78
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,920
 There's a photo of this tree.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,120
 There's a photo of a tree standing up, right?

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 That's proof.

81
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,880
 There's a photo of a tree standing up and the report is this tree got knocked over and then

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,120
 somehow it re-rided itself.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,440
 What's interesting about this photo is it does look like it was uprooted.

84
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,520
 All of the ground at the base of the tree is churned up and you can see most of the roots

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,880
 of the tree.

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,400
 Ghana News Agency was the one reporting on this story and it's such a weird thing.

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,240
 Ghana News Agency is talking about this and then there's a footnote going, "This isn't

88
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,560
 the first time this has happened."

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 I'm like, "Really?

90
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,880
 Can't tell us about the other times."

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,080
 Apparently this isn't the first time that it's happened that a tree has been felled

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
 and then fixes itself.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,880
 Mary, just to be safe, has contacted a local spiritualist.

94
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,160
 You know, "I would probably not burn that wood, right?

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,400
 I'd rather spend a couple nights kind of chilly than burn possibly cursed wood."

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,960
 What a bizarre story.

97
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:25,440
 Last week we covered a hobo whose car was magically repaired one day.

98
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,440
 He walked out to his cousin living in his car and apparently he left his car for some reason,

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,120
 probably to eat, right?

100
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,400
 And then when he comes back, part of his car had brand new parts put on it and he didn't

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
 do it.

102
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,480
 And he questioned whether or not the Mandela effect had anything to do with that and that's

103
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,060
 really when you look at this story, like what could be the possible causes.

104
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,160
 We know why the tree got knocked down.

105
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
 It was a storm.

106
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,080
 But what would have been the possible, like from a logical point of view, right, you're

107
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,000
 just going to say the photo, they just took a photo of a tree and the thing with being

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,200
 a skeptic is sometimes you do really have to think of a logical excuse and that doesn't

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 make sense.

110
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,800
 Well, maybe a construction crew needed to move a vehicle, by the way, so they towed

111
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,760
 the tree up and sat it there and left this teetering giant tree.

112
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
 It's quite large.

113
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,600
 It's probably like 20, 30 feet tall.

114
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
 They just left it there.

115
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,080
 They didn't replant it or anything.

116
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,000
 I've never ever heard of a tree, a fallen tree being put back in its position and they just

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 kind of left there.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
 Right now there's a bunch of people going, "No, Jason, that's what they actually do with

119
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
 fallen trees."

120
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
 I don't think so.

121
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,400
 I've always seen them carted away, right, for firewood or paper or pencils or whatever,

122
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 right?

123
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,440
 To get rid of, because you can't have this giant tree just laying there.

124
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,880
 But yeah, so maybe there's a totally reasonable explanation.

125
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,400
 I'm going to get an email from some forestry major being like, "No, that's what they do."

126
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,120
 But I think if it was a reasonable explanation, they would have just put that in the article.

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,040
 Coast to Coast AM's website is where I found this originally.

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,120
 And they're really, really good about including, well, you know, experts say this or experts

129
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
 say that.

130
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
 They'll constantly...

131
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
 Sorry, there's a card driving one.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,360
 I'm recording in my living room instead of my closet like normally because it's just

133
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
 too hot.

134
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,720
 Coast to Coast AM's good about the other side of things, right?

135
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,840
 Not like the other side, i.e. the other side dead people, ghosts and stuff like that.

136
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
 But just like, this is what experts say.

137
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
 They're really good at providing balance.

138
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,600
 This one even there like, "What in the world can have caused this?"

139
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,840
 You could say the large sound was a construction vehicle rewriting the tree, but then you also

140
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,540
 hear the rumbling of a construction crew nearby.

141
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,440
 So this happened, right?

142
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,880
 I mean, unless they're, again, faking everything, which they could, but it seems to be going

143
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,200
 out of the way for kind of a goofy fake.

144
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,160
 You do have to look at stuff like Mandela Effect.

145
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
 Ghost?

146
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,660
 I have no idea.

147
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,960
 Why would a ghost even want to do this?

148
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,160
 They're like, "Ah, it's time to flex my ghost muscles.

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,560
 I've been dead for 400 years.

150
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
 Time for a workout."

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,760
 I mean, like demons maybe?

152
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
 Magic?

153
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,000
 I mean, I have no clue of why a tree...

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,960
 And you know, and again, you could go to maybe something that I personally find very boring,

155
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,720
 but a lot of people like nature magic, right?

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,880
 The tree was like, "Oh, I'm not supposed to be dead."

157
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,600
 And then like, he did it himself.

158
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,080
 Which if I saw that event, I would not find it boring at all.

159
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,840
 I would be completely dazzled, but I'm not a huge fan of nature magic.

160
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,520
 I'm not a huge fan of like fairies and little gnomes and stuff like that.

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,680
 Again, if I see them, I won't be like, "Boring."

162
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,400
 But just, I don't like reading about them.

163
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
 I find it kind of lame.

164
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,280
 I mean, I'm talking about this tree that fixed itself.

165
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
 I'm like, "Come on, man.

166
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,680
 Where's the UFOs?"

167
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:40,160
 I have no reasonable explanation of why this would happen or why someone would fake it.

168
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,480
 But according to Ghana news agency and Mary Boma, two very, very well-respected names,

169
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,680
 this tree fell down.

170
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,520
 She chopped the limbs off and then re-rided itself.

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
 And what's interesting is she does have the proof.

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,560
 Like when you look at the photograph, there are limbs chopped off the tree.

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
 You're like, "Jason, come on.

174
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,640
 There's always limbs chopped off trees."

175
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
 Why would they make this up?

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It's so dumb.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
 It's so dumb.

178
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,880
 Why would they make it up?

179
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,320
 And it's also so fascinating because I can't think of a legitimate reason outside of some

180
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,000
 lame old nature magic that this would even be a thing.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,440
 Ghosts don't care.

182
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
 Aliens don't care.

183
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
 Demons don't care.

184
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
 Bigfoot wouldn't do it.

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
 I don't even know if there's a Bigfoot in Africa actually now to think about it.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 That's interesting.

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,600
 I know there's a bunch of cryptids, but a Sasquatch-esque creature in and of itself.

188
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
 I don't know.

189
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
 I should look into that.

190
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
 But yeah, why would this have...

191
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,680
 Mandela effect really is the biggest thing, right?

192
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,440
 But then why are the tree branches removed?

193
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,880
 Fascinating story coming out of Ghana and it's fairly recent.

194
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,360
 Ghana news agency also, if you do say, "This paranormal event has happened more than once."

195
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 Include those.

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
 Include those notes.

197
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,480
 I'd like to see those.

198
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
 Now, rabbitfish and the rest of you are probably thinking, "Whoa, that wasn't that gross.

199
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,200
 You were thinking did the tree fall on someone?"

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
 No, you sickos.

201
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,280
 You're like, "Get to the gross.

202
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 Get to the gross.

203
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
 We're getting to the gross."

204
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
 Rabbitfish.

205
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,000
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar character.

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,440
 We're leaving behind Ghana.

207
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:15,320
 We're headed somewhere within the United States of America.

208
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,720
 This is a story I've had ready to go for a while and it's actually one of those stories

209
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,680
 that's so creepy and disturbing that I've actually gone back and forth between like,

210
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,680
 "Should I do it today or should I never, ever cover this story at all?"

211
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,440
 Because what we're going to be looking at is the story of a man who was on a mission.

212
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,760
 Well, according to him, not on a mission, but we're basically, when I tell this story,

213
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,800
 you're going to see this clock in front of you and you are going to realize that it is

214
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,160
 counting down to something very, very, very disturbing.

215
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,200
 There's a subreddit called "Incessed Confessions."

216
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
 Incest Confessions.

217
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
 And if you've got to say anything about this subreddit, for the people who are listening,

218
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,040
 they're like, "No, I'm good, dude.

219
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,680
 Good happy Monday, Jason."

220
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,760
 Incest Confessions, truth and advertising, right?

221
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,480
 It's people talking about incest confessions.

222
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,960
 Now there's a debate even within the community about how true the stories are, which I would

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
 hope that none of them are.

224
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,920
 I'm hoping that none of them are.

225
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,420
 I actually came, I stumbled across them because I was covering another story where someone

226
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,120
 was posting, saying some crazy stuff and I want to say, "What else is this lunatic up

227
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
 to?"

228
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
 I don't remember what that story was.

229
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,280
 It was nowhere near as crazy as this one.

230
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,700
 I got wondering what this guy's up to and he was in, one of the subreddits he was talking

231
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,920
 about in was incest confessions.

232
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,400
 And these people sit around and talk about either things that really happened or things

233
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,080
 they want to happen.

234
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,000
 And again, you don't know what's true.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,720
 Some of this stuff, because I didn't have to read some of this stuff, I'm like, "Ugh."

236
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,840
 Some of this stuff is obviously like, it seems fake.

237
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,480
 Again, I hope it's fake.

238
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:16,940
 Let's take a look at this guy because this guy, he is in love with his daughter.

239
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,380
 And when I say love, that's probably not the right word.

240
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,340
 Obsessed would be a better way to put it.

241
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,100
 He's very, very cautious about what information he gives out, obviously, because he's getting

242
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,740
 ready to commit a crime.

243
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,600
 The only information we have is that he has multiple daughters.

244
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,880
 And according to him, someone specifically asked, "How old is your daughter?"

245
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 And he goes, "18."

246
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,040
 I actually read that comment in that voice.

247
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,760
 I don't know if she's actually that old.

248
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,400
 He knows well enough that if he said she was any younger, even the people of incest confessions

249
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,520
 would boo him.

250
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,840
 She might be 18, but we don't know.

251
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,100
 So you're like, "Jason, okay, you found a guy talking about wanting to have sex with

252
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,900
 his daughter on Reddit."

253
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,140
 Yeah, it's way worse than that.

254
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,340
 That is just something in passing.

255
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,020
 This guy, again, what I find so fascinating about this is like with any criminal, there's

256
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,180
 an escalation to it.

257
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,900
 You can always chart a through line.

258
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
 So let's take a look at this guy.

259
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
 He didn't wake up one day.

260
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,620
 Well, he might have woken up one day and said, "Oh, I want to have sex with my daughter."

261
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,000
 But let's take a look at this escalation of events.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,840
 And you tell me if you think there should be a race against time to identify.

263
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,240
 I'm not saying Doc's the guy.

264
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,320
 Let's take a look at this.

265
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,920
 Here I am again, 12 is his username.

266
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,800
 Here I am again, 12.

267
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,520
 Why did he pick the number 12?

268
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
 Don't know.

269
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,160
 Don't want to know.

270
00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:00,100
 What he does is post on incest confessions and we find out that he is the father of multiple

271
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:06,980
 daughters and he enjoys going to happy ending massage parlors, which is the massage parlors

272
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,580
 where basically you do not get a massage.

273
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,980
 They just want to get you in and get you out.

274
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,460
 The people there, the masseuses, masturbate you and then you leave, right?

275
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,060
 If you go and then you're like, "Man, I sure didn't have a stressful day at work."

276
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,200
 Then you start off on my back and then work my calves.

277
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,880
 You'll be like, "No, that's not what we're here for."

278
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,360
 Happy ending massage parlors.

279
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,720
 And he's very clear about this stuff and he goes, "One day I was getting a happy ending

280
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,980
 massage and he asked the woman, "Do you mind if I look at pictures on my phone?"

281
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,780
 This gets rough, guys.

282
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,420
 From here on out, you're like, "Jason, it started off rough.

283
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,980
 It started off rough."

284
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,660
 He said he's having this done.

285
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,720
 He's having this happy ending massage.

286
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
 He's getting masturbated, right?

287
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,180
 He's getting jacked off by this woman.

288
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,780
 I don't want to use all these euphemisms.

289
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,980
 He asks, "Can I look at my phone while you do that?"

290
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
 She doesn't care.

291
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,540
 Yeah, anything that'll get you off quicker and get you out of here.

292
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:09,460
 So he pulls up a photo of one of his daughters.

293
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,820
 Now he kind of plays it off like maybe he didn't plan on doing that in the first place,

294
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:19,220
 but he's looking at a picture of one of his daughters in a thong bikini.

295
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,280
 And he said that it was hard for him to even last.

296
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,520
 As he's looking at this photo of his daughter, I'm already second guessing about releasing

297
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
 this.

298
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,400
 As he's looking at the photo of his daughter, he goes, "It was so hard.

299
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,040
 I was so turned on, I couldn't even last that long because of it."

300
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,400
 And then after he was done, the masseuse kind of looked over at his phone and saw the picture

301
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,040
 of this girl on his phone.

302
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,240
 And she said, "Very pretty."

303
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,780
 He's complimenting this random girl, and he responded, "This is an actual quote from him.

304
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
 Thanks.

305
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,580
 She's my youngest."

306
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,940
 And then the last quote of this post was, "The look on the masseuse's face when she realized

307
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,180
 what I said was priceless.

308
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,220
 I can't wait to try this again."

309
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,820
 I saw that post, and I was like, "Oh my God, this guy's a monster."

310
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,620
 And I really kind of thought that would be the end.

311
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,220
 I really kind of hoped that would have been the end of it, right?

312
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,200
 But later on, I think I was planning on just mentioning that briefly about something.

313
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,200
 So I went back to this account, and I saw that he had posted more.

314
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,400
 And I was like, "Okay, whatever I was working on before, we've got to follow the trail of

315
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,200
 this villain, right?

316
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,600
 This man who he says his daughter's 18, which doesn't make it right.

317
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,640
 It doesn't mean, "Oh, well, she's over 18.

318
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,080
 You totally have sex with your daughter.

319
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,320
 She still doesn't make it right."

320
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,660
 But I don't think she's actually 18 years old.

321
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,060
 I mean, maybe, right?

322
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,300
 If that's his youngest, then he has multiple daughters, then maybe he's in his 50s, right?

323
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
 50s, 60s, years old.

324
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,940
 I don't know.

325
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:04,140
 He legally knows that even, morally, that even the Reddit incest confessions, I think,

326
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,580
 has a line, or at the very least, they rule.

327
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,860
 You know, you can't say anything.

328
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,820
 So let's go ahead a month in time.

329
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,600
 When he posted again in the same subreddit, he said that he's gone back to the massage

330
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,520
 parlor several more times.

331
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
 Whatever, right?

332
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,640
 The dude is getting happy and beans.

333
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,680
 That's not my beef with this guy, right?

334
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:33,920
 But then he says that he's starting to feel, quote, "extremely tempted by his daughter."

335
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,400
 He says the weather's been hot recently, so she's been wearing less clothing around the

336
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,920
 house.

337
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,780
 That makes me mad, right?

338
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,140
 That's her house, too.

339
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,380
 She's feeling comfortable there.

340
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,700
 Her guard's down.

341
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,540
 She doesn't know her father wants to have sex with her, so if she's walking around, she's

342
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060
 like, "Oh, man, sure is hot."

343
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,380
 And she throws on a pair of boxer shorts and a tank top.

344
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,500
 It's because she doesn't think that there's anyone around who is going to judge her sexually.

345
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,180
 Her guard is completely down.

346
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,380
 And as she's wearing this casual clothing, see, this is where we get to this dangerous

347
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,340
 stuff.

348
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,040
 He's seeing it as, "Oh, maybe she's trying to turn me on."

349
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,480
 See, his neurons are starting to get rewired.

350
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,760
 This is what we talk about when fetishes become obsessions.

351
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,520
 Your neurons start getting rewired.

352
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,920
 Your pleasure sensors change.

353
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,680
 He actually posted one point on the incest subreddit.

354
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,520
 He posted one of them was, "Maybe I've read too many of these incest stories."

355
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,420
 Like, he even knows that this is changing the way he's looking at his own flesh and

356
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
 blood.

357
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,420
 He never once mentions this as a stepdaughter.

358
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,180
 Again, not that would make a huge moral difference.

359
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,020
 But she's wearing clothes that are comfortable in the heat.

360
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,300
 Oh, man, she's tempting him, right?

361
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,980
 So he has been going to these happy ending parlors.

362
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,700
 That's doing pretty good for him, I guess.

363
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,900
 I mean, he keeps going back.

364
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,700
 Five stars on yelp.

365
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,480
 His daughter is tempting him at home, but he knows that he can't do anything.

366
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,280
 Now, according to him, this was all an accident.

367
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:22,480
 According to him, he accidentally hired a prostitute who looks like his daughter.

368
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,840
 On accident, right?

369
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
 Didn't mean it at all.

370
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,320
 He was going to the escort website, and he closed his eyes, and he scrolled his mouse

371
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,680
 and goes, "You!"

372
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,640
 He puts this, he says this in this post quote.

373
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,260
 She definitely looked different.

374
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
 She definitely looked different.

375
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,980
 But, when he had a butt to that, she definitely looked different.

376
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,260
 But her eyes, nose, and hair were uncanny.

377
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,940
 And from the back, I couldn't even tell the difference."

378
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,020
 Unquote.

379
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,620
 Then he says, just so all the other perverts on the board know what his intentions are.

380
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:11,960
 He says, quote, "I wasn't planning on asking her to pretend to be my daughter."

381
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,080
 But, and then he goes on to tell the story.

382
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,480
 He said, "She asked, the escort asked what fetishes I have.

383
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,720
 I believe they're meeting up at a hotel room at this point, or maybe her place, but I think

384
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,300
 it was a neutral location.

385
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,960
 She goes, "Do you have any fetishes?"

386
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,520
 And he said, "Well, since you asked, I want to have sex with my daughter."

387
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,900
 According to him, he accidentally chose an escort that looked like his daughter.

388
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,780
 And he didn't want to, he didn't come in with that intention.

389
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,060
 She asked, so I told her.

390
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
 He's with her.

391
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,460
 He doesn't want to do anything with his daughter until she brought it up.

392
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
 It said, "What fetishes do you have?"

393
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,780
 He goes, "Well, I've always wanted to have sex with my daughter."

394
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,600
 And then, that's a bomb to drop in any conversation, right?

395
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,660
 She said, "Why don't you call me by your daughter's name?"

396
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,460
 And they keep this thing going.

397
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,600
 He's now having sex with this escort and calling her his daughter's name.

398
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,120
 And the escort looks like the daughter.

399
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,720
 He's like, "Jayson, you don't have to review it.

400
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,960
 Please just continue.

401
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
 Just continue."

402
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,040
 And he has this thing where he keeps putting it on the other.

403
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
 It's not my fault.

404
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
 My daughter's tempting me.

405
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,400
 I didn't want to do this with the escort, but she brought up the fetish thing.

406
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,480
 And this is when he says, "Am I taking this too far?"

407
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,920
 Like, at this point, he realizes that maybe the fantasy is going a little too much.

408
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,680
 Am I taking this too far?

409
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,860
 The escort, though, before he's able to rationally think about that, the escort said, "Hey, next

410
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,280
 time," because obviously now you've got a hook in this guy, right?

411
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,520
 Next time, why don't you bring some of her clothes?

412
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,900
 Why don't you bring some of her clothes?

413
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,620
 And he ends this post by thinking, "Oh, yeah.

414
00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,500
 I can grab one of her bikinis, her cheerleading uniform, maybe her underwear."

415
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,200
 He's excited about this thought about what he-- again, he didn't think about this.

416
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
 She brought it up.

417
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,480
 He didn't think about this.

418
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,080
 And he's already thinking about this, cheerleading uniform.

419
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,200
 So he's done this now.

420
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,160
 He's had sex with this prostitute and pretended it was his daughter.

421
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,080
 And then he thinks, "Am I taking this too far?"

422
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,720
 And he ends the post again by re-asking that question, "Is this taking it too far, though?

423
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,660
 Part of it feels like it's good because it's helping me resist my temptations."

424
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,980
 That is used a lot in sex criminals, right?

425
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,260
 They go, "Well, I'll watch this really, really graphic pornography because it won't make

426
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,660
 me want to go out and do that."

427
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,220
 But that's never that-- we've never seen that throughline, right?

428
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,380
 Playing violent video games doesn't make you more violent.

429
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,580
 We know that that exists.

430
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,540
 Watching violent movies doesn't make you more violent.

431
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
 We know that exists.

432
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:04,920
 But watching depraved pornography that feeds into your fetish, there's a reason why pedophiles

433
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,800
 get caught with large amounts of child porn.

434
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,460
 There's a reason why people who commit necrophilia get caught with necrophilia porn.

435
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,960
 We see that throughline all the time.

436
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,360
 "Is this taking it too far, though?

437
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,160
 Part of it feels like it's good because it's helping me resist my temptations.

438
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,700
 Not I know that it's only making my lust for my daughter stronger."

439
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,980
 I don't think I've given you a time scale.

440
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,460
 This is taking place this year.

441
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,620
 This next post was posted on May 27th, 2022.

442
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,780
 So really, really recent stuff.

443
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,900
 There's still a chance to stop this.

444
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,780
 I don't know why I think Sherlock Holmes is listening to the podcast.

445
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,780
 He's like, "Indubitably.

446
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,460
 Let me figure out who this guy is."

447
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,080
 May 27th, 2022, he goes to see this prostitute again.

448
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
 And this time, remember, he had all those choices.

449
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,240
 He had all those choices.

450
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,880
 Cheerleader uniform, bikini, underwear.

451
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,080
 What he brings is actually now the reason why I thought she was younger.

452
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
 Now I remember.

453
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,120
 I didn't wasn't originally thinking that sicko.

454
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,800
 I was thinking that sicko.

455
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,240
 This was the clue that I go, "Oh, she's not 18."

456
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,420
 What he brought was his daughter's prom dress.

457
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,980
 So again, it's an icon of high school, right?

458
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:28,020
 Cheerleading uniform icon of high school, but also icon of college.

459
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,620
 You're not going to proms in college unless you're a dude and you're going to some senior

460
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,420
 girl's prom.

461
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:40,100
 He brings the prom dress, an icon of not only high school life, but high school, like

462
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,360
 the ending of being a girl and becoming a woman is the prom dress.

463
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
 Cheerleading uniforms, they have them all the time.

464
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,280
 They're something about a prom dress.

465
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,560
 It actually seems really, like totally fluffy and stuff.

466
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
 That doesn't seem like the best dress.

467
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,200
 You write that to the escort and she's like, "Okay, it's going to take me two hours to

468
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,600
 get in and out of this thing."

469
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,200
 He brings the daughter's prom dress and it was the hottest sex he'd ever had in his

470
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,600
 life.

471
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,100
 Being sex with this escort in his daughter's prom dress was the best sex ever.

472
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,260
 Oh, and I should add, he said it felt so real.

473
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,500
 He's still completely fantasized.

474
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 Just because he's like, "Oh, I love this prom dress.

475
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 Satin on silk?

476
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 This is beautiful."

477
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,260
 It's because he was still imagining his daughter.

478
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,340
 So then a little bit of time passes and he has two weeks of the house to himself.

479
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:40,560
 The rest of the family is gone and he has some money set aside.

480
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,200
 He has some money that I don't know if he's in that...

481
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,640
 Again, he doesn't give us a lot of details.

482
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,880
 Was he saving up for this event or did he just happen to have a lot of money set aside?

483
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,840
 He decides with the family gone from the house.

484
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,280
 You guys are like, "It's been a while to ride so far."

485
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,840
 With his family gone from his house.

486
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:16,540
 He decides to hire the escort for three days to live with him in the house and pretend to

487
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,880
 be his daughter.

488
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,140
 So for three days, that would be a couple thousand dollars, right?

489
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,820
 I don't know, a lot.

490
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,420
 For three days, I'm like, "You're like Jason Rowe."

491
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,340
 He can fixated over the weirdest details.

492
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,800
 You're like, "Oh, you're having my little calculator I'd have on that little accounting

493
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,840
 visor from those old 1940 movies."

494
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
 I'm like, "Wowee, that sure is a lot of money."

495
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,080
 Because I'm doing, he's paying an escort that looks like his daughter in his house and they

496
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,520
 would do it in her bed.

497
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,040
 So he's hired this woman.

498
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,400
 She only wore his daughter's clothing.

499
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,520
 She called him dad the whole time.

500
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
 Dad, daddy, they're walking around.

501
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:12,180
 He says this, he goes, "By day three, I almost forgot that she wasn't really my daughter.

502
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,220
 It was amazing.

503
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,060
 She would be wearing cute outfits of my daughters and I was finally able to live out my fantasy

504
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,100
 of ripping every one of those outfits off of her."

505
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:33,400
 I'm assuming she, the daughter, would come home and go, "What happened to all of my clothes?

506
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,100
 Why have they been shredded to pieces?"

507
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,340
 Apparently, he turns into a werewolf.

508
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,420
 And then he adds this quote, "My favorite place to have sex was, of course, my daughter's

509
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,220
 room to really make sure that you know how sick he is."

510
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,900
 And then, so you're like, "Jason, listen, man, people have fetishes.

511
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,340
 He's not actually, what do you want me to look at the photo of his daughter?

512
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
 They have any parlor.

513
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,660
 You forgot that part, huh?"

514
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,540
 Okay, okay, so, but he's not doing anything to her, right?

515
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,500
 It's that he's having this fantasy and he's not engaging in the reality.

516
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,020
 I mean, ignoring the first part of the story where he's looking at the photograph, ignoring

517
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,940
 the story of where when the daughter's walking around just being herself, being comfortable

518
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,140
 at home and their dad's like, "Ugh, she's tempting me."

519
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,260
 This is, this is really, like, I can't think of another way to end this.

520
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,020
 The doomsday clock is ticking.

521
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,660
 We're to this point, we're to the zenith of this man's sickness.

522
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,540
 Has this escorted over for three days?

523
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,340
 They're having sex in her bed, wearing her clothes.

524
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,780
 This is where you're just like done, right?

525
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
 You're done.

526
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:54,460
 Now, one of the hottest experiences was looking through old photo books of her and talk about

527
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:03,620
 how much she's grown as she lightly teased my cock.

528
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,460
 So whatever debates we had about how old she is now, now he's referencing younger photos

529
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:17,060
 of her and sexualizing her at a younger age, whether she's 18 or 15.

530
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,740
 Is it relevant at this point?

531
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,980
 Because now he's looking at young photos of her while he's with a prostitute.

532
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,740
 It's kind of mind blowing if you think about it.

533
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,340
 While he's with a prostitute dressed as his daughter looking at childhood photos and talking

534
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,860
 about how much she's grown.

535
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,980
 This is vomiting, this is so rough.

536
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,180
 And the reason why I think it's rough is because this isn't a true crime story where we have

537
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:47,140
 this guy locked up in jail or he's on the run and there's been this trial and there's

538
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,220
 all this stuff or whatever.

539
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,140
 This is happening now.

540
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,420
 That was posted on May 27th, 2022.

541
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,260
 I just checked his posting history before I started recording this episode.

542
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,340
 There is no additional parts to this saga.

543
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,700
 He's just posting on gross subreddits, meaning like, yeah, give it to her baby.

544
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,300
 Yeah, that's so hot.

545
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,580
 I wish I could do that.

546
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,100
 That's what all of his other posts are.

547
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,980
 We don't have any addition to this story.

548
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
 Did he make a move?

549
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,340
 Is he still planning on it?

550
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,100
 Is he still seeing this escort?

551
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,620
 Have things escalated so much he doesn't even feel comfortable talking about it.

552
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,780
 A subreddit full of incest lovers.

553
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,140
 But this is a true crime story.

554
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,580
 We covered a story like this before, right?

555
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,980
 A true crime story, but we have not seen technically the crime happen yet.

556
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,620
 We have unsolved true crimes.

557
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,500
 There's usually disturbing, right?

558
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,980
 There's a serial killer on the loose that's never been caught.

559
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,420
 Then we have solved true crime where the person's currently in trial or the person is already

560
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,140
 in prison or the suspect is dead or whatever.

561
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,180
 This is a true crime story in the making.

562
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:02,780
 This guy's a villain and he's going to cross the line.

563
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:11,180
 This guy at the very, very least will cease having a healthy relationship with his daughter.

564
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,020
 The very least, right?

565
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,460
 He will see her as a sex object.

566
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,100
 He may not have seen her as a sex object all of her life, but he definitely sees her as

567
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,820
 a sex object now.

568
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,540
 And every time she makes a funny joke or every time she leans her head up against him as

569
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,420
 they're sitting on the couch or every time she giggles at one of his stupid puns, he's

570
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,380
 going to read into it the same way that a guy does when he's talking to a cute girl at

571
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,580
 a coffee shop.

572
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,660
 She gives him that bright smile and goes, "Oh, I wonder if she's into me."

573
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,220
 But the difference is this is not my daughter at the coffee shop.

574
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,140
 I have no power over her.

575
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,940
 I'm not in charge of paying for her college.

576
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,780
 I'm not in charge of any sort of emotional support.

577
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,900
 I'm not in charge of any part of her life.

578
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,300
 And if I was, if I was the boss, that'd be sexual harassment, right?

579
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,020
 If I'm doing things untoward, is that a thing?

580
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,860
 I'm doing things I shouldn't do to my employees.

581
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,220
 At the very least, he's going to have an unhealthy relationship with his daughter.

582
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,580
 That's the very, very least.

583
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,580
 And you got, I don't really have to say what the worst thing to happen is, right?

584
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:27,740
 Like in his mind, I'm going to, I'm going to, but in his mind, if he successfully seduces

585
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,900
 his daughter, they'll have this super hot, "How do we want to go into it?

586
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
 I'm not saying it's hot.

587
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
 I'm saying for him, right?

588
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,340
 They're going to make whoopee and it'll be this lust filled journey.

589
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,340
 All of his fantasies will come true."

590
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,460
 We know that's not how this stuff works out, right?

591
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,980
 It would completely devastate the family.

592
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,900
 You go, you're just shredded in half.

593
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,260
 But, you know, he's the hero of his own story and he's rewired his brain to think that this

594
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,060
 type of stuff is normal.

595
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:05,100
 Even though in almost every human civilization, it's not, I mean, unless it's a survival situation,

596
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,140
 it's not.

597
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,100
 So he, he, he's just looking at the world through a porn sick point of view and he's

598
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
 on this subreddit.

599
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,180
 Again, that's why I hate Reddit, because these people can congregate and cheer each other

600
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
 on.

601
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,860
 And the posts that they leave stay there pretty much forever.

602
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,180
 The mods very rarely delete stuff and the people don't delete their accounts.

603
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,500
 They're proud of this stuff.

604
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,940
 So best case scenario, he just has a completely unhealthy relationship with his daughter from

605
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,940
 here on out.

606
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,540
 And even when he's 80 years old and the rest home and she comes in and brings in the grandkids

607
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,140
 to visit him, he's still going to have these weird messed up things floating around in

608
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,260
 his head.

609
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,540
 At the worst, he's going to try something.

610
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,700
 He's going to make a move.

611
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,300
 He's going to misread the room.

612
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,900
 And then the whole fallout from that, right?

613
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,780
 A true crime story when technically the crime hasn't happened yet.

614
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:08,300
 I mean, technically going to escorts and going again, having any miscarriages or all crimes.

615
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,740
 People get arrested for those all the time.

616
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,820
 But you know what I mean?

617
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:19,140
 Like the thrust of the crime, the narrative here hasn't happened yet.

618
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,900
 So we don't know how it ends or if it will ever end.

619
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,580
 Again, will this be something that just carries on through the decades?

620
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,580
 He becomes insanely jealous of her husband or any boyfriend she brings home like this.

621
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,620
 We've seen this stuff happen in true crime stories, right?

622
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,300
 We can trace these things back.

623
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,660
 And this is how they start.

624
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:43,500
 A man becoming obsessed with his own daughter, obsessed with having a sexual relationship.

625
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,740
 Not very loving, right?

626
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:51,660
 Again, not that it would matter, but again, he's viewing his daughter as a solely a sexual

627
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,980
 object.

628
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
 Absolutely terrifying.

629
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,060
 Again, this is, we want to think this is an aberration.

630
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,020
 And I do think for the most part it is an aberration, but there's a lot of aberrations

631
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,820
 out there.

632
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,500
 This guy is just going to keep on having these fantasies.

633
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 He's not going to stop.

634
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,980
 He's going to keep fueling it from reading more of these foreign posts and from watching

635
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,700
 incest pornography and just building this up in his system until he either completely

636
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,420
 abandons the whole thing before.

637
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,580
 I mean, he's gone pretty deep at this point, right?

638
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,740
 He hasn't crossed that line, but paying the hooker to come to your house for three days,

639
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,380
 dress up as your daughter and have sex in her bed.

640
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:42,300
 I mean, that's, I won't say you're past the point of no return, but you're getting

641
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
 there.

642
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
 You're getting there.

643
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,060
 Your foot's on that white line.

644
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:52,460
 You're coming close to stepping over.

645
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,580
 It's just, it's creepy.

646
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,660
 It's creepy because we don't know how the story ends yet.

647
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,940
 This story's going on right now.

648
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,980
 We don't know if it's going to happen for no one intended a happy ending or if it's going

649
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,500
 to be an absolutely tragic ending.

650
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,300
 We don't know.

651
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,540
 We just can sit and watch, not even watch, wait for the next post to come out.

652
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,060
 Don't subscribe to this guy.

653
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,860
 Don't be like, all right, I'm bored.

654
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
 I wonder what's going on.

655
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,380
 This dude sickos life.

656
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,460
 But again, like a true crime in the making.

657
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,920
 Will he make the ultimately disgusting decision?

658
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,700
 Will he back off and realize that this was wrong?

659
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,180
