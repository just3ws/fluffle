1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Today, it's Vigilante Day.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,500
 What would it take before you took the law into your own hands?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,840
 And then we traveled to Glasgow, Scotland to take a look at a group of vigilantes who

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,800
 armed themselves to hunt down a child-killing monster.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,360
 But these vigilantes were children themselves, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:32,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
 It's Vigilante Day.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,720
 I just came up with that.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
 I didn't plan on it.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,920
 Just both stories that I picked.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,120
 I was like, oh, they both involve vigilantes.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,120
 So here we go.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
 It's a vigilante day.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,960
 I think everybody loves a good vigilante story.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,920
 First off, let's give a shout out to a legacy Patreon, a longtime supporter of the show.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
 Matthew McKenzie.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,680
 Matthew, thank you so much for supporting the show.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,480
 We're handing you over the keys of the carpenter copter.

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
 You're going to be flying us around.

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,560
 You're going to be doing stunts, whoop-de-loops and so whatever that is.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,200
 We're going to be doing some stuff like that.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,280
 You can't support the Patreon.

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
 That's fine too.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
 Just help get the word out about the show.

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
 That really, really helps a lot.

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,320
 We also have a merch store if you want to buy some merch.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,280
 Because I always sleep on the merch, not literally.

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
 But I do have a dope Dead Rabbit shirt.

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
 So if you guys want some Dead Rabbit merch, we got that as well.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 Matthew, let's go.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,920
 Oh, oh, and let me say this too.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
 You'll notice new...

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
 Matthew, Matthew, you got all excited?

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
 No, no, no, slow down.

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,600
 I'm not getting the copter yet.

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,320
 You'll notice there's new episode art for this episode.

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,240
 This is from Robert Paulson.

41
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,360
 His name was Robert Paulson.

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
 You remember that name.

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,720
 You remember that name.

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,760
 Robert Paulson created this.

45
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
 Robert Paulson actually made this as a flyer.

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,720
 So there's QR codes.

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 One takes you to the website.

48
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,800
 One takes you to the Patreon.

49
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 It's awesome.

50
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 I really, really love it.

51
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
 We're going to put it up.

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,400
 We're going to put it in our flyer download on our website.

53
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,840
 You can download flyers and that's another great way to get the word out about the show.

54
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,720
 Print out flyers, hang them up around your town.

55
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 That really helps a lot.

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,600
 That's joining our flyer army.

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
 And it might appear every once in a while in our episode artwork.

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
 I have to see how it looks as a little iTunes.

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,480
 But I like it.

60
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 I like it a lot.

61
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,560
 So thank you, Robert Paulson.

62
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,000
 Your sacrifice was not in vain now.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
 I think McKinsey the whole time is like, "It's time to fly, it's time to fly."

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
 It's time to fly now.

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,920
 Let's go ahead, hobbin' that carboner copter.

66
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,080
 We are headed out to Omaha, Nebraska.

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
 We're not in the helicopter yet.

68
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,240
 That's just Matthew makin' those noises with his mouth.

69
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,040
 It's May 16th, 2020.

70
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
 Now we're in the carboner cop.

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,880
 So this just happened a couple weeks ago.

72
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,960
 We're headed out to Omaha, Nebraska.

73
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,760
 All the houses were made by the first little pig.

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
 Made out of corn husks.

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,800
 And there we're going to meet a man named James Fairbanks.

76
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,360
 He's 43 years old, father, recently divorced.

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
 He's looking for a new place to stay.

78
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,320
 He's looking in the area, he's drinking a cup of coffee.

79
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,400
 No one drinks coffee like that.

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
 Drinking some coffee.

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,160
 He gets a little bug in his brain and he goes, "Hmm, I'm going to check the Megan's Law database

82
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 in this area.

83
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
 I'm going to take a look here and see what's going on."

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,800
 Now if you don't know what Megan's Law database is, because I know a lot of people in other

85
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,240
 countries listen to the show in America, they have this thing.

86
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,760
 In most states, most counties, you can put in your zip code and it will tell you what

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,360
 you, who all these registered sexual offenders are in your area.

88
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,520
 And he pulls that up and he sees a name, Mateo Condolucci, 64 year old dude.

89
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,800
 He's looking at it and it will usually show the charges, two counts of rape against children.

90
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 Look, he begins doing research on this guy.

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,400
 He finds a trail of victims.

92
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,080
 He had been convicted of two counts of rape against children.

93
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,600
 Served two years in prison.

94
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,720
 There's two separate incidents.

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,880
 It's like, he did it, he got busted, he did it again, he got busted.

96
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,120
 Only two years total in prison.

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,440
 But there's many more than just two victims.

98
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,640
 Those are just the two that I was actually held accountable for.

99
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,720
 One of the kids that he abused, when that child grew up, the little boy grew up, got

100
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,440
 addicted to drugs, died of an overdose.

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,080
 The child's mother had a Facebook page saying, "Somebody needs to stop this guy.

102
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
 He's hurting children.

103
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
 He killed my child.

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 He killed my child.

105
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
 He ruined my child's life.

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
 My child got into drugs."

107
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:26,440
 James, an otherwise normal man, all of a sudden is having a terrible, terrible day.

108
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,360
 But nothing compared to what the children went through.

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,980
 But he feels something in him go.

110
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,120
 Something has to happen here.

111
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,000
 He sees this and he is so enraged.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,680
 He drives to Matteo's house.

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,760
 He sees Matteo washing his car.

114
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,280
 She's washing it, so open it down, spraying it with water.

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,680
 And James is watching this in the middle of the day and he realizes this very, very quickly.

116
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,320
 Matteo is not washing his car.

117
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,280
 He's watching a group of kids play across the street.

118
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,040
 And James is just gripping that wheel right there.

119
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,480
 And when the kids go inside, Matteo, his car is magically clean now.

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
 What great timing.

121
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,280
 Matteo goes inside as well.

122
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,480
 And James creeps over and peeks over the fence and notices that Matteo's backyard is pretty

123
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,320
 open and it has little playground equipment.

124
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,880
 If the children of the neighborhood want to come over, they can just walk into his backyard.

125
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,840
 On May 16th, 2020, the police go to Matteo Condolucci's house.

126
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,480
 They find him dead.

127
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,920
 There seems to be no reason that they think it's a murder.

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,200
 A 64 year old man, dead in his house.

129
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,720
 I don't see any proof that they actually opened a homicide investigation at that time.

130
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,360
 To be honest, knowing this guy's reputation, they probably didn't care.

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,800
 That two days later, on May 18th, an email sent from the account StopPredators was sent

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
 to local media and to a Facebook page called the Omaha Scanner, which dealt with local issues,

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,320
 local law enforcement.

134
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,960
 And this email was titled, "I Killed Matteo Condolucci Thursday, May 14th."

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,040
 It goes into, and it's basically James' confession.

136
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,000
 He doesn't state his name in the email, but he tells them what he did.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,200
 The email ends with him giving a detail, it's blanked out of the actual email, a detail

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,640
 that only the murderer would know.

139
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,520
 In the email, we have this quote, "I've worked with kids for years who have been victimized,

140
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,960
 and I couldn't in good conscience allow him to do it to anyone else while I had the means

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,120
 to stop him.

142
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,120
 I'm willing to turn myself in, even though I'm confident I wouldn't be caught because

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,960
 it's my opinion that we need to fix this in our society.

144
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,040
 We cannot let this continue to happen to our children.

145
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,680
 They must be stopped.

146
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,840
 I know in this messed up judicial system that means I will face far more severe punishment

147
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,440
 for stopping him than he did for raping kids, but I can no longer do nothing."

148
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
 He probably could have gotten away with it.

149
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
 Again, I don't know what the cause of death was, but it didn't look like the police were

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
 looking into him.

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,840
 He does get arrested for it, and he gets charged with first degree murder because it's 100%

152
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
 premeditated.

153
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,600
 A petition starts at the time as I was researching the story, which is about a week ago.

154
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
 It had 15,000 signatures.

155
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,200
 When James walks into jail, the convicts stood up, walking through the jail.

156
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,480
 The other dudes, all the other prisoners are clapping for him.

157
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:50,000
 Condalucci's own daughter supports James being released from jail.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,040
 Amanda Henry has this amazing quote about this.

159
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:00,560
 It's a horrible thing that he chose to be the one to give up everybody he loved just

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 to try to protect children that aren't even his.

161
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,960
 So yeah, a true sacrifice, a hero.

162
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,600
 And here, I'm not, you know, it's a tough story because I'm not a huge fan of murder.

163
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,360
 I mean, I don't know many people who are, they have a little penance.

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,600
 This is as murder.

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,120
 This guy just kept beating the system though.

166
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,080
 Like at a certain point, like, you just get fed up.

167
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,040
 You just get fed up and you're just watching this guy over and over and over again beat

168
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
 the system.

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,560
 And in a perfect world, he would have not gotten out of prison, right?

170
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,120
 In a perfect world, James wouldn't have had to make this sacrifice.

171
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,680
 And hopefully, this is all taken into account.

172
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,040
 And a jury finds him guilty of a lesser crime, because he is guilty.

173
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
 He did commit the crime.

174
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
 He's not denying that.

175
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,120
 Hopefully, he doesn't get a life sentence or a super long sentence or that.

176
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,440
 I'd much rather live in a community where you have people like James Fairbanks than

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,240
 live in a community with people like Mattel.

178
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,360
 And I think that's pretty much how everyone would choose to live.

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,680
 It's unfortunate that James may have to make that decision, but yeah.

180
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,520
 So anyways, bit of a downer story.

181
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,720
 Let's go ahead and hop back in that carbonicopter.

182
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,280
 Matthew, we're going to go up, up and away.

183
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,200
 We're leaving behind local superhero.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 I don't know.

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,720
 Again, he did murder a guy, right?

186
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
 Like I think that's the big thing.

187
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,200
 We would prefer our heroes not to have to murder people.

188
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,400
 But anyways, everything becomes morally gray.

189
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,880
 The whole landscape becomes morally gray as we're leaving behind Omaha, Nebraska.

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,000
 We are headed out to Glasgow, Scotland.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,560
 This story was recommended by Emperor Ezekiel.

192
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,400
 So thank you so much for recommending this story.

193
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
 They're really, really helpful.

194
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
 That's really cool.

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,360
 And Matthew, you're flying that carbonicopter.

196
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:54,120
 And as we're flying towards Glasgow, we see an old steelworks flame shooting up into the

197
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,760
 sky smoke, bluah, bluah, belching up.

198
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,560
 It looks like that bad guy's headquarters from Captain Power and the Soldiers of the

199
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
 Future.

200
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,040
 For the three people who remember that show, helicopters flying in between the giant steam

201
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,120
 stacks, bluah, bluah.

202
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
 I should get a job as a Foley artist.

203
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,280
 We're in the year 1954.

204
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,480
 It's September 23rd.

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,920
 We're going to land a little bit away from a little elementary school.

206
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,560
 And these kids are talking excitedly about something that's going on.

207
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
 Did you see?

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
 Did you see what happened?

209
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,520
 I didn't see it.

210
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,680
 Govna?

211
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,640
 But with my peepas, I saw her tell somebody it.

212
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,000
 What does that even mean, you weirdo?

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
 The kids are talking excitedly at school.

214
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
 Did you see it?

215
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
 Did you see it?

216
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,600
 Ah, yes, matey.

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,880
 I saw it.

218
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,160
 He was seven feet tall he was, with teeth made of iron he was.

219
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,960
 My one man show of a Christmas Carol coming soon.

220
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,240
 And the kids are like, that's super spooky, right?

221
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,640
 Too spooky.

222
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:12,320
 The kids were talking about a creature that was spotted at the Southern Necropolis.

223
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,000
 A long time ago, back in 1849, apparently there was just a bunch of people dying in

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Scotland.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
 They needed an affordable cemetery.

226
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,640
 So they built this thing called the Southern Necropolis.

227
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,760
 Now it's affordable to the point where there's 250,000 bodies buried in this place.

228
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
 I don't even know how that's possible.

229
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,120
 I don't think I've ever seen that many people in one location ever, let alone buried on

230
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
 top of each other.

231
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,400
 But you have this graveyard, it's called the Southern Necropolis, and then right next

232
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,740
 to it is a steelworks.

233
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:53,400
 So that's where you have the, ah, the smoke, ah, shooting up into the sky flames.

234
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,680
 CGI robots flying around it, trying to destroy the soldiers of the future.

235
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,760
 The kids were adamant.

236
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,160
 They saw a vampire there.

237
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,360
 Seven foot tall vampire with steel teeth.

238
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,920
 But it wasn't just that there was a monster in the community, that's spooky enough.

239
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:21,320
 This vampire was responsible for eating two children.

240
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,440
 Flame shooting up, dark black smoke.

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,000
 Vampire eating children.

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,200
 It was a very, very horrible, horrifying image for anyone.

243
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,560
 Horrifying image for anyone, but for kids especially.

244
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,680
 I mean, actually no back to the bits.

245
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
 Horrifying for anyone.

246
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,280
 No one's like, ah, it's quite quaint.

247
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,840
 It's like the monster squad, but more violent.

248
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,280
 The kids decide to hunt the vampire themselves.

249
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,520
 Now what's interesting is that this story was in all the local schools.

250
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,320
 It wasn't confined to one school.

251
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,720
 So at 3pm when all the schools got out, you had hundreds of kids descend upon the cemetery.

252
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,880
 Armed with knives, bats, crucifixes, couple kids brought their dogs.

253
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 [mimics dog noises]

254
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,600
 Santa Fextra, on point this episode, aren't they?

255
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,160
 [mimics dog noises]

256
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,560
 Coming out of the dog's mouth, an eagle.

257
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,120
 [mimics dog noises]

258
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,720
 Turned into a crow and started flying around.

259
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,720
 And then there was a garbage truck backing up.

260
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,240
 [mimics dog noises]

261
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
 All the sound effects.

262
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
 [mimics dog noises]

263
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,360
 A wolf saw a sexy wolf walk by.

264
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,200
 Now hundreds of kids in a cemetery is bad enough.

265
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
 Basically you're just asking for trouble.

266
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,240
 Hundreds of armed kids in a cemetery.

267
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,080
 Hundreds of kids in general in any location is bad.

268
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,840
 Because you're going to have chaos.

269
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,800
 Now they're walking around knives, bats, crucifixes.

270
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,520
 I get bringing a crucifix to hunt a vampire.

271
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,840
 But dude, you're better off just bringing two knives and making a cross at the last

272
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 minute.

273
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 Because when it comes down to it, I don't know if that's really going to work.

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,120
 All the crucifix is going to do is make it so the vampire doesn't attack you.

275
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,680
 You hold up the crucifix, it goes [mimics dog noises]

276
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,720
 and then sees the kid standing next to you.

277
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
 Mwah!

278
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
 It eats him.

279
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,520
 Now you had hundreds of kids descend from all these different schools.

280
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,560
 People in the area were obviously calling the police being like, "You better get down

281
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
 here."

282
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,840
 Kids with knives and they're right next to this factory and they're chasing something

283
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 around the graveyard.

284
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 We don't know what it is.

285
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,240
 We're too scared of the graveyard to go check it out.

286
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
 The police show up.

287
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,080
 The kids will not listen to the police.

288
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 They won't do it.

289
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,840
 The police are like, "Get out of here, you scamps!"

290
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,200
 And they're like, "No!

291
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,640
 We won't go!

292
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,200
 We won't go!

293
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,360
 Gotta kill the vampire who ate two of our buddies!"

294
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,720
 It's not really good for a chance, but they're trying.

295
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,720
 They're just kids.

296
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,320
 They said the oldest of the kids were 14.

297
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,600
 Some of them were like six.

298
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 Which the idea of a six-year-old carrying around a butcher knife is quite adorable.

299
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,480
 But anyway, so that's all going on.

300
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,400
 Police are, they can't round up all these kids.

301
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
 They're completely outnumbered.

302
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
 The kids are armed.

303
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,240
 So the police go to the next authority they can think of.

304
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,040
 They get the principal, local principal to come out there and be like, "Get back!

305
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 Go!

306
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 Go home!"

307
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
 The kids still are saying, "No, there's a vampire here.

308
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
 He ate two kids.

309
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 We have to kill this guy."

310
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,000
 And of course the adults don't believe in vampires.

311
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Go home.

312
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,160
 The kids remained there.

313
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
 The cops couldn't get him out.

314
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,360
 The principal couldn't get him out.

315
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,320
 It wasn't until it started raining that the kids finally go, "It's a little damp out here.

316
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
 Aren't you a little cold?"

317
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,800
 I didn't, I was wearing my Monster Hunter tank top.

318
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,880
 I didn't wear my Monster Hunter hoodie.

319
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,000
 So the kids slowly filter out of the graveyard and eventually the cops are able to round

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,240
 up the few stragglers.

321
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,720
 But the kids still know there's a vampire out there.

322
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,400
 They come back the next day and the day after that, but less numbers each time.

323
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,840
 Now while they're at the graveyard, the kids keep saying, "I saw the vampire, saw the

324
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
 vampire."

325
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
 And the adults are like, "It's the trick of the light."

326
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,720
 It was that other kid with the knife running looking for a vampire.

327
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
 You saw him.

328
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,120
 It was the flames exploding out of the tops of those stacks, casting long shadows.

329
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,840
 There are no such things as vampires.

330
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,800
 And what's funny is, as these things often are, this became huge news.

331
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 The first off, the parents went to the cops and were like, "There's no vampires."

332
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,720
 The cops were like, "Are you scared of vampires too?"

333
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,000
 And the parents were like, "Listen, okay, I might be a little scared of vampires."

334
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,360
 My first question is, are there any missing kids?

335
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,320
 And the police go, "There are no local missing kids.

336
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,480
 All kids are accounted for in Glasgow.

337
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,240
 There are no missing kids.

338
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,900
 There's no murdered kids."

339
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,800
 So what these kids are talking about did not happen.

340
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,920
 And so then now the parents could sleep with their lights off again.

341
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,120
 They go, "Something has to be done about this."

342
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,320
 And this story, becoming a national story in Scotland, was actually used to pass legislation

343
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
 against comic books.

344
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,080
 People were blaming Chamber of Horrors and Tales from the Crypt and all these comic books

345
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,360
 for causing, like, look at what comic books are doing to the youth.

346
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,000
 They're making them go crazy.

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,720
 They're making them run around graveyards with knives.

348
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,320
 You shouldn't be doing that until they're at least 19.

349
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 So this incident was used to censor comic books.

350
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,400
 And there was a big push for that back in the '60s and things like that.

351
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,840
 Here's an interesting-- and that's really where the story ends factually, but let's

352
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,760
 take a look at some interesting details with this thing.

353
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,520
 There were no missing kids in Glasgow, Scotland, in this time period.

354
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,200
 But who's to say that the kids weren't from out of town?

355
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
 And you go, "Jason, you're really grasping at straws."

356
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,840
 No, hold on.

357
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,800
 Vampires aren't nomadic.

358
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,160
 And the story wasn't that two kids had been eaten that were locals.

359
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,600
 It was that kids had seen two children be devoured by a vampire.

360
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,240
 The story wasn't, "I know who got eaten by the vampire."

361
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,160
 It was a little Sally and little Billy.

362
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,560
 It was that a vampire at the graveyard was eating children.

363
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,000
 It's possible that this-- and again, we're putting on our cryptid caps here.

364
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,120
 So we're going to be in the realm that this might be possible.

365
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,440
 It could be that this creature was eating corpses of children.

366
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,560
 You're like, "Jason, this--

367
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,680
 I'm taking off my cryptid cap and throwing it on the ground.

368
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,960
 That's disgusting.

369
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,440
 You did not prepare me for that in any way, shape, or form."

370
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,640
 Sorry about that.

371
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,120
 It could be-- put your cap back up, put it on.

372
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
 It could be that this thing that a local kid was watching this monster eat.

373
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,240
 The corpses of children, it could be that these children were from out of town, that

374
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,120
 they came with the vampire they were captive.

375
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,680
 What I find interesting about the story is two main details.

376
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,600
 First up, yes, rumours mass hysteria, they spread very quickly.

377
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,000
 And in 1954, when you didn't have cell phones or social media or instant messaging, how

378
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 did it go?

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,760
 Because at all the schools in the area, they were talking about it all day long.

380
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,840
 By the time 3 PM rolled around, you had kids from all the different schools showing up.

381
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,560
 The rumour started that morning.

382
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,560
 How did it spread to all the other schools so quickly?

383
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,920
 Here's my theory.

384
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,240
 If you had a group of kids who went to different schools, who lived in the same neighborhood,

385
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,360
 but went to different schools, different grade levels.

386
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
 And they saw this action happen.

387
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,400
 They would tell their respective schools.

388
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,160
 The rumour exploded in that day.

389
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,680
 So if it was at one school, let's say someone made it up is what I'm going.

390
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,720
 Let's say someone went to Strawberry Point Elementary School and they go and they make

391
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 it up.

392
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,040
 You would have all the kids from that school go, but the fact that you had other schools

393
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,160
 in the area also just makes me think there were multiple points of this rumour starting.

394
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,440
 And today that wouldn't be weird at all because the person in school A would be messaging

395
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,120
 the people in schools B, C, and D. But back then you would have to have, if it was completely

396
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,960
 made up, you would have to have the same myth made up in each school on the same day.

397
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
 So we have that.

398
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,520
 If it's completely made up, we have multiple origins of the same myth.

399
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,000
 If it was made up, you would have different versions of it at each school, still culminating

400
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,440
 in a 3pm meetup.

401
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,400
 There's an old story, like an old rhyme in that area about a creature.

402
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,320
 It's like a boogeyman version has iron teeth.

403
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,160
 I think that's where that comes from.

404
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,840
 But again, that legend, the story of the boogeyman with iron teeth in Glasgow, Scotland is old.

405
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,840
 So why would on that day it become a big story?

406
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,920
 Unless that morning, most likely that morning, there was activity seen that made them believe

407
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
 that was real.

408
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,880
 Even on the day before, on the way home from school, they may have seen it, but you don't

409
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,800
 have that mass communication like we have today.

410
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
 So that's an interesting detail.

411
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 It's not a deal breaker.

412
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,760
 It's an interesting detail, but there's one other interesting detail.

413
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,920
 The kids are adamant that there's the creature there.

414
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,520
 So let's assume that they did see something eating kids and the myth was the same.

415
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,160
 That's why you'd have multiple ignition points at other schools because it's a true story.

416
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,200
 If it was fake, you would have that game of telephone where it would morph each time.

417
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,960
 You'd have a group of kids from run school going to fight an alien, a group of kids from

418
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
 other school going to fight Loch Ness.

419
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,800
 We have the same story being told across multiple schools on the same day building to a critical

420
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,640
 mass.

421
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,720
 They have the vampire cornered.

422
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,560
 Vampires hunt single individuals, but especially if they're praying on children and we're not

423
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,440
 talking about the toughest of the tough vampires, when you have hundreds of children to send

424
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,320
 armed to the teeth, no pun intended, to kill you, where are you going to go?

425
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 Please show up.

426
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
 You're like, oh thank god, law enforcement's here because these kids are going to find me.

427
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 They're going to kill me.

428
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 The kids won't leave.

429
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
 Principal shows up.

430
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
 Oh man, finally.

431
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 Can I finally get out?

432
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
 I'm barely hiding.

433
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,920
 It was got me like three or four times if they'd look over here.

434
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
 And so here's the thing.

435
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,600
 So they're hunting the vampire.

436
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,760
 They haven't cornered.

437
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,880
 They keep seeing a move in the shadows.

438
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,640
 Police can't get them to budge.

439
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,080
 Principal can't get them to budge.

440
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
 Starts raining.

441
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,760
 The kids go home.

442
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,280
 As I read that I thought, you know what?

443
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
 I'm going to bet money.

444
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,160
 I'm going to bet money that I am right on my hunch.

445
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,320
 I looked it up.

446
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,040
 I owe myself money.

447
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:07,160
 One of the most obscure powers a vampire has is the ability to control the weather.

448
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,960
 There's one of Dracula's original powers.

449
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,080
 Able to create fog, mist, or storms.

450
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,520
 The perfect cover for a vampire, right?

451
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,320
 The vampire would never have expected hundreds of kids to show up out of the blue.

452
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,840
 Corner him.

453
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
 Possibly kill him.

454
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,680
 Even though he's seven feet tall, hundreds of anything can quickly overpower you.

455
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,640
 When the police show up and don't disperse the kids, the vampire begins to panic.

456
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,400
 When the principal shows up and the kids still stay, the vampire believes that it may be time

457
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
 to pull out his trump card.

458
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,680
 It causes it to rain.

459
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,720
 The kids file out of the graveyard one by one.

460
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,400
 The kids would return the next two days.

461
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
 They wouldn't find the vampire.

462
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,720
 The vampire had moved on by then.

463
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,320
 Lucky that he had gotten away from such a large mob.

464
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,240
 It had been a century since that many people had tried hunting him at once.

465
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,840
 Nowadays the vampire is a fairy tale, a legend that only children believe.

466
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,680
 So as he leaves behind the southern necropolis, he's on the hunt once again for his next

467
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
 meal.

468
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,440
 Monsters like the Glasgow Vampire kind of remind us what it's like to be a kid.

469
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,520
 When everything was scary, when monsters were real, and more importantly where we could

470
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,920
 take a stand against the darkness.

471
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,560
 But as we get older we realize that stories like the Glasgow Vampire most likely aren't

472
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
 real.

473
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,600
 It'd be nice if they were not the child eating thing, but it would be nice if the world was

474
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,560
 the forces of good versus the forces of monsters.

475
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,360
 But that's the world's far more complicated than that.

476
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,240
 Because in the real world we have James and we have Mateo.

477
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,240
 And James is by all accounts a hero, sure.

478
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,480
 But he should have never had to step up to that plate.

479
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,040
 The justice system should have taken care of that monster.

480
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,320
 The justice system should have put a stake through that vampire's heart.

481
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,920
 So the monsters aren't as clear in the real world.

482
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,160
 Because even though we can identify that that is a sick man, he does sick things, we as

483
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,920
 a society can't seem to agree on how to take care of that monster.

484
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,520
 If the evil of the world was really seven feet tall with steel teeth who hung out in

485
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,040
 graveyards we would all be in agreement on how to deal with it.

486
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:26,400
 It would be nice if the world was divided up between humans and the forces of darkness.

487
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:48,800
 So that's just a fairy tale.

488
00:24:48,800 --> 00:25:00,320
 Bye.

489
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,900
 (upbeat music)
