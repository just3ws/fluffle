1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
 A young man visits the doctor, complaining of excruciating testicular pain.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,880
 Little did he know he was about to make medical history.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,280
 Then we meet a man who claims that the Second Coming of Christ already walks among us.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,600
 He's actually doing interviews with CNN trying to announce to the world his glory.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 But the mainstream media is silencing.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
 Jesus Christ.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:43,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,440
 I hope you guys have some fun plans for this weekend.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,160
 I want to give you guys a heads up.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,880
 Next week will be the last week of season 15.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,680
 After next week, I'm going to take two weeks off.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,160
 I really didn't want to do this in October, but it's just the way that everything worked

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
 out.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,880
 I got to take my two weeks off every 50 episodes just to recharge.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,600
 Otherwise, I don't want the show to ever become a chore.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
 So I need these two weeks too.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,440
 But we're going to do one more week at the beginning of October.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,080
 We're going to have my birthday episode.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,520
 You're like, "Woohoo."

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,200
 And then, after that amazing spectacular, I'm going to continue the week.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,880
 There'll be other episodes, right?

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
 That's not the last one.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,360
 I'll take two weeks off and then we'll be back for the week before Halloween.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,480
 So I got some goodness planned, but I just don't have the energy to do it right now.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,400
 But you know who has tons of energy?

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,000
 One of our legacy Patreon supporters, a longtime supporter of the show, a longtime YouTube supporter.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,480
 Give it up for Team Ad.

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,200
 Everyone give a round of applause to Team Ad as he's walking into Dead or Abacame.

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,800
 Team Ad, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,520
 Just help spread the word about you.

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,800
 You're not going to want to support the Patreon after this episode.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,320
 You're like, "I don't know what episode I'm going to end up on."

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,560
 But if you can't support the Patreon even after this episode, that's okay.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,720
 Just help spread the word about the show.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,200
 Really, really helps out a lot.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,760
 Team Ad, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,800
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,200
 We are sailing all the way out to a hospital somewhere.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,360
 Oh, that's us.

45
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,360
 That's us rowing this boat.

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,000
 This isn't from a medical journal.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
 So we don't have names.

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,040
 We don't have locations.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,640
 This guy's secret must be kept.

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
 I'm sure the scientists after they finished writing this report, they all just shot themselves

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
 in the head.

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,760
 They're like, "This knowledge is too horrible for this world."

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,160
 In this medical journal, it tells the story of a man.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,320
 Let's call him Keith.

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,320
 Keith is a 33-year-old man.

56
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,360
 Now he has a history of illegal drug use.

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,400
 So smoking the doobie, maybe like eating some mushrooms, maybe a little cocaine here and

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
 there.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,760
 But it's in the past.

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
 He doesn't do them.

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,480
 He's not in the midst of the doctors.

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
 At least he comes in.

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
 He's all shaken.

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,960
 I need painkillers.

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,320
 He has a history of illegal drug use.

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,800
 He goes to the hospital and he's like, "Doc, you got to treat me.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,640
 My testicles hurt really, really bad."

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,960
 The doctors start asking questions like, "Okay, how long have they hurt?"

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,920
 And his answer is the first part of this bizarre mystery.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,960
 So I'm going to post it to you.

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,440
 How long, how many days would it take for your testicles to hurt before you went to the doctor?

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 And ladies, your ovaries.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
 It doesn't matter.

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 It doesn't matter.

75
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 It doesn't matter.

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,360
 Anything down there, how many days would you have to say you used the term excruciating

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
 pain?

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,880
 How many days would your testicles or ovaries have to hurt before you went to the doctor?

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
 Me, zero, right?

80
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
 They're good three hours.

81
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,360
 I'm like, "Ahh, I can't take it anymore."

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,960
 He waited five days.

83
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,400
 He must not have insurance or something.

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
 I don't know.

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,240
 Or he's just like, "Oh, it'll go away.

86
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
 It'll go away."

87
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,800
 It's their throbbing cartoon-like.

88
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
 They're like the size of grapefruits.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,000
 Anyways, five days of excruciating testicular pain.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,080
 And while he's there, this is not why he went to the doctor.

91
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,440
 The testicular pain is not the reason why he's in a medical journal.

92
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,000
 That's normal, unfortunately.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,320
 As they're treating this testicle pain, he goes, "Hey, you know, while I'm here, I was

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,200
 wondering if you could take a look at something else while you're down there, while you're

95
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,960
 in that region?"

96
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,800
 There's been this weird thing that's going on.

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,600
 And the doctor's like, "What?

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 That's weird."

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,720
 I mean, he's a veteran doctor, right?

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,640
 This isn't his first time someone's passed gas in his facility.

101
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,720
 He realizes he's like, "Check in this guy's testicles out."

102
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,680
 And his face gets farted on.

103
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,800
 That's weird.

104
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,000
 This man, I'm looking right at his crotch, and he clearly farted on my face.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
 How did that happen?

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,040
 He's thinking, "The doctor's flummoxed.

107
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
 That doesn't make any sense.

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,040
 If he was behind him, the fart would have hit his face."

109
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,640
 But he felt like the gas.

110
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,880
 He felt like the air pressure change.

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,560
 He's like, "What?"

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,520
 And Keith goes, "Oh yeah, sorry.

113
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,200
 Since you're down there, I probably should have warned you.

114
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,840
 I passed gas out of my penis."

115
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
 This is a true story.

116
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
 This is a set up for a joke or anything like that.

117
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,880
 This guy, when he farts, it comes out of his penis.

118
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,760
 And the doctor's like, "That's ridiculous.

119
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
 That's ridiculous.

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,160
 He's giving him a bunch of ruby hair.

121
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,120
 He's giving him a bunch of beans to make him carbonated.

122
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,360
 He's like, "We must test this."

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,480
 And then the guy goes, "Okay, to be fair, I don't know what happened in this sequence

124
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 of events.

125
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,680
 The medical journal just had at least four symptoms.

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,280
 But in our version of it, Keith goes, "Oh, you know what?

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,600
 You made me eat all those beans because you have some weird fart fetish.

128
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 You big pervert."

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,080
 I have to go to the bathroom.

130
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,240
 I have to go number two."

131
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,040
 So he goes to a urinal, which is just conveniently in the doctor's office for the sake of the

132
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,440
 narrative.

133
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,600
 And the doctor's like, "That's weird.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,080
 He said he was going to go number two, which is the universal thing for poop.

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,680
 But he's facing..."

136
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
 No.

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,960
 No way.

138
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,840
 And the doctor's watching the doctor develop the new fetish this day.

139
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,800
 This is true.

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,880
 This is true.

141
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
 The guy begins pooping.

142
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,480
 I can't believe this is true, but it is.

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,200
 This guy begins pooping out of his penis.

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,400
 Now you go, Jason.

145
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
 This is clearly fake.

146
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,040
 Did you find this on April Fool's Day?

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
 This is clearly not true.

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,760
 Well, I didn't find it on April Fool's Day.

149
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,720
 But I did find it in the India Times.

150
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
 So, but anyways, there is a...

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,400
 Everyone just shut off the podcast.

152
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,360
 Even people in India, they're like, "That's a rag.

153
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
 Click."

154
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,120
 I did find the medical journal it was reported on.

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:13,360
 It was reported in Cures.com, which actually now sounds like a totally fake medical journal.

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
 It's funny because you read stuff all the time, but you don't pronounce it out loud.

157
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
 Cures.com.

158
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,040
 So I haven't even gotten to the title of...

159
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,160
 None of this is the title of it, right?

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,280
 The man who peed poop.

161
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,720
 They could have titled it "The man who farts out of his weiner."

162
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,520
 No, we haven't even gotten to the title of this medical journal article yet, because that is weird.

163
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,920
 But it's not as weird as we're going.

164
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,440
 So the doctor's like, "Oh my God, oh my God, let me...

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,880
 I have to videotape this, I have to videotape this on a creepy old VHS camera and save it for later."

166
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,800
 But the doctor goes, "Okay, so you poop out of your penis and you fart out of your penis.

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
 Would that mean?"

168
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,320
 He's like, "You've guessed it.

169
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:04,400
 You've guessed it, young man." And then he pees out of his butthole.

170
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,040
 But that is not the name of the article either.

171
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,320
 Because what he can do to my remaining two listeners...

172
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,920
 What this man can do...

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
 This is the name of the paper.

174
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,040
 He...

175
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:29,200
 Can he jaculate out of his butthole?

176
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,520
 I think the term that was used was "copious amounts of semen."

177
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
 Which is...

178
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,040
 Which really, I think should be any amount, right?

179
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,520
 If your semen is coming out of your butthole, it doesn't matter if it's a teaspoon or a gallon.

180
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,040
 It's just too much.

181
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,960
 And he can ejaculate out of his butthole.

182
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,520
 This went on for two years.

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,200
 He never went to the doctor for this.

184
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:03,800
 So again, I ask, "How often would you have to ejaculate out of your butthole before you

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 went to the doctor?"

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,720
 Because I'm sure this guy was out on dates, right?

187
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,280
 He's meeting a hot girl.

188
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,080
 You know what I'm not even going to go into detail.

189
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,320
 I think you guys know exactly where that was headed.

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 Two years.

191
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,760
 And so the doctors are like, "Here's the thing.

192
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,440
 There's X-rays with this.

193
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
 There's this medical journal."

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,640
 And they said, "They kept asking him over and over again, "Have you ever put anything

195
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
 up your butt?"

196
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,720
 And he's like, "No."

197
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,280
 And they're like, "Hmm, let's rephrase that question.

198
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,120
 Have any objects ever gone into your anus?"

199
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
 He's like, "No, that's the same question.

200
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 You just use different words."

201
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,240
 They're like, "Because that's all they can think of."

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,240
 And he's like, "Here's the thing.

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 Because here's the rub.

204
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
 This can happen to you."

205
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,880
 Or maybe not the first part.

206
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,160
 So maybe this one happened to you.

207
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,080
 The first thing is he went on a cocaine and PCP binge.

208
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,680
 And this led him, he was like overdosed, it put him into a comatose state for three weeks.

209
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,000
 And while he's comatose, they had to insert in this catheter.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,280
 And it poked a hole.

211
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,960
 Apparently, there's a pretty thin line between your butthole and your penis.

212
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:27,800
 It poked a hole through it and created a little fistula that mixed stuff up.

213
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,360
 So this is true.

214
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 This can happen to you.

215
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,000
 As you're sitting in a doctor's office right now, they're like, "One catheter coming up.

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Come on in."

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,760
 You're like, "No, no, they're dragging you in."

218
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
 You see the doctor has a creepy VHS camera.

219
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,960
 He's like, "Ah, a new fetish of mine as well."

220
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,800
 You can poke a hole between it.

221
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,880
 Poop comes out of your wiener and semen shoots out of your butthole.

222
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 So they fixed it.

223
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,440
 They didn't just go, "We'll see you later.

224
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,920
 Thank you for giving us material for this journal."

225
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,080
 They fixed this testicular pain, which apparently was unrelated.

226
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,880
 And then they fixed this as well.

227
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 He's doing fine.

228
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,000
 As far as we know, apparently he can go two years with peeing out of his butthole and

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
 not mentioning it to anybody.

230
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
 If your friend came up to you and said, "Hey man, how's it going?"

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,680
 "Ah dude, I was doing okay, you know, but I peed in my pants."

232
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,960
 And then you look and there's like a wet spot on the back of your pants.

233
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
 You're like, "What?"

234
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,640
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, dude, I peed out of my butthole.

235
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,480
 I've been doing that for about a year and a half."

236
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,840
 So any plans this weekend?

237
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,240
 You would say go to the doctor.

238
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,720
 So I'm assuming this dude told nobody.

239
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,280
 And you're out on a date with a sexy girl and like, you know, making sweet love to her

240
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,000
 and she's going to be like, "Did you finish?"

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
 And you're like, "Yeah, of course."

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,520
 And then you roll over on the wall.

243
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,640
 Okay, that's too much.

244
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
 That's too much.

245
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
 But anyways, bizarre story and the creepy thing is it can happen to you.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,760
 And you're like all the time to your just Jason.

247
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,320
 The story is obviously not true.

248
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,520
 It's obviously not.

249
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,240
 I'm pretty sure it's true.

250
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,560
 Could be wrong.

251
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,080
 So with that, I am never ever having a caviter inserted inside of me.

252
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,600
 Team Ed, if he's still listening to Team Ed, we're going to go ahead and toss you the

253
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,280
 keys of the carbonar copter where you're leaving the eye in this hospital.

254
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,760
 We are headed all the way out to Nairobi.

255
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,320
 This story was sent to me by ChurchGoingMule on Twitter.

256
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,640
 A long time listener of the show.

257
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 Really, really appreciate the lead at ChurchGoingMule.

258
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,320
 He reached out to me and said, "Look at this ad I got while I was searching the web."

259
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,440
 And a chill ran down my spine.

260
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:44,360
 An enemy of my past was still around.

261
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,320
 There's a group called Share International and what they do is they believe that the

262
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
 new Messiah walks among us.

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,480
 His name is the Matreya and he is the second coming of Jesus Christ.

264
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,040
 And I remember reading about it.

265
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,560
 It was so funny because when ChurchGoingMule sent this over, I was like, "Oh, not this

266
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,160
 dude again."

267
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,520
 Because this became very evident how old this conspiracy theory is as we go through it.

268
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
 It happened when I was a kid.

269
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,720
 I turned 45 on Monday, October 4th.

270
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,360
 This story really started, I remember being in high school and hearing about this and

271
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,200
 it scared me because I grew up, I still am a Southern Baptist, but I grew up in the church.

272
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,080
 We watched a thief in the night.

273
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,720
 We watched all these films about the Antichrist coming and he was going to deceive mankind

274
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
 and make everyone get the mark of the beast.

275
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,400
 That type of stuff terrified me.

276
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,040
 It terrified me.

277
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,520
 So when I'm in high school and I'm like, "Oh dude, I'm totally kicking it with all these

278
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
 cute girls."

279
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,880
 And then the Antichrist is showing up.

280
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,680
 I'm seeing about this guy named the Matreya and people are like, "Oh, this is the second

281
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
 coming of Christ."

282
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,880
 And I know that's not Jesus.

283
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 I'm thinking, "Oh man, am I ever going to get to third base because will I ever know

284
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,240
 where my semen comes from because this guy might destroy the world?"

285
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,000
 So I remember being in high school because I was always into conspiracy theories.

286
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,720
 I've been researching this stuff since I was like 12, so when I was in high school I was

287
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,040
 reading about this guy, the Matreya.

288
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,480
 And I was like, "Oh no, this dude is the Antichrist."

289
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,560
 And I remember it scared me.

290
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,760
 I remember for the longest time that the concept scared me, that he was already here, that

291
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,080
 the Antichrist is already here.

292
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,360
 And you can kind of toy around in your head about who the Antichrist is and where he would

293
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
 come from, but this was a group saying...

294
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,080
 They were not saying he was the Antichrist, by the way.

295
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:44,280
 This is the reincarnation or the new incarnation of Jesus, but I'm like, "Nah, that's the Antichrist."

296
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,560
 But then time goes on and I discover all these other conspiracy theories and just get older

297
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,720
 and wiser and totally forgot about this dude until...

298
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,680
 I was trying to go on Mule, sent me an article and I'm clicking on the photos and I remembered

299
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,920
 the photo from high school.

300
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,480
 I remember this exact photo.

301
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,280
 So I just thought that was an interesting callback to this.

302
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,720
 Now you know this is an old conspiracy theory.

303
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,000
 I'm surprised they're even still around.

304
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,560
 I'm totally surprised they're even still around.

305
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,720
 And when you go to their website, when you go to shareinternational.org, they talk about

306
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,680
 you'll know that the new Jesus Christ is here because of the political upheavals, such

307
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:27,800
 as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, remember that?

308
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,640
 30 years ago?

309
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
 That's old stuff.

310
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,480
 There's been a ton of political stuff then, but it shows like they're not updating their

311
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
 website.

312
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,760
 They're still advertising for it.

313
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,120
 Church going Mule saw an advertisement, but there's...

314
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
 What?

315
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
 That's where you end off?

316
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,360
 The Soviet Union falling apart?

317
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,640
 It's boomer tier conspiracy theory content.

318
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,600
 And it worked back then.

319
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,040
 I mean, I don't think they're playing with the scared teenagers, but it definitely got

320
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,880
 people's attention.

321
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,480
 The Metre, this really comes from the mind of one person.

322
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,560
 The Metre is a Buddhist term, but this version of it comes from a guy named Benjamin Kreme.

323
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,600
 And he grew up like us.

324
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,080
 UFO fan, Fjordian fan, loved the bazaar, and he just kind of goes through life.

325
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,640
 It's in 1959, he's 37 years old.

326
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,320
 This dude is dead by now.

327
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
 That's why again.

328
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,640
 I don't know who's running the organization.

329
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,960
 I don't know what the end game is, but Benjamin Kreme was 37 years old back in 1959, and he

330
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,240
 started hearing voices in his head.

331
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,480
 The master begin to communicate with him.

332
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,200
 Now that ties into another conspiracy theory that there are these ascended masters and

333
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,160
 they live in the mountains or the volcanoes or something like that, and they reach out

334
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,520
 and they're occasionally finding random people to bestow this gift of knowledge onto.

335
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,160
 I mean, yeah, I'm not so much of a skeptic that I don't think that telepathy is fake.

336
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,240
 I'm sure it's possible out of 7 billion people, and I'm sure there is a group of ascended

337
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
 people.

338
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,240
 I do believe in elements of that, but when you start hearing voices in your head, it

339
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
 should be the same thing as if your testicles begin to hurt.

340
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,640
 How many days do you have to hear the voices in your head before you maybe go seek help?

341
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,680
 But anyways, he's listening to voices in his head and it tells him, "Hey, the matreya's

342
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,400
 coming and we're going to get you ready.

343
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,680
 We're going to give you this knowledge to get you ready so you can usher in this new

344
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
 age."

345
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,120
 He's a nobody at this point.

346
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,560
 Someone who always believed in paranormal stuff and now he's second in command of the

347
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,840
 end of the world.

348
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
 In a good way.

349
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,040
 See, the interesting thing is, like you say in the end of the world, if you believe that

350
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,440
 this guy's Jesus, yeah, it's the end of the world, but it's world peace afterwards.

351
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,800
 But still, as far as I'm concerned, it would be the end of the world, because if everything's

352
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,600
 peaceful, then what's there to do?

353
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 Jason, is that really your attitude about the second coming of Christ?

354
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,600
 Let me cite that for a second.

355
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,080
 In 1979, he actually begins making public announcements.

356
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,680
 The matreya is coming.

357
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,160
 He's right around the corner.

358
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,040
 All the reporters look and he goes, "Oh, he was around the other corner and you just

359
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,720
 missed him."

360
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,280
 That's barely a joke, because it wasn't that funny.

361
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,960
 But for a while, the media was following him.

362
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,280
 Like for a while, he was actually getting press attention.

363
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:38,000
 In 1982, he began publishing ads and newspapers, saying the end of days begins on June 21st,

364
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 1982.

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,480
 And of course, that doesn't happen.

366
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,320
 Like all of the predictions we've seen on the export and on God-like productions and

367
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,720
 things like that, 2012 Mine Apocalypse, all this stuff, they know it'll happen.

368
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 They don't happen.

369
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,520
 Remember what was it a couple years ago that guy was buying billboards saying Jesus was

370
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
 coming back?

371
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,040
 See, at that point, I had already lived through so many doomsdays and so many Christ coming

372
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,760
 back into the world events, because I sharpened my teeth on the matreya type of stuff that

373
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
 now want to hear it, it's like, "Ah, it's nothing."

374
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
 But back when I was, I was only six when 1982, I wasn't aware of that.

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
 But as the story goes on, I am aware of that.

376
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,760
 And I do think that this guy is not Jesus, that he's the Antichrist and we're all about

377
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,400
 to be enslaved.

378
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,880
 In May of 1982, Benjamin gives a press conference.

379
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
 Again, people are paying attention to this lunacy.

380
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,600
 And he says, "Jesus, this is hilarious.

381
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,520
 This is the best contest ever."

382
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,040
 He goes, "Guys, listen, Jesus is here."

383
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,360
 And the reporters are like, "Oh, they're looking around."

384
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,600
 He's like, "Not here literally, but he's here on Earth."

385
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,000
 I have to stop talking like that to you guys.

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,600
 He's living in Brick Lane.

387
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,880
 Apparently, that's like a neighborhood in London.

388
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,800
 So go out there and find them.

389
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 Reporters are like, "No, we're good."

390
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,680
 I mean, if the world's gonna end, like you said, in June, we're really gonna go out to

391
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,880
 Brick Lane and he says, "Listen, he has..."

392
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,680
 This was really interesting because as I was reading the story of Benjamin Kreme, he's

393
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,320
 getting these messages and he's talking about the matreas coming, the made trayas coming.

394
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,840
 The reason why he said that in May 1982 is because he's never met the matrea.

395
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,880
 Ever.

396
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
 Never seen him.

397
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,080
 He just hears the voices in his head, but he knew that he was in Brick Lane.

398
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,720
 So his goal was to get the reporters to go there, start randomly asking people, "Are

399
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
 you Jesus?

400
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 Are you Jesus?

401
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 Are you Jesus?"

402
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,800
 Until eventually the guy's like, "I will admit I'm Jesus because I was the third person

403
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,840
 in line you were about to get to me."

404
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,320
 And then Benjamin Kreme would have met...

405
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,080
 He's never met this guy.

406
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,920
 Remember this saga started back in 1959.

407
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,200
 That was his first telepathic message.

408
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,880
 Or in 1982, he's never met the guy.

409
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,160
 He has no proof that the matrea exists.

410
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,280
 He also has no proof that that's how he pronounced his name, but we're just going to keep rolling

411
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,400
 with it.

412
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,200
 He keeps getting these telepathic messages and he keeps announcing the end of the world.

413
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,560
 But Harold Camping was that guy who had the same thing.

414
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,840
 You make an announcement, it fails, and then you make another announcement and no one pays

415
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 attention.

416
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
 And that's what happened here.

417
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
 He kept making announcements.

418
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,720
 He keeps dating the end of the world.

419
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
 Nothing happens.

420
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,280
 Again, he now has proof in his saga.

421
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,480
 He now has proof that the matrea exists.

422
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,360
 If you go to a bathroom, this is legit.

423
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
 I...

424
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,080
 Oh my God, why would you even put this on your website?

425
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,600
 You guys already look like lunatics.

426
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,080
 Out of date lunatics, by the way.

427
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,600
 They have on their website proof that the matrea exists.

428
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
 Apparently, if you...

429
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
 This sounds like creepypasta.

430
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,160
 This totally sounds like creepypasta.

431
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,240
 If you go to Barcelona, Spain...

432
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,800
 It's a small town, apparently.

433
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,840
 I bet you you just can walk in and out within a couple minutes.

434
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,920
 If you go to Barcelona, Spain, and you go to a bathroom, right?

435
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
 It doesn't tell you what bathroom.

436
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,200
 It doesn't tell you if it's a private bathroom at someone's house or some seedy bathroom at

437
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 some sex store.

438
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 You don't know.

439
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:17,000
 If you go to this bathroom, if you look in the mirror, there is a handprint of the matrea.

440
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 That's proof.

441
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,680
 Now, I understand if you've been on this saga for decades and you've never seen the

442
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,840
 dude and you're trying to get reporters to do your dirty work, you kind of lean on anything.

443
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
 But that's what?

444
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
 Oh, I forgot.

445
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
 I forgot, actually.

446
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,720
 I left out a key detail.

447
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,320
 It's not just the handprint of the matrea.

448
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,960
 It's blessed.

449
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
 So if you look at it, it like cures you.

450
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,400
 And they said even if you look at a photocopy of it, you can get blessings, which I don't

451
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,280
 really believe because I've been researching this story and then I ate some spicy food

452
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,680
 and I got a big fat canker store on my lip.

453
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,640
 So I don't think I've anything this picture's cursed.

454
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,480
 It's cursed media.

455
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,000
 He also had this weird conspiracy theory where he kept telling people the matrea has visited

456
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,960
 the headquarters of CNN and they did a full interview on them and they believe him now.

457
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,200
 But they are not allowed to air the interview.

458
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,280
 So you just have to write CNN letters and tell them to air the matrea interview and

459
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
 then they'll air it.

460
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,760
 And then he did that with other news networks as well.

461
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,120
 I think it was ABC or CBS or something like that, which is interesting because I think

462
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,360
 he was running the same gimmick.

463
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,000
 It doesn't state it clearly, but I bet you anything.

464
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,480
 Obviously he doesn't know if this guy's doing interviews.

465
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,400
 He may be getting voices in his head that he's doing interviews.

466
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,720
 He doesn't know for sure.

467
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,000
 The tapes, he can't prove exist.

468
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,200
 So what you do is maybe he thinks they do.

469
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,120
 He gets people to write in this letter campaign, air the interview of the matrea, air the interview

470
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,680
 of the matrea and eventually CNN goes, "Well, who's the matrea?

471
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,800
 We must find this guy and put him on the news."

472
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,280
 I think that was his tactic.

473
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,560
 I don't think he actually thought he was being interviewed, but that's what he was stating

474
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
 publicly.

475
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,080
 The matrea has tried going on the record that he is here to save mankind.

476
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,840
 He is the second coming of Christ.

477
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,600
 But the media is covering it up.

478
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,960
 Now Benjamin Kreme died fairly recently ago back in 2016.

479
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,880
 He lived to be 93 years old.

480
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,120
 But their website is as current as September 25th, 2021.

481
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,680
 So someone is still maintaining it.

482
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,480
 And I couldn't see it.

483
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
 You know, a lot of times this stuff is scams.

484
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,880
 A lot of the stuff, you know, like send us $10 and we'll send you a photocopy of a disgusting

485
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,320
 mirror in Barcelona.

486
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,520
 Like I didn't see anything that scammy.

487
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 Could be wrong.

488
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
 Right.

489
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,320
 I could be wrong, but I didn't see anything that scammy.

490
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,440
 So I don't know who's still running it or why they're running it.

491
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,720
 Because if he was the one who was getting the messages in the head, then what's going

492
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
 on?

493
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,680
 But that in and of itself, I think is an interesting story, but that's not where we're going to

494
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
 end.

495
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,480
 Because let's talk about the photo that I saw.

496
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,200
 I kept talking about it being scary and you're like, "I said none of that stuff was scary.

497
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,040
 There's no proof that this guy existed."

498
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,880
 Until we reach Nairobi.

499
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,240
 Any man land this carbonicopter were in Kuangware, Nairobi, is June 11th, 1988.

500
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,680
 That's the worst city to say when you have a kinkersaw in your mouth.

501
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,000
 We're headed to the church of Bethlehem.

502
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,120
 There's a bunch of people sitting around outside and Mary Sinaita Akatsa comes out.

503
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,560
 She's a local faith healer.

504
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
 Everyone knows who she is.

505
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,200
 She heals the sick and the blind.

506
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
 People are singing Bible hymns.

507
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,360
 Jesus loves me, this Sino form.

508
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,640
 I think that's a Bible hymn actually.

509
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,240
 I think that's for little kids.

510
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,120
 But anyways, they're singing it.

511
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
 Mary Akatsa walks out.

512
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,600
 She's like, "Okay, everyone, can I get your attention please?

513
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,160
 Can I get your attention please?

514
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,400
 Thank you."

515
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,520
 I was just in the church and you won't believe what happened.

516
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,320
 God told me we're about to be visited by a very, very special guest.

517
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,560
 And I was like, "Ooh, I wonder who it is."

518
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,560
 And Mary's like, "I'll give you one guest.

519
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,600
 Who would be the most exciting guest that God would say he's coming?"

520
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
 People are like, "Hmm, I don't know."

521
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,080
 They're not really good on their Bible.

522
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 They haven't even read the Bible.

523
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,440
 They've been singing these songs the whole time.

524
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:24,240
 Out of the church walks Jesus, he's six foot five inches tall.

525
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,720
 He was wearing spotless white garments.

526
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
 He's a giant robe.

527
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,680
 And he had this little turban hat thing on that had a blue band around it.

528
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,680
 He walks out and he goes, "Guys, he's speaking perfect Swahili with no accent."

529
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,040
 He's like, "Guys, you guessed it."

530
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,360
 And Mary's like, "They didn't guess right.

531
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 They didn't guess right."

532
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,160
 He's like, "Well, I guess I should tell you right now.

533
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,440
 I am Jesus Christ, son of God.

534
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,360
 Look at my spotless robes and this snazzy little hat.

535
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,760
 Could anyone else have spotless robes enough to be fair?

536
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:01,000
 The photograph is super, like, the entire landscape is covered in mud in the photographs

537
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 of this place.

538
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,680
 It was like a church, but I guess the parishioners were outside and apparently there were like

539
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,160
 a thousand people showed up here.

540
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,480
 So the fact that he did have spotless robes, I'll admit, were, that's pretty legit.

541
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,600
 I don't think I would declare him the son of God.

542
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,120
 But anyways, he's like, "You are all blessed.

543
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
 Everyone here is blessed.

544
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,720
 I want to let you know that it's almost time.

545
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,480
 It's almost time for God to come down."

546
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,160
 And he goes, "But before that happens, before the end of the world comes and we're all accepted

547
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,800
 into heaven, I will continue to bring blessing upon blessings down to you.

548
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,040
 You are all blessed.

549
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,560
 You are all children of God."

550
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,400
 I mean, I'm number one.

551
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 I'm number one.

552
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,440
 But in another way, you are also all children of God.

553
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
 Mary's nodding.

554
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,640
 And everyone's like, "Oh my God, dude, no one will believe me.

555
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
 This is so awesome.

556
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,480
 I'm meeting Jesus."

557
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,640
 And then Jesus goes, "It's time for me to leave."

558
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
 And he starts...

559
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,600
 The thousands of witnesses are watching this.

560
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 He begins to hover.

561
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:12,160
 I don't know if there's a slide whistle sound, but he flies up into the sky.

562
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,640
 That is the story of Jesus visiting Nairobi.

563
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,280
 And that happened in the year 1988.

564
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,160
 And so this story was quickly latched onto by Benjamin Kreme and saying this was the

565
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
 matreya.

566
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,240
 So when you look at photographs, for some reason they have this photograph of this dude

567
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,520
 and then they have a photograph of a dirty hand on a mirror and they're both equal proof.

568
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,320
 He says that was the matreya.

569
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,520
 Here's photographic evidence.

570
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
 And so that's what I saw as a kid.

571
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,360
 I saw that photograph and it scared me because I was dumb, right?

572
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,520
 I was like, "Oh man, how am I supposed to fight a guy with spotless robes?"

573
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,200
 But I looked more into this story because for all I know this photo was some guy opening

574
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,520
 a new restaurant in town, right?

575
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,520
 So I looked into it and the story checks out, save for one detail.

576
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,240
 And I'm sure you guys can guess which detail doesn't check out.

577
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,520
 I dug into this a little bit more and I found some other narratives.

578
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,680
 Everything else is the same.

579
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,120
 The date and the minister at the church, everyone there is freaking out because this dude walks

580
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,680
 out the six foot five tall dude walks out.

581
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
 Everything's the same.

582
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,800
 One or two of the articles mentions that he has a light.

583
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,440
 He seems to be emitting this light from his turban, which is easy to fake or else it could

584
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,200
 be false memory or mass hysteria.

585
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,880
 But let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

586
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,560
 Let's say that he actually did have some sort of angelic glow over his head.

587
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,440
 We have the version where he flies into the clouds.

588
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,320
 That is not true, right?

589
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,000
 I can only find that reported one place.

590
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,880
 The Benjamin Kreme version actually was not as ridiculous as him flying up to the clouds

591
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 to be fair.

592
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,480
 The Benjamin Kreme version was there was a guy who just happened to be in the area named

593
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
 Gernum Singh.

594
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,200
 And he goes, you sir, how would you like to give the son of God a ride in your car?

595
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,680
 And the dude said, well, okay, sure, I'm not going to turn down that offer.

596
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:15,160
 So the Metreah gets in the backseat of the car and they drive just a short while.

597
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,160
 And then he gets out of the car and he goes, Gernum, thank you for the ride.

598
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,400
 But I got it from here.

599
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,040
 And he vanishes into thin air.

600
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,280
 Now that's always far more convenient because there's only one witness to that.

601
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,760
 But it's still pretty dumb.

602
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,960
 It's still pretty ridiculous.

603
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,600
 If he could vanish, then why didn't he do it in front of all of these people?

604
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,320
 Why did he get driven around the corner?

605
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,480
 I found another reason.

606
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,360
 This one was actually from a news article written on the event.

607
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:49,080
 It said that Gernum Singh, he shows backup, Gernum Singh was his chauffeur.

608
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,440
 So he didn't magically appear at the location.

609
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,840
 What happened was Gernum Singh brought him in the car and then he got out and he went

610
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,600
 to the church, did a little razzmatazz and then got back into the car.

611
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 This is so funny.

612
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
 This is so funny.

613
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,840
 He drove into a bus station.

614
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,240
 Gernum Singh drove the second coming of Christ to the bus station and as he was walking into

615
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,560
 the bus station, Gernum Singh goes, where are you headed?

616
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,840
 And he turns around and he goes, back to heaven.

617
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,120
 And then he just gets on a bus.

618
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
 He just gets on a bus.

619
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,400
 And he's never been seen since.

620
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,800
 Fascinating, fascinating story.

621
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,480
 That photograph scared me for the longest time.

622
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,720
 I thought that this guy might actually be the anti-Christ.

623
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
 I never thought that he was actually the second coming of Christ, but he was one that was

624
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,080
 going to deceive us and I didn't want that to happen, right?

625
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,880
 I still had a bunch of episodes in the next generation to watch and it did not happen.

626
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
 But I want to wrap this story up like this.

627
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,040
 There's a quote on the Share International website that talks about what things are going

628
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,920
 to be like when the Christ, when the matreo makes himself known.

629
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,720
 I want to read this to you.

630
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:08,400
 "The Christ will come on the world's television channels, linked together by satellite.

631
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,480
 All those with access to television will see his face.

632
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,440
 He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously.

633
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,320
 While the Christ is speaking, everyone will feel far more loved than they've ever felt

634
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
 before.

635
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,240
 That massive outpouring of love will cause hundreds of thousands of miracle cures to

636
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,200
 take place simultaneously."

637
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,520
 That's terrifying to me.

638
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:47,160
 That idea is so antithetical to what I believe in.

639
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,240
 That's terrifying to me.

640
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,720
 Because I'm wondering now if I read one of these ads when I was a teenager.

641
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,240
 Because the thing is, there's two parts of this.

642
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,920
 Obviously, the Antichrist is coming and you're just walking by a television set and you just

643
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,360
 see like, the stuff you've seen in the rise of Cobra, G.I. Joe movies and stuff.

644
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,200
 You see all the television change and it's a picture of this stranger you've never seen

645
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
 before.

646
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,000
 And it begins talking and you have this gut reaction that this person is not who he says

647
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,200
 he is.

648
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,440
 But you see everyone else around you just falling to their knees.

649
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,560
 Weeping openly.

650
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,160
 They finally have peace in their hearts.

651
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,800
 And you're just standing there and you don't understand it.

652
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,240
 And you start to see other people start to approach the televisions because they just

653
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,200
 hear people weeping in the electronics department.

654
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 And they're walking closer and you hear it.

655
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,920
 You turn around and you see other people just falling to their knees.

656
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,400
 Just joy on their face and they're sobbing as they're watching this man who's speaking

657
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,400
 this message of peace and love.

658
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:06,160
 And you're watching this and you know this person is not who he says he is.

659
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:16,320
 You could easily fall to your feet and pretend to cry just so they don't notice you're different.

660
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,000
 You could go along with it.

661
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,400
 Maybe you do feel a little bit of peace in your heart.

662
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
 Things definitely are better.

663
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,000
 There's less pollution.

664
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,680
 There's no more wars, no more crime.

665
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:37,680
 Everyone seems to love each other but you are just going through the motions.

666
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:46,360
 You live in the world you know you live in the world controlled by a demonic entity.

667
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,700
 But nobody else realizes it.

668
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,700
 Or do you know?

669
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
 Do you know?

670
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,720
 In the book of Revelation it says even the learned will be deceived.

671
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,920
 Even the people who have studied the Bible, studied the Koran, studied the Torah, meditated

672
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:15,400
 and refined their mind for decades, they will also fall prey to this Antichrist.

673
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,680
 It's a terrifying story and it's a terrifying vision.

674
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,880
 The loss of free will, even if it's the loss of free will for a paradise, is the worst thing

675
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
 that can happen.

676
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,360
 Free will is what separates us from the animals.

677
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,720
 With that gone, we're just a planet of servants.

678
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,440
 So that is why the idea of the matreya terrified me and I bet you anything I read this ad when

679
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
 I was a teenager.

680
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:51,160
 Because the idea of just passing by a television set and losing your free will to this powerful

681
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,320
 force who could fight against that.

682
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,920
 I always have this question, if the book of Revelation is real and the devil knows how

683
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,360
 the story ends, why does he continue to fight?

684
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,000
 And we've discussed that on other episodes.

685
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,520
 But I have a sneaking suspicion the reason why he continues to fight.

686
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:18,440
 Even though the book ends this way is that he knows there's a clause.

687
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:26,520
 He knows there's a chance that he wins.

688
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,800
 And if he does, and this Antichrist comes down and warps our minds and makes us worship

689
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,880
 him, and the kingdom of God falls and the angels are slaughtered in battle, it may start off

690
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,400
 as a paradise on earth, one that we greeted with open arms and weeping eyes, but it will

691
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,120
 end with eternal hell.

692
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:03,760
 Not just a planet, but a universe ruled over by the darkest entities ever created.

693
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,320
 Truly a terrifying thought.

694
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,920
 It just brings back memories of me being a young man, being in fear of what may happen

695
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
 tomorrow.

696
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:24,160
 I may be older, I may be wiser, but I still believe that this can come to pass.

697
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,160
 If not the matreah, someone else.

698
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:56,400
 After all they've been planning the conquest of this reality since before it was created.

699
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:19,600
 And I'm sure that the end of the story will be the same.

700
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:49,400
 I'm sure that the end of the story will be the same.

701
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,880
 Thank you.

702
