1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,180
 A ONE MAN war on perversion, led by a schoolteacher with a heart of gold.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,240
 And then we take a look at the creature known as Corona Chan.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:20,400
 Is it possible for a group of internet users to create a god bent on destroying the world

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,840
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:32,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,000
 So guys, let's go ahead and let's hop in the Carpenter copter.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,680
 We are flying all the way to Madison East High School in Wisconsin.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
 Madison East.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,320
 That's not really a chanting school, is it?

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,880
 You're really Maddy East.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,480
 Maddy, I guess you could do that, right?

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,200
 But anyway, we're flying over the school of Madison East High School.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,760
 It's December 2019.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
 Now if you go to this high school, or if you live in this town, you already know this story.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,320
 But if you don't, if you're not one of the 800 people who live in Madison East, you have

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,920
 no idea what's going on.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,400
 Helicopter, we're gonna land in the middle of school and I'll hop on off, right?

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,640
 And there we meet a young teacher, David Cruchin.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,280
 He's 37 years old, which I guess isn't that young, but he's young at heart.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
 So we're like, David, it's nice to meet you.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
 And he's like, it's kind of weird that you flew here in a helicopter and landed it in

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
 our school, but it's nice to meet you too.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
 And we shake hands.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,880
 A very strong grip.

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,000
 I'm like, hmm, surprisingly strong.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
 You're not some sort of vigilante, are you?

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,200
 And he's like, well, let's find out together if I am, because he doesn't know what's gonna

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
 happen yet.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
 Now he does these field trips, right?

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,320
 He's like an economics teacher or something like that, something nerdy that I didn't bother

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,520
 to write down in my notes.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,600
 But he does these field trips.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,720
 Now he has like this business club, this, okay, so the fact that he's a vigilante comes

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 out later.

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,840
 Right now he's just a big old nerd, because he has business club field trips.

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
 Where do you go?

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,320
 Like behind, like to the, the accountant at Denny's?

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,280
 Like where would you go on a business club field?

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
 Oh, look at me.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
 I'm at a bank just like standing behind the counter.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 Like where, that's the lamest field trip.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,920
 At least future farmers of America, you get to see like horses kick people into being

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 idiots.

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,280
 Like, that's cool.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,400
 Like you go to future farmers of America and like a baby cow's pop out all the time and

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,480
 you're like, hmm, and then you're trying to climb inside the cow to see if you'll fit

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,600
 the farmers chasing you around with the pitchfork.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
 Could you do that?

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 Because cows are pretty big.

52
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,480
 Like a baby cow is pretty big, right?

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,040
 So if a baby cow popped out of a cow, then I know I couldn't because I'm too brawny,

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,400
 too muscular.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
 Could you fit a human sized baby cow?

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,160
 Can you fit a human the size of baby cow inside the cow?

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,040
 Now I know when the cow is not pregnant, that would be impossible, right?

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
 At least I hope so.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,880
 I mean, that would be actually a real, maybe that's where the idea for Trojan horse came

60
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
 from.

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,480
 Some guy, some guy was on the beach of ancient Greece and a cow gave birth and then some

62
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,680
 kids like bored and he climbs inside the cow and the cow starts like running around.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:25,120
 And this Greek general is like, hmm, how can I scale this up?

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,280
 They build a giant uterus into the Trojan horse, they're all sliding and they're like,

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,480
 dude, we could have just put a door.

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,560
 He's like, nah, it's better this way because everything opens up, right?

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,640
 This isn't an episode about cows giving birth.

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
 So I might as well get back on track.

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,760
 Anyways, the whole time I'm talking about it, Dave, it's like, it's a business club

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
 field trip.

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
 We meet stockbrokers and small business people and stuff like that.

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,640
 I'm like, small business people, are they like tiny little people?

73
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
 Can we put them in cows?

74
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,240
 He's like, no.

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,920
 So anyways, he takes these kids now this usually because you know, we're in an age where we

76
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,400
 want to encourage young women to strive for the stars, right?

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,800
 Smash that glass ceiling and become like CEOs and stuff.

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 So he focuses on young women going into businesses.

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,280
 So he has this business club field trip and they go to Minnesota, you know, the business

80
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,520
 capital of the world.

81
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,840
 If you want to be a high level businessman, you got to go to Minnesota and you know what?

82
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,440
 They're going to change it to women's soda because these girls are fierce.

83
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,440
 And with the help of David, they're going to change the system.

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,040
 So they go on a field trip to Minnesota.

85
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
 All the girls there are young.

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,880
 They're about 15 to 17 and he's like, let's change the system, girls.

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,120
 Smash that glass ceiling and do other platitudes.

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,200
 And the girls are like, yay, we love platitudes.

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
 We love platitudes.

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,720
 And they all go to their respective hotel rooms.

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,120
 This girl's walking around a hotel room and she's like, oh, you know what I got to do?

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
 I got really got a poop.

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,800
 I got a poop, right?

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
 So she goes in the bathroom.

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,280
 She's going to get ready to poop and she sees this little air freshener can on the shelf

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,760
 on the thing that the sink sink.

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,280
 That's what I'm looking for.

98
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
 She sees air freshener and she goes, you know what?

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,880
 Before I poop, I want to freshen the air and she presses the top to freshen the air and

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
 it falls apart, which would be shocking.

101
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,360
 Would be the most shocking thing you go.

102
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
 You're like, oh man, you know what?

103
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
 I'm going to get a cookie.

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,760
 You reach your hand in a cookie jar.

105
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,960
 Cookie jar just disintegrates.

106
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
 It would be odd.

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,200
 It's shocking to say the least, but it falls apart to reveal a hidden camera, wires and

108
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,400
 batteries.

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,880
 She runs to David's room.

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,960
 David, David, I just found something in my bathroom.

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,680
 I pressed this air freshener can and it fell apart.

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,160
 There's just camera in it.

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,600
 And he's like, oh my God, are you, these young women are just trying.

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,080
 They're just trying to be business leaders and the evil men.

115
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,600
 So he runs into the bathroom and he finds this camera disguises an air freshener and

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,720
 he's like, no, you were supposed to only freshen the air, but instead a pervert built you and

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
 then he runs each room.

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,440
 He's an air freshener also in these girls bathroom.

119
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
 So you pervert.

120
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,440
 And then he runs downstairs and he goes, I want to see the manager.

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
 He goes to the bell hop.

122
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,160
 I want to see the manager puts these down.

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,320
 He goes, these are obviously fake.

124
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,840
 There's no such air freshener known as watch you is usually like for breeze, right?

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,160
 Or Glade.

126
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,280
 And these ones, they have a little beeping red light.

127
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
 Now they weren't that obvious.

128
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,520
 They didn't say watch you, but he takes them down.

129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,240
 He goes, these are cameras.

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,840
 What are you doing?

131
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,800
 How dare you have these in my girls rooms?

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,920
 And the staff obviously is like, what are you talking about?

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,520
 He simpletons.

134
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,840
 He runs upstairs and he's like, girls, let me check your room because there might be

135
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,240
 other horrible stuff in there.

136
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,560
 And they're like, oh, thank you, David.

137
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
 Thank you.

138
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
 And he's running through the room.

139
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
 He's looking.

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
 He's like, that's odd.

141
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,240
 This thermostat seems tilted.

142
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
 Rips it off the wall.

143
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,520
 Video camera.

144
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,320
 Based on my knowledge of smoke detectors, there shouldn't be one in the shower.

145
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
 Rips it off video camera.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,760
 So there are video cameras in the air fresheners and in the smoke detectors and in the thermometers,

147
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,320
 like the wall thermometers, not like butt thermometers.

148
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
 That would be a weird place to put a camera.

149
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,240
 I guess I shouldn't say weird because we're talking about perverts.

150
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,840
 It would be a hard place to put a camera.

151
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,120
 He takes all the stuff and he sees a security guard walking through the hallway and he's

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,720
 like, stop, good doer.

153
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,600
 Can you dispose of these evil, evil devices?

154
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,000
 Also you should check everywhere for more of these cameras because right now the working

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,040
 theory is that these cameras could be anywhere.

156
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,240
 They happen to be in all these girls' rooms, but they could, every room could have been

157
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
 infiltrated with these cameras.

158
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,760
 And security guard goes, yes sir, I will be your sidekick.

159
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,600
 I will be secure a boy and we will take care of this.

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,080
 And then he rushes downstairs and at this point the police have showed up.

161
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,880
 And David's like walking downstairs all dramatically.

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,240
 He's like, law enforcement officers, do not worry, I've taken care of this situation.

163
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,520
 And I have got all the cameras, no longer all these young women assembled in front of

164
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,800
 us being videotaped by a pervert.

165
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,640
 And the police officers go, hey dude, can we see your phone?

166
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,880
 Can we check out your phone, dude?

167
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
 What?

168
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,080
 Officers would Commissioner Gordon ask Batman if he could go through his cell phone?

169
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,640
 Well, yeah, but this isn't Gotham City, dude.

170
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,960
 So we want to have an investigation.

171
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,920
 It's a little weird that there's secret cameras in these girls' rooms, right?

172
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,480
 Of course, officers.

173
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,680
 Now was there any secret cameras in your room?

174
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,640
 So the cops start talking to this guy and they go, so do you, they weren't in your room,

175
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,160
 but you got these other ones.

176
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,680
 Yes, yes, I got these air fresheners and I got, I also found them in thermostats and

177
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
 spoke to detectors and the police go, oh, can we see those?

178
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
 He goes, why get them in the security guard?

179
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,600
 And they go, what security guard?

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,320
 The guy he described didn't exist.

181
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
 The security guard he described didn't exist.

182
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
 He goes, he was seven feet tall and made of metal.

183
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,720
 He didn't exist.

184
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,000
 So now the cops are completely suspicious of him.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,760
 Sir, can we please see your phone?

186
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,000
 So he finally does give his phone up to the police and they find that he is a member of

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,320
 a website that sells hidden cameras in the shapes of air fresheners, thermostats, and

188
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
 smoke detectors.

189
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,000
 David was not the hero all along.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
 He was the villain.

192
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,640
 He's a villain who's currently facing federal child porn charges and three felony, in the

193
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
 state of Minnesota, that was the federal charge in the state of Minnesota, three felony counts

194
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,960
 of interfering with the privacy of a minor under 18.

195
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
 What's interesting is his defenses.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,640
 How can you be charged with child pornography if you have no video or photos?

197
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,880
 That's what his lawyers defenses on those federal charges.

198
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,280
 How can you, how can you chart?

199
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,040
 There's no, been no video recovered, no photos recovered at all.

200
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
 So how can you charge him with this?

201
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,400
 If you have no pics, you must acquit.

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,920
 It's kind of the argument there, but they really should just charge him with attempting

203
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,240
 to create child porn or whatever.

204
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
 I'm sure there's other ways around that.

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,160
 But the prosecutors are basically saying there's probably, there probably was video

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
 footage.

207
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,120
 Oh, oh, and I guess I should say that this isn't the only time that he did this.

208
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,320
 They were able to link him to doing this to like two or three other previous field trips.

209
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,960
 And he was assistant coach of the girls tennis team.

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,000
 But I am always interested in the mental states of people in high anxiety situations.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
 Because I tend to just keep going.

212
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,840
 Like I have this normal thing.

213
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,800
 And then afterwards, after I analyze the situation, I go, man, why wasn't I more panicked?

214
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,840
 Like that seems like it should have been a high panofi.

215
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,200
 David's in his room doing whatever weirdo stuff perverts do when they're alone.

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,680
 Well, I'm sure we know what they do when they're alone, but he's in the room.

217
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
 Young girl knocks on his door.

218
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,960
 He's like, yes, but she comes to the door and she goes, teacher, teacher, I found a

219
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,720
 secret camera in my way.

220
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
 What must have been going through his head when this young girl comes through holding

221
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,280
 a device he bought and saying, look at what I found.

222
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,760
 Like you have to imagine his mental state was all over the place.

223
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,600
 The jig is up at that point.

224
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,160
 He was really having to pedal really, really hard just to keep the bike moving at that

225
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
 point.

226
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
 That's an analogy I just made up.

227
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
 You like it?

228
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,760
 Also, I have to wrap the story up like this.

229
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,400
 Two perverts everywhere.

230
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,520
 And to really people who build products that appeal to perverts, because normal people

231
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,600
 don't buy hidden cameras in the shape of air fresheners.

232
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,400
 If you're going to put a hidden camera in something, don't make the button that makes

233
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,520
 the item useful also be the button that opens it up.

234
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,880
 Don't have that be how you open the device.

235
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,320
 That should be creepy pervert 101, but apparently it wasn't.

236
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
 And David is facing a lot of time.

237
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,520
 So that's that story.

238
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,400
 There's a weird aside to that story too.

239
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,680
 That story was full of weird sides, but I was reading one of the articles they said,

240
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,120
 during his first day of not trial, but trying to do the hearing to figure out what the charges

241
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,200
 are going to be and all that stuff, a bunch of his female students were in the back of

242
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
 the galley crying.

243
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 What?

244
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,640
 And the article didn't, they didn't interview any of them.

245
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,480
 Were they crying because the event was so traumatic?

246
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,760
 Were they crying because they really liked this guy?

247
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,440
 Were they crying because they thought the charges were false?

248
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 Who knows?

249
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 Who knows?

250
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,320
 Maybe they were just all having a bad day.

251
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,560
 Oh no, someone ran over my pet turtle.

252
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,880
 I'm also in this trial.

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,360
 It's just happenstance.

254
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
 Odd story nonetheless.

255
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
 But who knows?

256
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
 Who knows?

257
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,960
 If something amazing happens, we'll revisit it.

258
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:16,400
 But for right now, let's leave behind David and his crying cadre of young victims.

259
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,900
 That sounded creepy.

260
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,920
 That was a horrible transition.

261
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,920
 And we're headed off to someone's bedroom.

262
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
 Okay?

263
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,280
 And creepy segue, Jason.

264
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
 What's going on here?

265
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,080
 There's a guy typing on his computer.

266
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
 Type and type.

267
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,280
 It sounds like a bunch of horses galloping, but it's not.

268
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,560
 It's fingers hitting the keyboard.

269
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,680
 And he's like, "You've heard the intro, but so you know where this is going, but I'm

270
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,360
 still going to build the suspense."

271
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,120
 This guy's typing on the keyboard.

272
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
 Not enough people have died.

273
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,920
 Apparently Yoda uses fortune now.

274
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,360
 Not enough people have died from this disease.

275
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
 No, no.

276
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,040
 Guys type into the computer.

277
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,640
 No, we must work.

278
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
 Okay, fine.

279
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,480
 I don't know why I was even doing that intro.

280
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
 Let's just skip it.

281
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,400
 Let's just get into it.

282
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,000
 So Yoda, Yoda, he goes back to wherever Dagobah, he's not from Dagobah, but he goes back

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 to wherever.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Sorry, Yoda.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
 Maybe you'll make an appearance in future episodes.

286
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,240
 Anyways, anyways, maybe Yoda will make an appearance.

287
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,120
 My Yoda impression is pretty spot on if I do say so myself.

288
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,120
 But so let's just forget that whatever weird gimmick that was.

289
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,960
 In 2014, there was the Ebola, one of the several Ebola virus outbreaks.

290
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,160
 And people on 4chan thought it was hilarious, you know, bunch of people dying from this disease

291
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,720
 and makes you poop out blood.

292
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,200
 Now, it's funny because I was actively using 4chan at the time.

293
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,320
 And when I was researching this story, I had to go to knowyourmeme.com and they were presenting

294
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
 it in a completely different light.

295
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,120
 Totally whitewashing the whole thing.

296
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,520
 I was using 4chan all the time back then.

297
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,800
 So I know what the intent was.

298
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,720
 Knowyourmeme was like, "That's not what they meant.

299
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,360
 You should be ashamed of yourself to think otherwise."

300
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,120
 So let me go ahead and give you an overview, though, of what Ebolachan is.

301
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,000
 The idea is this.

302
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,120
 What Yoda was doing was he was trying to get people online, specifically 4chan, to say,

303
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,280
 "Thank you, Ebolachan." or "I love you, Ebolachan."

304
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,760
 And you're like, "Wait, what?"

305
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,400
 First off, why was Yoda involved in this in any way, shape, or form?

306
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
 Secondly, what?

307
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,360
 What is Ebolachan?

308
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,840
 Why are they--?

309
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,400
 We've talked about tulpas on the show before.

310
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,520
 We've talked about--I have a hard time pronouncing it, but Aragors?

311
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,020
 Aragors?

312
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,440
 These are thought forms.

313
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
 These are things that you can.

314
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,000
 With enough concentration, enough meditation, enough dedication.

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,400
 You can create a nation of hypnotization.

316
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,080
 Never mind, I'm going to stop doing that.

317
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,400
 Basically you create something in real life.

318
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
 So we've talked about tulpas before.

319
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,680
 That guy made a cartoon character but forgot to add the arms and legs for some reason,

320
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,280
 and it was flopping around on his ground.

321
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,000
 I'm going to leave it at that.

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
 You can go listen to that episode.

323
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
 Just type in "tulpa" into the search engine on my website.

324
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,040
 The idea is that you could create this personification of something.

325
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,600
 Now on 4chan in 2014, you had the Ebola virus.

326
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,720
 So people on 4chan thought it would be funny to turn the Ebola virus.

327
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 This is where it gets interesting.

328
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,400
 I was actively using 4chan a lot back then.

329
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,840
 What I remember and what knowyourmeme.com is reporting are two completely different things.

330
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,920
 You go to knowyourmeme.com and type in "Ebolachan."

331
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,680
 They're like, "Oh, it was this thing on 4chan where they were telling people, 'If you say

332
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,280
 I love Ebolachan, you won't get the Ebola virus.'"

333
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,880
 Because people were afraid that the Ebola virus was going to travel around the world.

334
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,440
 And it was just a way to protect themselves.

335
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,680
 That's 100% not true at all.

336
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,600
 I was active on quite a few boards back then.

337
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,040
 Nowadays I'm mostly just on paranormal and fit.

338
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,440
 That is not what the intent of Ebolachan was.

339
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,680
 It was not a protection spell.

340
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,840
 The idea was this.

341
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,360
 And I think I might have mentioned this on an early episode.

342
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 People on 4chan, it started on 4chan.

343
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
 It branched off from there.

344
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:28,480
 But people wanted to create a living personification, a new god of Ebola that would then travel the

345
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,800
 world causing death and destruction.

346
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,600
 The way they personified it was an attractive female nurse whose hair ended in what looked

347
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,440
 like the Ebola virus under a microscope.

348
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,160
 It was like this anime drawing and she had a little blood drop on her hat.

349
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,040
 She was wearing a white nurse's uniform and she just kind of danced around or just stood

350
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 there or whatever.

351
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
 It's a drawing.

352
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,120
 And you would say, "I love you, Ebolachan," because you were trying to create more power

353
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,480
 to the virus.

354
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,240
 We've talked about thought forms on this show before.

355
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
 We've talked about positive thinking, the science of getting rich visualization.

356
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
 That was this, but they wanted to do it on a massive scale.

357
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,680
 Could you either, one, spread the Ebola virus through thought or two, create a living embodiment

358
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:22,320
 of Ebolachan, some sort of demigod that could then travel through Africa and then eventually

359
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
 the world?

360
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,760
 And I remember on 4chan, some people just wanted it to ravage Africa.

361
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,320
 This conspiracy theory may actually have gotten people killed in real life because you had

362
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,560
 people in Africa who are already very, very suspicious of the white doctors in the area

363
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,760
 and they would say, "Hey, listen, our village was doing fine.

364
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,880
 Ebola was over there.

365
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,280
 A bunch of white doctors show up.

366
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,480
 Now Ebola's in our village."

367
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
 And the doctors go, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

368
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,120
 We were tracking the illness.

369
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,940
 We knew it was going to come to your village.

370
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,240
 We got here just in time."

371
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,080
 And the people in the village are like, "Hmmm, awfully convenient, awfully convenient."

372
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,360
 And then this idea of Ebolachan, this drawing, people would do shrine.

373
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,760
 I remember people posting on 4chan's shrines.

374
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
 They would make 2 Ebolachan and they would mix their blood, they would mix their semen

375
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,880
 and they'd put it on the shrine and they're all these photos.

376
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,480
 Those photos were getting published in newspapers in Africa saying, "This is what the white

377
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,400
 people are trying to do to us.

378
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,200
 We need to rise up and fight back.

379
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,000
 Otherwise they're going to wipe us all out."

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,160
 So it's very likely that at least one doctor got his head caved in because of this conspiracy

381
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
 theory.

382
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,960
 Now I think with most stuff on 4chan, these guys are joking around.

383
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,920
 But what I've also seen being on 4chan for quite a long time is that you have 99% of

384
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,080
 the people joke around.

385
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,520
 One person takes it super seriously and goes out and does something really dumb.

386
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,800
 And then the people who are just joking around joke about that and then they just go on with

387
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
 their lives.

388
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 And then they eventually leave 4chan and do something else.

389
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 And the new people come and they'll be like, "Oh, you missed the good old days when people

390
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,480
 used to talk about this or that."

391
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,200
 And then some guy posted a photo of himself killing his girlfriend.

392
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,320
 We all laughed.

393
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,440
 And it's just this cycle that goes on.

394
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,520
 Now that's the darker side of...

395
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
 All this stuff is the darker side of 4chan.

396
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,880
 I think 4chan, like Reddit has it too, has a good side and a bad side.

397
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
 But this Ebolachan thing was super popular on the politically incorrect board and on

398
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,560
 the paranormal board back in 2014.

399
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,400
 That was the whole idea behind it.

400
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,120
 Now like I said, know your meme is like, "No, it was harmless."

401
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,480
 What's going on now is Coronachan.

402
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
 Now Coronachan is basically the same thing.

403
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,920
 Very attractive drawing of an anime character.

404
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,200
 She has little headbands that look like the coronavirus.

405
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,120
 She's holding a Corona beer and she's like, "Don't you love me?"

406
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
 And it's the same thing.

407
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
 Now I don't spend nearly as much time on 4chan as I used to.

408
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,080
 But I can imagine that she's pretty much running around the same boards as she was back then.

409
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,920
 I haven't really seen her pop up on the X board because I do go there every once in a

410
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 while.

411
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,360
 And this is actually this Chris, founder of the Golden Rabbit Army.

412
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,680
 He was like, "Do some more stuff about Coronachan."

413
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,280
 So Coronachan, now this story, it's basically the same thing.

414
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,600
 There's photos of them together and they're like, "Hey, don't you want a party?"

415
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,320
 And it's a thing that I think it's on one hand, it's kind of a funny, goofy thing where

416
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,040
 someone's like, "Wouldn't it be wacky if people actually worship these diseases?"

417
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,800
 That's one angle of it.

418
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,320
 I think it started off as trolling.

419
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,320
 Someone came up with this stuff and said, "Hey, wouldn't it be funny if we took this horrible

420
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,480
 disease and turned it into an attractive character?"

421
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,920
 And then someone else goes, "You know what would be even funnier if we could meme this

422
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,600
 character into becoming someone's waifu?"

423
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,160
 Someone actually being attracted to this.

424
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,760
 And I honestly think that's where my little pony, Friendship is Magic, I think Brony's,

425
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,440
 all came out of a troll.

426
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,400
 I think six people got together and thought, "Wouldn't it be funny if we talked about how

427
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
 great the show was?"

428
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,840
 And they created an entire economy in fanbase.

429
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,360
 I truly believe that.

430
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,880
 Obviously, Bulacan was not as successful as Friendship is Magic, but I think it's the

431
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
 same push.

432
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
 I think people go, "This would be funny because the internet, so much of it is powered by

433
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
 trolling."

434
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,320
 And then people take it super seriously.

435
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,800
 I think the first pictures of shrines were probably larps.

436
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,680
 People said, "Hey, wouldn't it be funny if we had this picture of Bulacan?"

437
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,560
 And then threw some "blood" on it.

438
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
 And then later on, you got people who were really into it.

439
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,320
 99% of it is trolling and then you just have 1% of it that takes it super seriously.

440
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,400
 Like spooky super seriously.

441
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 But here's the thing.

442
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,640
 This is what we got to look at.

443
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,280
 Is it possible?

444
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:41,360
 Is what, let's say, what I experience with the Bulacan and what's maybe going on with

445
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,800
 Corona Chan, where you could have a group of people worship a disease.

446
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,120
 Could you create a thought form of a disease?

447
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,840
 Bulacan is scared of Ebola.

448
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
 So people are constantly thinking about it.

449
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
 It might just be in the back of some people's minds.

450
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,920
 Definitely when it flares up, people are worried about it.

451
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,480
 We've done several episodes of Ebola on this show.

452
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,360
 Right now, everyone's thinking about Coronavirus.

453
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,720
 My family in Sacramento were shopping for masks.

454
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
 I was like, "Guys, whatever.

455
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 Don't worry about it."

456
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,360
 As I cough and die.

457
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,120
 People are thinking about the Coronavirus.

458
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,320
 It's so much mental energy is going into it.

459
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,080
 All you're doing is pushing it slightly.

460
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,120
 At any given point during your day, there's probably 3 to 4 billion people who are thinking

461
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,800
 about Coronavirus right now.

462
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
 In some fashion.

463
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,000
 And so if you have this wave of energy coming through the universe.

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,600
 Half the human population, let's say 3.5 billion at any given time.

465
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,880
 And then you have 5 to 10 million people taking that wave and focusing it.

466
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,120
 You're still having a lot of energy just kind of shooting out, but you can get that focus

467
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:57,240
 to a small province in China creating a thought form, taking actual death, taking an actual

468
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,720
 biological entity inside someone.

469
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,900
 Is it possible for that thought form to become real?

470
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,200
 Is it possible that with all that focus and all that mind power, even though most of the

471
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,280
 population are unaware of Corona-Cham, they're just afraid of a virus that may destroy them,

472
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,000
 kill them and their families.

473
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,280
 Even though the people who are aware of the Coronavirus, 99% of them think it's a funny

474
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,200
 joke to focus and try to create this thought form.

475
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,520
 And you have 1% who are 100% dedicated to creating this chaos god of death.

476
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:40,000
 Is it possible that somewhere in China this form is being created?

477
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,520
 It's incredibly, incredibly unlikely.

478
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:53,960
 But this is one of those things, I love investigating all this stuff, love aliens and ghosts and

479
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
 paranormal conspiracies.

480
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,680
 But this is one of those things that I truly hope isn't true.

481
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,720
 I truly hope it's just a fool's errand.

482
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,000
 Because I get it.

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,760
 It's funny, people want to see if you can actually get people to start worshiping this

484
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,800
 drawing or make it your waifu or just to troll people.

485
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 I get it.

486
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,920
 I get the humor behind it.

487
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,680
 But as someone who believes in the paranormal, there is a concern that it could actually

488
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,920
 be true.

489
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,480
 That you have the person drawing the picture and you have the people laughing about the

490
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,640
 picture and you have the people using the meme.

491
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,360
 And the 1% that take it super seriously spend all their time and mental energy and they

492
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,280
 build these shrines and they make these sacrifices and they put everything forth to create this

493
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
 god.

494
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,560
 And you have the billions of people that are already worried about the virus.

495
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,040
 Then you have the millions of people who are worshiping it as a joke.

496
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,880
 And then you have the 10,000 people that are really, really, really putting energy into

497
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 it.

498
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:03,600
 And all of those things cascading into a young girl being born in the city of Wuhan underneath

499
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,400
 the most dire of circumstances.

500
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,040
 Not a lot of food, not a lot of medicine, sickness all around her.

501
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,080
 And this child who would not have been conceived under any other means is basically created

502
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,800
 as a thought form inside of a woman.

503
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,880
 And she gives birth to what seems like a human child but is really a creation of the mental

504
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,640
 powers of billions of people.

505
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:47,120
 That terrifies me because I think it might be possible.

506
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,040
 This child could grow up and appear to be totally normal and then one day activate.

507
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,800
 The question everyone has is why are we here?

508
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 What are we doing here?

509
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,760
 What is our destiny?

510
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:10,880
 But to this girl who may be born nine months from now, her destiny was created by us.

511
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:25,280
 Her destiny is to kill us all.

512
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,880
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

513
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,400
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

514
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

515
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,480
 Have a great one guys.

516
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 Bye.

517
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,480
 Bye.

518
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,060
 (upbeat music)
