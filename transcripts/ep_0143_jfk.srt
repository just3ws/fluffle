1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 An assassin's bullet takes its time to find its target.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 We take a look at a shaman who would do anything to avoid repain his swindled customers.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then finally we take a look at another topic on the conspiracy iceberg.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 This one has been mired in conspiracy theory for decades.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 But today we ask the question, did JFK shoot himself today on Dead Ravra Radio?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravra Radio.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 The merch store is up. It is ready to go.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You need a t-shirt or a coffee cup or a travel mug or stickers, a little poster. It's all there.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 The link is going to be the first link in the show notes.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Same thing on YouTube. It's going to be the first link down.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I already bought a shirt and a sticker from there. It's dope. I've already tested the quality.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And again, thank you for the art of Grant Scott and Ash Black. They're the ones who designed everything.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It looks amazing. The shirt is dope. I love the shirt. I love the stickers.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 There's just so much stuff. We have a clock, a Dead Rabbit clock. Check that out.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But anyway, so that'll be on the links there.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Okay, let's go ahead and get started with the episode because we've got a lot to cover.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Usually when we have three stories, we don't have a lot of time to kind of bandy about.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 First story we're going to cover is a story that is most likely not true.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 However, it's possible. Definitely possible.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And this is actually a request from George through email. Listener George.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 That's not his name. Not Listener George. Instead of Curious George, you have a dude named Listener George, a little monkey.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 That's just ease dropping on people all the time.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Listener George discovers where the monies come from, little monkey with his ear to the...

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Sorry, George. I hope you don't think I'm making fun of you.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Anyways, George emailed this to me. It's the story of the patient bullet.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Very simple story, but it was in Ripley Strange Coincidences.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So it's one of those stories that have probably been passed down over the years.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 The year is 1893. We're in Honey Grove, Texas, which sounds like the most delicious city you could ever live in.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Other than like Chocolate City. There's a guy named Henry Ziegland.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And he's dating this chick. And then he's like, "Nah, I don't want none of this no more."

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And the girl's like, "What?" And he just leaves.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Now, she is so... I guess this started off a little funny because the next part is she's so heartbroken that he left her.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 She kills herself. So that's not funny.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And then her brother... This is actually quite a sad story now that I remember.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So Henry's like, "Dude, you just totally ghost this chick."

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 She ghosts herself. That might be in bad taste, but then her brother... And then I just continue.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Then her brother is like, "I gotta go shoot Henry."

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So he finds Henry on his property. And he's like doing old-timey stuff.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Saw on a log, lighting a fire, making a billow, something.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And the brother shows up and is like, "My sister killed herself because of you."

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And Henry's like, "Kick bricks, dude. Get out of here. Your sister, I didn't want to be with her no more.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 You can't make me date your sister."

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 But then the brother pulls out the gun and shoots Henry.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And Henry falls backwards.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And then the brother goes, "Oh my god, what have I done? Well, at least I got vengeance for my sister."

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And then the brother shoots himself and kills himself.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And around that time, Henry gets up off the ground and is like, "Oh, what?"

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And he got shot. The bullet simply hit his face, gave him a little cool scar, and went into the tree behind him.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Which I should have said earlier. He was standing in front of a tree.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I'm like, "One of those guys who tells jokes."

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And then right when he gets to the punchline is like, "Oh, I forgot."

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Okay, so there was a penguin in this joke. So anyways, he was standing in front of the tree.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 The bullet cuts his face, lodges in the tree. The brother kills himself, joins his sister in the afterlife.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So anyways, now we're jumping ahead 20 years. It's 1913.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And Henry Ziegler's like, "You know what? I need to clear out my property. I have some bad memories.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I think that tree over there is where I got shot in the face.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And I did get this cool scar. It allowed me to pick up a bunch of chicks and ghost them too.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And he's like, "China saw it. He can't saw it. China ax it. Can't ax it."

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 They didn't have chainsaws back then, I don't think. Wait, maybe they did.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 But anyways, he can't get it. He can't get access to a chainsaw. And Honey Grove, Texas, they're illegal.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So he gets some dynamite and he's like, "I'll just blow the tree up." Which people do that, especially back then.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Blows the tree up.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I wonder what a tree would sound like as it exploded. Would it be all sappy? Would you hear like, "Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Okay, good bookend for when we talk about J.F.K. getting shot. But before we move on to that one, let's move on to our new news folder

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 because we have a little mystery for you. A little mystery. We're in Jakarta, which is a country out in the ocean.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 So a series of islands in the ocean. You can hear the confidence in my voice when I say that.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 It's December 9th, 2004. Cops, you get a really weird call. All day long, they're getting these calls.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 "Someone's dead in my house." Well, not in their house. Not like someone dropped a body out there.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 They'd be like, "My aunt, she lives in a house and she's dead." They're like, "What?"

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 When they go, you know, a couple of cops are like, "Let's go check out this house." And they get another call.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 They're like, "Hey, there's someone dead in my house too." And they're like, "What?" And they're driving over there

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 and people are waving them down as their police cars got on the street. They're like, "Dead bodies, dead bodies."

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 The cops are like, "What is going on here?" Seven people dead. Five people found dead in their homes.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Two people dead at a local cemetery and two sick in the hospital. Cops are like, "What the hell? This is Jakarta.

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Where are all these people dead?" And they don't know why they died. It wasn't like they all had knife fights.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 There's just a bunch of bodies laying around. Seven people. And so they start talking to the two people who are sick

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 and they're like, "What's going on? Do you happen to know?" "Well, actually, no. I don't think that's how it worked."

79
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I think they're trying to figure out a connection between all the people. I don't think they just walk to random sick people in a hospital

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 and ask, "Do you know anything about these murders?" I think they try to make connections between the people.

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And they realize that the dead people were in the same social circle as the sick people. So then they're like, "That's the way you do it, officer.

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Don't just walk up to the burn ward and say, "Who committed a crime?" "You have to know who you're talking to."

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The officer's like, "Okay, thank you." They go to the sick people and they go, "Hey, what happened?

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Do you know anything about why all these bodies are here?" And the sick people are like, "That wasn't a sound effect. That was actually me coughing.

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I'm still terribly sick." Not super terribly, but anyways. So the sick people are like, "Yeah, we do know them. We all use the same shaman."

86
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 So there's a shaman in town called Iskander. And he was a grifter. He was basically a scam artist. And he told these people, "If you pay me 10 million rupees, you will get a lifetime of riches."

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Now, 10 million rupees is only about $1,100 in U.S. money. So it's not like a huge amount, but it's more than, you know, you would want to give to just a scam artist.

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And they started saying, "Hey, you know, wins are riches coming. Wins are riches coming." And the shaman realized that he had ripped off too many people who kind of knew each other and that things get really, really bad.

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So instead of like fleeing town or making up some more magic stuff that like scares him away, well, he kind of did that.

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Actually, he created a magic brew and said, "Okay, if you guys want all your money, you got to drink this. But don't put it down. Put it down. You have to drink it in your own house."

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Because he didn't want a bunch of bodies in his shop, which is quite clever actually. But anyways, he says, "Take it home."

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I think two of the people probably went to the cemetery because they thought it was going to be like extra ghosty if they drank it around dead people.

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But yeah, that's how all these bodies got everywhere. It was one dude killing a bunch of people on the same day.

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And they just went home and they're like, "Okay, if we drink this magical potion, we'll get our money."

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And the two people who just got sick either had an immunity to it or they watered it down. They're like, "I don't need like super magic juice."

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 They're like adding some orange juice to it. Little V8. They drink it and they're all "Bleughh!"

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And they're like, "That's weird." They're like, "Why am I vomiting?" And they're like, "Oh yeah, because I added the V8."

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 "Bleughh!" And someone else is like, "No, no, I think you're poisoned." And then he's like, "Ugh, I don't know. It might just be the V8."

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 V8 is the grossest drink ever. And I don't know if people still drink it, but when I was growing up, people would crack open cans of it and just...

100
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 It's tomato and celery juice mixed together. It's like, what is it, eight vegetables? That's why it's called a V8?

101
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Ugh, I'd rather drink shaman juice than V8. I'd take my chances. I met this beautiful woman last night. We're getting along. Having fun.

102
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And then I think to myself, I got a daily podcast to do. Really, really, really put a cramp on my social life, guys.

103
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And it's a lot of fun. So we say au revoir to the young maiden, and we say au revoir to the shaman. He's been prisoned out.

104
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And we're going to Dallas. We are going to... Hey, whoa, well, I should have probably put those together better, because we were just in Texas, and then we flew to Jakarta, and now we're back in Dallas.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 So, just right off the bat, I'm not going to go over, like, everyone knows the JFK conspiracies, and that's the, like, there's multiple shooters, or that it was the mob, or it was this or that, or something like that.

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And I'm not interested in any of that. I've always considered JFK one of those babies' first conspiracies, where it's just like, yeah, whatever.

107
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So I'm not going to get into all of that stuff. I find it relatively boring. What we're going to talk about right now, though, is quite interesting, and it's the...

108
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It's on the conspiracy theory iceberg, and it's just three words. Well, actually, three letters, two words, unless you count the letters in those words, but JFK shot himself.

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Now, again, this is where we're going to have to say that this conspiracy theory is probably a joke, but there are some interesting theories that have popped up from it.

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 First off, I'll let you know this. If you aren't eating jelly, or any sort of, like, red substance, you can always go to the Wikipedia page for bullet trajectories for JFK.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 You get a nice photo of his brains coming out of his head. Did not expect that. Did not expect that. And it's so funny, there is a drawing of a skull.

112
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 They're trying to show, like, a forensic drawing of the bullet entering the skull, right?

113
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And this is on the Wikipedia page. It'll be linked here. There's a drawing of a skull, and there's a bullet going into it.

114
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And then there's pieces of the skull. So you see the skull fragments go, "Bing!" Just kind of flying off in every direction. It looks like some Stanley Druid or something.

115
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And it says at the bottom. Let me actually read this to you. So the drawing is a bunch of skull fragments coming off this drawing of a skull with an outline of Kennedy's face around it.

116
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And it says, "The skull fragments are shown exploded for illustrative purposes. Most stayed attached to the skull by skin flaps."

117
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 So someone was drawing the president's skull, and then going, "Bee!" Like, made them fly off in every direction. It's super bizarre. They didn't need to even have them on there.

118
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Okay, the reason why the vocals have changed is not because there is a CIA agent standing in my apartment right now, and he told me to edit the podcast because it got too close to the truth.

119
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 No, actually, as I was editing it, I was like, "I talk about nothing for the next 30 minutes. Like, I could totally make this shorter."

120
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So I apologize if there's a bit of an audio change. Generally, like, anything, because the mic's so sensitive, anything can cause the audio to be a little bit different.

121
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 If it's noticeable, that's why. I recorded the first segment in the morning, now it's 10 o'clock at night.

122
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 The episode is usually uploaded by now, but I was like, "I can make it more succinct."

123
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 We're really gonna look at three possible scenarios with the idea that JFK shot himself. One is a conspiracy theory that popped up on 4chan.

124
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 One is a conspiracy theory that is kind of known, a possibility type of thing. And the third one is, truly, could JFK have shot himself?

125
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And all of them deal with him shooting himself. But the first one, the one that popped up on 4chan, is this.

126
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 John F. Kennedy shot John F. Kennedy. But, a little asterisk there, John F. Kennedy shot a reptilian disguised as himself.

127
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 So what happened? This conspiracy theory on 4chan goes like this.

128
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 The reptiles after Roswell, after aliens have made contact with the planet, have decided to start infiltrating our government with the help of insiders in the government.

129
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And just, you know, just being reptilians and being able to do what they want, because they got laser beams and stuff.

130
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And John Fitzgerald Kennedy could not stand this. They're like, "Hey, John, meet your replacement."

131
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 "Nap, pleasure to meet you, John. How do I look in your skin?"

132
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 John Kennedy's like, "I fought in World War II. I can fight in World War, the... alien."

133
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And then he just runs away and everyone's like, "Why did it take him so long to come over that joke?"

134
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Anyway, so, John F. Kennedy's like, "I have to defeat the reptilian menace. I can't let people be taken in by the reptiles."

135
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So he went to the grassenal and as the car was driving by, reptilian JFK, "I love these people. They look so delicious."

136
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And Jackie's like, "What did you say?" And he's like, "I meant they look like good constituents."

137
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And she's like, "Okay, that's what I thought you said."

138
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Anyways, JFK loads up his rifle.

139
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 See, is it coming down? See, thing coming down. That's one reptile who won't be... evolving.

140
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And runs away. And someone's like, "Why is that guy in such a hard time coming up with jokes?"

141
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 They should write themselves. Or technically, you should write them before you say them. JFK's just running away.

142
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Now, obviously, there's a couple problems wrong with that.

143
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I mean, other, namely the fact that shapeshifting reptiles don't exist, but let's pretend they do exist for a second.

144
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 If I was a shapeshifting reptilian, I wouldn't assume the shape of somebody and then let them know and let them leave.

145
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I wouldn't be like, "Haha, now I'm you."

146
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So what are you doing this afternoon? Like, no, you would kill that person right away.

147
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And John F. Kennedy, I mean, yeah, he was a war hero, but he wasn't Jason Bourne.

148
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's not like he could be knocking out secret service agents and stuff like that.

149
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Plus, they would have been looking for him. And John F. Kennedy is quite recognizable, so it's not like he could have hidden out.

150
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 It's not like he could have put a patch on his eye and they're like, "Who are you?"

151
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And he's like, "Bobby Kennedy?" And they're like, "Oh, you're the attorney general?"

152
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, I meant somebody else Kennedy."

153
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So he's really-- John F. Kennedy, not many people knew this. He was really bad at coming up with jokes and aliases.

154
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And again, let's say that JFK was replaced with a shapesh-- just the very idea makes me laugh.

155
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 JFK was replaced with a shapeshifting reptilian.

156
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Nobody noticed? I mean, here's the question I have with that.

157
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Is everybody replaced by a shapeshifting reptilian? Like, all of them? Every secret service agent?

158
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Jackie Onneses? Lyndon B. Johnson? Are they all reptiles?

159
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Because at a certain point, if JFK became a reptile, or if JFK was a shapeshifting reptile, all of a sudden, like, he wasn't always that.

160
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 He just is one now.

161
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Secret service agents would be like, "Isn't that weird how he's very-- JFK's become very protective of his eggs recently."

162
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 They're like, "Yeah, that is kind of weird. Like, he used to just-- actually, no, here's a better question. Where's he getting these giant, infant-sized eggs from?"

163
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Jackie O's, "Have you seen my husband?" And the secret service agent's like, "Yeah, he's laying out on that rock in the middle of the day.

164
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 We can't figure out why. It's almost like he can't regulate his own body temperature."

165
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And Jackie O's like, "Hmm, that is suspicious. I should talk to him about that."

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So, I mean, that's the thing. Like, everyone in the circle would have to be a shapeshifting reptilian, otherwise they would do reptile-like things.

167
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Eating their young. She's like, "No, John, no!"

168
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Anyway, so that kind of goes out the window.

169
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 The second one is a little darker. And this is one that people have kind of floated around for a while, is that--

170
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 See, not a lot of people knew this. JFK actually had some serious medical conditions.

171
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 When he got shot, he got hit by the first bullet, and he still was sitting up.

172
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Because he had on a back brace. He had really, really bad back pain.

173
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So when he got shot with the first shot and went through his throat, he couldn't duck down.

174
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 He was a sitting duck, literally. Well, not literally. That means he was actually a duck as well, but he couldn't move.

175
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Because he was stuck there with the back brace, so then he got his brains blown out.

176
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 So not a lot of people know that, that he has a lot of back problems.

177
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 He was constantly on painkillers, anti-anxiety agents, stimulants, sleeping pills to take the edge off the stimulants.

178
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He was on Ritalin. He was getting injections of something called gamma globulin to combat infections.

179
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And there was a rumor that he was getting vitamin B shots, which was actually a code word for crosstops,

180
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 which is a code word for methamphetamines. Methamphetamine used to be available over the counter.

181
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 They're just like pet pills. But we had a guy who had a lot of physical problems.

182
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And a guy who's Roman Catholic. And a guy who has the weight of the world on his shoulders.

183
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And this conspiracy theory goes by that he reached out to the mob, which he did have connections to through his father.

184
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 His father was a bootleger. That he reached out to the mob and put a hit out on himself.

185
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Now, people do put hits out on themselves. It's not super common, but it does happen.

186
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 My pushback to that one would be... Oh, oh, and the other thing, before I go on with that.

187
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 He was Roman Catholic and they very, very much frowned upon suicide.

188
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 So if you kill yourself in the Catholic tradition, you go to hell. That's not true, but that's what they believe.

189
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 It would make sense that he wanted to kill himself. I don't think... I wonder if there's ever been a sitting world leader

190
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 who's taken their life other than like people are bashing down the door and being like,

191
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 "Put your hands up. We're here to rush you for all your crimes."

192
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I mean, like other than just sitting there and they're like, "Now I'm feeling kinda... I'm feeling like this is the end."

193
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I wonder if that's ever happened. I probably should have looked that up. But I guess I don't want to be depressed.

194
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 So the idea was that he put a hit out on himself.

195
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Says, "This is where I'm gonna be. Here I'm gonna be in this convertible. You can take me out. I'm done."

196
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And pay him a bunch of money. There's a couple problems with that.

197
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 One, everyone knew where he was going to be. He's the president.

198
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Two, he loved being in convertibles. That was nothing different.

199
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That was nothing new for him into being in the convertible.

200
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Three, anyone who took that contract would have a ton of heat on them.

201
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But most importantly, four, there's a far easier way to do that.

202
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And that would be playing Crash or have a Secret Service agent kill you.

203
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Or just fall, you know what, just get poisoned or something like that.

204
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 You could say, "I don't want to kill myself, Secret Service guy. But will you kill me?"

205
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And they'll be like, "Uh..."

206
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I mean, I guess you'd probably have better luck getting a mobster to set that up than the Secret Service.

207
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But I think a president would have more routes rather than getting shot in the head while driving out of the street.

208
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 However, it did make him an icon.

209
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Like, I think if Kennedy wasn't assassinated, he would just be a president.

210
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Instead of this whole fall of Camelot type of thing.

211
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 He would have been an okay president.

212
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 A lot of people deify him, but, you know...

213
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 So, I've heard that conspiracy theory too that he arranged to have himself murdered.

214
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 But what I think the conspiracy iceberg is actually talking about is, did JFK shoot himself?

215
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Not in the third person where he's shooting a replica of himself, not where he hires a hitman to kill him.

216
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Is it possible that JFK actually shot himself?

217
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Now, I always talk about conspiracy icebergs with this caveat.

218
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 We're gonna go, we're gonna put on our imagination caps, because none of this is... none of this is gonna be true what I'm gonna say.

219
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But let's try to make it work.

220
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And there actually is a way.

221
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 There actually is a way to make this theory work.

222
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And it's quite simple.

223
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 It's two of them put together.

224
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's, he hired a hitman.

225
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He did do the mob thing.

226
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Now, again, we have a guy who's in chronic pain all the time.

227
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 And that first shot comes and gets him right in the neck.

228
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And he lives.

229
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And he was afraid of that.

230
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 He was afraid that this hitman, because the mob's not gonna send out their best, because whoever does it is gonna get caught.

231
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 They might be able to pin it on some dude, but for the most likelihood, this guy's gonna get caught.

232
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Bullet goes in him and he's like, "Ugh, just more pain.

233
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Now I'm gonna survive this. I have the best doctors in the world.

234
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And now I'm just gonna be even more pain.

235
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I'm gonna be a hero, because I'll be a president who almost got killed, but that's not what I want.

236
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 So he pulls out...

237
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Listen to this.

238
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 He pulls out a flesh-colored gun.

239
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Looks just like his hand.

240
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 No one would know in the blink of an eye what he was doing.

241
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And here's the kicker.

242
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Anyone in that car wouldn't tell.

243
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 That at that last moment, when they see him pull out the flesh-colored gun,

244
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 maybe it was wrapped in human skin,

245
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 skin of a couple communists,

246
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 puts it under his chin, blows his brains out,

247
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 and Jackie O's like, "Ugh!"

248
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 I should have figured.

249
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 I was wondering why he was wrapping that human skin around that gun.

250
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And the people in the front seat are like, "Ugh!"

251
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I'm never gonna say anything, because that will totally ruin his legacy.

252
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Now, is that possible?

253
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 If you look at the Zapruder film, you see how I dodged that question?

254
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 If you look at the Zapruder film,

255
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 we see him put his hands to his face before his head's blown out.

256
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Now, unfortunately, I had watched it a couple times for this podcast,

257
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and it was disgusting, and I hate it.

258
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I hate that video. I mean, it's a piece of American history.

259
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I've seen it multiple times throughout my life, but I just think it's so grim.

260
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 He does put his hands to his face.

261
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Visually, you could see the idea that someone could say he shot himself with a flesh-colored gun.

262
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 It looked exactly like his hand.

263
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 But, that all being said,

264
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 the idea of somebody taking their own life is simply grim enough.

265
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It happening in public is even worse,

266
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 and it happening at a celebration for that person might be the worst combination of the three.

267
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Usually with the conspiracy iceberg topics, I say,

268
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 "Could be, possibly. I'd give my own spin on it, like I did with The Ocean at Night,

269
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Paleolithic Deep State, Golf Rumors, and stuff like that."

270
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 But this one particularly, I think that he did not shoot himself.

271
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I think it's pretty clear just from bullet trajectory and ammo type and the wound and everything like that,

272
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 that it wasn't a self-inflicted gunshot wound from a flesh-colored gun.

273
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I was really saying that to throw out that conspiracy theory.

274
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 This is probably the first conspiracy theory I've come across on the conspiracy theory iceberg,

275
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 that I believe is 100% false.

276
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Every other one, there's wiggle room to it, but this one, because we just have this sheer amount of evidence,

277
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 proving otherwise, that he did not shoot himself.

278
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 This one is probably the first one I've covered where I think, unequivocably, it's fake.

279
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Now, like I said in the beginning, I'm not talking about multiple shooters, grassy-null, stuff like that.

280
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 You can go deep in that stuff if you want, it's not my interest.

281
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But I think it's interesting because out of all the conspiracy iceberg episodes I've done,

282
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 this is the first one that I did my research on and it was like, "I'm gonna assume this is true,"

283
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and it's the first one I've walked away from saying, "100% fake, 100% word soup, someone thought it was funny to put on a board."

284
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 It's a very evocative image for a man who we all know is assassinated to have taken his own life,

285
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 but in the end, I don't think that happened.

286
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And what's interesting is I don't think anyone who listened to this episode thought that I would think it would happen.

287
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 But the power of the story is what kept me researching,

288
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 because when we find a chink in the armor of an established narrative, we just have a natural instinct to explore it.

289
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Some people go in too deep and they get lost in the conspiracy theory, other people just go, "Interesting."

290
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 But that's not true, and move on with their lives.

291
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And I think that is the difference between someone who is obsessed with conspiracy theories,

292
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 who hears something and can never let it go, or someone who's simply intrigued by them.

293
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Maybe they believe a few of them, but for the most part, they just kind of laugh and go, "That's interesting," and they move on with their lives.

294
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 That's an important difference.

295
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 It's important to remember when we find these stories that seem very evocative to take off that imagination cap and go, "That was fun."

296
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 But it wasn't true.

297
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
