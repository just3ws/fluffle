1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
 There are hundreds of stories of people being abducted by aliens and taken to far off places.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,880
 But what happens if you get abducted and you're taken straight to hell?

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,460
 And then we take a look at the possibility that the Easter Bunny may not be a warm cuddly

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,420
 dude who drops eggs off in your backyard.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:48,280
 He may actually be an interdimensional invader today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,000
 Cool stuff to cover today, so first off let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,200
 newest Patreon supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,700
 It's everyone's favorite dude.

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,880
 I don't know, you might hate this guy.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
 Give it up for F.Sindo.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
 Woohoo!

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
 Come on in buddy, come on in.

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,640
 F.Sindo, you're gonna be our captain or our pilot this episode.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

15
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,320
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,360
 You have no idea how much it helps.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,880
 Just promoting the show.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,440
 F.Sindo, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason Jalopy.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,800
 We are headed out all the way to a young man's house.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,880
 This is a really interesting story, but like so many stories we cover, we don't have an

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,080
 exact time, we don't have an exact location or date.

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,960
 In this story, I understand why this person wouldn't want to reveal all that information

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,240
 because this is a pretty intense one.

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,240
 We're sitting outside this house and inside this house there is a person who goes by the

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,080
 internet handle Homogenic Harpist.

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,480
 Homogenic Harpist.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,160
 We're gonna go ahead and call you Pete, if that's your real name, it's just a guess.

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,600
 And Pete tells us this terrifying story and like all terrifying stories, it starts off

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
 with a quite depressing beginning.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,120
 Pete said, "Listen, when this happened to this happened a couple years ago."

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,640
 So he puts a bit of a time zone in, it's around the time of the COVID lockdowns.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,280
 So he goes, "Listen, COVID came, everything started getting shut down, lost my job, had

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,640
 to move back to my old hometown, I'm an adult, I'm sleeping in the bed that I had as a kid,

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,320
 and I'm just kind of thinking, what happened?

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
 How did I end up here?

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
 Okay, COVID, right?

37
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,920
 That's how I ended up.

38
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
 Locked down, but a lot of people faced that.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,760
 A lot of people had financial difficulties, they were forced back to living with their

40
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,200
 parents or their relatives of some sort.

41
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,080
 And he says, "My parents are not good people.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,000
 As a kid, I didn't get along with my parents.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,880
 It was not a healthy home environment.

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:59,520
 So that, I knew when I was moving back to this house, it was not a house full of love."

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,080
 He goes, "The house is hard to grow up in.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,080
 The house always had such a dark energy as a kid, and it seems even now it's hard.

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,600
 And I'm dealing with that, I'm dealing with all this psychic residue, I'm dealing with

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,920
 all of the emotional trauma of growing up with my parents, and I'm an adult and I'm

49
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,520
 living with my parents, and I don't know if things are ever going to get better.

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,480
 I'm in, the world seemed to be falling apart, right?

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,800
 Remember when that whole COVID lockdown stuff was going on back in 2020?

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,080
 So he's laying in bed one night, and one of the things he did to help fall asleep was

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,080
 he left his blinds open on his window, and there's like this big tree outside of his

54
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,720
 house, and he would just kind of watch the branches sway, and give him some sense of

55
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 peace, right?

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,480
 That was the way he fell asleep.

57
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 Blah, as a kid and now he's an adult doing this as well.

58
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
 And he's starting to zone out.

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,800
 This is, he's done this ritual all his life when he was living there.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,400
 He's starting to zone out watching these branches sway, and then bam!

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,160
 He is no longer in his bedroom.

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:09,520
 He finds himself, and he, I'll say this too, he is very adamant this was not a dream.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,680
 He's like, "I've had dreams, I've had like most humans have had dreams all my life.

64
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,240
 This was not a dream, this actually happened to me."

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,360
 And he also says he's an experienced lucid dreamer.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,320
 So he has the ability to control his dreams, and he goes, "This 100% was not a dream."

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,760
 He says, "What happened was he's laying in bed, he starts to zone out, and then he's

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,280
 on his knees in a coliseum.

69
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,920
 He's kneeling in the dirt, he's in the center of this coliseum-like structure.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,280
 His hands are handcuffed behind his back.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,120
 They're restrained in some way."

72
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,000
 And it appears that the coliseum for the most part is empty.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,880
 He's looking at this massive structure, he's in the center of it, but he doesn't see a

74
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,160
 bunch of people going, "Pete, Pete, Pete!"

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,360
 He gets ready for the big game, he's in this coliseum-like structure, but it's empty save

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,200
 for three people.

77
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,880
 And probably the more apt term would be three demons.

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 Because he instinctively knows he's in hell.

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,560
 He's not like Shay Stadium, whoa!

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
 Maybe I'll hit a Homer.

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,760
 He doesn't go on and say like the sky's blood red and there's like dinosaur type creatures

82
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,280
 flying around volcanoes going on.

83
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
 The volcanoes show up later.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,760
 But he instinctively knows where he's at, he's in hell, and he's bound on his knees.

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,060
 And in this coliseum he sees three humanoids.

86
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,560
 He describes them like this.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 One of them is a goat in a humanoid form.

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,640
 Not just like has a human body and a goat head, which would be terrifying enough.

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,320
 He's like, "Oh, that's lame."

90
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,640
 It was actually a goat, but it was bipedal.

91
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,800
 And it was sitting there.

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,100
 And then also sitting there was a black...

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:10,360
 He described it as tall, slim, humanoid shape, but it was made up of black energy sitting

94
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,480
 next to the goat man.

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
 And this entity had glowing red eyes.

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,040
 And then sitting next to that figure is a man with the upper body of an eagle.

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,200
 He just had regular old surfer legs, all muscular and tan, and then the upper body of an eagle.

98
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,800
 I don't know if he had feather arms, but he's sitting there and he said...

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,480
 I love this story because there's so many interesting little tidbits to it.

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,180
 Really interesting details.

101
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,840
 He's sitting there and he goes, "They're having a conversation."

102
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,360
 I can't understand what they're saying.

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,640
 They're speaking some sort of language that makes absolutely no sense to me, but I've

104
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
 heard it before.

105
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,480
 It doesn't know when, doesn't know where, but he's heard this language before.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,240
 So, how they were speaking Polish or something like that?

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,560
 It was an infernal type language.

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,520
 While he's kneeling there and they're speaking, he picks up on another just really interesting

109
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
 detail.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:18,820
 He says, "I feel like this conversation had been going on for a long time and my body

111
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,840
 had been there for a long time.

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,840
 What I experienced when I left the bedroom and came here was my subconscious being dropped

113
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,720
 into this reality."

114
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
 Whatever had been going on had been going on for a while.

115
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,160
 He was just now for the first time being made aware of it.

116
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,960
 While this is all going on, while this conversation is going on, while he's realizing the predicament

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,840
 he's in, he starts to sense there's somebody behind him.

118
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
 He can't see who it is.

119
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
 That's your point.

120
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,320
 I don't even want to, right?

121
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:06,680
 But this conversation is going on and he said at a certain point, the bird man seemed

122
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,040
 to signal to Pete that a decision had been made.

123
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,440
 It was almost like subconscious that he was picking up on these details.

124
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,120
 The bird man basically seemed resigned to go along with the decision that was made.

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,680
 The bird man felt bad for Pete.

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,040
 At this point, Pete becomes aware of who is standing behind him.

127
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,080
 It is what he describes as another humanoid.

128
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 It's a woman.

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,320
 There's a whole woman standing there and she's wearing a Japanese style kimono with

130
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,560
 a pale face.

131
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,160
 She has very pale skin.

132
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,960
 Her eyes have been removed or maybe they were never there to begin with, right?

133
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,200
 It's a sort of demonic creature.

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,200
 Where her eyes should be were just these pitch black holes in her head.

135
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,080
 And she's wearing a gold crown on her head.

136
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,960
 He gets the sense that the eagle man felt bad for what was going to happen to Pete,

137
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:16,040
 but the woman seemed to derive some sort of weird pleasure about the decision that had

138
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,680
 been made and about what was going to happen to Pete.

139
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:28,720
 And she grabs Pete and begins to drag him through the coliseum towards a white door.

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,080
 A door of the brightest white light emanating out of it.

141
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:42,120
 This woman is just dragging Pete over to it.

142
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,280
 Really really interesting motifs, right?

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,720
 We have this hellish world with these creatures in it.

144
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,560
 But generally when you think of things like a golden crown and a tunnel of light, a white

145
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,840
 door, you think of good stuff, right?

146
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,080
 You think of heaven?

147
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,480
 You think passing on to the next better world?

148
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,840
 Pete makes the assumption that what's on the other side of this door is actually the end

149
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,360
 of everything.

150
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,280
 He cannot go through this door.

151
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,760
 But he's handcuffed.

152
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,160
 He's being dragged by this supernaturally strong woman.

153
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,240
 He's getting closer and closer to the door and he's fighting so hard.

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:33,040
 He's fighting so hard to get out of her grasp and he can't.

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
 He says, "I'm so close to that door.

156
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,480
 I'm so close to that door now that my legs are inside of it.

157
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,920
 My legs are inside of this door and I don't know what to do.

158
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
 My arms are restrained.

159
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,320
 This woman is forcing me to go.

160
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
 What?"

161
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:03,640
 At the very last moment before he is fully thrown through this opening, he grabs the

162
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,720
 golden crown and removes it from her head.

163
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,280
 He says instantly he hears her begin to shriek this inhuman scream.

164
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,800
 Echoes through this reality and his nose starts bleeding and his ears start bleeding and

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,840
 his vision gets distorted and he's having a hard time processing any information and

166
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,320
 then the screaming stops.

167
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,840
 He turns around and he sees that the woman has now been reduced to a pile of ash and

168
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,120
 on top of that is the golden crown.

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,720
 He instinctively, something's telling him to put the crown on and he puts it on and

170
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,600
 he realizes, "I gotta get out of here somehow."

171
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
 There's two ways he can tell or out of this area.

172
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,360
 One is the white door, the white door that he killed this woman to not go through and

173
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,560
 then he sees a tunnel headed off in the other direction and he goes, "Well, if that's the

174
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,480
 only other way I'd much rather take this tunnel."

175
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,400
 He goes running down the tunnel.

176
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 What's interesting about this story?

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,160
 I want to take another break because I'm sure some of you guys are scratching your heads.

178
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,080
 There's obviously parts of the story that physically don't make sense.

179
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,000
 She's dragging him towards the door but then his feet are in front so she would have had

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,280
 to start pushing at some point.

181
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,080
 When he removed the crown from the head, did he then drop it?

182
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,920
 Did it drop on the pile of ash?

183
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,040
 It's really interesting because on the one hand you could go, "That's dream logic."

184
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,840
 You're being dragged and the next thing you know, everything's kind of rearranged because

185
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,360
 dreams are illogical or you're holding something important and then you turn around and you're

186
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,920
 not holding it.

187
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,760
 On the one hand there are things like that where his hands are restrained behind his back

188
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
 but somehow he's able to get the crown on it.

189
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
 Fair.

190
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,320
 That's totally fair.

191
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,720
 I just wanted to address that because that is that was, I was reading this I was like,

192
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 "Hmm?

193
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
 I was trying to figure out the chain of events as well."

194
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,560
 But again, he's adamant this isn't a dream and the way that this story plays out.

195
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,520
 So he's sitting, he has to wake up with the crown and Betty doesn't wake up and he has

196
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,080
 the crown and he looks at the camera and he goes, "It wasn't a dream."

197
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,520
 It's just kind of an interesting ending to this whole thing in two ways.

198
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,920
 He takes the crown and he puts it on and he begins to make his way through this tunnel.

199
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,640
 And if there was any doubt in his mind that he was in hell before, which there wasn't,

200
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,880
 he knows he's in hell now.

201
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,480
 I mean you couldn't make the argument that the eagle and the goat and the black void energy,

202
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,280
 maybe those were angels and he was in maybe a rundown part of heaven.

203
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,640
 They needed to do some renovation and just look like hell.

204
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,960
 But as he's moving through this tunnel, he's now in basically a loony tunes version of

205
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,080
 hell.

206
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,000
 There's lava, there's seas of lava, there's volcanoes, there's fire everywhere.

207
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,400
 There are these little imps running around with mining tools.

208
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,800
 Jason is clearly a dream now.

209
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 This is clearly a dream.

210
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
 Hold on.

211
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,720
 There are these little imps with mining tools and they're just like mining rocks and they're

212
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,200
 singing songs and snow whites burning in the lake of lava.

213
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,160
 Quit singing and help me you buffoons.

214
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,920
 And he's making his way through the tunnel and he's watching these little people mine

215
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,160
 these rocks and he realizes something.

216
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,760
 He's invisible.

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,840
 Like once he put the crown on, he realizes nobody can see him.

218
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:37,920
 And he's making his way through these tunnels and these little guys talking around him.

219
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,280
 He's making his way through this tunnel and he sees these little miners running all around

220
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,160
 mining these rocks.

221
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,340
 And every show often when he's walking down this tunnel, he sees these giant eyeballs

222
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,040
 protruding from the walls and they're just staring at the proceedings.

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,720
 What he gets from them is that these are some sort of security system.

224
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,080
 Eyes felt like they were watching for something.

225
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,600
 They were trying to make sure the imps weren't taking too many coffee breaks or making sure

226
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,320
 no one escaped.

227
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,360
 But he felt the oppression of these eyeballs, these giant eyeballs staring out of the rocks

228
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
 as he's making his way through the tunnel.

229
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
 He's invisible though.

230
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
 That's the one thing.

231
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,080
 If you're trying to sneak by a security system, be invisible.

232
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,240
 And everything's going great until in typical Looney Tunes fashion, this invisible man who's

233
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,720
 trying to escape from hell bumps into one of these little creatures.

234
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,560
 And the creature kind of falls to the ground and looks up and sees nothing.

235
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
 But I mean obviously it's hell.

236
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
 Right?

237
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,680
 There's weird stuff in hell all the time.

238
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,600
 Somehow whether it was a little imp or one of these watching eyes noticed something was

239
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,920
 off, a alarm starts to go off.

240
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:01,000
 It's ear splitting, screeching alarm begins to go off and the room just seems to be flashing

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,520
 these lights.

242
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,840
 He has been detected.

243
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,360
 And then he hears a rooster crow.

244
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,440
 Next thing you notice he's laying on the floor in his bedroom.

245
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,520
 He says it wasn't a dream.

246
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,600
 It was not a dream at all.

247
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 I went somewhere that night.

248
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,840
 This is what's interesting about this.

249
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,240
 He goes, "I know so clearly that that was not a dream that I went there that night because

250
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,160
 I went crazy basically after this."

251
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:43,800
 He did not use the word crazy, but he became pretty much catatonic after this experience.

252
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,240
 He said, "I didn't speak to anyone."

253
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
 Not just about this.

254
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,960
 I didn't speak to anyone at all for weeks after this happened.

255
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,280
 Truly traumatized by this experience.

256
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:05,120
 And he says even now I have such a hard time even thinking about it.

257
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,520
 And he's posting this and he's asking, ends it like this.

258
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,680
 Basically two questions to try to sum up the whole thing and while he's asking for advice

259
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,640
 anonymously on the internet, first question was was this hell?

260
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,920
 And the second question is, am I still there?

261
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,520
 Really interesting if you think about it because he didn't escape.

262
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
 He got caught.

263
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,080
 Right?

264
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,520
 They found him.

265
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,960
 Then when you hear that rooster crow and you're back in your house, you have to ask yourself,

266
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,800
 is he still in hell?

267
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,640
 And I do think it's interesting to point out that he talks about how he didn't have a great

268
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,400
 relationship with his family that they seemed quite awful.

269
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,680
 He didn't speak to anyone for weeks and nobody thought that was weird.

270
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,160
 Like if I stopped talking for weeks, there would be quite a few people who would call

271
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
 911 and would have me admitted.

272
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,520
 Actually, probably the first few weeks he'd be like, oh, finally, he shut up.

273
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
 Finally.

274
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,920
 But that's troubling as well.

275
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,480
 Like he was basically mute and no one did anything.

276
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,840
 No one sought out any mental health services for him.

277
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,880
 But he doesn't know, was that hell for sure?

278
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,360
 And am I still there?

279
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,080
 Is my experience that I'm living on earth just punishment?

280
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,080
 Did I actually escape from that?

281
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,840
 Very interesting story and it's funny because I went back and forth on it and I go, it's

282
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,880
 so close to a dream.

283
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,200
 And long time listeners on the show know I really don't like to talk about people's dreams.

284
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,880
 But this one, I mean, and we should say he wrote it on the internet.

285
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,280
 He could be having a good laugh about it if he ever listens to the episode.

286
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,400
 I totally made that up.

287
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 That's always possible, right?

288
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,360
 But conspiracy caps fully on looking at this thing.

289
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,840
 On the one hand, dreams can be super realistic and weird.

290
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,160
 On the other hand, he did wake up in a different location.

291
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,160
 He didn't fall asleep on the ground.

292
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
 He doesn't feel like it was a dream.

293
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,040
 He felt like it was an actual phenomenon he went through.

294
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 But I wanted to tell that story for two reasons.

295
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,760
 One, because I thought it was an interesting tale.

296
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,120
 We talk a lot about people getting abducted by aliens or waking up in pitch black bedrooms.

297
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,760
 This is the first time I've ever come across someone just going to hell.

298
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
 Going to hell.

299
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,240
 And I like all the little details where he felt like this had been going on for a while

300
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,280
 and his subconscious was finally becoming aware of that.

301
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,800
 That's something that we see in near-death experiences.

302
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,120
 I got another cool story coming up later this week about something like that.

303
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,120
 And just speaking of near-death experiences altogether, I did an episode about negative

304
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,040
 near-death experiences.

305
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,440
 They're not as rare as you think.

306
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,960
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

307
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
 That was a really cool one.

308
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
 So this also goes into that catalog.

309
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,240
 But I also wanted to tell you this.

310
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,080
 Because on tomorrow's episode, I'm going to share a personal story of mine.

311
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,360
 The story that up until about two days ago, I had never told an other living soul about.

312
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,160
 And the only reason I told them, I told Sabine about it, my friend Sabine, the only reason

313
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,800
 I told her was in preparation to tell you guys this story.

314
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:29,360
 I had never, ever spoken about the time when I went to hell.

315
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,200
 We will save that story for tomorrow.

316
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
 F-Sindo.

317
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonar copter.

318
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,800
 You guys are going to get a kick out of it on so many different levels.

319
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
 F-Sindo, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonar copter.

320
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,720
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

321
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,960
 We're headed all the way out to an Easter egg hunt.

322
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,520
 We're sitting at this Easter egg hunt.

323
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,720
 We're watching all these kids run around, finding eggs.

324
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 Look at Margaret.

325
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,080
 I found the pink one.

326
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,760
 He takes a bite out of it.

327
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 And then, what was it?

328
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
 Girls named it.

329
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 I totally forgot already.

330
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
 Margaret.

331
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
 Margaret goes like, "But look it.

332
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,960
 I found this cat berry egg."

333
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,640
 And she takes a bite out of it.

334
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,120
 And everyone's having a good time.

335
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,360
 There's only two eggs.

336
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,920
 There's only two eggs in it.

337
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 Okay guys, Easter egg hunt's over.

338
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
 What?

339
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,400
 And you weren't supposed to eat those either.

340
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,760
 Those are from last year.

341
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,840
 We're watching this Easter egg hunt and then everyone kind of shuffles in.

342
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,640
 And then the guy who was in the Easter bunny costume, he's like, he gets in his car.

343
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
 He still has his helmet on.

344
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 He's like, "Woohoo!

345
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
 Woohoo!

346
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
 So whimsical!"

347
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,720
 And this is his huge Easter egg pile up.

348
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,960
 And we just kind of let the sun set on the world.

349
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,000
 We're still just sitting out in this...we're sitting out in this family's backyard and

350
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
 they're like, "Have they left yet?

351
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,640
 Are those strangers still in our yard?"

352
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,000
 We're sitting there and waiting for the sun to go down because real...most of you guys

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,320
 don't know this.

354
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,760
 Easter really begins in the dark.

355
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,080
 Because there's a lot of reports online of Easter bunny sightings.

356
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,160
 This guy tells a story from about 20 years ago when he was 6 years old.

357
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,480
 He said it was sometime between 3 and 4 in the morning and we lived in this two bedroom

358
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
 apartment.

359
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,460
 It was me and my older brother.

360
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,320
 We shared a room.

361
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,720
 And then my dad's room was across the hallway.

362
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,920
 I'm in the top bunk.

363
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,560
 My older brother's in the bottom bunk.

364
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,280
 And I wake up around...I don't remember the exact time, sometime between 3 and 4.

365
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,960
 And I noticed that our bedroom door was opened.

366
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,640
 And across the hallway I saw that my dad's bedroom door was slightly open.

367
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,000
 And I'm kind of just like...all the lights are off so everything's kind of dark and you

368
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,760
 know when you're looking at your own house in the night it's just all very gray.

369
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 But in this gray darkness I see what can only be described as two giant bunny ears begin

370
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,800
 to peek around the corner of the door.

371
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,920
 And then sure enough they're followed by a giant bunny head.

372
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,080
 And I'm sitting there...it's Easter.

373
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,880
 I don't know if that was implied.

374
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 I don't know.

375
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 It was Easter morning.

376
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 I'm sitting there.

377
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,520
 I'm getting really excited because I'm 6 years old and here's the Easter bunny.

378
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,520
 The Easter bunny is visiting our apartment.

379
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,480
 And I watch him come into frame.

380
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
 And he's standing there.

381
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,000
 He's about 4 feet tall and oddly enough, not that that's a giant rabbit.

382
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,600
 That's totally normal.

383
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
 He's 4 feet tall.

384
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
 It's his giant rabbit.

385
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,360
 But what's even more odd is that he was plaid.

386
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
 Not...he wasn't wearing a plaid shirt.

387
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,600
 He wasn't a lumberjack.

388
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,400
 His fur was completely plaid covered.

389
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
 He's like "What?"

390
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
 That's not what I thought.

391
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,200
 That's not what I thought Easter Bunny was going to look like.

392
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,720
 Easter Bunny comes and is now standing in front of their door and this little boy's

393
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,960
 like "Ooh Easter Bunny, this is so cool."

394
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:04,760
 And then the Easter Bunny smiles, revealing a row of sharp teeth.

395
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 Now a dream?

396
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,280
 He's like "Jay's not in a dream."

397
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
 No, no, no.

398
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
 It's not a dream.

399
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
 He's sitting there.

400
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,000
 He's looking at this bunny rabbit and everything was fine until it smiled and all these sharp

401
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,480
 teeth are there.

402
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,640
 And this little boy's like "Ugh, that's not what Easter Bunny's supposed to look like."

403
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,080
 But now you're petrified, right?

404
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,400
 First you thought it was this whimsical magical feeling.

405
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,120
 And now you think that you're about to become lunch.

406
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
 But maybe I'm just saying things.

407
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
 Maybe I am dreaming.

408
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,440
 Maybe this is all made up in my head because I'm 6 and that's when he hears his older brother

409
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
 say from the bottom bunk.

410
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,960
 You see that too?

411
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
 Both kids start flipping out.

412
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
 They jump out of bed.

413
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,400
 They run into their dad's room.

414
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,760
 Dad, dad, dad, the bunny rabbit's here.

415
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,320
 The bunny rabbit's here and he's a big monster man.

416
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 He's going to get us.

417
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,600
 And the dad's furious, right?

418
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,120
 Because he's just trying to sleep.

419
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,480
 It wasn't him.

420
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,800
 He wasn't dressed up as a bunny monster man.

421
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,520
 He was furious.

422
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,360
 He blamed them for making it up because they just wanted to start Easter early that year.

423
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,800
 And to this day, his dad denies it.

424
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,760
 His dad, I don't know if he asks him every single day.

425
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,000
 Every single day what's going on.

426
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,960
 But is that always the night he says I wasn't the Easter bunny?

427
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,120
 I definitely didn't walk around the house.

428
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
 I'm not 4 feet tall.

429
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,400
 I don't have razor sharp teeth.

430
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
 I wouldn't buy a costume if I had razor sharp teeth.

431
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
 Definitely.

432
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,400
 So, that's just one of many Easter bunny sightings that we do see of kids actually saying that

433
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,240
 they're seeing the Easter bunny.

434
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,360
 It's interesting because this is one of those type of stories where you post about online

435
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,240
 and then a bunch of people chime in in the comments being like, "Oh, that happened to

436
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
 me!"

437
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 I thought I was just going insane.

438
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,080
 I was just the one hallucinating that.

439
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
 People seeing the Easter bunny around Easter time.

440
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,320
 Now at the same time, there's also stories like this.

441
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,840
 One guy's like, "That happened to me!"

442
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,200
 He goes one year, the teacher were at school and the teacher goes, "Open your desk, kids.

443
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,800
 The Easter bunny left you something and everyone opened their desk and there was candy in their

444
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 desk."

445
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,920
 But this dude opens his desk up and he doesn't see any candy and then he shuts it and he

446
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,000
 tells his buddy, "I can't find the candy.

447
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
 The Easter bunny forgot me and the buddy came over."

448
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,640
 And they open the desk up and there's candy in there and that's his proof that the Easter

449
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,760
 bunny exists.

450
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,920
 This is the problem with paranormal research.

451
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,080
 Some of it just sucks, right?

452
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,840
 Kids are the least observant of all living creatures that happens all the time.

453
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,480
 But anyway, I won't really consider that proof.

454
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 Then you have accounts.

455
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,960
 There's one woman told the story that my mom always swears she saw the Easter bunny as

456
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
 a kid.

457
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,680
 She told me that story all the time.

458
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,720
 So usually just around Easter.

459
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,560
 But eventually I got old and I realized the Easter bunny wasn't real.

460
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,840
 And I remember asking my mom, "Hey, I know the Easter bunny is not real.

461
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,400
 Did you... why did you tell me you saw the Easter bunny all these years?"

462
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,000
 And the mom goes, "Oh, because I saw the Easter bunny."

463
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,920
 The Easter bunny isn't real but I saw it and she goes, "My mom never changed her story.

464
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,320
 Even when I knew for a fact that Easter bunny and Santa Claus and all this stuff wasn't real."

465
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,720
 My mom was like, "Yeah, I know.

466
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,320
 That's why I told you that story so many times.

467
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 It's terrifying."

468
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,160
 I saw something that doesn't exist.

469
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,400
 But that's the question.

470
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,680
 Does it exist?

471
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,600
 Now I see a lot of talk online and I'm sure a lot of you guys are kind of thinking around

472
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
 this way and it's definitely very plausible.

473
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,560
 The idea of topos and that's the thing that if you believe in something enough, if you

474
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,640
 give it enough of your brain power, you can create a hallucination.

475
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,320
 You can turn it into a 3D hologram.

476
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,080
 We've done at least one episode on topos before.

477
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
 I'll put it in the show notes.

478
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
 It's really creepy.

479
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,120
 I was just trying to have sex with a cartoon character.

480
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,360
 Made the cartoon character alive and then...

481
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,360
 Anyways, I'll put that in the show notes.

482
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
 Topa.

483
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,040
 And if you had millions of people believing in the Easter bunny, believing in Santa Claus,

484
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
 would it...

485
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,160
 Because there's just as many stories about people seeing Santa Claus for real, hearing

486
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,680
 sleigh bells and again, they're very adamant.

487
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,760
 My parents weren't doing it.

488
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,320
 My parents were not on the roof with a bunch of reindeer.

489
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,520
 I saw Santa Claus.

490
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,600
 So the idea is that if enough people believe in the Topa, they create this thought form

491
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,840
 over time and with all this mental power we're creating these things.

492
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,680
 But let's put on our conspiracy cap because I actually have a more sinister reason for

493
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,920
 these things.

494
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,600
 When I was looking into this, we had the Santa Claus stuff.

495
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,880
 We had the Easter bunny stuff.

496
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,960
 And then you had people chiming every once in a while saying that they saw the tooth fairy.

497
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,420
 What if this is what's going on?

498
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:42,000
 Because I think at this point, I think we should all be aware that we're lied to constantly.

499
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,360
 We're lied to by the government.

500
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,040
 We're lied to by the media.

501
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,680
 And unfortunately, we're lied to by each other now.

502
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,800
 That's become a major component of this stuff.

503
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,480
 The media tells you a lie and then you repeat the lie.

504
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,200
 You may not know that you're lying, but the media tells you a lie and then you repeat

505
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,760
 the lie and other people...

506
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,620
 Oh, that's weird.

507
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,980
 And then they repeat the lie and then eventually someone fact checks it.

508
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,140
 And then when they come to you with a fact check, you're like, "Ah, I've already forgotten

509
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,620
 about that lie that I told you."

510
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,060
 You know what I mean?

511
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,860
 Happens on all sides of the political spectrum.

512
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,940
 It seems to be relatively new though.

513
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,940
 It seems to be part of the 24-hour news cycle.

514
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
 Very, very interesting.

515
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,060
 That didn't really happen when I was growing up.

516
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,900
 But the government lies to you.

517
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,100
 That's happened since the beginning of time.

518
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,320
 The media lies to you.

519
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,440
 That's happened for quite a while as well.

520
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,000
 And now we're lying to each other.

521
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,720
 We're repeating these lies over and over again.

522
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
 We know that happens.

523
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
 That is true.

524
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,200
 So what happens when you go farther back before the lie was invented?

525
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,880
 Here's my conspiracy theory.

526
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,560
 Here's my carpenter...

527
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:58,880
 My conspiracy cap fully on theory that these entities do exist.

528
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,560
 What's the story you've always heard about Santa Claus?

529
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
 The traditional Santa Claus...

530
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,260
 I know there's different versions of him in different countries, but the traditional

531
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:13,340
 American Santa Claus was dreamt up by an artist who was trying to sell Coca-Cola products.

532
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,340
 Which even just...

533
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,340
 I'm just talking about this.

534
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,980
 Makes me want to drink a Coca-Cola so bad.

535
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,100
 I need one.

536
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:24,940
 But he drew it and then that has become the idea of Saint Nick of Santa Claus.

537
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,820
 But what if that's not the truth?

538
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,760
 What if there was predating that?

539
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:38,080
 A Santa Claus-esque demon, ghost, deity, whatever form you want to put it in, and the government

540
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,480
 covered up the existence of the Santa Claus by making up the story?

541
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
 The guy probably drew it right.

542
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,600
 I'm not saying that he didn't draw it, but that would be the easiest way to do that.

543
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 And here's the thing.

544
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 You can chase him.

545
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 That's ludicrous.

546
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,940
 It's even easier to believe that a man came up with a drawing of Santa Claus that became

547
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,900
 so popular and people started writing songs about what he looked like.

548
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,460
 And that's why we think that's way more plausible than the fact that you're telling me that

549
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,320
 in America predating that there was some sort of ghoulish figure that looked like Santa

550
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:20,840
 Claus and to cover up his existence, the government made up the story that he was made

551
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,340
 up.

552
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:29,300
 But we see them do that with the UFO phenomenon.

553
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,140
 We saw it happen right before it.

554
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,140
 We can look back to the past 70 years of UFO stories.

555
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
 And they do that.

556
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,180
 You have people reporting these black triangular shapes in the sky.

557
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:49,580
 The military designs stealth fighter jets to look like black triangles in the sky and

558
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:58,060
 then say these UFO sightings that predated the stealth fighter jet were of test of the

559
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,140
 stealth fighter jet.

560
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,380
 You have the phenomenon and then you have the cover story.

561
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,580
 So is it possible that they did this with Santa Claus?

562
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,060
 Is it possible that around Easter?

563
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,060
 Because here's the thing too.

564
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:17,100
 You know my boy, I have such a serious tone when I'm talking about this.

565
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
 Here's the thing.

566
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,340
 If you look for what's the history of the Easter Bunny, where does the Easter Bunny

567
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,060
 come from?

568
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,420
 Every time they talk about it they go, "We don't know."

569
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:34,100
 Or one theory is they have no idea what the true originally came up with the idea of the

570
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,300
 Easter Bunny.

571
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
 We don't know.

572
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,660
 There's theories that it comes from this German tradition.

573
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,700
 It's a theory that it started in the 1700s in America.

574
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,940
 But they don't know.

575
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,660
 It's just there.

576
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:54,300
 So is the Easter Bunny a cover story for a giant rabbit that does stalk the residents

577
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
 of America?

578
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
 And here's the thing too.

579
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,780
 This is so ridiculous.

580
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,260
 Here's my thing too.

581
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,700
 Is it possible that the reason why we have the Easter Bunny sightings around the spring

582
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,500
 equinox is because that is when the veil is thinnest?

583
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,540
 And is there a reason why we have the Santa Claus?

584
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,700
 People aren't seeing Santa Claus on Arbor Day.

585
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,460
 They're seeing Santa Claus around Christmas Day.

586
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,420
 Like Jason, please just stop.

587
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:28,060
 You're telling me that because Santa Claus is only seeing it Christmas time, it has something

588
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:33,780
 to do with the changing of the seasons or the end of the year and that somehow the veil

589
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,580
 is thin around then and the real Santa Claus shows up and all of the images of Santa Claus

590
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,180
 is based on a real figure.

591
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,660
 Is that what you're saying, Jason?

592
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,780
 I do want to add this too.

593
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
 I am saying that.

594
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
 I do want to add this too.

595
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,940
 You have the Easter Bunny sightings.

596
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,620
 You have the Santa Claus sightings.

597
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:57,100
 And I was perplexed by the Tooth Fairy sightings.

598
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,300
 Because what if there is something about when a...

599
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:05,900
 What if there's something about kids' teeth falling out that, again, used to attract this

600
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,100
 pixie-like creature who loved the children's teeth and then the government...

601
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,780
 The government's spying on a house.

602
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,060
 They think they're Soviet spies and they see this little tinkerbell person walk in and

603
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,260
 then walk out with a little tooth and it's like...

604
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:26,180
 It's licking it and they're like, "Call the Pentagon right now.

605
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,340
 We have no idea what we just saw."

606
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,180
 And then the government has to come up with a cover story.

607
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
 They're like, "Right, another one.

608
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:36,060
 I don't know how we got people to believe in the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus."

609
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,620
 They're not real even though they show up all the time.

610
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,620
 Fine.

611
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,540
 Maybe there is a creature that loves human teeth and the stories of the Tooth Fairy are

612
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,180
 real but then we were told they were fake.

613
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,860
 So if anyone ever talks about the Tooth Fairy being real or the Easter Bunny being real or

614
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,500
 Santa Claus being real, we think they're insane.

615
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,340
 And actually, most people will not admit this outside of their families or outside of an

616
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,100
 anonymous post online.

617
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,580
 Because if you were at work and you go, "Hey, Charlie, how was your weekend?"

618
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,580
 They're like, "Oh, it was really cool.

619
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
 I saw the Easter Bunny.

620
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
 He was in my house.

621
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,900
 He surprisingly has really sharp teeth."

622
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,220
 And they're just drinking their coffee.

623
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,700
 That person would be locked away.

624
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,380
 It's such a perfect cover story.

625
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,140
 If these entities exist and who knows, maybe someday characters like Bigfoot will become

626
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,660
 part of a cultural celebration and then two, three hundred years later, you'll be buying

627
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,020
 Bigfoot cards on Arbor Day.

628
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,660
 You'll become part of that tradition.

629
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
 And then when people do go, "Hey, I saw Bigfoot."

630
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
 People are like, "What?

631
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,100
 The Arbor Day guy doesn't exist."

632
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:48,420
 Like, that was something we made up to kids so they'd go plant trees.

633
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,700
 You're nuts.

634
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,020
 This is the perfect way to cover something up.

635
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,500
 Make it so foolish to talk about it.

636
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,980
 You don't talk about it.

637
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,180
 They did it with UFOs.

638
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,500
 They 100%, the government 100% did it with UFOs.

639
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,580
 So are they doing it with the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy?

640
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,220
 Who knows?

641
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,100
 That's the great thing about being a conspiracy theorist.

642
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,060
 I don't have to prove anything.

643
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:20,660
 I just have to have a hunch.

644
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,260
