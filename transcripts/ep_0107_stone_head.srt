1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Books bound in human skin. We go and visit the dirtiest man in the world.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,360
 Then we look at the winding mysterious tale of a stone head found in Guatemala.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,480
 What starts off as possible proof of an ancient civilization or UFO

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,240
 encounter becomes even odder today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,360
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great... huh? I'm having a great day. I hope

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,080
 you're having a great day too. I'm battling something in my ear.

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,760
 You listeners are probably like, "Dude, you're always sick." You just got done with

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,440
 the sinus infection, but now I got some ear pressure. Actually, it hurts to talk.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,640
 So we're gonna go ahead... so yeah, we still got to record the podcast though.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,960
 So we're gonna go ahead and get started though, not because I want to hurry up

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,440
 and get this done with, but because we actually have a lot to cover. So first

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,800
 thing I wanted to talk about was books bound in human flesh. Now the idea of a

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,240
 book having a fleshy cover is kind of something that... it's one of those

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,960
 things that I think you would expect to be real. You wouldn't be surprised to

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,520
 know that they actually exist, but for the most part we see them appear in horror

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
 movies or horror novels or things like that, where it's like the net

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,440
 cramming on, it's bound in the flesh of a tortured human and so on and so forth.

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,360
 They do have pretty good provenance. Provenance? I know I never get that

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,720
 word right. I think it's provenance, like the history of something. They do have

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,360
 pretty good provenance on human-covered books. Books with human skin covers? As of

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,480
 2016, there are 47 supposed books, the covers flesh. 18 have been confirmed to

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,080
 have the flesh. 14 has been disproved and others are currently being tested. I

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,720
 don't know why it's taken them so long. Just run a normal book cover, does not

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,400
 have DNA. If it has DNA, it is human. There. I just saved you guys a ton of time.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,000
 What's weird though, so you go, "Okay, Jason, yeah, there's books bound in human

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,980
 flesh. No big deal." What's bizarre is the the small amount of them. Now, I thought

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,760
 they'd be everywhere, because people have been around forever. Books have been

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,480
 around for what? Since the Gutenberg press, roughly? And I love it how you can

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,880
 often see the gaps in my my history. But so books were around probably like

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,920
 1484, but there's always been like tablets and papyrus and like scrolls. I'm

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,680
 sure scrolls are made of human flesh, but they say we only have these 47 books.

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,120
 1568 was apparently the first time that they're like, "This is the oldest book

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,600
 with human flesh." It was a medical book, and that was actually quite common. It was

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,080
 medical books that mostly have been discovered having human flesh covers.

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,880
 Because medical staff had easy access to cadavers, you know, I would be really

37
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:02,400
 cautious to go to a doctor who all of his patients have an 8x12 patch cut

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,440
 out of their skin. I mean, not his alive patients, but he's like, "You know,

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,040
 obviously the medical guy, the dude doing the tannery, gives it to the the

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,720
 mortician." The mortician's like, "Why is this guy always missing a peachy's binder

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,040
 size of skin from his torso?" Whatever, I'll just burn the bunny. So a lot of

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,360
 these were medical texts. There were a couple famous ones. So you know, the

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,240
 gunpowder plot in England, remember, remember the 5th of November? Guy Fox,

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,480
 all that stuff. One of the guys who was caught up in that, his name was Henry

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,120
 Garnett, he in 1606 when he was executed, they made a book out of his skin

46
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,160
 about the event. So I mean, that's, you know, throwing salt on the wound. Your

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,800
 failed event and then we're going to immortalize it in a book and the cover

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,600
 is your skin. There was rumors during the French Revolution that there was a

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,120
 tannery set up just outside of town, basically, where they were cutting skin

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,480
 off people to make books. And so again, like, sure, that was probably just a rumor,

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
 but you'd think there would still be more than these 47 books. Now, you had the

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
 people, you had the medical doctors doing it, you had condemned prisoners,

53
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,880
 their skin was also being turned into books. There's two famous examples. There

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,000
 was this guy named James Allen, he went by the alias George Walton and he,

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,320
 there's a book called The Highwayman, narrative of the life of James Allen,

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,800
 alias George Walton. And it's by James Allen, who when he was dying, he's like,

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,720
 "I want you to, I want you to take this book. I want you to use my skin to make

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,200
 the cover." And people are like, "Okay, I guess." And he's like, "And then, this happened

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,240
 in 1837, that's why I'm doing an old-timey voice." But he's like, "Ugh, I got the

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,000
 consumption and other old-timey diseases, plus I'm being executed for my crimes all

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,880
 at the same time. And I want you to, I wrote this book, I want you to put my human

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,000
 skin, my epidermis for the cover." And they go, "Okay, so I want you to give this book

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,520
 to this dude who I tried robbing once and he was so brave, I want him to have my

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,960
 skin book. Now, that's cool and all. I don't know if I would want that. Like, if

65
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,320
 some guy put a gun in my face, an old-timey gun, like a big old revolver,

66
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,240
 and I was brave, which is cool, and I survived. And then years later, I get a

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,320
 book in the mail and it's his biography and I'm like, "Oh, that's interesting. You

68
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,400
 know, I wonder if I'm in it." And then you touch it, you realize the cover has

69
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,720
 follicles. Yeah, I don't think so. The other interesting, this, I don't understand

70
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,360
 this. I don't, do not understand this example of a human skin book. There is a,

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,960
 it is the biography of Abraham Lincoln, bound in the human skin of, and this isn't

72
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,880
 my word, this is the word off Wikipedia. This, I, it is bound with the skin of a

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,160
 Negro. So, I think you're kind of missing the point of what Abraham Lincoln was

74
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,800
 trying to do. It's like, hey, remember when, remember when that president freed

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,520
 all those slaves? Here's one of them! Here's this book! Why would you, what was the,

76
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,400
 who was thinking that through? But apparently you can read a biography of

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,560
 the life of Abraham Lincoln and the cover is made out of the skin of a

78
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,000
 black man. Super bizarre. Now, here's the thing. Like I said in the beginning, I

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,340
 think there's far more books out there than these 47 that are made with human

80
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,360
 skin. In the article I was reading, they said there's a lot of legends of books of

81
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,920
 erotica and occult manuals being bound in human flesh, but that's mostly just

82
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,760
 rumors. I'm sure there's a ton of them. I'm sure there is a lot of a, especially a

83
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,960
 cult books that are bound in human flesh, because why not? The world's been,

84
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,880
 we've been around for so long, we've been book binding for so long. I'm sure

85
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,520
 there are not like vast amounts, it's not like a Barnes and Noble of human skin,

86
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,820
 but I'm sure there are a lot of books out there, because these books are the

87
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,220
 ones that are like in libraries. But if you had a personal collection of erotica

88
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,780
 bound in the human skin of young maidens, or you had like dark grim walls of, you

89
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,300
 know, I'm sure there's even probably Bibles bound in human flesh. I'm sure

90
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,940
 that there are just mainstream religious texts that are like, "Oh yes, this one's

91
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,180
 made out of some priest dude who fell over and I figure no one was gonna

92
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,080
 discover the body. He always wanted to be in the Bible, so now he is the cover."

93
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,720
 I'm sure there are actually, I mean, not, when I say common I don't mean like

94
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,320
 comparatively to all the total of book bindings in the world, but I would bet

95
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,960
 money there's more than 47 books out there that have a cover made from a

96
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,840
 living human, a previously living human. But dude, just do a DNA test and it's a

97
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,560
 human or it's cardboard or maybe like a lamb. It really shouldn't be that hard.

98
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,820
 It shouldn't take you that long to figure out how many books have human flesh on

99
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,900
 them. That's a good reason to get tattoos. That way if your skin ever gets

100
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,580
 turned into a book cover, it's beautiful. It's already illustrated. Next story we're

101
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,980
 gonna look at. This one is an interesting story because it's basically a story of

102
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,820
 degrees. It's a story of lots of little small steps that lead to you being

103
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,660
 discussed on a podcast called Dead Rabbit Radio. This one's actually a

104
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,340
 recommendation from YouTube user David. David, I always leave out people's last

105
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,680
 names because I don't know if they want that much attention. But anyway, so David

106
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,560
 on YouTube was like, "Hey, have you ever covered the story of the dirtiest man in

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,320
 the world?" And now I was aware of the dirtiest man in the world, but I hadn't

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,800
 done an episode on him yet. This is legit. You go, is he gonna list ten

109
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,280
 people who are the dirtiest? No, there's actually a guy who's considered the dirtiest

110
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,440
 man in the world. So let's hop in the carpenter copter. We are leaving the

111
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,400
 books, the human skin book place. So I'll hop in the carpenter copter. We're gonna

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,340
 fly over to Iran and not get shot down. We're gonna land in southern Iran, far away

113
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,340
 from any sort of missiles. I'm assuming, I don't know why. Anyways, the carpenter copter

114
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:07,540
 flies over the Middle East safely, lands in southern Iran, and that is where we

115
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:14,660
 meet Amu Haji. So Amu Haji is 84 years old. He's an old man, live in in the desert.

116
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,400
 He's 84 years old. He has not had a bath in 60 years. He's so dirty looking and

117
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,440
 all leathery that he looks like the dirt around him. Other people, and that's not

118
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,940
 me being racist, other people in Iran go, "He looks like the dirt. He looks like a

119
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,380
 bunch of rocks moving around." So like I said, this is a story of degrees. The

120
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,840
 question is, how do you become the dirtiest man living in the desert? This,

121
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,060
 okay, so the story goes like this. The legend is that when he was a young man, a

122
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,300
 young woman broke his heart. Aww, that's so sad. I wonder if they have Valentine's Day in

123
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,140
 Iran. Anyway, so this young girl breaks his heart and he's like, "I don't want

124
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,800
 anything to do with anybody. I'm totally heartbroken. I'm just gonna leave town."

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,340
 So he runs out into the desert. Now that's, I get that. I get that emotion. You get

126
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,940
 your heart broken when you're young or even when you're old, but it hurts more

127
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,260
 when you're young because it's, you know, you haven't had it broken that many times.

128
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,020
 You run away. Now again, here's the first degree. Most people go, "You know what? I

129
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,140
 this isn't, I just gotta get back on the saddle and go back to town and try to

130
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,340
 find my way in the world." But he doesn't. He goes, "Yeah, I have whatever. I'm gonna

131
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,700
 live out in the desert." Now he's living out in the desert and while he's out

132
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,300
 there, whatever reason, he goes, "You know what? I'm gonna also do while I'm out here.

133
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,740
 I'm gonna stop bathing. I'm just gonna stop. I'm just gonna stop bathing." And you

134
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,940
 might go, "Okay, Jason, that's it. You're in the desert, so you're gonna be dirty all

135
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,180
 the time. You would spend all day long taking baths. It could have been a, a,

136
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,700
 just could have been a logistical issue. You didn't have time or enough water to

137
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,100
 bathe all the time." But he actually believes that if he takes a bath, he gets

138
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,580
 sick. So he runs out into the desert because he gets his heart broken. He

139
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,060
 decides to stop taking baths. And then he makes the decision to start drinking

140
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,260
 water out of a rusty oil can, a rusty old dirty oil can. And you're like, "Why? Go

141
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,740
 back to town and get some nice ceramic mugs. Get a beer stein." But no, he finds a

142
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,780
 dusty, rusty dirty oil can. He uses that to drink water. He drinks five liters of water

143
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,700
 a day, so that's good. He's not gonna get dehydrated. He may get several oil-based

144
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,180
 illnesses, but he's not gonna get dehydrated. So what does he do for food? You

145
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,380
 ask, "Well, for food, what would you do for food if you're in the Iranian desert?"

146
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,220
 What animals are out there? Vultures, worms, I don't know. But he decides to

147
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,980
 eat rotting porcupine meat. That's his favorite meal. He eats rotting porcupine

148
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,940
 meat. See what I mean? It's a story of degrees. You want to be a hermit? Fine.

149
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,180
 You don't want to take a bath? Fine. But at what point do you go, "I'm just gonna eat

150
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,740
 rotting porcupine meat?" Because if there's rotting porcupine meat, there's

151
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:02,020
 porcupines. Just get a porcupine and kill it and cook it and eat it. You don't have

152
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,660
 to eat it rotting. Just eat one that you just killed. So apparently in Iran, there

153
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,260
 are vultures, worms, and porcupines because there's enough rotting meat for

154
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,660
 him to eat it. So he's sitting there, let's say at this point he's probably

155
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,300
 like 40 or 50. He's been out in the desert for a long time. He's covered in dirt,

156
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,580
 drinking water out of a rusty oil can. He's eating rotting porcupine meat, but

157
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,780
 he's like, "You know what, man? I'm so bored. I didn't bring any of my human skin

158
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:32,220
 books out here because I didn't bring any of any entertainment. I don't

159
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,180
 got my Game Boy. What am I gonna do for fun?" So what would you do for fun? You

160
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:45,100
 would of course do what Mu does. He starts smoking dried animal poop. Now at

161
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:53,820
 this point you're like rotting meat, dirty water, no bath, and for

162
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:01,020
 entertainment he smokes dried animal poop. Why? Like that's what was so... if it

163
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,660
 was just this guy was the dirtiest man in the world, I'd be like, "Yeah, it doesn't

164
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,860
 take a bath. No big deal." But it's all the other little things that he does that

165
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,140
 just paints this sign of insanity. Now he says that he's totally fine. He says one

166
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,060
 of the biggest trouble that he's had was a group of men from the nearby town

167
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,260
 showed up and tried to force him to take a bath and he ran away. Like that was one

168
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,140
 of the big moments of his life as a hermit. Now he's been covered in media

169
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,640
 quite a lot because again it's kind of an intriguing case. It's usually

170
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,900
 intriguing when people just kind of brush off society and go out on their own.

171
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:41,500
 But the latest article I read was that he is currently looking for love. He wants

172
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,620
 to rekindle that fire he once had. Bring that love back into his life. I think

173
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,180
 before that happens you're going to have to take a bath and that's probably the

174
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,020
 least of your things. You're gonna have to find something else to eat and stop

175
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,420
 smoking the animal dung. But at 84 I can't imagine like even if he came back

176
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:05,060
 and did like a whole "she's all that" makeover thing. I think after spending 60

177
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,700
 years out in the wilderness that just being inside like having to go back to

178
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,620
 sit inside and then you're like, "Whoa, what's this thing?" And they're like, "Oh,

179
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,860
 that's a SpongeBob SquarePants." He's like, "Oh my god, people these these drawings,

180
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,380
 they automatically..." He's not that old. He knows what television and cartoons are,

181
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,660
 but it would be such a culture shock. So he can either hope for to go back into

182
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,060
 the real world or for one day him to wake up and there is a hot young woman

183
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,620
 sitting there just slightly dusty going, "Man, I'm thirsty. Is there any rusty oil

184
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,420
 cans around I can drink from?" Like he would need to find someone on his viable

185
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,460
 level. But you know the world's big enough. I'm sure there are women who read that

186
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,020
 article and were like, "Hmm, it's kind of sexy. He's a rebel. The ultimate bad boy.

187
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,260
 He doesn't let society tell him what to smoke. He'll eat whatever he wants." I'm

188
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,260
 sure if he had a mail address, women would write him love letters like they

189
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,860
 write serial killers in prison. But Hamu, Haji, Dead Rabbit, Radio Salutu, whatever

190
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,060
 you want, I hope you get. You don't... you seem relatively harmless. I just think

191
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,580
 it's so bizarre that you go from just saying, "I don't want to take a bath to

192
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,020
 smoke an animal poop and eating rotting porcupine." Like I really wish I could

193
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,580
 figure out where those decisions happened because I don't think all four of

194
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,460
 those things happen on the same day. I don't think as he was leaving town, he

195
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,380
 saw a rotting porcupine and goes, "I'll be back for you later." First I gotta go not

196
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,860
 take a bath. But then I'm gonna eat you. I'm gonna smoke some animal poop. It's just

197
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,300
 weird how those steps all progressed. Okay, for our last story of the night, this

198
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,140
 one was really weird. This was also a request from YouTube. And I'm not gonna

199
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,300
 be able to pronounce the name right, but I'm gonna try it. Holly Coraris? Holly

200
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,660
 Co... Coris? Holly Coris? They hit me up and they said, "Hey, have you ever done an

201
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,100
 episode on the... Have you ever heard of the Guatemalan Stonehead?" And I hadn't.

202
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,900
 I looked it up and I saw the picture and I was like, "Oh, that's intriguing." And I

203
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,860
 kind of filed it away. Every so often I would kind of take a brief look at it

204
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,060
 and it didn't really investigate it. It was intriguing. I was like, "Okay, I'll do

205
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,580
 that on season three." And today I sat down and I said, "You know, I'm gonna do

206
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,780
 Guatemalan Stonehead." I've been doing some changes with the stories this

207
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,140
 week because some stuff has popped up, Thanksgiving conspiracy and all that for

208
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,300
 next for tomorrow. So I was kind of looking for a good meaty story to tell

209
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:22,180
 today. Guatemalan Stonehead, I looked into it and it is bizarre. The whole... It's so

210
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,460
 wrapped up in these... Okay, let me just... It was not what I expected the story to be.

211
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,860
 So, but let's get into the basics. So the carbonic copter we have to leave in Iran

212
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,820
 because the dirtiest man in the world was sleeping in it and it smells like

213
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,940
 rotting porcupine meat. So now we're gonna have to take the... Oh, now we're stuck

214
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,220
 again with the Dead Rabbit rowboat. So it is a long journey from Iran to

215
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,540
 Guatemala. We're going to row all the way from the desert of Iran somehow to

216
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,140
 Guatemala. It's a long journey, but we get to know each other better. And he gave

217
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:59,220
 us an ample supply of dried animal poop to smoke. So we are ripped. We are totally

218
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,540
 off our heads by the time we get to Guatemala, which is probably gonna help

219
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,940
 for this story. So we're tied the... Tied the rowboat up to the... What's that thing

220
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,220
 up here? Now we've got to get our sea legs back. We're kind of walking weird.

221
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,820
 Severely vitamin C deficient. We both have scurvy. But now we're on land. We're in

222
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:24,020
 Guatemala. We're gonna go get a beer and a bunch of oranges. We're gonna eat a ton

223
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,060
 of limes now. So anyways, we're on the land. We're in Guatemala. 1987, Dr. Oscar

224
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,020
 Rafael Padilla-Laura got a picture. We'll just call him Oscar. Oscar was a

225
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,380
 ufologist. So he was a guy who was into conspiracy theories and UFOs and all

226
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,740
 that stuff. He gets a picture and there's a picture of a little Volkswagen bug

227
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,380
 parked next to a giant stone head somewhere in the jungles of Guatemala.

228
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,460
 Is what is the letter included with the picture says. It's somewhere in the

229
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,500
 jungles of Guatemala. Now what's interesting about the face of the stone

230
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:03,740
 head, it has Caucasian features. So it has like a sharp nose, thin lips, high

231
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,020
 cheekbones. In that region where this head was discovered, there are other stone

232
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,300
 heads. They're very popular. They're the Olmec stone heads. The civilization, the

233
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,300
 Olmecs and the Mayans lived in the civilization. They carved also these

234
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,620
 massive stone heads, but they had facial features that were reminiscent of the

235
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,660
 civilizations that lived there. So they had puffier cheeks, flat noses, and their

236
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,540
 eyes were a bit crossed. And there are still people in the region who match.

237
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,620
 They don't have giant stone heads, but they look like a... the stone heads look

238
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,380
 like the people who did live there. But out of the middle of the jungle you have

239
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,820
 a head that is listed as being Caucasian features. So he gets this photo in 1987.

240
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,340
 The photo is dated like the 1950s. And he writes an article for like this UFO

241
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,900
 magazine. He's like, "Look at this picture. This picture. This head

242
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,460
 shouldn't exist in this area. There was no white people in the area when this

243
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,020
 head would have been created, when the Olmec heads would have been created. This

244
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,580
 is an anomaly. Could it be aliens? Could it be a previous race?" So on and so forth.

245
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,940
 So of course people start to ask questions and they're like, "Oh, where's the head at?

246
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:14,180
 You know, what's going on? How do we find out more about this? We need to know

247
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,220
 what's going on." Doc Oscar. We'll call him Dr. Oscar. Dr. Oscar says that he was

248
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:24,020
 just able to, from the brief information in the letter, able to track down where

249
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,340
 the head actually was. So he goes there and the head is shot to pieces. The

250
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,060
 lips are gone, the nose is gone, and the eyes are shot away. We're blown off by

251
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,380
 anti-government forces. There was a civil war. There was a lot of civil strife in

252
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,820
 that area. And he was like, "I'm never going back there. I'm not gonna tell anyone

253
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,620
 where it's at, but this is a real stonehead and here's the proof. Here's

254
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,060
 this photo." And he didn't take more photos of it with all the stuff blown off

255
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,020
 of it. So people were suspicious, but also very intrigued. Because this wasn't just

256
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,340
 some dude that he was a well-respected UFOologist, especially in Central America,

257
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:06,460
 lore, things like that. The story had pretty much disappeared. Like, it was

258
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,220
 just kind of... there's so much stuff that comes out in weird news that it's... unless

259
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,340
 something is constantly developing, stuff will kind of fall the wayside. This

260
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,820
 story pretty much disappeared until there was a documentary being, quote-unquote,

261
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,500
 documentary being made called Revelations of the Mayans 2012 and

262
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,340
 Beyond. And this is where the story gets really bizarre. So this documentary is

263
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:34,220
 being made. And they believe that it is either an ancient civilization that

264
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:41,780
 predated the Olmecs that built this head. So before any indigenous people of

265
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,460
 Central America, South America were there, there was a previous race of white

266
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,260
 people or Caucasians in that area. And it's funny because that ties a lot into

267
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,180
 the theory of Hitler's master race and then wanting to go to South America to

268
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:00,220
 build colonies and use and all that stuff. But anyway, so they positioned

269
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,980
 themselves as either there was an older race that existed in Central and South

270
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,900
 America or aliens built it. This documentary, they got a letter from

271
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,420
 Guatemalan archaeologist Hector E. Maji. And this is what the letter said. "I

272
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 certify that this monument presents no characteristics of Maya, Nato, Olmec, or

273
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,940
 any other pre-Hispanic civilization. It was created by an extraordinary and

274
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,380
 superior civilization with awesome knowledge of which there is no record

275
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:40,420
 of existence on this planet." That's quite the bold letter. So what's funny was

276
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,540
 that this documentary was going to be made. They got this letter going. Theories now

277
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,100
 again were starting to fly. Was this stone head, was this stone head created by

278
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,500
 the Olmecs? And it's an anomaly? Is the stone head proof of an older

279
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,140
 civilization? The fact that the stone head is slightly looking up, is it proof that

280
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,300
 it's looking for aliens? They have the alien race that are known as the

281
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,260
 Pleiadians, which are Arian. They're white and blonde hair and all that stuff.

282
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,020
 We'll get into them in a later episode, but the idea that it could be modeled on

283
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,820
 them. So here, this is, it's, this story was, when I was researching it, I was like,

284
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,700
 "Okay, stone head, different theories." I read an article and the first article I

285
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,620
 read there, kind of like, "This is kind of weird, this is kind of weird." As I kept

286
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,660
 reading more articles, the stories just got weirder and weirder. So the

287
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,580
 documentary, Revelations of the Minds 2012 and Beyond, was being made by Rawl

288
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,900
 Julia's son, which I don't know why I think that's funny, but I think it's funny.

289
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,620
 Because when everything a Rawl Julia, I think a street fighter in the movie. I,

290
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,900
 everything else he did, that's all I can remember a street fighter movie. Anyway,

291
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,340
 so Rawl Julia's son, and by since son, is making this documentary. They include that

292
00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:00,580
 letter by Hector E. Maja. Hector eventually says, "The letter that they presented was

293
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,820
 completely altered. I never saw the statue. I never visited the site. I saw the

294
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,020
 photograph." He goes, "I don't believe it's anything extraordinary at all." So the

295
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,620
 documentary actually cast more doubt on the fact that this head even existed at

296
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,020
 all. Because all anyone had was this photo. Now, there were other researchers who

297
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,500
 were looking into this over the years. No one could ever find it, because it was

298
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,420
 just, and basically an undated photo that one guy said that he visited, but

299
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,060
 wouldn't tell anyone where it was at. And there were researchers who were

300
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,660
 looking at it saying, "This is proof of the white master race that white people

301
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,780
 existed here long before anyone else." And then, I guess if they're the master

302
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,900
 race, somehow they died off. But anyways, this is proof of that. Other people are

303
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,020
 like, "This is proof of aliens." Other people said, "No, there's an archaeological

304
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,180
 reason. There must have been other Olmecs who made this head for whatever reason."

305
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,980
 Lost in all of the shuffle, predating even the photograph from the 1950s, the

306
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,700
 answer was there. And a lot of these researchers could easily access this

307
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,100
 information, and they either weren't, or they saw it and just completely disregarded

308
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,820
 it. This is the tale of the Guatemalan Stonehead. It actually did exist. The

309
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:19,980
 photograph is real. It is a real Stonehead in the middle of Guatemala. In 1941-1942,

310
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,780
 the Carnegie Institution Reconnaissance Survey was going through the area, taking

311
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:31,300
 notes of everything. They came across the story of a guy in 1936 who used soft

312
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:38,140
 volcanic pumice and carved a monument to his dead wife on his form. When the

313
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,180
 Carnegie, they weren't there specifically to look for the Stonehead. They were just

314
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,300
 doing reconnaissance of the area, archaeological stuff, history stuff, all

315
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,860
 that stuff. They come across the Stonehead. They talk to people like, "Hey,

316
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,020
 what's that doing there?" People in town are like, "Oh, Joe made that." We don't know

317
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,620
 who, we don't know the name of the guy who made it. A lot of the stuff had been

318
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,060
 lost, but they'd be like, "Hey, Joe made that." Yeah, he made it for his dead wife,

319
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,580
 and they're like, "Oh, that's interesting." They talk to other people in town. They're

320
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,820
 like, "Hey, do you know anything about the Stonehead?" They're like, "Yeah, yeah, the

321
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,140
 farm administrator over there, he lost his wife, he was really sad. He basically

322
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,260
 carved this monument." It is huge. It's bigger than a Volkswagen Bug, but it's a

323
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,420
 very soft stone. He's like, "Yeah, you know, he sat and carved it for his dead wife.

324
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:20,380
 It's a monument." And so, the Carnegie Institution was like, "Okay, this is what

325
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,500
 this is." They ended up, so there was a historian back in the day, wrote an

326
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,300
 article. Lee Parsons wrote this article called, "A pseudo pre-Columbian colossal

327
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,180
 stonehead on the Pacific coast of Guatemala." And this article is explaining

328
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,500
 the Stonehead and where it came from and the history behind it. And this is an

329
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,580
 interesting part of this article. Here's the quote here, "Whatever the inspiration,

330
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,140
 its very existence could confound future archaeologists and lead to unwarranted

331
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,300
 explanations of trans-pacific contact or even mysterious pre-Columbian

332
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,260
 megalithic complexes. Anticipating such interpretations, I have titled this paper

333
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,900
 a pseudo pre-Columbian colossal stonehead. Actually, there was no intention

334
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,580
 whatever to defraud. But through the years, the sculpture has become increasingly

335
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,540
 difficult to identify. Therefore, it is here recorded that the lost Victoria

336
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:22,540
 stonehead is recent, having been carved in 1936. Further, it has no meaningful

337
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,300
 relationship to any American Indian living or dead. I regret that I am

338
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,100
 unable to supply the name of the Guatemalan for who the monument is a true

339
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,180
 modern memorial." So the person who made it, his name has been lost and unfortunately

340
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,920
 the person who it was made as a memorial for was lost. Apparently, there was a

341
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,940
 plaque at one time at the base of the stonehead. Plaque's gone. And the idea

342
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,580
 that it got shot to pieces by anti-government forces, the theory is

343
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:56,380
 that it was a soft pumice. So really, it wouldn't have lasted the ages. Just

344
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,380
 erosion will take care of it. But this Lee Parsons was like, "Listen, I know what's

345
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,280
 gonna happen. People are gonna stumble across this stonehead and they're going

346
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,100
 to think that it is proof of something that it's not. This was a modern

347
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,340
 memorial that was made. But he knew how historians and archaeologists and stuff

348
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,380
 like that would think. And he's also thinking 100, 200, 300 years in the

349
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,020
 future. Like, again, the nose is gone, the lips are gone, the eyes are gone, but

350
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,300
 it's still different looking enough. And they were going to be like, "This is proof

351
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,620
 of something. We don't know what it is. We're gonna start looking into it." And

352
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,420
 he's like, "No, no, no, don't. I'm writing this. I trust that people in the

353
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,660
 future will be smart enough to find my article. And I am telling you this is a

354
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,260
 history of the stonehead." So that's it. The stonehead does exist. How much of it?

355
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,900
 It's possible that Dr. Oscar went there and saw the head. And it had been either

356
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,620
 blown up, piece of it blown up, or just because it's softer stone parts of it

357
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,700
 were eroding away. His story may be true that he went there and he's like, "It's

358
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,540
 too violent here." He could have went there and realized, "This is more

359
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,220
 modern than it looks in the picture. So I'm just not gonna tell anyone where

360
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,940
 it's at." And it is weird that he didn't take any additional photos to go all the

361
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,500
 way out there and not take any... I mean, we rode all the way from Iran. He just

362
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,820
 showed up in a car and couldn't even take a photo. There are still people who

363
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,740
 believe that this story is a cover-up. That the stonehead is actually from an

364
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:27,660
 ancient white Caucasian civilization or aliens. And this story that was planted

365
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:34,580
 20, 30 years before the UFO story even started. That this story is fake. I mean,

366
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,100
 you would really have to do some like vast retconning. I really... this was a

367
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,660
 really enjoyable story to research because again, I went in thinking, "Oh,

368
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,020
 there's gonna be the stonehead. There's not gonna be... the questions are gonna be

369
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,820
 who built it, why, and when. There's gonna be no answers." And it actually turned

370
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,700
 into this winding mystery that actually has a conclusion. Which my favorite

371
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,180
 mysteries, my favorite like conspiracy mysteries, true crime, paranormal, are

372
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,580
 the ones that have a definite conclusion. This is what happened. The open-ended

373
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,100
 ones are fun to speculate on. But when you can actually go back and say, "This is

374
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,820
 real and this is what happened and there's no real speculation behind it,"

375
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,540
 that is what I find the most fun researching. Because there's an end. Just

376
