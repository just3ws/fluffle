1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 Did a book from the 18th century lead to dozens if not hundreds of deaths?

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:15,200
 And then we traveled to California where one night a young girl answered the door and the unthinkable happened

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,200
 There were no clues to her death

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,640
 Until her ghostly image appeared on nearby billboard today on Dead Rava Radio

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,380
 *music*

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,360
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,020
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too. I gotta be honest man

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,960
 I've recorded three versions of this. This is version three. This first story. I had a really hard time

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,880
 Not being super depressing when I'm telling it

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,120
 So let's see how I got it recorded eventually or I just ditched the whole story. I do think it's an interesting story though

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,360
 Let's talk about suicide now

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,000
 What I really want to get to is this really interesting story

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,800
 So as I'm going down this internet rabbit hole is researching the Golden Gate Bridge because I was researching ghosts of San Francisco for an upcoming episode

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,640
 They started talking about the suicides on the Golden Gate Bridge

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,280
 And then I just kind of started doing all of this research on all of these weird things that pop up when they look at suicide

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,060
 Not gonna talk about that. It's too depressing. So as I'm going down this rabbit hole though

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,800
 I found out about a thing and it's pretty commonly known called suicide contagion and that is where

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,560
 when

19
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,280
 somebody who is famous or

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,320
 In a particular peer group kills themselves. We see it spread

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
 I've told people before I've talked to

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,360
 People who are kind of like at the end of their rope and they're like I got I'm gonna end it man

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,240
 I'm gonna do it and I always tell them this I have a couple different tools

24
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,000
 for talking people out of suicide and

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,100
 Who knows how effective well, I know it's been effective for me because they haven't killed themselves, but

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,840
 One of the things I've talked to people and I said

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,440
 It's a contagious disease

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,800
 When we look at families when somebody in the family kills themselves, it's usually not isolated daughter kills herself

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,960
 Uncle kills themselves

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,240
 Brother kills himself brother kills himself, you know, it's so like that. It's a contagious disease

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,080
 That came the reason why I discovered that is because of stuff like suicide contagion. There's a town

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,320
 I think it's in Scotland or Ireland called Bridgend

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,880
 And there was a documentary made about this town and they had this cluster suicide clustering at all the young people or a

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,960
 Bunch of young people in town killing themselves as the documentary is being made one of the guys being interviewed for the documentary kills

35
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,520
 Himself now it doesn't do it during the interview the guys not like hey

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,960
 So tell us a little bit about your friends and he's like yeah sure

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,640
 Let me get this chair set up first and the guys just filming it

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,480
 But through the creation of the documentary that guy killed himself now

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,120
 There's been debate about that documentary some people say that it's sensationalized and so on and so forth

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,520
 But you do have these things suicide clusters suicide contagion and as I'm reading about this stuff

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,180
 And again, it's fairly depressing as I'm reading about this stuff

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:15,180
 I came across the story and it's actually suicide contagion has another name. It's called the Werther effect

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,340
 Thought this was fascinating stuff fascinating. Let me tell you this story now. I haven't read this book

44
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,540
 I'm sure a lot of you have

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,260
 Let's go back in time to the year 1774

46
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,860
 I tricked you there. You thought I was gonna say 1777. I was just looking at my notes wrong

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,780
 1774 let's hop in the carboner copter

48
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,780
 did it

49
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,900
 And now we're back. It's provincial

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,540
 Germany I believe so a bunch of little thatched huts with

51
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,700
 Bell is what was her name Bell not Bella right Bell from Beauty and the Beast is walking around and

52
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:58,900
 You know, she would have been okay if she'd ended up with Gaston she really would that I think they would have made it work out

53
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,760
 I know a lot of bells who ended up with Gaston's in real life

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,760
 It works out. He was a cad but he didn't deserve to die like he didn't go that extra level

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,960
 He wasn't trying to really hurt anybody. He was trying to bed this beautiful woman

56
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,860
 He would have been better off at those blondes anyways

57
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:23,100
 But he wanted to marry this beautiful woman and then he found out that a monster kept her prisoner

58
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:30,300
 Which was really going on and he gets the townspeople to rescue her which she really was a prisoner

59
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,180
 He didn't know she had fallen in love with this monster and he falls to his death

60
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,980
 I think he's probably one of the most tragic Disney villains

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,340
 He said he is a cad but he it wasn't like he was like broken her house one night

62
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,860
 It was like trying to rape her and then she ran and got kidnapped by the beast or nothing like that

63
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,340
 He was just an idiot who wanted the best chicken town. I eat me

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,900
 So I have a lot of sympathy for Gaston

65
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,100
 they might have ret condom in the live-action movie where they made him more evil, but I didn't watch that garbage and as

66
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,380
 And you're just looking at me as I'm seeing about beating the beast as I'm trying to navigate trying to land this helicopter in this

67
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,540
 German village you're like dude

68
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,600
 You just landed on all those sheep and I was like add another thing that little dude who was sitting here like

69
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:20,020
 You jump out of the helicopter before we've even landed it's 1774 and there's a young German author named Johan

70
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,980
 Wolfgang von Goethh

71
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,180
 Goethh I think is how you pronounce it. It's spelt go the but I'm pretty sure it's not go the we'll call him goat

72
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,420
 And this dude goat is writing this book

73
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,460
 That's what it sounded like back then when you wrote

74
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:41,580
 It sound like ants marching it's not like Dave Matthews band song

75
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,980
 Don't don't don't that song was playing every time you wrote something. That's why there's not a lot of literature from back then

76
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:55,900
 It's not true. There's a ton of it. So anyways, he's writing this book. Goethh is writing this book the sorrows of young Werther

77
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,340
 So here's a story dude

78
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,780
 There's this dude named Werther, right? He's like Werther's original. That's where they got that name from that delicious

79
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,620
 Hard caramel. Let's put one in our mouth for the rest of this adventure

80
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,780
 Delicious hard caramel is named after this lovable young scamp

81
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,340
 Werther so he's chilling in this town in

82
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,100
 Germany right and he meets this

83
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,460
 Beautiful woman named Charlotte and he's like, oh dude. He's like hey, Char. What's up?

84
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,980
 And she's like, oh, what's your name? And he's like I'm Werther here have a caramel candy

85
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,300
 So she bites down on it breaks a bunch of her teeth and he's like no you're supposed to suck it

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,120
 So he gives her another one anyway, so he's hanging out with Charlotte now

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,620
 Charlotte is about to be married to this older man named Albert and Werther's totally in love with this chick though, right?

88
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,060
 And Albert's just kind of like hey Werther, what's up? They all start hanging out together

89
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,740
 So he actually moves in with them so Werther is chilling there and then you have Charlotte the love of his life

90
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,380
 the only woman he's ever wanted to be with and then Albert is just kind of walking around and

91
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,220
 You know living there too. He didn't just walk by the house. He's like hey, that's my house

92
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,700
 And I'm just walking by so anyways

93
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,780
 He's totally like just like oh my god like this

94
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,700
 Their torment in my heart is killing me. I'm in love with this woman

95
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,860
 She's with this other guy and it there's gonna get married, but maybe I can woo her

96
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,180
 Maybe something will work out here. Maybe somehow against all odds

97
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,580
 We can do this and then he's like no I can't I have to leave like yeah

98
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,060
 We're really good friends, but I gotta leave so he bounces out and for a couple months

99
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,620
 He goes to this other town now

100
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,140
 I'm reading all of this from Wikipedia because I'm going down this suicide rabbit hole

101
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,620
 So so I could be totally off of major details

102
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,180
 You could be like no way Albert was a bricklayer and that was symbolic of him like putting bricks on stuff

103
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,500
 Yeah, yeah, maybe I'm just reading the Wikipedia thing

104
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,180
 So anyways here is a I don't understand this this makes me think it's a different novel an awesome novel

105
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,700
 This is he goes to the other town and there's this sentence in Wikipedia

106
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,420
 He goes to this other town. Okay, he quote

107
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,140
 He suffers great embarrassment when he forgetfully visits a friend and

108
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,660
 Unexpectedly has to face there the weekly gathering of the entire aristocratic set

109
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,860
 He's not tolerated and asked to leave since he is not a nobleman

110
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:25,060
 Which makes me think that all of a sudden he became a Rodney Dangerfield story where he's like yo I get no respect

111
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,900
 The woman I love is with someone else

112
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,580
 I'm like nothing over there and it's a bunch of people with their little like

113
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,180
 Wine glasses going what I never he's not an aristocrat like he basically shows it

114
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,740
 But his buddy's house with a six-pack. He's like yo Ralph let me in it's worther and he goes in and it's

115
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,940
 Basically Wayne Manor during a ball where everyone's dressed up in their suits not their Batman suits dressed up in their suits and ties

116
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:56,380
 There's violin music playing. He's like whoa. What kind of party is this yo Ralph things have gotten real snazzy for you

117
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,020
 And they're like you're not an aristocrat please leave and he's like what I get no respect

118
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,220
 I get no respect have my audience is like who the hell is Rodney Dangerfield and why doesn't he get respect?

119
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,340
 And no one knows the answer to that question, but

120
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,940
 Apparently so he goes to his buddy's house to chill and there's a huge party going on and they kick him out

121
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
 So now he has no choice

122
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,500
 But to go back to Charlotte and Albert when he gets back there when he goes back to Charlotte'sville

123
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:29,900
 He finds out that they're already married and he's like are you kidding me? I truly do get no respect and

124
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,700
 He can't live with the fact that he can't be with Charlotte

125
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,100
 So he decides listen one of three things has to happen either he dies

126
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,980
 She dies or I die and he goes well. I never want to hurt anybody else

127
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,540
 So I'm gonna kill myself so he asks Albert. Hey, do you got two pistols I can borrow?

128
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,340
 I'm gonna go on a quote an adventure and Albert goes. That's weird

129
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:01,100
 Why did you say quote an adventure and he's like well, that's just what Wikipedia said I'm going on an adventure Albert

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,720
 He goes fine. Yeah, sure. I don't know why you would need two pistols, but here you go Albert goes

131
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,400
 Thank you, and he goes back to his house. Where was he living? Where did maybe he was doing this outside?

132
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,460
 Anyways, the point is he goes somewhere away from him. He's not standing in front of him going like how you like me now like

133
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,660
 He goes somewhere else and the story is written as like a collection of letters

134
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,600
 It's posted like supposedly a true story and in some ways it is anyways

135
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,840
 he goes and he pulls out a pistol and he blows his brains out and

136
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,920
 He doesn't die. He basically just bleeds there for a while just sits there bleeding and the book

137
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 Let you know that it takes 12 hours for him to die. So it's not even just like it's this instant death

138
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,100
 He's all uh as he's bleeding out dies

139
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,180
 The book also wants you to know that at his funeral there was no clergyman and

140
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,580
 Charlotte and Albert didn't even show up to the funeral. So totally died alone. That is the story of

141
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,620
 Werther so that story

142
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,380
 Was the story that made goath super famous like he became an overnight celebrity

143
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,180
 It would be like one day you were walking down the street and the next day you were on

144
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,420
 Jersey Shore level famous. He was the situation of the 1770s and

145
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,700
 The book what?

146
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,900
 I've been in that situation

147
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,500
 multiple times in my life where I like me to chick and she's with the dude and

148
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:38,020
 They're married and I'm like, yo dude. We'll hang out and then I've been there to be pining over a girl in a relationship

149
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,860
 And I've lived with them like it's totally real

150
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,100
 I've done this stuff and I've gone to parties and gotten kicked out of parties

151
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,780
 obviously, I didn't blow my brains away, but

152
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:54,220
 I've been there and so I'm reading this and I'm like dude. This is super relatable super relatable to me

153
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,900
 I think I've done this twice honestly

154
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,780
 I think I've been in love with a girl moved in with her and she was married or had a boyfriend at the time both

155
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,860
 But both times I was like, ah, this ain't working out and bounced

156
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,020
 But I totally relate to this character and this is one of the things that's fascinating

157
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,780
 Everyone else related to this character too. Every show often a book will come along that people really or a movie or song

158
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,780
 It's usually a book or a movie but

159
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,940
 They take off because people can absolutely 100% relate to that character and this guy became so relatable that

160
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,860
 supposedly

161
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,100
 Young men all over Europe were reading this book and going

162
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,340
 You got two guns and they dressed up like he became super fashionable to dress up as Werther

163
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,900
 He's very emo character. He's very like tortured character

164
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,980
 but people begin dressing like Werther and

165
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,300
 Shooting themselves in the head and some people have said no no no that didn't happen or it didn't happen on the scale people think it did

166
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,660
 It's a poker full. It's a rumor, but we do know the book was incredibly famous and

167
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:08,300
 Historians and researchers say there was a spate of suicides of young men found

168
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,540
 Dressed in the type of clothes or dressed in his style shooting themselves in the head

169
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:19,920
 They said some people even went so far to get the same pistol that's described in the book to do the deed

170
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,860
 Fascinating fascinating stuff and obviously goat wasn't like

171
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,340
 Step one write a book about a young man killing himself step two

172
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,340
 Everyone kills himself like that wasn't his plan

173
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,100
 It wasn't his plan at all

174
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:42,020
 But he wrote the book and it was based on his true story like his elements of it were that he obviously didn't kill himself either

175
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,300
 But the emotional stuff and his time went on he distanced himself from the story

176
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,540
 It was basically like again his first big novel

177
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,100
 It's one of those things that you're a band you release a hit song you you really your

178
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,660
 Destiny's Child and you release bootylicious and then 30 years later people are yelling at Beyonce. Hey, do bootylicious do

179
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,460
 But yeah, I don't want to do that. That was basically his bootylicious

180
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,980
 It made him famous, but he distanced himself for it. However thought this was an interesting little note, too

181
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,460
 However, even though he distanced himself from this book that cost a bunch of people to kill themselves

182
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,940
 He wouldn't let anyone else

183
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,980
 Do anything to the book. I didn't know how this segue that there was this dude because the book was super popular

184
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:31,420
 There was this other author named Frederick Nicolai and he wrote a satire of the book called the joys of young werther

185
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,660
 And in the he changed the ending so basically the book's totally different and then he changed the ending where when he asks

186
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
 Albert for the guns

187
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,580
 Albert instead of putting bullets in the gun puts chicken blood in the gun

188
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,180
 So when

189
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,300
 Werther goes to shoot him

190
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,740
 So it's funny because it's can't be that much of a different from the plot if it still ends with him trying to kill himself

191
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:58,060
 But he grabs the gun pulls a trigger just a bunch of chicken blood shoots out which is that's

192
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,580
 Incredibly traumatizing because he still goes through the whole mental process of deciding into his life

193
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,740
 And then it's like what want he's just like covered in blood. He's like what?

194
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,500
 That show that showed me no more depression for me

195
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,620
 And then Albert gives charlotte to werther. It was a satire

196
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,420
 And that made goath this was

197
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,060
 Like from what I understand. This is like two decades after the original version came out

198
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,940
 Goath had already distanced himself from his novel

199
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,580
 Furious that someone would write the again. It was his life story in a way. It was his emotional journey

200
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,460
 Furious that someone would write this so then goath writes a poem

201
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,620
 Called nicolai on werther's grave so gets meta here. He writes a poem

202
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,140
 That we're back in the werther verse we're back in the universe where werther actually killed himself

203
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,620
 And his grave is underneath like a lime tree or a pine tree or something

204
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,380
 What was it again?

205
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,900
 Yeah, it was a lime tree. It was underneath a lime tree. Oh napoleon bonaparte loved this book so much. He carried it with him

206
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,940
 That's it. That was not just factoid. Anyways, so he wrote this poem about werther's grave

207
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,020
 Is sitting there

208
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:17,500
 Obviously they'll move around their graves aren't known to be quite mobile and nicolai walks up to the grave

209
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,260
 This is a poem by the way. Nicolai walks up to the grave looks at it

210
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,700
 Pulls his pants down and takes a steaming fat dump

211
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,180
 on werther's grave

212
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,820
 And that's basically the poem and they became rivals until they died

213
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:39,660
 Goath and nicolai began just constantly like hate writing people suicide contagion aka the werther effect based on the book

214
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,580
 That inspired

215
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,180
 Men to kill themselves and I can almost guarantee you sadly enough that this book probably still does that

216
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,100
 I think it's probably harder to get a flintlock pistol and a big old floppy hat

217
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,380
 But i'm sure the book is so relatable stories relatable that people are still reading it and going

218
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,860
 Well, if it works for him it'll work for me. Yeah, bizarre stuff

219
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,380
 But let's go ahead and we're leaving behind the story of werther

220
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,020
 The sorrow of werther. Ugh

221
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,300
 What a relatable story. Anyways leaving it behind

222
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,780
 You're like jason

223
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,500
 Are you over it and I was like, yes. Yes. I am over it. You don't have to have a place I can live for a while, right?

224
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,900
 How's your wife doing here? Like, ah, you're never staying at my house now that I know that you have designs on men's wives

225
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,980
 When you live with them like what no, I don't

226
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,900
 That wasn't what I was saying as my eyes shift from side to side

227
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,460
 I've never figured it. My mom thinks that I have a like mental disorder

228
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,900
 She goes you always fall in love with women you can't have you're constantly falling in love with married women all the time

229
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,140
 And I go that's not true

230
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,500
 So I pull a pistol out of my okay, that was dark. I was sorry. Okay. She's like, where'd you get those two flintlock pistols?

231
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 I'm like, I'm going on an adventure. Okay, that's okay. Anyways, so

232
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:02,060
 Uh, good old jokes about committing suicide and falling in love with the wrong women. Let's forget all that stuff

233
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:07,340
 We are going to june. No, we're not. We're going to chula vista, california

234
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,860
 It's june 19th 1991. You know, I'm not a big

235
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,820
 Big person who believes in a lot of like numbers new

236
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,220
 Merology and changing these codes up and stuff

237
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,900
 I've talked about it. But this did strike me as odd chula vista, california. That part's not odd

238
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,980
 That's just the city in california

239
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,980
 june 19th

240
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,220
 1991

241
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,220
 at 9 p.m. And

242
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,660
 June is the six month if you turn it upside down you can an upside down six

243
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,620
 Or there are that joke aside. There are a lot of nines involved in this

244
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:47,500
 There's a lot actually very very weird. What I'm even seeing more. Okay. I got to start doing this chula vista, california

245
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,820
 It's 9 p.m. June 19th 1999. There's a young girl in the house. Her name is laura arroyo

246
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,020
 She's nine. She's nine years old. This is true story by the way. It's true story

247
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:05,260
 She's upstairs reading a book with her mom and there's knock at the door knock knock knock and she jumps out of bed

248
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,740
 And she goes all get it all get it and she runs downstairs now the mom is thinking it's kind of late

249
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,740
 But this chula vista area they were in kind of a nice neighborhood and friends would always kind of like come over and be like

250
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,340
 Hey, she doesn't really think too much of it. And then as she hears laura running down the hallway

251
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
 She hears laura say who is it?

252
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,740
 And then the door open

253
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:31,820
 And then she doesn't hear anything and the mom goes. Oh must have been one of her friends talking about homework or something like that

254
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,580
 But after about 10 minutes she goes

255
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,620
 Uh-oh like where's my daughter at?

256
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,340
 Like if it was a casual conversation

257
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
 They would have come in

258
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,180
 Where's she at? So mom jumps out of bed and laura is gone

259
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,900
 from her front door

260
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,140
 Obviously police are called very shortly fathers looking for her

261
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,900
 Moms looking for her neighbors are all looking for this girl

262
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,420
 She's disappeared at 6 30 a.m. The next morning

263
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,380
 Four miles away her body is found at a business park

264
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,100
 And she's been murdered

265
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,500
 and there are

266
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,260
 Uh

267
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,780
 There there was signs of sexual assault

268
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:27,020
 So obviously just the disappearance had the police working high gear now. They're absolutely freaking out about this whole thing

269
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,180
 and

270
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
 They can't find who did it

271
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:37,580
 They are looking all over for the murderer of a nine-year-old and the salter of a nine-year-old girl

272
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,620
 This is an interesting case. There's a paranormal angle. I'm just going to talk about this horrible crime

273
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,100
 It's an interesting case because you can find it's very well publicized. You can find a ton of articles

274
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,180
 detailing everything

275
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,220
 A couple weeks after the murder we're in the month of july now

276
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,300
 There in town was a billboard

277
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,060
 That was no advertisement was put up on it was a blank billboard

278
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,820
 It was in between someone saying hey, I want to put my advertisement on there

279
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,420
 So it would stand there on the street corner just white with the lights shining up on it

280
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,980
 That's the sound the lights at night in chula vista

281
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,980
 And one day someone's driving down the road and they're looking at the billboard and they go

282
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,540
 What?

283
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
 They're kind of squinting

284
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,940
 They're like, uh, that looks weird

285
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,380
 Someone else driving down that same road at night's looking and they're like what the hell is that?

286
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,700
 Now

287
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,300
 missing girl

288
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:40,460
 Young little nine-year-old girl her photo was plastered everywhere. Everybody knew what this girl looked like in town

289
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,940
 Horrible horrible story. So people who had never met laura while she was alive knew what she looked like

290
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,420
 So when people were driving down this road in chula vista and they're looking at this billboard

291
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,780
 They see the light and the shadow

292
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,140
 Make the image of laura's face

293
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:06,300
 The billboard was two miles between the house and the murder scene. So it was like right in the middle

294
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,860
 And word gets out in town now. This is again before social media

295
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,940
 You actually had to walk up to someone and go hey, buddy. Have you seen that billboard or you would pick up the phone and be like, yo

296
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 What are you doing tonight? Let's go see the billboard

297
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,620
 So it wasn't like someone could tweet something and then a bunch of people showed up

298
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,580
 But a bunch of people did show up at one point

299
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,220
 They were recording crowds of like

300
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,180
 25,000 people which is mind-boggling to me. I don't know how big chula vista is

301
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,940
 But people huge traffic jams cops have to come out

302
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,500
 And direct traffic because people were driving by this billboard and that's one thing

303
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,380
 We have a bunch of articles on this if this story happened today

304
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,860
 We'd have video footage and and photos and everything like that

305
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,300
 We don't have any of that at least in none of its posts that this was way before the internet was even really a thing

306
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,100
 So the father of the girl luise arroyo says i gotta check this out

307
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,460
 And he goes and he goes oh my god, that's my daughter

308
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,340
 That's my daughter on that billboard

309
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,100
 He took her brothers. He had she had like i think like a 12 year old brother and a 10 year old brother

310
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,740
 They went there and the brothers were like

311
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,940
 Laura Laura and they started crying. It's a tragic story tragic story, but

312
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:24,940
 So the general consensus was this was Laura's image on the board and you're like light and shadow people are imagining things

313
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,260
 The police are looking at it and they go can you take some photos of that? So they had other cops

314
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,060
 photographing

315
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,020
 Taking it as evidence

316
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,740
 And there was a quote from detective wane maxi. He goes it's one of those things where we don't know where it could lead us

317
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,180
 And they were they asked the billboard people

318
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,660
 They said do you have another person ready to put up a sign there and the billboard company says yeah

319
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,860
 We actually do have someone we were just in between putting up advertisements and the police said listen

320
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,460
 Could you do us a favor

321
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,500
 This we don't know if this is a ghost face or anything like that

322
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,300
 It's funny because cops tend to be kind of superstitious

323
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,500
 But this officer wasn't saying we think there's a ghost here and we're trying to contact her this officer said

324
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,260
 Listen

325
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,220
 We think this might help lure out the killer

326
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,780
 Because if he believes there's some sort of supernatural force going on or something like that, can you not put up a new advertisement?

327
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,780
 And he goes yeah, yeah, we'll give it some time. Maybe this will help catch the killer

328
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,460
 So it wasn't so much like they thought a giant Laura hand a ghostly hand's going to reach out and grab him like the state puff

329
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,700
 Marshall oh man, it was just that maybe the guy in the area would just be so overwrought by guilt

330
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,820
 But at some point this the image didn't go away

331
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,700
 At some point the traffic jams are so much

332
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,420
 Some I think that city disconnected the power to the sign

333
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,940
 And then the people in town got up there and reconnected the power now

334
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,100
 There was also stories that you could see the image of the killer in the background

335
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,500
 Now I heard that out of my national directory of haunted places book

336
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,940
 I wasn't able to find any verification any news articles saying and some people said you could see the killer

337
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,020
 So I'm not for sure about that detail. But anyways

338
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,100
 Eventually though enough time passes

339
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,900
 Traffic dies down

340
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,500
 Company throws up another billboard the image is no longer seen

341
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,460
 It wasn't until

342
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,580
 2005

343
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,580
 When the cops break down a door and this is what 14 years later

344
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,780
 Put your hands on your head put your hands on your head. Oh guys wrestling

345
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,540
 Smash hopefully smashed his head into the floorboard

346
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,260
 Manuel brocca montes 42 year old man

347
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:45,500
 So he would have been in his what what's 14 minus 4 42 would have been 28 something

348
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,860
 I think it would have been 28 when this happened used to live in the area

349
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,260
 Moved out a week before the crime

350
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,220
 Had access to a tool that they believe was used in the murder

351
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,300
 And they caught him because of the dna he left at the crime scene

352
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,780
 He ends up getting sentenced to death

353
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:09,180
 He ends up getting sentenced to death and it's interesting because when you look at the early articles it said there's no sexual assault

354
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,300
 This child was not sexually assaulted. She was just chopped up with this weird looking tool

355
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,900
 That he used at his construction company or something. It wasn't like a normal weapon that you would see

356
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
 So that kind of helped him kind of narrow it down

357
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,820
 But it was the dna that finally got him and it was one of those things that it was a cold case

358
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,460
 And they're like just run the dna again and then like six seven years would pass and they're like just run it again

359
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:36,060
 Can you run it one more time and they're like, yeah, you'll run it as much as we want this guy murdered a kid

360
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,140
 Let's do it and they finally caught him. But he gets guilty

361
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,020
 sentence to death

362
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,140
 And that's where we're at now the last real article I saw him

363
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,540
 This was 2005 so i'm assuming that he was appealing his death sentence or something like that

364
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,460
 I think it's an interesting story because we have that convergence

365
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,620
 We have there we're at that intersection of paranormal and true crime

366
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,380
 Which when I started the show I said that's going to be a common theme

367
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,980
 And it pops up every now and then every now and then so it's always interesting when it does

368
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,940
 but the idea of

369
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,780
 the billboard

370
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,420
 And the little girl looking out from the shadows and the light out at the street below her

371
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,860
 The father said, you know, I worked on the street

372
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:27,580
 That the billboard was like looking down and I figured that was a way for my daughter to watch over me and to send me a message

373
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,820
 But I don't know what she's trying to tell me

374
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,740
 Damn, that's horrible. I mean I get that's awesome that he finds that uplifting thing but

375
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,260
 Imagine it's one thing to lose your child

376
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:46,540
 But then imagine if you saw your child frozen in time if you truly believe that was her frozen in time her image looking at you

377
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,100
 giant looming

378
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
 Over the night sky scape

379
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:57,740
 Of chula vista and you just being this father looking up at this image of your daughter and thinking what are you trying to tell me

380
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:04,220
 And then have it go another 14 years before you finally have any piece

381
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,420
 About what happened to her

382
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,660
 And then let's say that it was some ghostly apparition up there

383
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,500
 I think the creepiest part is

384
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,980
 There's a chance that it was

385
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,740
 And there was that brief moment in time where there was no billboard up there

386
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,140
 And people were driving by and they happened to recognize the way that it looked as laura

387
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,020
 but what if

388
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,180
 There was a billboard there

389
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,940
 What if there was a eat a Kentucky fried chicken colonel sanders taking a big old bite

390
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,660
 And yet somehow the soul of this young girl her ghostly image was still impressed on that

391
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,740
 Thing and people just continued to drive by

392
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,620
 Drive by this billboard and you have the soul of this young girl looking out trying to send her father a message

393
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,140
 But it's simply being ignored

394
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,700
 I find that infinitely more creepy

395
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:12,700
 How many messages could be out there people who are lost people who are dead

396
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:21,820
 That they're trying to send to their loved ones, but we just don't see because of all of the information overload all around us

397
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,540
 Is it possible someone's trying to reach out to you right now?

398
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,060
 You just don't notice it

399
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,380
 You just drive by that sign as a ghostly presence is trying to send you a message

400
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,300
 From the other side
