1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 I just flew in from Sacramento and boy are my arms tired.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,120
 Today is going to be a bit of a different episode.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
 Because I'm exhausted, I'm tired and I have no prep work done.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,240
 Instead we're going to look at a couple of conspiracy theories that I kind of believe.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,200
 I'm not married to any of them, but these are things that may be true.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 We're going to look at these and more on the hot take episode of Dead Rabbit Radio starting now.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:41,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,720
 I'm flat out exhausted.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,000
 I just flew back in from Sacramento.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,480
 My vacation is over and I'm back at home with my regular microphone.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,800
 I'm doing a regular setup and I was like, you know what?

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 I'm going to do something different.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 I'm going to do something different.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 We're just going to do a hot take episode.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 I don't want to actually really even know what that term means.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,920
 I just see it on the internet.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,520
 I see cool kids using it and I want to be cool too.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,680
 We're going to go over a couple of my personal conspiracies.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,160
 Some of them I actually do believe in and some of them I think may be possible.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
 But we'll get into it.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
 We'll get into it here.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
 But I did have a great vacation.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,760
 I'm going to get back to responding to all YouTube comments and stuff like that.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,160
 Guys have been great while I know the schedule was kind of wonky the past couple weeks, but

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,920
 I appreciate that you guys are sticking around.

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,320
 But let's go ahead and get started here.

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,920
 Now, I don't talk about politics on this show.

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,080
 It's one of the rules of Dead Rapper Radio.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,200
 No politics and never ever fall in love.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,280
 Two main rules of Dead Rapper Radio.

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,880
 But if you don't want to hear anything about politics, skip ahead maybe 10 minutes.

35
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,720
 But before you do, let me tell you my first...

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
 Before you jump ahead, you're like, "Great, he's going to talk about income and quality."

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,000
 Before I get into...

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,320
 Before you jump ahead, give me a second.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,800
 Conspiracy theory number one.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,880
 Marianne Williamson is a witch.

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,960
 Now, yeah, see, I got your attention.

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,200
 Now this one...

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,800
 So I know I've done a couple episodes about how I'm not a huge fan of Wiccans.

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
 I think it's...

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
 Okay, that's not being fair.

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,560
 That's kind of watering it down.

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,920
 The episode I did was, "Why are Wiccans always fat?"

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
 What's the episode?

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
 I'm not...

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,200
 I can't pussyfoot around the actual episode.

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,800
 Hey, welcome new listeners, by the way.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,600
 Welcome new listeners to the show, Dead Rapper Radio.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,400
 So anyways, but so obviously Marianne Williamson is fairly attractive, thin woman.

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,000
 So you're like, "Jason, if you went on and on for half hour about why is it that there's

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,960
 a combination or a correlation between overweight people and the Wiccan religion, but here Marianne

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,360
 Williamson is 120, I'm assuming.

57
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
 I don't know.

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
 I'm not her stalker.

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
 I'm all looking through her bushes at her scale.

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
 I think she's a witch.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,800
 And so this is the reason why.

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,360
 Well I don't actually have any proof, but one, she does talk a lot about like mysticism

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,400
 and magical powers and she talks a lot about like mysticism and like positive thinking,

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,200
 which you know I'm fine with, definitely I'm a fan of positive thinking.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,880
 She talks about Trump bringing a quote, "dark psychic force" into the world and it's almost

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,840
 to her it's not a battle of policies, it's a battle of like energies.

67
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
 You know, like Jason, that doesn't make you a witch, huh?

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
 Hold on, hold on.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:42,760
 I also have a like, when you deal with, I've met like witches in real life, not Wiccans,

70
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,280
 but like witches, and when you meet people you start to think about it this way.

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,640
 How many times do you have to get mugged before you're able to pretty, before you're

72
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,600
 pretty good at spotting a mugger from like a hundred yards away?

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,640
 You're walking on the street, well you get the example, so I think that is where I'm

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 coming from.

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,800
 I've dealt with real witches in the past, so when I see someone I go, that's a witch,

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,560
 like burn her, no, no, I'm not saying burn her, I'm not saying that at all, but you know

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,960
 what I mean, like you see, you pick up on it, you go, that's a witch, that's totally

78
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,040
 a witch, and she gives off that witch energy, and I'm not even using that as a pejorative,

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,840
 I'm just saying that I think she casts, I think she's capable of casting spells.

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,040
 And not Wiccan, which is different, I think she might be an actual witch.

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,800
 I also think she probably, here's the thing, people always go, who am I voting for?

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,920
 I go, who's the funniest candidate?

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 Who's the candidate that if they won would provide me with the most laughs?

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:53,480
 So, I mean, dude, I would love to have a president who believed that crystals healed people.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 That would be hilarious.

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,320
 I probably wouldn't be so good for healthcare in the nation, but wouldn't it be awesome

87
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,800
 to have a president who's like, like praying to the moon?

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,680
 So yeah, I think she's a witch, I don't have any proof of it, I think as the campaign

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,520
 goes on, I think she's going to be one of the long holdouts of the Democratic Party,

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,480
 because I think her passion is so into it, and she has magical powers that she can hang

91
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
 on longer.

92
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,800
 I predict she'll be in the top six.

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,120
 Like when it narrows down to six people, maybe seven people she'll be in there.

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
 So Marianne Williamson is a witch.

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,240
 I guess I should explain for people who don't know, Marianne Williamson is a Democratic nominee

96
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
 for president.

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,360
 I probably should have said that seven minutes ago.

98
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
 Marianne Williamson is a witch.

99
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,560
 That's conspiracy theory number one.

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,000
 So yes, yes, that is about as political as we get on Dead Rabbit Radio.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
 Marianne Williamson is a witch, has witch powers.

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,720
 I'm sure she's also probably the only presidential candidate that's ever used a yawning egg.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,200
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to my next hot take conspiracy.

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 Bear with me here.

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
 Here's one.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 Here's one.

107
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,080
 This one I think is fairly true, and I think a lot of people agree with the base of it,

108
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,320
 but I'm pushing it a little bit farther.

109
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:13,600
 Fast food restaurants, their food is designed to make you fat.

110
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,680
 And I think people go, well, of course, you know, like they have all these ingredients

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,600
 that, you know, they're big fat burgers, big max.

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
 I'm taking it a step further than that.

113
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,760
 I think fast food restaurants in particular use a model basically patterned after drug

114
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,120
 dealers.

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
 Because here's the thing.

116
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,800
 Before subway, before subway existed, did you ever think, you know what I really need

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
 right now?

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,280
 A foot of bread in meat in meat.

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,560
 Like before subway existed, you went to, unless you specifically went to a sub shop, you would

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,120
 order a sandwich or you would make a sandwich at home.

121
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,480
 Maybe you'd have a hoagie if you were feeling particularly ethnic that day.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,960
 But subway, and I know the conspiracy theory, and maybe you don't know the conspiracy theory,

123
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,040
 but foot long subs are not actually a foot long.

124
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
 They're like 11 inches.

125
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,120
 And I remember there was a big controversy about it years ago, and I'm like, who cares?

126
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,560
 Like that's probably one of the dumbest things to get riled up about, that you're getting

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,360
 one inch less of food.

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
 Anyways.

129
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
 Anyways.

130
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,040
 I think that fast food restaurants use the same model basically that drug dealers use.

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,280
 You get them hooked on the supply, and you get them hooked on the supply by making the

132
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
 portions not just full of fat and sugars, but bigger.

133
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,640
 Because then what happens is you go to, you know if you go to McDonald's you're going

134
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:42,920
 to get not as good tasting food, but it's going to satisfy you on a primal level more

135
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,600
 than going to a sit down restaurant.

136
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,040
 Like you can go to McDonald's, and for the same amount of money that you can go to a

137
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,000
 sit down restaurant, you can pretty much buy a double the food, or one and a half times

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
 the food.

139
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,040
 And you eat it, and it releases all these endorphins because it's full of sugars and

140
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
 fats.

141
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,960
 It's designed to basically make you addicted to it.

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
 And the portions are larger.

143
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,640
 You can, let's say you go to a restaurant and you order a bourbon fries.

144
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,720
 You really don't give you a lot of fries.

145
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,040
 You get a burger, you get a nice juicy delicious burger, Trillium, Great Burgers here on Hood

146
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,760
 River, but you never get a lot of fries.

147
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,560
 When you go to McDonald's or Burger King or something, you can basically get as many

148
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,880
 fries as you want.

149
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,520
 Ah, I want a large fry, I want a super sized fry, whatever.

150
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
 Same thing.

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
 Subway Domino's.

152
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,720
 I was looking at ordering Domino's when I got home.

153
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,800
 They have that package where it's a p- like you can basically get any two items for $5.99

154
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
 each.

155
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,640
 So you can order like two pizzas for $5.99 each.

156
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,880
 The thing, or like two sandwiches or a sandwich and a pizza or whatever, the thing is you

157
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,320
 have to order two.

158
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,800
 And I'll argue that Domino's knows that most of the people who ordered Domino's live

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,840
 by themselves.

160
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,520
 So basically you're saying, "Eat two pizzas."

161
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,400
 You individual person who just flew in from Sacramento, you can't order less than two

162
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
 pizzas.

163
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 We're not going to allow that.

164
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,040
 If you want to, well, you can still allow it.

165
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
 You just have to pay more.

166
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
 But if you want this deal, you have to order two pizzas.

167
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,720
 And I think the logic is, the logic that I'm assigning them is if they order two pizzas,

168
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
 they'll eat two pizzas.

169
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,320
 And then, then nothing less than two pizzas will satisfy them.

170
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,120
 It's basically the same thing as drugs.

171
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,280
 Okay, I'm realizing that I may not be communicating that logic as much as I, but I think that fast

172
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,000
 food restaurants use the same business model as drug dealers.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,280
 They're everywhere.

174
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,840
 Their food is made to be addictive.

175
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,640
 And they give you such outrageous portions that when you think about going somewhere

176
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,480
 else, I realize that maybe I'm, this might just be a Jason thing, because I think most

177
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,040
 people if they want like a delicious, I don't cook myself.

178
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,640
 I hope nobody cooks themselves, but I don't cook for myself that often.

179
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,640
 Anyways, I guess that kind of, okay, people are like, no, Jason, you're just fat and

180
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
 you need to go back on keto.

181
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,520
 And I do need to go back on keto.

182
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,240
 Okay, onto the, do you guys, I don't like, you guys get that right?

183
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,040
 Fast food restaurants are designed to basically be like drug dealers.

184
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,160
 Get you addicted to their food.

185
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,480
 Get you coming back, all their special sauce and all that stuff.

186
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
 Think it's suspicious.

187
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,040
 Okay, okay, so remaining listeners, thank you.

188
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
 Thank you for sticking around with this.

189
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,800
 Here, we're moving on to our next one.

190
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,600
 I think Beyonce is a scam.

191
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,240
 I think Beyonce is not, I think she's a real person.

192
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
 I'm not saying she's a hologram.

193
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,200
 I'm not going to go so far to say that she's some sort of tax write-off, but I don't think

194
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,320
 she is as big as people say she is.

195
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,640
 I think she is propped up by a huge marketing machine and a record label and her albums

196
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
 aren't as big as they actually are.

197
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,720
 You go, Jason, that's easy to prove or disprove because you can look at album sales numbers.

198
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
 But here's the thing.

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,680
 We see the same thing with movie tickets to a certain point, but with book, specifically

200
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,160
 this happens a lot with book publishers.

201
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,840
 A book will come out and a book publisher will buy back tons of their own books so they

202
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,760
 can boost their sales up.

203
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,040
 What they do is they're basically pre-orders or gifts and stuff like that.

204
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
 YouTube had an album that they gave away with either a newspaper or an iPod or something

205
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,520
 like that.

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
 That counted towards it.

207
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,200
 Nowadays, when you buy a ticket to a tour, I know Madonna did this to a tour ago, you

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
 buy a ticket for her tour, you got a free copy of her album.

209
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,240
 That counted as an album sale.

210
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,160
 There's a lot of ways to artificially boost your sales.

211
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,600
 And I think Beyonce, I think that's all she does basically.

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,920
 There was a huge scandal a couple of years ago.

213
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,200
 Jay-Z bought Tidal, which was a music streaming site out of Sweden or Norway.

214
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,440
 And it turns out that Kanye West came out with his new album, The Life of Pablo, and

215
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,560
 Beyonce came out with her new album, I think it was called Lemonade or something like that.

216
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,320
 And they showed that her album had been streamed 320 million times.

217
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,600
 And Kanye West's album had been streamed like 300 million times.

218
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,920
 And someone started digging through the numbers and they looked and they said, "Everyone who's

219
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,280
 subscribed to Tidal would have to listen to Beyonce's album for eight days straight to

220
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,040
 get to 300 million downloads in the period of time that it was."

221
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,640
 When they looked at the numbers, they actually only got 170 million downloads.

222
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,520
 Beyonce's album only got 170 million downloads.

223
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,880
 Kanye West's album only got 150 million downloads.

224
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,520
 So they were doubled and they showed how all the numbers were rigged and basically there

225
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,200
 was duplicate plays going on.

226
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,120
 Someone would listen to the album and then behind the scenes it would play again.

227
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,520
 So Kanye West and Beyonce got huge payouts from Tidal when actually their albums were

228
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,680
 only heard half as many times.

229
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:11,520
 I think that she isn't the huge selling superstar that people make her out to be.

230
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,240
 I think she sells albums and I think people really, really like her, but I don't think

231
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,760
 they listen to her music.

232
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,360
 I don't think they listen to her music and I don't think it is as...

233
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,120
 Here's the thing, this could just be because I live up on Hood River, but when's the last

234
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,040
 time you heard a Beyonce song on the radio that wasn't crazy in love or Destiny's Child

235
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
 song?

236
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,800
 When's the last time Beyonce has had a crossover hit that would make her sell millions of albums?

237
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,280
 The only Beyonce song I ever hear on the radio is, "What was that one song where she's like,

238
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,160
 'Oh, you're so beautiful.

239
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,240
 You're just a girl or like if girls run the world or something like that?'"

240
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,480
 That and Crazy in Love and then Destiny's Child stuff.

241
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,000
 You're saying, "Jayson, you're just an old man.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,600
 You don't listen to the right radio stations, maybe."

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,360
 But I don't think she is as popular as...

244
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,600
 I think she's an icon.

245
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,840
 I personally am not a fan of hers, but I think people know who she is and it's cool to like

246
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,200
 Queen B, but it would be interesting to see how many people watched her Netflix special.

247
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,960
 It'd be interesting to see how many people actually buy and listen to her albums.

248
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,240
 I mean a lot of people are like, "Ooh, I love Queen B.

249
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,480
 She's so cool."

250
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,840
 But they don't name a couple songs.

251
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,480
 Crazy in Love, Lemonade, like it's not...

252
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
 She doesn't have songs that you can just kick back to and listen.

253
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,240
 I don't know, again, maybe I'm just an old man.

254
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,560
 But that's one of my conspiracy theories.

255
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,000
 Beyonce is a scam.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Beyonce is...

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,800
 I won't go so far to say she's some sort of tax write off or some sort of malicious scam.

258
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,920
 I just think Jay-Z has a hot girlfriend and he wants to keep her happy.

259
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,960
 So he lets her record albums.

260
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
 Oh, Single Ladies, that was a big hit.

261
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,760
 But see, all those are like older songs.

262
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
 Single Ladies was a big hit.

263
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
 And then she had one or two other ones.

264
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,320
 She kind of had this thing in the beginning after she left Destiny's Child when she first

265
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,840
 got with Jay-Z.

266
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
 She had these hits.

267
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,800
 Now I think it's just this billionaire husband lets his wife pick songs out of a...

268
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,440
 Basically meet up with songwriters and buy songs for her and then she goes in the studio,

269
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
 sings them, and goes on tour so he can...

270
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,680
 I love Jay-Z, by the way.

271
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,880
 I'm not trying to throw him under the bus.

272
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,000
 But you know, yeah honey, yeah, you're perfect.

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Everyone loves your albums.

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,280
 Queen B, Queen B, why don't you go so I can, you know, go sleep with Becky over here.

275
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
 So that's...

276
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,360
 I love you Jay-Z.

277
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,760
 But don't cheat on your wife, dude.

278
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
 Tacky.

279
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 Okay, so...

280
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
 So...

281
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,640
 That's not a conspiracy theory.

282
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,400
 I'm actually pretty sure Jay-Z did cheat on his wife.

283
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,120
 I think that's kind of public record.

284
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
 But...

285
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
 Anyways, so...

286
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,200
 Here's an interesting...

287
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
 I want to go back to the fast food thing for a second.

288
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,120
 You remember that documentary Super Size Me?

289
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,560
 I remember when that came out...

290
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
 So before I go on...

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,160
 There's a documentary called Super Size Me where a guy's like, "I'm going to eat nothing

292
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,480
 but McDonald's for 30 days to show how disgusting the food is."

293
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
 The food isn't good for you.

294
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,760
 But he goes, "And if they ask me to Super Size It, I will Super Size It."

295
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,680
 And so for 30 days he videotapes himself, Morgan Spurlock walking into McDonald's and

296
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
 he's like...

297
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,400
 By the end of the 30 days he's like, "Oh, I'm so sick."

298
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,560
 And the doctor's like, "Oh my God, you're totally going to die."

299
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,640
 And then McDonald's stops Super Size Me and their stuff because of the publicity for this.

300
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,280
 The bad publicity from the movie.

301
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,200
 And Morgan Spurlock was kind of held up as like, "Whoa dude, he's like a new Michael Moore.

302
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,560
 He's going out but he's eating stuff and he's showing how bad fast food is for you."

303
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
 Okay.

304
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,720
 When the #MeToo movement was first starting off, Morgan Spurlock got pulled into it because

305
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,720
 he was being inappropriate with some female assistant or something like that.

306
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,120
 And at that time he came out and he said, "I'm sorry.

307
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
 I shouldn't have done that.

308
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,320
 I have an alcohol problem.

309
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,960
 I've had alcoholism for years and years and years.

310
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,720
 I drink every day."

311
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
 So sorry.

312
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,000
 Now, I'm not making fun.

313
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 I kind of chuckled there.

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,320
 I'm not making fun of people with alcoholism.

315
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,160
 Part of the concept of Super Size Me was that he ate and drank nothing except for stuff

316
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,400
 that he got at McDonald's.

317
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,720
 And he had just admitted in writing that he was an alcoholic during the time they were

318
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,400
 shooting Super Size Me.

319
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,160
 And I remember reading an article and they said, "McDonald's can sue him now because

320
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,520
 that was the whole, he's not feeling well because he's just eating nothing but McDonald's.

321
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,400
 But if he was suffering from alcoholism, that will also make your belly be all bloated

322
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,040
 and make a doctor go, 'Oh my God, you might die soon.'

323
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,920
 And I remember seeing that, I remember reading something too that McDonald's, in the insiders

324
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,200
 were saying that McDonald's might try to sue Morgan Spurlock, but they just let it go.

325
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,760
 As far as I know, as far as I know, they just kind of let it go because they could have

326
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,680
 taken him to court and said, "You committed fraud.

327
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,880
 You told everyone you ate nothing but our product for a month and you got sick."

328
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,160
 It turns out you were actually drinking four Bloody Marys every morning as well, so you

329
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
 lied.

330
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,000
 And that's the reason why your health was so bad.

331
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,560
 Okay, and so next one here, I have just a couple, I had to write these down because

332
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,960
 even though I'm not prepared enough to do a normal episode, I had to prepare for something

333
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
 at least.

334
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,440
 Let's see, Mary Ann Williamson is a witch, I did that one.

335
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,280
 Here's the, you know, we'll end it on this one, assuming I can keep a linear path in

336
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
 my thoughts.

337
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
 I'll end this one.

338
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 This is one that is kind of weird.

339
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
 [laughs]

340
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,800
 I mean, that's assuming the other ones were normal to you.

341
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,480
 It's going to take us a couple steps together.

342
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
 So I don't know what happens to you after you die.

343
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,160
 Shock, I know, everyone thought I had all the answers, but I don't know what happens

344
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,440
 to you after you die.

345
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,000
 I believe something, I don't believe you just disappear, I don't believe you just go into

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,560
 the void.

347
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,000
 But people ask me, "Hey, do you believe in reincarnation?"

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I go, "I don't know.

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I don't know."

350
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That's the exact tone I take with them too.

351
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I go, "I don't know.

352
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I don't know."

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,200
 I actually have a friend of mine who thinks that her son, like, her son will often mention

354
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,480
 stuff about being like in an old war.

355
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,680
 She's like, "Really?"

356
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,320
 She goes, "I think you might have been reincarnated.

357
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,720
 I don't know."

358
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,880
 But do I believe in reincarnation?

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
 I don't know.

360
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
 I don't know.

361
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,360
 I think reincarnation is an interesting thought because I like the physical planet Earth.

362
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,480
 I like the physical things around us.

363
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,680
 So the idea of going into some sort of like spiritual ether or going into a realm not

364
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,280
 of this Earth, that actually terrifies me more than like dying.

365
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,000
 Like the idea of dying doesn't necessarily scare me.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,840
 The idea of moving past the physical realm into a brand new spiritual journey, that's

367
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,680
 what scares me.

368
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,520
 Like because I like touching stuff and I like seeing stuff and hearing stuff and tasting

369
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
 stuff.

370
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,800
 But we're all based on physical things that are receptors in our body.

371
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,160
 I don't think that a little ghost shaped, a little ghost in the shape of Jason is going

372
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,480
 to float up into the sky and then be walking on streets.

373
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,440
 I don't think that that just doesn't make any sense.

374
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,200
 So the idea, I remember I was watching Twin Peaks when I went down to Sacramento.

375
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,000
 My brother hadn't seen the last three episodes of Twin Peaks The Return, so I went down there

376
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,280
 and we watched him.

377
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,120
 And all the stuff with like the giant floating head and the teapot with David Bowie in it.

378
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,360
 I'm thinking what if this is what happens when you die?

379
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,440
 It's just this weird black and white artistic world.

380
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,600
 And it's just like *blah* *psshh* *blah* *psshh* and then David Bowie talks to you.

381
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,880
 Like that would not, and it's not where I want to go.

382
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,960
 That would be super unsettling.

383
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,880
 Killer Bob's floating around in a ball.

384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
 No.

385
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,080
 So the idea of reincarnation is very intriguing to me.

386
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,160
 It's very peaceful to me.

387
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,360
 And I will say this, let me do one more little hot take.

388
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,280
 Again, I don't know what that means.

389
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,680
 The, I think reincarnation may actually be the way you explain to a caveman quantum reality.

390
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,400
 Or quantum immortality, where if you die you just shift into another universe and you

391
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,280
 don't know you've died, you continue on with your life.

392
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,120
 Because you can't experience a world that you can't experience, so you're basically

393
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,280
 create a, you move into a world where you can't experience it.

394
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,640
 So if you had like shamans or yogis or whatever back in the day experimenting with these vision

395
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,560
 quests and they were similar upon the idea of reincarnation, they might have actually

396
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,760
 just been realized seeing through the veil and seeing that there's a reality next to us

397
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,480
 and when you die you enter that reality.

398
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,840
 And they can't really explain that so they go, "Ah, you become a dog."

399
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,560
 Like you can't explain to a caveman the way that quantum reality works so you go, "Oh

400
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,400
 yeah, if you die you just become a stick."

401
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 You become a log.

402
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,720
 And like, "That's kind of lame."

403
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
 Well you should have been better.

404
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,880
 If you're a really good log you'll end up becoming a cricket.

405
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,560
 "Ah, I can be a good cricket."

406
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 And you go on.

407
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,880
 And it could just be a way of looking at what may actually be true is that when you die you

408
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,840
 shift to a universe where you haven't died and you have no idea that you died.

409
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,440
 You know, it's just a quick, "Whoa man, that was close.

410
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,760
 I almost got hit by that car."

411
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,560
 When in the reality you came from, you actually did get killed instantly when you get hit

412
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
 by the car.

413
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,240
 I don't really even know if I believe in quantum immortality because it raises a lot of questions

414
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,320
 like what if you're horribly injured?

415
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,000
 Are you horribly injured for the rest of time?

416
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,520
 Because you just keep shifting into another reality where you did not succumb to your

417
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,680
 wounds but you're like, "Ugh, I'll bust it up."

418
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,680
 If you're 99 years old and you die in bed, do you switch into another reality where you're

419
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,200
 99 years old dying in bed and then you switch into another reality where you're 99 years

420
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,320
 old dying in bed?

421
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,920
 And every second you die and go to another reality where you just have one more second

422
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,160
 to live, that sounds hellish.

423
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,640
 So the idea of quantum immortality, it's kind of a weird one and I don't know how true

424
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,440
 it is but let's go back to my main thing which is reincarnation.

425
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,680
 Don't worry, this is going somewhere.

426
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,160
 I'm supposed to every other segment on this episode.

427
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,400
 Reincarnation, the idea that when you die you are reborn into another body.

428
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,920
 Most likely humans, sometimes you might become a cricket or a stick or something like that,

429
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,520
 but you die and then you become a human baby and you live your life out again and you have

430
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,760
 your karmic mission, you live a good life, you become, you get reborn and you do that

431
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,800
 so many times you basically fulfill your soul quest or you achieve enlightenment or whatever.

432
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,380
 You have to live through a thousand lifetimes or a million lifetimes and if you keep making

433
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,920
 the same mistakes in each lifetime, the journey is when you die you start back over as a baby,

434
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:43,000
 but if each time you kind of are more enlightened, you're a better person in each incarnation,

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,760
 eventually you will ascend out of the physical realm.

436
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,720
 I think, so let's assume that's true, because again I don't know, that again there's very

437
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
 comforting thought to me.

438
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,720
 If that's true, I think that this is one of my first incarnations, maybe second or something

439
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 like that.

440
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,780
 I'm not an old soul, I'm not, if that's true I believe this would be one of my first

441
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,680
 times on earth, because everything, I'm 42 years old but everything always seems so new

442
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,520
 and fascinating to me and I'm clumsy, kind of clumsy, not super clumsy, I used to be

443
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,480
 really clumsy as a kid, so you're like, Jason, just tell me what your conspiracy theory is,

444
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,600
 what does any of this have to do?

445
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,680
 Here it is, people who are reincarnated just in the beginning, so first, maybe first couple

446
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,760
 times that they've been a baby and then died and came back as another baby.

447
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,440
 They're still getting used to their physical bodies, their souls are still getting used

448
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,760
 to being able to walk around the planet, but people who have lived hundreds if not thousands

449
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,400
 of lifetimes before, live a life, grow old, die, live a life, grow old, die, live a life,

450
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,560
 grow old, die, over and over and over again, they become so much more comfortable in their

451
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,200
 bodies, they know how bodies work intrinsically, they don't understand why, but they've lived

452
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,640
 so many lifetimes that they're basically, if you're an RPG character, they've leveled

453
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,160
 up their physical attributes over and over and over again, while people who are not,

454
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,440
 they have not been reincarnated a lot of times, who are new to the game, they're still kind

455
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,040
 of clumsy, they have two left feet, they bump into stuff, scratch their knees, because they're

456
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,680
 still getting used, they don't have the expert control of their bodies over the masterclass

457
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,680
 people.

458
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,320
 Here's my conspiracy theory, here's what I'm getting at.

459
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,560
 Dancers, like really really good dancers, are people who have lived millions of years.

460
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,720
 Sometimes I'll just watch dance videos on YouTube, I'm fascinated by great dancing, I think it's

461
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,480
 amazing, it's a skill I don't have, and I think that I will see kids, I will see these

462
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,920
 young men and women pull off moves that I would have thought were impossible, that the human

463
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,760
 body should not be able to move that way, but I think it's all, that's because I'm

464
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,240
 new to this, I'm new to this planet, my body is still, I'm still getting used to how fingers

465
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,800
 curl and how you can move your legs, I'm basically on the cosmic scale, I'm in a baby body, or

466
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:17,120
 I'm an adult body, but I have baby coordination, where you could have a 19 year old kid who's

467
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:25,800
 actually been living and dying since the days of the Romans, who intrinsically knows what

468
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,240
 the body's capable of, how it can move, how fast it can move, which way it can bend, and

469
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,400
 they are just naturally born gifted dancers.

470
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,180
 They're so comfortable with the human form that they can just glide on the floor, do

471
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,800
 incredible moves, things like that.

472
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,040
 Now of course, obviously they have to train, they have to train themselves as well, but

473
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,560
 I think there's a natural, there are people who are just naturally born dancers and with

474
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,600
 training they can become great dancers, you have people that are mediocre dancers and

475
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,960
 with training can become pretty good dancers, and then there are people like me who I love

476
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:06,160
 to dance, and I'm bad enough at dancing that when I go out, I'm bad enough at dancing that

477
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,060
 it's almost charming, like I can keep a rhythm, and people go wow, he's terrible at dancing,

478
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,660
 but there's something charming that he's actually just trying and you can tell I'm having fun.

479
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,700
 So yeah, it's charming, he's terrible, he's a horrible dancer, but he looks like he's

480
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,460
 having fun, that's nice.

481
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,220
 That's nice, say something nice for the boy over there in the bar doing my moves, doing

482
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,980
 my moves, because I got a baby brain and a baby body, I got a baby brain and an adult

483
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,440
 body that I don't know how to use this body to its full potential.

484
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,200
 So we look around for proof of reincarnation by finding kids that are like, my wife died

485
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,000
 in 1909, I shot her in the head and they're like, what did you say Billy?

486
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,400
 He's realizing he confessed to a crime that's over 100 years old, but we look for proof

487
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,320
 in reincarnation with like kids saying stuff or people being hypnotized and things like

488
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,280
 that, but it might actually just be something more basic than that.

489
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,020
 Someone who's lived multiple lifetimes would know their spirit would hop in a baby and

490
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,660
 be like, let's do this, I'm ready to go, they're cracking their knuckles and stuff like that,

491
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,260
 because they've piloted a human body so many times before.

492
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,380
 Where as someone who is new to the scene, they're like, oh what, I got a butthole, what comes

493
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,660
 out of this, oh no, that's horrible, it's all new experiences to them, or newer, if

494
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,340
 you've only reincarnated two or three times, you'd still be getting used to the whole thing.

495
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,040
 So that is my hot take episode.

496
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:37,000
 I'll look that up, I'll look up what the definition of hot take means before I title it.

497
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,360
 If the title of the episode is not a hot take, that means that I don't know what I'm talking

498
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,800
 about, that I think of the wrong thing.

499
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,760
 I think a hot take is just a thing where you just like say stuff off the top of your head,

500
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
 I don't know.

501
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,080
 But that being said, I hope you guys had fun with today's episode, we're moving back to
