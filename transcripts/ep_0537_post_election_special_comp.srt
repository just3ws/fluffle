1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 To be honest, I don't know exactly what we're talking about today. I'm actually not feeling super good.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I'm sure it'll include a horrific death or two. I also have a story about... Let me try and get back on track here.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Today we talk about a horrific death or two.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Is it possible that this happened? Is I'm holding my hands out pointing to nothing? I don't know what I'm going to talk about yet.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And finally, we are going to look at one of the most bizarre fetishes I've come across in 44 years of being alive.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Move over, feeders! Get out of the way, other weirdo groups!

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Because we are going to walk deep into a pool of quicksand today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Kerviner. I'm having an okay day.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day. The debate was last night. I'm not going to talk politics, but I really enjoy politics.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I enjoy the art of politics. So this whole thing, all these debates and everything, this is like my playoffs, man.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I'm serious. I really, really enjoy politics. I don't like to talk about them so much because I always have such a weird view.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I consider it all stagecraft. I consider it all like it's this tellage. I know people say there's real world consequences and things like that, and there are.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But I like the art of politicking. So yeah, this is a really big time for me.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So I said on a couple of episodes ago, I drink like two or three times a year. Last night was one of them.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I had a little bottle of wine that I had from a date a year ago.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I had a little tiny, when I say a little bottle of wine, one of those that's like the size of your hand.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Steel reserve and a half and a bottle of hard apple cider.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And I've been sick since 10 p.m. last night. I've been completely ill. I barely slept.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I just took a shower. It's way too late to be taking my shower for the day. I feel black.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But while I'm feeling black, I'm going to run up and give a hug to one of our legacy Patreons, Herbert.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Herbert, come and get this sloppy hungover hug. I love you, buddy. I love you.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He's like, get off of me. You smell like you just took a shower.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And you should have taken one hour ago. Yeah, yeah, you know.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Herbert, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode even though I don't know where we're going.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Wherever we go, though, you are going to be in charge.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I'm going to put the page on that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So I'm waiting on Herbert. He's like, oh man, it's going to be one of those episodes. It is.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Let's first head out to Wyoming. So let's go ahead and hop in that Der Rabbit Durgible.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 We haven't used that in a while. Herbert, you're at the command. You're working all the buttons and stuff like that.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We're going up to Snake River Ranch. This is August 3rd, 2020.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Herbert's flying at Der Rabbit Durgible and we're not alone in the sky.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We see all of these beautiful hot air balloons filling up the early morning sky and we're flying.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 We're trying to navigate through them. It's a beautiful August day.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 This just happened what, two months ago?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But then I wouldn't talk just about a normal day, right?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 There would just be a boring podcast. Something happens.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We have a quote from Robert Kravitzky, his 12-year-old boy.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 He wrote this quote before we got on.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I was saying, there were dark clouds and it was windy, but no one was listening.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I don't know why they didn't cancel it.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So these balloons are floating around.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Now these aren't like, you know when you watch like, I don't know, Chitty Chitty Bing Bang or Around the World in 80 Days, whatever.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Those are the movies that have ever featured a hot air balloon.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 There's like two, three people in the balloon, right? You got like a little gondola, little wicker thing, because they still make them like it's the year 1892.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 There's that old woman hand wickering, all these hot air balloons.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 You got the basket and you got like two, three people in it.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 You got like the gondolaire. I don't even know if that's the right term.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I think that's the guy in Italy who rose the boat, but these balloons, you think like it's like two people in a balloon and then like a third guy working it.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 No, I found out that I was lied to by Chitty Chitty Bing Bang.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 The point is, think about Return to Oz.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 You got a couch, think about everything you could fit into that gondola or that thing that sits at the bottom of the balloon.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You fit a young girl, you could fit a couch with a moose head, you could fit a robot and I think that was it.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 What's the couch in the hot air balloon? It doesn't matter, this has nothing to do with it.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 The point is that nowadays modern baskets on balloons can hold like 20 people.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 So it wasn't like, I mean it's not like a romantic trip.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's like a romantic trip in a subway car.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Like sure you can sit across from your sweetheart, there's like 19 other or 18 other people sitting around.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It's not very romantic, but anyways, it's a very long-winded way to say there was 20 people in these baskets.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Clinton Phillips and his whole family were in the hot air balloon and there's a bunch of other people there as well.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So they're in this basket, it really hasn't taken off that high yet, but there's a bunch of balloons out this day, hot air balloons out this day.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 They haven't even taken off the ground that much and the wind starts to hit.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 The baskets moving so much that people are almost falling out, they're like, "Uhhh, which admittedly would be quite hilarious, right?"

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 As long as you were the one standing in the center, you're like, "I'm the king of the world, the other people are holding on for dear life, you're pushing them away from you.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I am the center of gravity."

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 People are holding on for dear life, they're afraid they're going to fall out of this basket.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 There's another balloon, this was what made me want to cover this story.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 There's another balloon in the area, they see this one and people are like, "Uhhh, almost falling out and stuff like that."

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 The other balloon in the area, there's one person you don't... Okay, you don't want anyone to fall out of a balloon, I'm not, because I think it's funny.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 But if there's 20 people in a balloon basket, there's one person that you don't want to fall out, other than you.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 That's the person who flies the balloon basket, right?

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 That's the captain, they're officially called captains.

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 This basket tips, the wind hits it so much that the captain falls out.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And now you got 19 people in the balloon and it's slowly going up.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And the captain's on the ground, he didn't die, he falls down, because again it wasn't that high.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He did a little tuck and roll like Wolverine.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But the balloon's flying away now.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And the only person who knows how to operate it is on the ground and he begins yelling, "Pull the red rope!

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Pull the red rope!"

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 They pull the red rope and the thing starts to descend.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But again, like, think about it, if you're in a plane and your captain falls out of the plane and then the co-pilot falls out of the plane too,

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 you're pretty boned, no one on the plane's probably going to know how to fly it, but you're boned for like 0.8 seconds.

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Like, you're like, "Ah, lived a good life."

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 A balloon is, you basically have 20 minutes of wondering, "Will I live or die?"

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So the balloon's floating around, they're pulling the red ropes, they're pulling the red ropes as much as they can.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Eventually, they have a slow crash landing.

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 It's not super dynamic, people are really able to contemplate their past life decisions.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Like, you just want it to be over quick, right?

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 People are just kind of like thinking, "Oh man, all my regrets in life.

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I should have asked Mary to the prom. I should have gotten on the hot air balloon!"

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That's it! Those are my only two regrets.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 The balloon crashes into the ground, the basket hits and everybody falls out.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 All 19 people spill out, which again, would be hilarious to watch, right?

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Because basically, like, haven't you ever watched someone like walking and they're carrying something fairly important?

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Like spy documents or viruses or something like that?

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And they trip? Apparently you work at the Pentagon, they trip and they spill it and you laugh.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Imagine that, but the thing being spilled is a box full of people.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Is it not as funny as I think it is?

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I will say this, I will say this, because I know a lot of you guys are concerned about these people.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Obviously Robert was fine, he was given quotes afterwards.

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Another balloon crashes well, but it wasn't funny, it just crashed.

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 35 people in total got injured during these three balloon crashes.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 11 of them went to the hospital.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Now, I actually waited to tell the story for a while, because again, I was laughing so hard when I read this back on August 4th.

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 But apparently one of them fell out and hit their head and they had to be airlifted to the ER.

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And I was like, "Oh, that sucks, that was the last sentence in the article."

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I was like, "Oh, it sucks, I can't really make light of that."

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I can make fun of everyone else having little cartoon birds floating around their head and stuff like that.

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 That's my only joke, this whole thing's built around that sight gag.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I was like, "Oh man, now here's the thing, they never revealed who that person was or if the person never got better."

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 So it's possible, I don't think the person ever died, but I'm sure the person got better eventually, right?

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Just to eat my own conscience for laughing at the story.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But I have to say this, if I fell out of a hot air balloon and bonked my head and I'm like in and out of consciousness,

113
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and then I see my rescue vehicle as an other aircraft, I'd be like, "Oh man, can't you just like, shoot me out of a cannon?"

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I guess that still flies through the air and it multitudes less safe than a helicopter.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But still, I guess it's the same thing, like when you're in a boat and it sinks, and then another boat shows up to rescue you.

116
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Wouldn't you be a little nervous about that? Have you guys ever seen that movie, Dunkirk?

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 If you haven't, Dead Rabbit recommends Dunkirk, but that movie is basically a series of people on a boat

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 and the boat blowing up and they're like swimming in the water and then they go, "Oh, there's a rescue boat,"

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 and they get on that boat and then that boat gets sunk and they're swimming in the water.

120
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And that literally happens for about an hour of runtime until one of the most horrific deaths I've ever seen on film.

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 You know, everyone talks about saving Private Ryan and like the guy with the radio is like talking,

122
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and again, this scene's kind of funny too.

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 The guy's talking on the radio and Tom Hanks is like, "Tell him, tell him to shoot more bullets,"

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and the guy's like, "Shoot more bullets."

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And then there's this huge explosion and then Tom Hanks, he rolls the radio operator over and he has no face.

126
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Like it's completely gone. It's shocking when you first see it, but then it's so Freddy Kruger-ish.

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I know stuff like that really happened, okay?

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I'm working all the times I'm losing subscribers in this episode.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I've already lost the Hot Air Balloon fanbase.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Like this first time you see it, you're like, "Oh my God, the horrors of war."

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And then the second time you see it, you're like waiting. It's almost like a sight gag.

132
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But that is nothing. That was gross. I remember saying that movie, I'm not a fan of, but I liked the beach scene.

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I thought that whole beginning was, the rest of the movie is basically just dumb.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's just people walking around Europe.

135
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And then I mean like, yeah, they're fighting a war.

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I know that that's how wars are fought. People walk from one location to another,

137
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 but I remember watching the theater and I was like, "What? Like this is it?"

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 That was so cool. It was such a great opening.

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And now they're just like walking around playing pianos and stuff like that.

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And then the last 10, 15 minutes are cool.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And it's pretty grizzly, like the knife fights and stuff like that in the street.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And then at the end, you're like, "Oh, Tom Hanks was dead the whole time."

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I don't remember the twist.

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Was there a twist?

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It was basically like you thought it was Tom Hanks at a graveyard.

146
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And then it turns out to be Mark Damon. Sorry, spoiler alert.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I don't even know if it's a twist.

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Anyways, you could take all of the deaths of Savin' Private Ryan.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You could have a guy getting stabbed with a knife as his face is getting blown off

150
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 and he's carrying his own arm.

151
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Does not compare to Dunkirk.

152
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Because there's this scene of this guy who's literally been blown out of like four boats at this point.

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And the Nazis are stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, just shooting bullets and stuff like that at boats.

154
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 They're like attacking these boats. They've been doing it.

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 They've been doing it the whole hour. I don't know why I'm surprised.

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 They're back. Oh no.

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga

158
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 The jets are attacking these boats. The boat blows up and of course you figured that was happening, but this guy jumps off the boat.

159
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And what happens is he dives in the water and the boat is so damaged there's oil everywhere.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 It's totally coating the surface of the water.

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And this guy is underwater and the oil catches on fire.

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This is so gruesome. This shot is like you see above the water you see the waters on fire on the top.

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 The camera goes underneath and you see a close-up of the guy swimming underwater and he's running out of breath.

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But the water above him is on fire and it's spread so far he can't out swim it.

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And the camera just lingers. It's like a close-up on this dude's face and he's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And then he runs out of air and he resurfaces and as he resurfaces the camera resurfaces and he gets coated in oil and fire and he just begins screaming.

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And then that's the end of his story. I mean like he had gone through, it was just like one of the 20 characters that were running around in that movie.

168
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 That was, I mean like pick your poison, right?

169
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Drown or burn to death in the water.

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And even, that was awful. That was awful. That's a movie though. I recommend Dunkirk, especially over, this is a movie podcast now, especially over Saving Private Ryan.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Or as I like to call it, Snoring Private Ryan. Yeah, I don't like that movie.

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. I said I was going to talk about people dying horrible deaths. What was I going to talk about?

173
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do this one. So Herbert, let's fire up that Jason Jett. Let's get out of here in a hurry.

174
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 We're leaving behind these hot air balloons. We're leaving behind my movie review podcast that was just invented and canceled.

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 We're headed out to Ancient Greece.

176
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Flying out there, we're putting on our togas and stuff. In Ancient Greece we're going to meet a dude named Heraclitus.

177
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Heraclitus of Ephesius. Heraclitus maybe? I don't know. Everything's weird back then. But Hera, well, no, that's a girl's name, right?

178
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Heraclitus of Ephesius. That kind of rhymes. That was probably his name, because they did that back then.

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 They're like, "Your name is Nome of Rome." And they're like, "Thank you, my liege."

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 "Your name is Farta of Sparta." And he's like, "Oh man, I should have been born somewhere else." Everyone's laughing at him.

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Heraclitus of Ephesius. He lived from 535 to 475 BC.

182
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He was a philosopher. He was one of those guys who just kind of walked around and goes, "Is an umbrella really an umbrella?"

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 If it has a hole in it. And everyone goes, "What's an umbrella?"

184
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 He's like, "Just wait till those are invented." I just blew your mind. He walks around doing stuff like that.

185
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 He actually hated people. He hated democracy. This is actually very timely. He hated democracy. He hated mobs of people.

186
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 He was a misanthrope. So it should have surprised you that he was a hermit. But he had some good sayns, because this is what philosophers are remembered for.

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Here's some of his sayns. Here's some of his sayns. We're going to sit down in front of Heraclitus of Ephesius.

188
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And he's like, "Okay, there's not a lot of you, so that's not a mob. Do you guys like voting?" And we're like shaking our head.

189
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 He's like, "Perfect. Here's some of my sayns. No man ever steps in the same river twice."

190
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Or, "It's not the same river, and he's not the same man." We're like, "Oh, that's pretty interesting."

191
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 That's true. Every experience changes you in some way. I really like that one.

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 "Our envy always lasts longer than the happiness of those we envy."

193
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 We're like, "Is that a good thing? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

194
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 So us being jealous of that dude, yeah, I guess it is like, it shows that we're bad.

195
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Like, we're jealous of someone's success, but we'll take it to the grave.

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 That person may just have a peak of happiness. We may only see a glimpse of it.

197
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 But we'll always hate them. Very good. We're clapping.

198
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Clapping for him. He's like, "No, don't clap for me. I'm a philosopher. This is my job."

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 He says, "I love this one."

200
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The chain of wedlock is so heavy that it takes two to carry it.

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And sometimes three. You get a little side action.

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 You get a little sancia going on. And that is true. It's not good for your marriage.

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 But very funny. See, man has some good stuff going on.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Anyways, the reason why I'm talking about this guy other than sharing those philosophical moments with you

205
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 is because, so he got this thing called edema, which is like fluid under the skin.

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 One day he wakes up and he's like, "What am I going to philosophize about today?

207
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I'm doing another one about that river. That was a hit."

208
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He looks in his arm and he's all, "Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep."

209
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And he's looking. He's seeing like little bubble appear on his arm.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He's like, "That's not supposed to be there."

211
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And so he presses it and it moves under his skin.

212
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And he has edema. So it's like he's getting pockets of pus popping out of his skin.

213
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And it's like bull gene. He's basically looking like some toxic Avenger dude walking around.

214
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And no one wants to listen to a philosopher if they think at any given moment

215
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 a bunch of pus is going to shoot out from. They're like, "You might be wise.

216
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 You might be the most sane man in this insane world, but I'm also afraid this horrible disease

217
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 is going to explode out of you like getting hit by a car in Robocop."

218
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So he goes, "Yeah, I probably should take care of this."

219
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And he figures your stuff in my skin and he to draw it out.

220
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Okay, so how do I draw it out? Well, heat draws out stuff, right?

221
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Because I once had a glass of water once I invented glass and then put water in it.

222
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And then like it all went away. So he discovered evaporation and heat like removes things.

223
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So he decides to get a bunch of cow poop and he covers himself up in cow poop.

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And he figures that the cow poop, don't do this at home obviously.

225
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I know this guy has so much cow poop. He was a wandering philosopher.

226
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 He must have stolen it from someone. Or maybe he goes, "Hey, tell you what.

227
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 You can eat 10 pounds of cow poop. I'll give you a life lesson."

228
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 The guy's like, "Just take the 10 pounds of cow poop. You look disgusting.

229
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You look like you're going to explode at any moment."

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He covers himself up in cow poop. He actually starts to feel a little better.

231
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 The soothing heat of cow excrement will remove this poison from my body.

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 While I'm doing that, I'm going to take a nap.

233
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 There's nothing more comfortable than being buried under 10 pounds of cow poop.

234
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So he takes a nap. This world famous philosopher wakes up a couple hours later.

235
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 The poop has hardened into clay. He's like, "What? No. What? No, no. What?"

236
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And he can't move. His body is completely immobilized in this hard cask of cow poop.

237
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I don't know how weak this guy was right now because I think,

238
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 given what's about to happen, I could break out of a cow poop prison.

239
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Like I know people used to make houses out of clay and stuff like that.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I'm sure there was a liberal amount of cow poop in the clay. I'm just guessing.

241
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I'm just making that fact up. The point is, is that back then,

242
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 if you wanted to break into someone's house, you would literally just break in.

243
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 You'd just kick the wall over and you're like, "Give me all your stuff."

244
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You don't get destroyed when you knock the wall over. This is not the most convenient way to go in.

245
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But you could break down houses. You just punch them a lot and stuff like that.

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 This guy, he's buried under a cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And then, "Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

248
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 He's buried under a cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

249
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

250
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

251
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

252
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

253
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

254
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

255
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

256
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

257
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

258
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

259
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

260
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

261
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

262
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

263
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

264
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 He can't break out of the cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

265
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 If you put me in a giant chicken pot pie, I'm getting out of there.

266
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I might have a full stomach when I get out, but I'm getting out of a chicken pot pie.

267
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 This guy could not.

268
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 So let's leave behind Heraclitus of aphetius.

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Herbert, fire up that one, that only carbonicopter.

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 We are headed out to the jungle.

271
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 [Jingle Bells]

272
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 We're going to land in a clearing.

273
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 There's a bunch of like vines and stuff like that.

274
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 There's jungle trees, there's like panthers, bow constructors.

275
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Stereotypical jungle.

276
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And we're walking through it.

277
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And I tell you this story.

278
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I go, "Guys, listen, when I was a kid,

279
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 quicksand was the thing.

280
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Everyone knew what quicksand was.

281
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I think that was every kid's nightmare.

282
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 They were going to fall in a quicksand."

283
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 It was in so many shows.

284
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And it's fine because as an adult, a couple years ago, I was thinking,

285
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 "What happened to quicksand?"

286
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 They were everywhere. There were video games based on quicksand.

287
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Well, there was one spitfall, but you know what I mean?

288
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Like, quicksand was everywhere.

289
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And I stumbled across this great article on Slate called "Terra and Ferma,

290
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 the rise and fall of quicksand" by Daniel Ingebur.

291
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And he actually is able to lay it out.

292
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 He says, "Yes, quicksand used to be everywhere.

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 At one point, 3% of all movies made.

294
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 In the 1960s, 3% of all movies made featured a quicksand scene.

295
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 But ever since then, it's been slowly sinking.

296
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It's been slowly dropping off.

297
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I guess it's a better term, not sinking."

298
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And he goes, "It's interesting because he was pointing out

299
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 lost doesn't have a quicksand scene.

300
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Prince of Persia's Sands of Time, which came out around the time,

301
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 didn't have a quicksand scene.

302
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 He actually asked the writers of Lost,

303
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 'Hey, you know, like, quicksand is a thing.

304
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 It's a real thing. How come you didn't have it in the show?'

305
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And they said, 'That's too cheesy.'

306
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Because it had been done so much.

307
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 3% of all movies in the 1960s having quicksand is a ton.

308
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Before that, from the 1900s to the 1950s,

309
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 it was about, like, 0.5% of all movies.

310
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 So still a lot.

311
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 3% just really got it.

312
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Cowboy movies would have it.

313
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Cowboy shows would have it.

314
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Cowboy country-western concerts.

315
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 They had a giant-- instead of a mosh pit,

316
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 they had a giant quicksand pit.

317
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Everyone's sinking inside of it.

318
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 You had it a lot.

319
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 It's interesting because he hypothesized,

320
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 'Why did it go away? Why did it go away?'

321
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And he broke it down like this.

322
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 One, cheesy. It's been overdone.

323
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 He says, '2, this was an interesting observation.'

324
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 He goes, 'I think that there's less wild areas for kids to play in.

325
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And there's not sandboxes anymore.'

326
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So it's not like these little, like,

327
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 nine-year-olds were in Hollywood making movies,

328
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 but you would watch movies about quicksand

329
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 and you could recreate those adventures

330
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 in your day-to-day life if you were a kid.

331
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 You could go, 'Oh, no, look out.

332
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Indiana Jones is in the quicksand.'

333
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 You could just put your hat on the quicks--

334
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 on the sandbox and stuff like that and run away.

335
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 That's the whole game. You win.

336
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Gotta get your hat back, though.

337
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But that, of course, isn't the end of it

338
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 because, like, everything in the world,

339
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 somebody decided to sexualize quicksand.

340
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It kind of plays on the 'vor' thing.

341
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 'Vor' if you don't know if you're a sane individual.

342
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 'Vor' is where you eat people.

343
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Like, you either get enjoyment out of swallow--

344
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 it's weird. It's not like, 'Ugh!'

345
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 It's not like ripping their bones up with your teeth.

346
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 You swallow someone whole, or you get swallowed whole,

347
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 and you get slowly digested.

348
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And there's tons of art. Don't look it up.

349
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 There's a whole 'vor' video game. Don't look that up either.

350
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 It's super hard to actually try playing it.

351
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 It's funny because I wanted to, like, fight the monsters,

352
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 but because it's made for people who like to get eaten,

353
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 like, you walk out and a monster gets you

354
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and then it shows an animation of you getting devoured.

355
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 This game had it come out, like, in 2008.

356
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It's not on Steam or anything like that.

357
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 You try to fight them, and then you're like,

358
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 'Ugh!' Like, the whole game is just you getting digested.

359
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 It's pretty lame.

360
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Okay, unless you're in a way.

361
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But it's kind of a side thing of 'Vor'.

362
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 The idea is watching people, specifically women.

363
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 It was interesting. I wasn't able to find out

364
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 whether or not there was a gay component to this fetish.

365
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But specifically women sinking into quicksand.

366
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 There's a magazine called Splosh, exclamation point magazine.

367
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 They even have a section on the website for Splosh dating.

368
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 It's in the show notes. If you're looking for someone,

369
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 if you're looking for love for someone who likes to be dirty

370
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 and in sync, there you go.

371
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 They even have movies.

372
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 They had a clearance section. I was like, 'Oh, maybe I'll buy a movie.'

373
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Clearance section. They sell VHS tapes, man.

374
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Just throw those away. No one's going to buy that.

375
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Actually, now that I think about it, it's such a specific fetish.

376
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 That if that was the only way you could get your fetish,

377
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 with some VHS tapes, sure.

378
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 They also sell photo CDs full of photos.

379
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Which is straight out of 1997.

380
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 When it took so long to download a photo of Sarah Michelle Geller,

381
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 back then you would buy a CD with nothing but photos of Sarah Michelle Geller.

382
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 None of them she was sinking in quicksand.

383
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 But if you want to see her sinking in quicksand,

384
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I don't know, just take a picture of her, draw some quicksand on it.

385
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 But they do have this thing.

386
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And then there's another website.

387
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It might be the same website, I don't remember,

388
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 because it's been a long time since I've been there, and I don't want to go back.

389
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 But it's called MPV for mud puddle visuals.

390
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Now we have, push the kids out of the room,

391
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 push them in some quicksands at a hand just part.

392
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They actually have the typical, like, porn titles for a lot of these movies.

393
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 We have Pie-eyed wives.

394
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I don't know what that has to do with quicksand.

395
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 They tell them there's a pie at the bottom of it, and they're so addicted to it, they jump in.

396
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 That's the thing, they want, people want to see them go in feet first.

397
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 They want to see them struggle.

398
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Very bizarre fetish.

399
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Pie-eyed wives.

400
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 You have Slime Suspect 2.

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Can't imagine what the first one is about, but Slime Suspect 2.

402
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Police Custardy.

403
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 I'm thinking that this might actually be from a different part of the website,

404
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 because these are all food-based funds.

405
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Maybe someone's thinking in quicksand they're throwing pies at her.

406
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And then they have another one called Pretty Clumsy Woman.

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Ah, you thought I was going to say Pretty Woman.

408
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 No, I guess she's, like, wandering into quicksand or something like that.

409
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 They're like, "Oh, Alice, you're so clumsy.

410
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You walked into the Brazilian rainforest all by yourself."

411
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Anyways, they also have, so those are kind of cute, right?

412
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Slime Suspect, I would never watch them.

413
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 I would never watch them, but Slime Suspect 2, Police Custardy.

414
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Then we have stuff like Nico Jordan loses her grip.

415
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Master--

416
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Nico Jordan loses her grip.

417
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 So I imagine she's, like, hanging on a branch.

418
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 She's like, "Oh, no, oh, no."

419
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 She falls in.

420
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 The whole title of this is "Nicco Jordan loses her grip."

421
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Masterbates, sinking in Pete Bogg.

422
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 She's like, "Oh, no, I lost my grip. I could try to get out.

423
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 I do know that, though, that struggling in quicksand only makes it worse.

424
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Pete Bogg's probably the same thing.

425
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 How can I not struggle?"

426
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 I don't know.

427
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 I'm just going to imagine.

428
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 That's struggling, right?

429
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Because you're, like, moving around and stuff like that.

430
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Anyways, Bondage and the Hammer Swamp.

431
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 They got dark real quick, right?

432
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 First it was like, "Oh, no, I got a pie in my face."

433
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Now it's like, there's no escape from Hammer Swamp.

434
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 It's just a swamp made of hammers.

435
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 They have damsels in quicksand?

436
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Number 17.

437
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 They've been putting this stuff out for a while.

438
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And I've actually found, like, on the website.

439
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Again, don't go there.

440
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Again, don't go there.

441
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Just-- but there's, like, sample videos.

442
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And they'll be, like, these women walking through the forest.

443
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 They're edited up.

444
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Because they're not going to give you the full half hour of sinking.

445
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Goodness.

446
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 They'll show, like, these three girls walking through the jungle and bikinis.

447
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And then they'll cut to, like, all three of them, like, knee deep in quicksand.

448
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And then they cut to them being, like, "Ugh."

449
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And then they just cut to, like, a picture-- like, a scene of quicksand.

450
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And then some of them are people, like, a sexy woman has a gun.

451
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And she's, like, walking to the quicksand.

452
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And the girls, they're, like, "No, I don't want to walk into the quicksand."

453
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 And they walk into the quicksand.

454
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And then it just ends with them sinking.

455
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 They all end the same way.

456
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 There's no suspense.

457
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 But I guess all pornography kind of ends the same way.

458
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 There's never one where some guy's, like, in the middle of banging some chick.

459
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And he's, like, "Oh, I got to go."

460
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Just leaves.

461
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And she just looks at the camera.

462
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I guess they all have a prescribed ending.

463
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But I did find something really disturbing.

464
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Disturbing than everything else I've described so far.

465
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I did find something else disturbing.

466
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 There's a section of it dedicated to Asian girls.

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Part of the video is that are dedicated to Asian girls.

468
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And it's real interesting, because it's almost like they know that's not the target market for the audience.

469
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 They actually include this phrase.

470
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 "Well, they are the women of the Philippines.

471
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And they sink in quicksand just like Western gals."

472
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 So they're like, "Listen, you pervert. You racist perverts out there."

473
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 We know you want to see the girl next door, that girl who turns you down when you asked her to the prom, Mary.

474
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Then you fell out of the high air balloon.

475
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And then you got bumped in the head and you got this sick fetish.

476
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 We know that you want to see her sink.

477
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 However, we got a bunch of girls from the Philippines.

478
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 They'll do it.

479
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 They'll do it for half the price.

480
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 We can totally sink them.

481
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 We don't have to, like, bring out a location or build a swamp set and have quicksand.

482
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 There's a bunch of quicksand right over here in the Philippines.

483
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 I'm not going to say that some of this may not actually mean snuff,

484
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 but I also probably want to watch the videos.

485
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I didn't watch any of them.

486
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And again, I don't know if they're actually in the middle of Philippines shooting snuff videos and drowning these women.

487
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 It doesn't appear to be.

488
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It looks like a lot of the footage is afterwards they're smiling and they're covered in, like, quicksand.

489
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 But how much would someone have to pay you to walk into quicksand?

490
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And knowing a bunch of weirdos are going to masturbate thinking about it.

491
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Like, you could be like, "Oh, you pay me $500 walking quicksand."

492
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 "Oh, I know you added that second part."

493
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 You have to be like a million bucks.

494
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Your image would be out there forever for people to pleasure themselves with.

495
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 So there we go.

496
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Let's do a quick recap.

497
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Don't take hot air balloon rides.

498
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Don't cover yourself in poop.

499
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Do see Dunkirk. I'm sure Chris Rennolan loves this ad for his movie.

500
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And if anyone ever asked you, "Hey, you know what would be really cool if we both walked out into the jungle?"

501
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 "I have a camera and you don't have anything you're wearing a bikini."

502
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 You're like, "What? Where did I get this at?"

503
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And why don't you...

504
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 I'm going to film you walking into the quicksand, but it's just for me.

505
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 It's just for me.

506
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I'm going to take it home first off, get new friends.

507
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 But secondly, you may want to look a little bit closer at quicksand websites, because actually, no, I've been telling you not to.

508
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 I was going to say, because you might end up on one.

509
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Obviously, you would know that.

510
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 I really don't have any way to end this episode, other than the fact that I'm actually feeling a lot better.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 So if you stuck around this long, Herbert left the garbage after he took off.

512
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He's gone.

513
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So we got to walk back.

514
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 But if you guys stuck around this long, I really appreciate it.

515
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 I'm actually feeling a lot better.

516
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 This show is really good for me to do.

517
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And I hope you guys have a lot of fun hearing it.
