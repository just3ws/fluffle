1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 To be honest, I don't know exactly what we're talking about today. I'm actually not feeling super good.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 I'm sure it'll include a horrific death or two. I also have a story about... Let me try and get back on track here.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Today we talk about a horrific death or two.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Is it possible that this happened? Is I'm holding my hands out pointing to nothing? I don't know what I'm going to talk about yet.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And finally, we are going to look at one of the most bizarre fetishes I've come across in 44 years of being alive.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Move over, feeders! Get out of the way, other weirdo groups!

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Because we are going to walk deep into a pool of quicksand today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Kerviner. I'm having an okay day.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day. The debate was last night. I'm not going to talk politics, but I really enjoy politics.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I enjoy the art of politics. So this whole thing, all these debates and everything, this is like my playoffs, man.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I'm serious. I really, really enjoy politics. I don't like to talk about them so much because I always have such a weird view.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I consider it all stagecraft. I consider it all like it's this tellage. I know people say there's real world consequences and things like that, and there are.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But I like the art of politicking. So yeah, this is a really big time for me.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So I said on a couple of episodes ago, I drink like two or three times a year. Last night was one of them.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I had a little bottle of wine that I had from a date a year ago.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I had a little tiny, when I say a little bottle of wine, one of those that's like the size of your hand.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Steel reserve and a half and a bottle of hard apple cider.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And I've been sick since 10 p.m. last night. I've been completely ill. I barely slept.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I just took a shower. It's way too late to be taking my shower for the day. I feel black.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But while I'm feeling black, I'm going to run up and give a hug to one of our legacy Patreons, Herbert.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Herbert, come and get this sloppy hungover hug. I love you, buddy. I love you.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He's like, get off of me. You smell like you just took a shower.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And you should have taken one hour ago. Yeah, yeah, you know.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Herbert, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode even though I don't know where we're going.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Wherever we go, though, you are going to be in charge.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I'm going to put the page on that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So I'm waiting on Herbert. He's like, oh man, it's going to be one of those episodes. It is.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Let's first head out to Wyoming. So let's go ahead and hop in that Der Rabbit Durgible.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 We haven't used that in a while. Herbert, you're at the command. You're working all the buttons and stuff like that.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We're going up to Snake River Ranch. This is August 3rd, 2020.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Herbert's flying at Der Rabbit Durgible and we're not alone in the sky.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We see all of these beautiful hot air balloons filling up the early morning sky and we're flying.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 We're trying to navigate through them. It's a beautiful August day.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 This just happened what, two months ago?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But then I wouldn't talk just about a normal day, right?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 There would just be a boring podcast. Something happens.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We have a quote from Robert Kravitzky, his 12-year-old boy.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 He wrote this quote before we got on.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I was saying, there were dark clouds and it was windy, but no one was listening.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I don't know why they didn't cancel it.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 So these balloons are floating around.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Now these aren't like, you know when you watch like, I don't know, Chitty Chitty Bing Bang or Around the World in 80 Days, whatever.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Those are the movies that have ever featured a hot air balloon.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 There's like two, three people in the balloon, right? You got like a little gondola, little wicker thing, because they still make them like it's the year 1892.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 There's that old woman hand wickering, all these hot air balloons.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 You got the basket and you got like two, three people in it.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 You got like the gondolaire. I don't even know if that's the right term.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I think that's the guy in Italy who rose the boat, but these balloons, you think like it's like two people in a balloon and then like a third guy working it.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 No, I found out that I was lied to by Chitty Chitty Bing Bang.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 The point is, think about Return to Oz.

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 You got a couch, think about everything you could fit into that gondola or that thing that sits at the bottom of the balloon.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You fit a young girl, you could fit a couch with a moose head, you could fit a robot and I think that was it.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 What's the couch in the hot air balloon? It doesn't matter, this has nothing to do with it.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 The point is that nowadays modern baskets on balloons can hold like 20 people.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 So it wasn't like, I mean it's not like a romantic trip.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's like a romantic trip in a subway car.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Like sure you can sit across from your sweetheart, there's like 19 other or 18 other people sitting around.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It's not very romantic, but anyways, it's a very long-winded way to say there was 20 people in these baskets.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Clinton Phillips and his whole family were in the hot air balloon and there's a bunch of other people there as well.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So they're in this basket, it really hasn't taken off that high yet, but there's a bunch of balloons out this day, hot air balloons out this day.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 They haven't even taken off the ground that much and the wind starts to hit.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 The baskets moving so much that people are almost falling out, they're like, "Uhhh, which admittedly would be quite hilarious, right?"

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 As long as you were the one standing in the center, you're like, "I'm the king of the world, the other people are holding on for dear life, you're pushing them away from you.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I am the center of gravity."

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 People are holding on for dear life, they're afraid they're going to fall out of this basket.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 There's another balloon, this was what made me want to cover this story.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 There's another balloon in the area, they see this one and people are like, "Uhhh, almost falling out and stuff like that."

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 The other balloon in the area, there's one person you don't... Okay, you don't want anyone to fall out of a balloon, I'm not, because I think it's funny.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 But if there's 20 people in a balloon basket, there's one person that you don't want to fall out, other than you.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 That's the person who flies the balloon basket, right?

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 That's the captain, they're officially called captains.

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 This basket tips, the wind hits it so much that the captain falls out.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And now you got 19 people in the balloon and it's slowly going up.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And the captain's on the ground, he didn't die, he falls down, because again it wasn't that high.

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He did a little tuck and roll like Wolverine.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But the balloon's flying away now.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And the only person who knows how to operate it is on the ground and he begins yelling, "Pull the red rope!

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Pull the red rope!"

79
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 They pull the red rope and the thing starts to descend.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But again, like, think about it, if you're in a plane and your captain falls out of the plane and then the co-pilot falls out of the plane too,

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 you're pretty boned, no one on the plane's probably going to know how to fly it, but you're boned for like 0.8 seconds.

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Like, you're like, "Ah, lived a good life."

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 A balloon is, you basically have 20 minutes of wondering, "Will I live or die?"

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So the balloon's floating around, they're pulling the red ropes, they're pulling the red ropes as much as they can.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Eventually, they have a slow crash landing.

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 It's not super dynamic, people are really able to contemplate their past life decisions.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Like, you just want it to be over quick, right?

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 People are just kind of like thinking, "Oh man, all my regrets in life.

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I should have asked Mary to the prom. I should have gotten on the hot air balloon!"

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That's it! Those are my only two regrets.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 The balloon crashes into the ground, the basket hits and everybody falls out.

92
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 All 19 people spill out, which again, would be hilarious to watch, right?

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Because basically, like, haven't you ever watched someone like walking and they're carrying something fairly important?

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Like spy documents or viruses or something like that?

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And they trip? Apparently you work at the Pentagon, they trip and they spill it and you laugh.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Imagine that, but the thing being spilled is a box full of people.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Is it not as funny as I think it is?

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I will say this, I will say this, because I know a lot of you guys are concerned about these people.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Obviously Robert was fine, he was given quotes afterwards.

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Another balloon crashes well, but it wasn't funny, it just crashed.

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 35 people in total got injured during these three balloon crashes.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 11 of them went to the hospital.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Now, I actually waited to tell the story for a while, because again, I was laughing so hard when I read this back on August 4th.

104
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 But apparently one of them fell out and hit their head and they had to be airlifted to the ER.

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And I was like, "Oh, that sucks, that was the last sentence in the article."

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I was like, "Oh, it sucks, I can't really make light of that."

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I can make fun of everyone else having little cartoon birds floating around their head and stuff like that.

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 That's my only joke, this whole thing's built around that sight gag.

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I was like, "Oh man, now here's the thing, they never revealed who that person was or if the person never got better."

110
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 So it's possible, I don't think the person ever died, but I'm sure the person got better eventually, right?

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Just to eat my own conscience for laughing at the story.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But I have to say this, if I fell out of a hot air balloon and bonked my head and I'm like in and out of consciousness,

113
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and then I see my rescue vehicle as an other aircraft, I'd be like, "Oh man, can't you just like, shoot me out of a cannon?"

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I guess that still flies through the air and it multitudes less safe than a helicopter.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But still, I guess it's the same thing, like when you're in a boat and it sinks, and then another boat shows up to rescue you.

116
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Wouldn't you be a little nervous about that? Have you guys ever seen that movie, Dunkirk?

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 If you haven't, Dead Rabbit recommends Dunkirk, but that movie is basically a series of people on a boat

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 and the boat blowing up and they're like swimming in the water and then they go, "Oh, there's a rescue boat,"

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 and they get on that boat and then that boat gets sunk and they're swimming in the water.

120
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And that literally happens for about an hour of runtime until one of the most horrific deaths I've ever seen on film.

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 You know, everyone talks about saving Private Ryan and like the guy with the radio is like talking,

122
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and again, this scene's kind of funny too.

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 The guy's talking on the radio and Tom Hanks is like, "Tell him, tell him to shoot more bullets,"

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 and the guy's like, "Shoot more bullets."

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And then there's this huge explosion and then Tom Hanks, he rolls the radio operator over and he has no face.

126
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Like it's completely gone. It's shocking when you first see it, but then it's so Freddy Kruger-ish.

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I know stuff like that really happened, okay?

128
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I'm working all the times I'm losing subscribers in this episode.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I've already lost the Hot Air Balloon fanbase.

130
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Like this first time you see it, you're like, "Oh my God, the horrors of war."

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And then the second time you see it, you're like waiting. It's almost like a sight gag.

132
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But that is nothing. That was gross. I remember saying that movie, I'm not a fan of, but I liked the beach scene.

133
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I thought that whole beginning was, the rest of the movie is basically just dumb.

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's just people walking around Europe.

135
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And then I mean like, yeah, they're fighting a war.

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I know that that's how wars are fought. People walk from one location to another,

137
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 but I remember watching the theater and I was like, "What? Like this is it?"

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 That was so cool. It was such a great opening.

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And now they're just like walking around playing pianos and stuff like that.

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And then the last 10, 15 minutes are cool.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And it's pretty grizzly, like the knife fights and stuff like that in the street.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And then at the end, you're like, "Oh, Tom Hanks was dead the whole time."

143
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I don't remember the twist.

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Was there a twist?

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It was basically like you thought it was Tom Hanks at a graveyard.

146
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And then it turns out to be Mark Damon. Sorry, spoiler alert.

147
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I don't even know if it's a twist.

148
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Anyways, you could take all of the deaths of Savin' Private Ryan.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You could have a guy getting stabbed with a knife as his face is getting blown off

150
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 and he's carrying his own arm.

151
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Does not compare to Dunkirk.

152
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Because there's this scene of this guy who's literally been blown out of like four boats at this point.

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And the Nazis are stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, stuck, just shooting bullets and stuff like that at boats.

154
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 They're like attacking these boats. They've been doing it.

155
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 They've been doing it the whole hour. I don't know why I'm surprised.

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 They're back. Oh no.

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga

158
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 The jets are attacking these boats. The boat blows up and of course you figured that was happening, but this guy jumps off the boat.

159
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And what happens is he dives in the water and the boat is so damaged there's oil everywhere.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 It's totally coating the surface of the water.

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And this guy is underwater and the oil catches on fire.

162
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This is so gruesome. This shot is like you see above the water you see the waters on fire on the top.

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 The camera goes underneath and you see a close-up of the guy swimming underwater and he's running out of breath.

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But the water above him is on fire and it's spread so far he can't out swim it.

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And the camera just lingers. It's like a close-up on this dude's face and he's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

166
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And then he runs out of air and he resurfaces and as he resurfaces the camera resurfaces and he gets coated in oil and fire and he just begins screaming.

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And then that's the end of his story. I mean like he had gone through, it was just like one of the 20 characters that were running around in that movie.

168
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 That was, I mean like pick your poison, right?

169
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Drown or burn to death in the water.

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And even, that was awful. That was awful. That's a movie though. I recommend Dunkirk, especially over, this is a movie podcast now, especially over Saving Private Ryan.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Or as I like to call it, Snoring Private Ryan. Yeah, I don't like that movie.

172
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. I said I was going to talk about people dying horrible deaths. What was I going to talk about?

173
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, let's do this one. So Herbert, let's fire up that Jason Jett. Let's get out of here in a hurry.

174
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 We're leaving behind these hot air balloons. We're leaving behind my movie review podcast that was just invented and canceled.

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 We're headed out to Ancient Greece.

176
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Flying out there, we're putting on our togas and stuff. In Ancient Greece we're going to meet a dude named Heraclitus.

177
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Heraclitus of Ephesius. Heraclitus maybe? I don't know. Everything's weird back then. But Hera, well, no, that's a girl's name, right?

178
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Heraclitus of Ephesius. That kind of rhymes. That was probably his name. Because they did that back then.

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 They're like, "Your name is Nome of Rome." And they're like, "Thank you, my liege."

180
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 "Your name is Farta of Sparta." And he's like, "Oh man, I should have been born somewhere else." Everyone's laughing at him.

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Heraclitus of Ephesius. He lived from 535 to 475 BC. He was a philosopher.

182
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 He was one of those guys who just kind of walked around and goes, "Is an umbrella really an umbrella?" If it has a hole in it.

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And everyone goes, "What's an umbrella?" He's like, "Just wait till those are invented." I just blew your mind.

184
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 He walks around doing stuff like that. He actually hated people. He hated democracy. This is actually very timely.

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 He hated democracy. He hated mobs of people. He was a misanthrope.

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So it should have surprised you that he was a hermit. But he had some good sayns, because this is what philosophers are remembered for.

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Here's some of his sayns. Here's some of his sayns. We're going to sit down in front of Heraclitus of Ephesius.

188
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And he's like, "Okay, there's not a lot of you, so that's not a mob." Do you guys like voting? And we're like shaking our head.

189
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 He's like, "Perfect. Here's some of my sayns." No man ever steps in the same river twice.

190
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Or it's not the same river. And he's not the same man.

191
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We're like, "Oh, that's pretty interesting." That's true. Every experience changes you in some way. I really like that one.

192
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Our envy always lasts longer than the happiness of those we envy.

193
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 We're like, "Is that a good thing? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?"

194
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 So us being jealous of that dude, yeah, I guess it is like, it shows that we're bad.

195
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Like, we're jealous of someone's success, but we'll take it to the grave.

196
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 That person may just have a peak of happiness. We may only see a glimpse of it.

197
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 But we'll always hate them. Very good. We're clapping.

198
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Clapping for him. He's like, "No, don't clap for me. I'm a philosopher. This is my job."

199
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 He says, "I love this one."

200
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The chain of wedlock is so heavy that it takes two to carry it.

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And sometimes three. See, you get a little side action.

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 You get a little sancia going on. And that is true. It's not good for your marriage.

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 But very funny. See, man has some good stuff going on.

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Anyways, the reason why I'm talking about this guy other than sharing those philosophical moments with you is because...

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So he got this thing called edema, which is like fluid under the skin.

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 One day he wakes up and he's like, "What am I going to philosophize about today? I'm doing another one about that river."

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 That was a hit.

208
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 He looks in his arm and he's all, "Bleep, bleep, bleep, bleep."

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And he's looking. He's seeing like little bubble appear on his arm.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 He's like, "That's not supposed to be there."

211
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And so he presses it and it moves under his skin.

212
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 "Bleep, bleep, bleep."

213
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And he has edema. So it's like he's getting pockets of pus popping out of his skin.

214
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And it's like Bull Jean, he's basically looking like some toxic Avenger dude walking around.

215
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 And no one wants to listen to a philosopher if they think at any given moment, a bunch of pus is going to shoot out from him.

216
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 They're like, "You might be wise. You might be the most sane man in this insane world, but I'm also afraid this horrible disease is going to explode out of you like getting hit by a car in Robocop."

217
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 So he goes, "Yeah, I probably should take care of this."

218
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He figures your stuff in my skin and he to draw it out.

219
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Okay, so how do I draw it out? Well, heat draws out stuff, right?

220
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Because I once had a glass of water, once I invented glass and then put water in it.

221
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And then like, it all went away.

222
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 So he discovered evaporation and heat like removes things.

223
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So he decides to get a bunch of cow poop and he covers himself up in cow poop.

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And he figures that the cow poop, don't do this at home obviously.

225
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 First off, how did this guy have so much cow poop?

226
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 He was a wandering philosopher. He must have stolen it from someone.

227
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Or maybe he goes, "Hey, tell you what, you can eat 10 pounds of cow poop. I'll give you a life lesson."

228
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The guy's like, "Just take the 10 pounds of cow poop. You look disgusting. You look like you're going to explode at any moment."

229
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He covers himself up in cow poop. He actually starts to feel a little better.

230
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 The soothing heat of cow excrement will remove this poison from my body.

231
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 While I'm doing that, I'm going to take a nap.

232
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 There's nothing more comfortable than being buried under 10 pounds of cow poop.

233
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So he takes a nap. This world famous philosopher wakes up a couple hours later.

234
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The poop has hardened into clay.

235
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 He's like, "What? No, what? No, no, what?"

236
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And he can't move. His body's completely immobilized in this hard cask of cow poop.

237
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I don't know how weak this guy was right now because I think given what's about to happen, I could break out of a cow poop prison.

238
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I know people used to make houses out of clay and stuff like that.

239
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 I'm sure there was a liberal amount of cow poop in the clay. I'm just guessing.

240
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I'm just making that fact up. The point is, is that back then, if you wanted to break into someone's house, you would literally just break in.

241
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 You just kick the wall over and you're like, "Give me all your stuff."

242
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You don't get destroyed when you knock the wall over. This is not the most convenient way to go in.

243
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But you could break down houses. You just punch them a lot and stuff like that.

244
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 This guy, he's buried in a cow poop. He can't break out of the cow poop.

245
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And then, "Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

246
00:20:37,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And then, "Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

247
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And the wolves ate him. Wouldn't that be awful? Wouldn't that be absolutely terrifying? That should have been in Dunkirk. That's how the movie should have started off. It's like previously in Europe.

248
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And they show this guy like philosophizing. And then he comes himself into a cow poop pie. Dogs are eating him.

249
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And then it says 1942. People are like, "What? What does that have to do with anything?"

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And then when they see the guy die in oil, they're like, "Oh, 'cause they're a gnollin'. 'Cause they're gnollin' a genius."

251
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But, yeah. All of that. All of that story that I laid out. Just to tell you about a man who cooked himself into a cow poop pie.

252
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 He did leave the world with some great phrases, right? Some great words strung together to make sentences that we can look back on and go, "You're right. Everything always changes.

253
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It's never the same river. It's never the same man." It's kind of hard to take a life advice from a guy who cooked himself and then couldn't break out of his prison.

254
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 You could put me in a giant chicken-pop pie. I'm getting out of there. I might have a full stomach when I get out. But I'm getting out of a chicken-pop pie. This guy could not.

255
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 So let's leave behind Heraclitus of a fetious Herbert Fireup, that one, that only carbonar copter. We are headed out to the jungle.

256
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 We're gonna land in a clearing. There's a bunch of vines and stuff like that. Jungle trees. There's panthers, bow constructors. Stereotypical jungle.

257
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And we're walking through it. And I tell you this story. I go, "Guys, listen. When I was a kid, quicksand was the thing. Everyone knew what quicksand was.

258
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I think that was every kid's nightmare. They were gonna fall in a quicksand. It was in so many shows. And it's fine because as an adult, a couple years ago, I was thinking, "What happened to quicksand?"

259
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Like, quicksand used to be everywhere. There were video games based on quicksand. Well, there was one spitfall. But you know what I mean? Like, quicksand was everywhere.

260
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And I stumbled across this great article on Slate called "Terra and Fermat, the Rise and Fall of Quicksand" by Daniel Ingeburr. And he actually is able to lay it out. He says, "Yes.

261
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Quicksand used to be everywhere. At one point, 3% of all movies made. This was in the 1960s. 3% of all movies made featured a quicksand scene. But ever since then, it's been slowly sinking.

262
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 It's been slowly dropping off. I guess it's a better term, not sinking. And he goes, "It's interesting because he was pointing out lost doesn't have a quicksand scene.

263
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Prince of Persia's Sands of Time, which came out around the time, didn't have a quicksand scene. He actually asked the writers of Lost, "Hey, you know, like, quicksand is a thing. It's a real thing. How come you didn't have it in the show?"

264
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And they said, "That's too cheesy. Because it had been done so much. 3% of all movies in the 1960s having quicksand is a ton. Before that, from the 1900s to the 1950s, it was about, like, 0.5% of all movies. So still a lot.

265
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 3% just really got it. Cowboy movies would have it. Cowboy shows would have it. Cowboy country western concerts. They had a giant, instead of a mosh pit, they had a giant quicksand pit. Everyone's sinking inside of it.

266
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 You had it a lot. It's interesting because he hypothesized, "Why did it go away? Why did it go away?" And he broke it out like this. One, cheesy. It's been overdone.

267
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He says, "Too, this was interesting." Observation, he goes, "I think that there's less wild areas for kids to play in. And there's not sandboxes anymore."

268
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 So it's not like these little, like, 9-year-olds were in Hollywood making movies, but you would watch movies about quicksand and you could recreate those adventures in your day-to-day life if you were a kid.

269
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 You could go, "Oh, no. Look out. Indiana Jones is in the quicksand." You could just put your hat on the quicksand box and stuff like that and run away. That's the whole game. You win.

270
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 You gotta get your hat back, though. But that, of course, isn't the end of it because, like, everything in the world, somebody decided to sexualize quicksand.

271
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It kind of plays on the "vore" thing. "Vore" if you don't know if you're a sane individual. "Vore" is where you eat people. Like, you either get enjoyment out of swallow-- it's weird.

272
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It's not like ripping their bones up with your teeth. You swallow someone whole, or you get swallowed whole, and you get slowly digested.

273
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And there's tons of art. Don't look it up. There's a whole "vore" video game. Don't look that up either. It's super hard to actually try playing it.

274
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And it's funny because I wanted to, like, fight the monsters, but because it's made for people who like to get eaten, like, you walk out and a monster gets you, and then it shows an animation of you getting devoured.

275
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 This game had it come out like in 2008. It's not on Steam or anything like that. You try to fight them, and then you're like, "Ugh, like, the whole game is just you getting digested. It's pretty lame."

276
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Okay, unless you're in a way. But it's kind of a side thing of "vore." The idea is watching people, specifically women, as interesting.

277
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I wasn't able to find out whether or not there was a gay component to this fetish. But specifically women sinking into quicksand.

278
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 There's a magazine called Splosh, exclamation point magazine. They even have a section on the website for Splosh dating.

279
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It's in the show notes. If you're looking for someone, if you're looking for love for someone who likes to be dirty and in sync, there you go.

280
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 They even have movies. They had a clearance section. I was like, "Oh, maybe I'll buy a movie."

281
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Clearance section. They sell VHS tapes, man. Just throw those away. No one's going to buy that. Actually, now that I think about it, it's such a specific fetish that if that was the only way you could get your fetish with some VHS tapes, sure.

282
00:26:46,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They also sell photo CDs full of photos, which is straight out of 1997. When it took so long to download a photo of Sarah Michelle Geller, you can now, back then, you would buy a CD with nothing but photos of Sarah Michelle Geller.

283
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 None of them she was sinking in quicksand, but if you want to see her sinking in quicksand, I don't know, just take a picture of her, draw some quicksand on it.

284
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But they do have this thing. And then there's another website. It might be the same website. I don't remember, because it's been a long time since I've been there and I don't want to go back.

285
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 But it's called MPV for mud puddle visuals. Now, we have pushed the kids out of the room, pushed them into some quicksands at a hand-to-spark.

286
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 They actually have the typical, like, porn titles for a lot of these movies. We have Pie-Eyed Wives. I don't know what that has to do with quicksand.

287
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Maybe they tell them there's a pie at the bottom of it. They're so addicted to it, they jump in. That's the thing. People want to see them go in feet first.

288
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 They want to see them struggle. Struggle. Very bizarre fetish. Pie-Eyed Wives. You have Slime Suspect 2.

289
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Can't imagine what the first one is about, but Slime Suspect 2. Police Custardy.

290
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I'm thinking that this might actually be from a different part of the website, because these are all food-based puns.

291
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Maybe someone's thinking in quicksand and they're throwing pies at her. And then they have another one called Pretty Clumsy Woman.

292
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Ah, you thought I was going to say Pretty Woman. No, I guess she's, like, wandering into quicksand or something like that.

293
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 They're like, "Oh, Alice, you're so clumsy. You walked into the Brazilian rainforest all by yourself."

294
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Anyways, they also have, those are kind of cute, right? Slime Suspect 2. I would never watch them. I would never watch them, but Slime Suspect 2. Police Custardy.

295
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Then we have stuff like Nico Jordan loses her grip.

296
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 [laughs]

297
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 So I imagine she's, like, hanging on a branch. She's like, "Oh, no, oh, no." She falls in. The whole title of this is "Nicco Jordan Loses Her Grip.

298
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Masterbates Sinking in Pete Bog." She's like, "Oh, no, I lost my grip. I could try to get out. I do know that, though, that struggling in quicksand only makes it worse.

299
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Pete Bog's probably the same thing. How can I not struggle?" I don't know. I'm just going to masturbate. That's struggling, right?

300
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Because you're, like, moving around and stuff like that. Anyways, Bondage and the Hammer Swamp. They got dark real quick, right?

301
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 First it was like, "Oh, no, I got a pie in my face." Now it's like, there's no escape from Hammer Swamp. It's just a swamp made of hammers.

302
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 They have damsels in quicksand? Number 17. They've been putting this stuff out for a while.

303
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And have actually found, like, on the website. Again, don't go there. Again, don't go there.

304
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 But there's, like, sample videos. And they'll be like these women walking through the forest. They're edited up.

305
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Because they're not going to give you the full half hour of sinking. Goodness. They'll show, like, these three girls walking through the jungle and bikinis.

306
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And then they'll cut to, like, all three of them, like, knee deep in quicksand. And then they cut to them being like, "Ugh."

307
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And then they just cut to, like, a picture, like, a scene of quicksand. And then some of them are people, like, a sexy woman has a gun.

308
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And she's, like, walking to the quicksand. And the girls, they're like, "No, I don't want to walk into the quicksand."

309
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And they walk into the quicksand. And then it just ends with them sinking. They all end the same way.

310
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 There's no suspense. But I guess all pornography kind of ends the same way. There's never one where some guy's, like, in the middle of banging some chick.

311
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I got to go." Just leaves. And she just looks at the camera. I guess they all have a prescribed ending.

312
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And then I did find something really disturbing. Disturbing than everything else I've described so far.

313
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I did find something else disturbing. There's a section of it dedicated to Asian girls.

314
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Part of the video is that are dedicated to Asian girls. And it's real interesting, because it's almost like they know that's not the target market for the audience.

315
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 They actually include this phrase.

316
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Well, they are the women of the Philippines. And they sink in quicksand just like Western gals.

317
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 They're like, "Listen, you pervert. You racist perverts out there. We know you want to see the girl next door, that girl who turns you down when you ask her to the prom, Mary."

318
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Then you fell out of the high air balloon. And then you got bumped in the head and you got this sick fetish.

319
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 We know that you want to see her sink. However, we got a bunch of girls from the Philippines. They'll do it.

320
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 They'll do it for half the price. We can totally sink them. We don't have to bring out a location or build a swamp set and have quicksand.

321
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 There's a bunch of quicksand right over here in the Philippines.

322
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 I'm not going to say that some of this may end up actually being snuff.

323
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 But I also probably want to watch the videos. I didn't watch any of them.

324
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And again, I don't know if they're actually in the middle of Philippines shooting snuff videos and drowning these women.

325
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It doesn't appear to be. It looks like a lot of the footage is afterwards they're smiling and they're covered in quicksand.

326
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 But how much would someone have to pay you to walk into quicksand?

327
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And knowing a bunch of weirdos are going to masturbate thinking about it.

328
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 You could be like, "Oh, you pay me $500 to walk into quicksand."

329
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 "Oh, I know you added that second part. You have to be like a million bucks. Your image would be out there forever for people to pleasure themselves with."

330
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 So there we go. Let's do a quick recap.

331
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Don't take hot air balloon rides. Don't cover yourself in poop.

332
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Do see Dunkirk. I'm sure Chris Rennolan loves this ad for his movie.

333
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And if anyone ever asks you, "Hey, you know what would be really cool if we both walked out into the jungle?"

334
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 "I have a camera and you don't have anything? You're wearing a bikini."

335
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 You're like, "What? Where did I get this at?"

336
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And I'm going to film you walking into the quicksand.

337
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But it's just for me. It's just for me. I'm going to take it home first off, get new friends.

338
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 But secondly, you may want to look a little bit closer at quicksand websites,

339
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 because actually, no, I've been telling you not to. I was going to say, because you might end up on one.

340
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Obviously, you would know that. I really don't have any way to end this episode,

341
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 other than the fact that I'm actually feeling a lot better.

342
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So if you stuck around this long, Herbert left to the garbage doctor. He took off. He's gone.

343
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

344
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

345
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

346
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

347
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

348
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 He's gone. He's gone.

349
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

350
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 He's gone. He's gone. He's gone.

351
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 He's gone. He's gone.

352
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 He's gone. He's gone.

353
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:50,000
