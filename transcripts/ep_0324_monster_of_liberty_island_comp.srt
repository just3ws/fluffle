1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 A bizarre haunting that took place at one of America's greatest landmarks.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,400
 And then we take a look at an ongoing bizarre murder investigation.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,520
 One that police say can be solved if they can just weigh a dog.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,860
 [Music]

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,660
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,860
 I want to start the episode off very briefly by talking about this.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:46,360
 I have been for probably about the past two weeks thinking, "Gah, this show's not working."

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,360
 Dead Rabbit Radio has run its course. It's peaked. It's over.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,360
 What am I doing? I don't know why I'm even continuing to do this show.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 Am I only doing it because I don't have anything else to do?

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,360
 [Music]

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,860
 Those are all self-inflicted wounds.

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,860
 Those are all--

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,160
 Nobody has come to me and said, "Your show's over the hill."

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,960
 You peaked. Your best seasons were behind you.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,460
 You suck now. And you've sucked for a while. Nobody has told me that.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,460
 Now I do have haters. People do send me emails and talk about me online and talk about how much I suck.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,860
 And I don't care about those.

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,860
 And it's funny because if I start getting emails from people saying, "You know what, dude? Your show sucks.

23
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
 It used to be really good, but now you totally suck."

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,860
 That would actually be like, "Dude, F you, dude. My show's awesome."

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,860
 Like, if someone else was pushing on me and telling me that I sucked, I would fight harder.

26
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,860
 But when you're telling yourself, "Yeah, it's just not working anymore. What are you doing?"

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,860
 And I talk a lot about visualization and high-presigils and stuff like that.

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,360
 You have to get out of that mindset. I have to get out of that mindset.

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 I mean, I really put off recording today's episode. I was just...

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 Now, I'm not feeling good. I'm a little sick. I have a pretty bad heel injury.

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
 I'm still withdrawn from the nicotine.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,360
 So those are all factors as well. And I'm tired. I'm just tired. I've been really busy lately.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,360
 But I have to push through all that stuff. You've got to break out of that mindset.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,360
 I've got to break out of that mindset. You've got to break out of that mindset if you're facing that as well.

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,360
 So, some words of inspiration from Jason today, the Rebor Radio.

36
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,360
 I got some new... Again, I'm getting new Patreons. The show can't be that bad, right?

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,360
 And I have to acknowledge there will be episodes that I think are stronger than other episodes, of course.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 And there will be story segments that are stronger than other story segments.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,360
 But at the end of the day, I do enjoy doing the show. I think a lot of people enjoy listening to it.

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,360
 It's when I start thinking that nobody likes it and that I'm just kind of wasting my time and everyone else's time.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 That type of stuff drags you down. So you can't think like that.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 And I'll look back on this... I'll totally forget about this. Six months from now, I'll totally forget about this.

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 I'll be listening back to this episode and I'll be like, "Oh, yeah, I do remember I was going through some stuff back then."

44
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 Because I've done that before. I've listened to other episodes where I can hear my voice as hoarse.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
 Or I can hear I'm a little depressed and I was like, "When did I record that episode?"

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 "Oh, yeah, I recorded that last December." "Oh, yeah, that was when that happened." "Yeah, I wasn't feeling that good."

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
 So I'll totally forget about this little bump in the road and keep on going.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,360
 And then six months from now, I'll listen to this episode and be like, "Oh, yeah, dude. That was stupid."

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,360
 That was stupid that you really doubted yourself and you spent five minutes talking to people about it.

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:41,360
 But again, this isn't just about me. It's about you. If you find yourself doubting yourself, we are responsible for inflicting the deepest wounds on ourselves.

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,360
 If you have a project that you love, just keep doing it. Just keep going.

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,360
 You can reevaluate it. You can approach it from a different angle.

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,360
 But don't give up just because you're hitting some speed bumps or you're feeling doubts or just feeling down or anything like that.

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,360
 Keep going. Let's talk about our Patreons for this episode. We've got two new Patreons and we've got Ivana.

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,360
 I'm sure this is some sort of pun. I'm sure this is some sort of pun.

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:12,360
 I know this isn't this person's real name because they told me the real name, but Ivana Kukkakovov.

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:22,360
 I was pronouncing it and I was like, "I'm sure it's like I want to blank, but I don't know. Ivana Kukkakov."

58
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 And then we have Burnt Toast Ghost. Actually, Burnt Toast Ghost is developing their own webcomic.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,360
 Burnt Toast Ghost and you can go to follow him on Twitter at @BeToastGhost.

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,360
 So check that and again, you know, have those projects. Maybe it's not art. Maybe it's fitness. Maybe it's anything.

61
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 But have those projects and keep plugging away at it. Keep plugging away at it.

62
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,360
 If you listen to the early episodes of this podcast, they suck. They're terrible. They're absolutely terrible.

63
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,360
 And I could have quit then, but I kept going. So if you're doing... I'm not saying his comics suck.

64
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 I'm just saying is when you guys are doing something, keep doing it. Keep doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it.

65
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,360
 And eventually, I believe you will be where you're at. But you also want to have that visualization thing as well.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,360
 And if I'm sitting here all depressed about my podcast, it's not going to help the podcast overall.

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,360
 I could be putting out the best episodes ever, but if I think the show sucks, I'm putting out into the universe, the show sucks.

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,360
 Not going to attract new listeners. You have to put out the best content and have the best world view about your content possible.

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,360
 It's the only way you're going to succeed. But thank you, Ivana, and thank you, Burnt, for supporting the Patreon.

70
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,360
 They're also both in the Minecraft server now, so that's pretty dope. They're not like Tron. They're not like teleported into it, as far as I know.

71
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,360
 But they're having fun in the Minecraft server. So if you can't support the Patreon, just get the word out about the show.

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:55,360
 It really, really helps a lot. Let's go ahead and get started now. Now, our first story, we're going to go to a little tiny island out in New York.

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,360
 So let's hop into Dead Rabbit Robot. We've been using this a lot. You're rowing. You're rowing. I'm just sitting there looking out of the water and I'm thinking,

74
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,360
 "Why am I rowing this boat?" What's the point of rowing this boat? And you're like, "Hit me with the paddle."

75
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 You're like, "Dude, snap out of it. Snap out of it." You have a bunch of content to produce. And I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right."

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,360
 And we're going to go to this little island in the middle of New York. We're back, not in the middle of New York, in the middle of the New York Harbor.

77
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:30,360
 This place is called Bedelos Island. And we're in the year 1892. So we're going to put on our old-timey clothes, little hats.

78
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 I was going to say the little tricorner hats, but I'm pretty sure that was revolutionary war. So anyways, we're in hat.

79
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 It doesn't matter. Cowboy hat. I have a cowboy hat on. You have a baseball cap on. Baseball hasn't even been invented yet.

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:50,360
 We're near 1892. We're on Bedelos Island. And at the time, there was an army fort barracks on the island.

81
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,360
 So we're like walking around. And, "Oh, dude, why are we dressed like this? We need dressed like uniforms."

82
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,360
 So we're going to put on some uniforms, throw away the cowboy hat and the baseball cap, patten that first, patten that, and then we'll be millionaire.

83
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,360
 Oh, you'll be. Dang it. You're the one who had the baseball cap. You're a millionaire now in the future.

84
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,360
 So we're walking around the army barracks, right? And we're like, they're like, "Do this, you maggots. Get over here."

85
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,360
 Maggots hadn't been invented yet, though. So they'd be like, "Do this, scarecrow." That was the insult back then.

86
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,360
 And all the military people were walking around in the drill sergeant. I should have said there was a drill sergeant saying that.

87
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,360
 And not just some random guy, the plumber is like, "Go shoot stuff in the army."

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,360
 And they're like, "The drill sergeant is yelling at everyone. He's yelling at us. Drop and give us 20, you scarecrow."

89
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 "Do 120." I don't think I've done 20 push-ups in my life.

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 It's total. Like, I can do the girl push-ups. And honestly, I don't think they're called that anymore.

91
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 You know the push-ups where you're on your knees? When I went to school, they were called girl push-ups.

92
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 I'm sure there's some more politically correct explanation for them now.

93
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,360
 I still call them girl push-ups, and every so often someone will give me a bit of a side-eye. They'll be like, "What?"

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 I also learned that sitting cross-legged is no longer called Indian style. It's called like John Davis.

95
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:21,360
 John Davis is actually the lead singer of Korn. I don't think it's called Jonathan Davis style.

96
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,360
 But apparently they're like John Henry when you sit cross-legged. I always heard it was Indian style when I was a kid.

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 And you do girl push-ups. The P.E. teacher would be like, "If you can't do a push-up, just do a girl push-up."

98
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,360
 And I'd be like, "Okay." And the girls would do girl push-ups.

99
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 Anyways, I've never done 20 push-ups outside of girl push-ups my entire life.

100
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
 I'm sure they're now called knee lifts or something like that. Actually, that's a different exercise.

101
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,360
 The point, the drill sergeant's like, "Just give me 20 push-ups." I'm like, "Fine."

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
 And it's just, while we are on this island, we meet two soldiers.

103
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,360
 One is named...we only have the last names of these guys. We have Gibbs and Carpenter, oddly enough.

104
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,360
 Now, if your last name is Gibbs, my last name is Carpenter. If you as a listener is the last name is Gibbs,

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,360
 this is a really weird episode for you and me. We only have their last names. There's a dude named Carpenter and there's a dude named Gibbs.

106
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,360
 So we meet them and I'm gonna shake Carpenter's hand and then it's like time cop.

107
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,360
 There's like this weird portal opening. Now we're back in the year 1701.

108
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,360
 And we're like, "Well, where are we?" That was a weird narrative device, but anyways, now we're in London at 1701

109
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,360
 and Captain Kid, a pirate, is executed for his crimes.

110
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,360
 Now, he was one of those dudes that they hung...well, they hung the rope broke and then they had to hang him again

111
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
 and then they give it to them or they put him in the cage.

112
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,360
 So his body was like in a...his dead body was in like a cage and it sat there

113
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,360
 and they put it out like on the harbor for like years to let people know this is what happens when you're a pirate.

114
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 Which actually is quite humane because sometimes they would just put you in the cage and they just leave you there

115
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,360
 and then you would just die of dehydration. You'd be like, "Help me guys."

116
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
 And people were like, "Sitting underneath you eating apples, drinking apple juice."

117
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
 But I don't think they did that.

118
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,360
 I was reading about this execution method, which to me, I almost died once

119
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,360
 because my throat swelled up and I couldn't get any liquid in me.

120
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,360
 And I was super poor and I didn't have insurance, so I was just like,

121
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
 "Well, I'm just gonna like get better eventually, right?"

122
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,360
 And I almost died. I went three days with all I drank was one coffee mug full of water

123
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
 over the course of three days.

124
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 And they had to take me to the hot ER and they pumped me full of all these fluids in it.

125
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,360
 But it's horrible.

126
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 Like, I could feel my body. I could feel myself dying.

127
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,360
 Not like the first day. I wasn't like, "Man, I sure am parked. Where's the Gatorade?"

128
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,360
 Oh no! By the 72nd hour, I was like, "This is it."

129
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 It's a dehydr, like not being able to drink stuff. It's a horrible, horrible way to go.

130
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
 But where was I going with that?

131
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 Oh yeah, so that would be a horrible way to go. Would be to be trapped in a cage.

132
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,360
 But I was reading, you know, they did this a lot. They would basically just like trap people.

133
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,360
 I guess one of the things they did was they took this dude, and this was in the Middle East or something,

134
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 they wrapped him in cow skin, and then when it dries, it squishes him.

135
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,360
 Which I don't believe. How much can... If somebody would like threw a bunch of...

136
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,360
 Okay, if somebody threw a bunch of like cow leather on me, first off, I'd look pretty snazzy.

137
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,360
 I'd have a new leather outfit. Secondly, I would eat that. I would just eat my way out.

138
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,360
 They're like, I gain weight. They're like, "What? You're supposed to starve to death."

139
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 I'm like, "Eat my way out." But anyways, I don't think you could dry quick enough.

140
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
 For one, two, it's an edible prison, so that doesn't work.

141
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,360
 But three, they wrapped this dude up in this leather, and it was going to dry, and he was going to be stuck in it,

142
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 and then get squished or die. But they also, on this, they turned the cow skin inside out.

143
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,360
 Like, I don't believe a lot of these old torture methods. I think they're made up.

144
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,360
 They... I'll have to put the link in the show notes. They took a cow skin, they turned it inside out,

145
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,360
 and they put the horns... It was a bowl, basically. I think cows have horns, too. It doesn't matter.

146
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,360
 They took the bovine's horns, so they turned the skin inside out.

147
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,360
 They put the bovine horns to touch against his ears, and then they sewed him shut.

148
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 So as it dried, the horns would slowly pierce his brain, and he would die.

149
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 I don't believe that at all. I don't believe that happened at all.

150
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 I think that was someone... I think people wanted to write, like, "saw," and they go,

151
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,360
 "Oh, yeah, let's come up with some awesome, like, fake tort." That's so ridiculous.

152
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 Because as it was drying, the horns would just push through the leather.

153
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 It's not going to be like... Think about it. The horns have two paths of resistance.

154
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,360
 One is decaying flesh, and the other one is human bone. It's skull.

155
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 So the horns, if you put a horn on the ground, and then put meat on top of it,

156
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 or, like, dried skin on top of it, and it got... It wouldn't go through the concrete.

157
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
 It would not go through the dudes. You could be like, "Well, Jason, it's going through."

158
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 It would go slightly in your ear. You'd be like, "Ow! It's not going to impale your brain.

159
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,360
 It's totally made up. Anyways, none of that stuff. Okay, let's give... Captain Kid dies.

160
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
 That's where we were at. That's where we were talking about. Captain Kid.

161
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 Captain Kid dies. He gets put in the cage.

162
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:36,360
 Now, he buried, supposedly buried, a treasure chest on Bedelow's Island.

163
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 So we're back on Bedelow's Island, and Carvener's like, "Dude, where'd you go?

164
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,360
 There was just this big blob, and then you and this other dude got sucked in."

165
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,360
 And I was like, "Yeah, it was weird. We talked about people getting tortured for a while.

166
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
 Let's go for a walk." And Carvener and Gibbs are like, "Uh-oh."

167
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,360
 Carvener and Gibbs, so apparently this isn't the story. They sneak away from us,

168
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 so now we're in the bushes watching them.

169
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
 They find out a rumor that Captain Kid buried a treasure on Bedelow's Island.

170
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,360
 And so they think they know where it's at. These guys straight up goonie it.

171
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,360
 They wait till everyone falls asleep at the barracks.

172
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,360
 The drill sergeant's like, "Scarecrow. Scarecrow."

173
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:29,360
 He's like insulting people in his sleep, and Gibbs and Carvener, they tiptoe out of the building.

174
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
 They get to this location, and they start digging up this treasure chest.

175
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 And then everyone in the barracks is awakened with a loud scream.

176
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:45,360
 And then everyone's like, "What's going on? Raise the alarm."

177
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,360
 They're like, "No, that's the cat alarm. Raise the real alarm."

178
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
 Still kind of sounds like a cat, but whatever.

179
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,360
 Everyone's grabbing their old-timey guns, and they're like, "What's going on? What's going on?"

180
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,360
 Now Carvener is running away from whatever, and he's like, "Oh my god, oh my god, something terrible just happened."

181
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
 And they're like, "What's going on?" And he's like, "Okay, let me tell you."

182
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
 He calls down, he sits down, and he goes, "This is what happened."

183
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,360
 He goes, "So, me and Gibbs found out that Captain Kibben might have buried a treasure on this island."

184
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,360
 And we dig it up, made shovel noises, but with actual shovels, and we found a treasure chest and a human skull.

185
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 And everyone's like, "You found the treasure?" And he's like, "Let me finish, let me finish."

186
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
 We found a treasure chest and a human skull.

187
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:39,360
 And then a demon showed up, like a real 100% what you think a demon would look like demon.

188
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:50,360
 Big black wings, dark leathery skin, horns, barbed tail, just *grunt* big monster just pops up out of nowhere.

189
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 So I ran away, and they go, "Well, where's Gibbs?" Carvener's like, "I don't know. I just ran. I just took off."

190
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 So at this point, the soldiers *grunt* start marching over to where Carvener's like, "The treasure's over there. The treasure is over there. I'm staying here."

191
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,360
 They go over there. Now, there's two versions of the story.

192
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,360
 The one version is they get over there and Gibbs is laying unconscious on the ground and there's an empty hole.

193
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,360
 And they're like, "What's- Wake up, sir! Wake up! Wait, no, you're probably a private. Wake up, maggot!"

194
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,360
 They haven't been invented yet. "Wake up, you scarecrow!" They're slapping him. He's like, "Uh-uh."

195
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 He gets up and he's like, "Oh, you won't believe what happened in there. Like, let me guess, you dug up Captain Kid's treasure."

196
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
 Demon showed up. He's like, "That's a great guess."

197
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,360
 And then I got knocked unconscious and the hole's empty.

198
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
 Now, we look in there. There's no treasure chest. There's no human skull. It's gone.

199
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 Now, there's another version of the story that Carvener ran away and Gibbs got hit by the demon and flew into the bay.

200
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,360
 Now, I can tell you almost for sure that that version is 100% made up.

201
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,360
 If any of this story is true, that part isn't.

202
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 I think it's possible that he woke up. Like, he was sitting there and the demon like, "Slap!"

203
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 Slap him and he falls down. But the idea of him getting thrown, just the force of getting hit by something to make you travel more than a foot would most likely kill you.

204
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 Like, you can get slapped and knocked down or punched and knocked down, but if you get punched with enough force, I mean, unless they were digging it up and then 30 inches away was the bay,

205
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 that is 100% not true. He would have been killed on impact from both the blow that would send him flying out more than, again, a foot or two.

206
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 And then the impact on the water and then, you know, obviously the water drowning and all that stuff.

207
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,360
 But anyway, so that version is most likely not true at all.

208
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,360
 But anyway, so the story is that they did find this treasure, demon showed up, carpenter took off, like a hero, he went to go get help, he wasn't cowardly, he wasn't running away.

209
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,360
 And then Gibbs got knocked down, treasure is gone.

210
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:10,360
 Betelow Island eventually was renamed because it was a military base to begin with, but then a woman moved in.

211
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:19,360
 A woman named Lady Liberty. The statue of, that was a weird transition, but anyways, Betelow Island is now Liberty Island.

212
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 So it's where the statue of Liberty is in New York, which I've actually heard isn't that big.

213
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 Like, you think it's huge because you see it in movies, but then when you go out there you're like, "It's okay."

214
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,360
 I would like to see it, but anyways, so that's where the statue of Liberty is now.

215
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:41,360
 Now what's interesting about this story is it was, I stumbled across it when I was researching the San Francisco ghost boats about a week ago.

216
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,360
 Because I was looking, there are stuff that's coming up about haunted US monuments and this story popped up.

217
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,360
 I bookmarked it and I went back very, very hard to find details on this story.

218
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,360
 It took me much longer than I thought it would.

219
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:05,360
 It's really interesting because all the sources say that this story was reported in an issue of the 1892 New York Times, which I was not able to verify.

220
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,360
 I attempted to and I was like, "I can't go through every issue of the 1892 New York Times."

221
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:20,360
 If they had given me a month, maybe, definitely if they had given me a week I could have looked through seven issues, but I couldn't look through, you know, 365 issues for the story.

222
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:29,360
 So I wasn't able to confirm that. It's just a weird little story that takes place at a national monument that nobody really knows about.

223
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,360
 I kind of expected it to be a little more popular because I just stumbled across it.

224
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 But so that's the story. The story is generally known as the monster of Liberty Island.

225
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 Do I think it's true? I think it's awesome. I definitely think that it's awesome and it has a lot of that stuff like cursed treasures.

226
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:54,360
 There's always that thing that when pirates bury their treasures or bandits would hide treasures or mines, cursed mines, there'd be some sort of guardian spirit blocking it.

227
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 So it has that element to it. I find that fascinating.

228
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,360
 True story? Who knows?

229
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 But before you start digging at the feet of Lady Liberty, just remember that it's probably against the law.

230
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,360
 It's probably against the law to bring a shovel to Ellis Island and be digging there.

231
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 Yeah, so don't do that. Don't bring shovels to Ellis Island. Probably a bad idea.

232
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,360
 Might get in trouble. So let's go ahead though and move on to our next story.

233
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 Now I'm going to tell you this right now. Our next story is a weird one. It's actually very, very short.

234
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,360
 It's very, very short. And to be honest, it's kind of been disturbing me.

235
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:38,360
 I came across it maybe about two weeks ago. And yeah, it's maybe more than that. Maybe three weeks ago. It doesn't matter. It has no bearing on the story.

236
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,360
 It's kind of a weird one. It's kind of disturbing. And it's an ongoing investigation.

237
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 So you can skip out now. There's going to be some disturbing imagery on this one.

238
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,360
 Not demons popping out of treasure chests. There's real people who are going through this.

239
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:01,360
 I'll see you guys tomorrow. If you decide to stick around for this true crime story, just know it's kind of dark. Kind of dark.

240
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,360
 So we're going to Albany Township, Pennsylvania. We're just going to walk and you're like, Jason, does this have to be even more depressing?

241
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 And I'm like, it's just, it's good exercise. Let's just get there. It's September 23, 2019. There's a little house in Albany Township.

242
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 And there's a mom. So you can kind of figure out where this is going named Lisa Snyder. And she's walking around her house and she goes into her basement.

243
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:32,360
 Now in her basement, there is like that giant basement support beam that kind of runs the length of the basement on the ceiling.

244
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 And she starts walking into the basement and there's that beam there. And there is a dog leash wrapped around the support beam of the basement ceiling.

245
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 So it's wrapped around the middle and then the two strands are coming off two opposite sides of the beam.

246
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 So basically if you took a jump rope and or rope, I don't know why is the jump rope wrapped it around that and you have the two sides just kind of hanging there.

247
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 That was what it looked like. She's walking on the stairs. She sees the dog leash, this long dog leash wrapped around like that.

248
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:16,360
 And then attached to the dog leash on both sides are the unconscious bodies of her eight year old son Connor and her four year old daughter, Brinley, hanging.

249
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:26,360
 And there are two tipped over dining room chairs on the ground and her children are just hanging there.

250
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 So she calls 911, they come out and they're still alive. But four days later, they both end up dying within minutes of each other.

251
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 Now, that's almost something that it would be walking into a house and seeing a hanging body would be really rough, obviously, or a gunshot victim or something like that.

252
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:57,360
 But walking in and seeing two and then add to the fact that they're children and then add to the fact that it looks like a suicide.

253
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
 An eight year old and a four year old hung themselves.

254
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 Now, the police are obviously very, very concerned about what went on.

255
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 Again, this is September 23, 2019, so not even a month ago or just a little over a month ago.

256
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:26,360
 She says, the mother says, listen, Connor was getting bullied, he was getting bullied at school, and he had made comments about killing himself, but he didn't want to do it alone.

257
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 Now, supposedly she said that in the 911 call to the operator.

258
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 Now, what's interesting was when this first happened, the police gave very little information about what's going on.

259
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 They just said these two bodies were found in this house and they were looking for the dog. I'll get to that in a second.

260
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,360
 And now more information is coming out, which makes me think they're starting to kind of figure out what happened.

261
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,360
 But she said they just recently released the 911 call. The mom says he was being bullied, but he didn't want to go alone.

262
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,360
 The kids were currently being not investigated, but assisted by Child Protective Services.

263
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 That's not the exact name in Pennsylvania for it, but Child Protective Services is a state program to help to find out if kids are being abused or living in dirty environments

264
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:26,360
 or suffering any sort of issues, but nobody is saying why they were being visited by CPS.

265
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,360
 Was it a routine thing? Was it something that happened years ago? Was it an ongoing issue? Nobody knows.

266
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,360
 Well, people know, they're just not revealing it to us.

267
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
 They took his Xbox, they took Conn- 'cause that's kind of what the cops were figuring.

268
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,360
 They're like, let's figure out who Connor was talking to. So they take his Xbox, they take all of his electronics.

269
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:54,360
 They end up visiting the house five separate times, each time with a new warrant, each time getting new devices, or looking for new evidence.

270
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:01,360
 The last piece of evidence they got, and this was what was just announced a couple days ago, is that it turns out the mom had three cell phones.

271
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:09,360
 They found that very suspicious. They said the phone that she used to dial 911 was not the phone she initially turned over to investigators.

272
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 They thought that was weird as well.

273
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,360
 And they're considering this criminal homicide. So you go, oh, it's a murder investigation.

274
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,360
 Well, these are the different options.

275
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,360
 One, Connor, it was a murder suicide. Connor hung himself and his four-year-old sister.

276
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 The other one is that a family member killed them to make it look like a suicide, or it was a dare, or let's play a funny game, you know, and they tricked them into committing suicide, or it was an outsider.

277
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
 Those are basically your three options.

278
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 Murder, suicide, murder, family member, murder, stranger.

279
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,360
 But the cops aren't being really, really cagey on this right now.

280
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,360
 And so, like I said, I think this is one of the most interesting facts to this story.

281
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 It's slowly getting more press. When it came out, it was just kind of a weird event.

282
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,360
 I found it, and now more and more people are reporting on it.

283
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:16,360
 But when I first came across it, the story was police are looking for a dog to help solve murder or suicide, or suicide events, however they put it.

284
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,360
 And so the cops are looking for the family dog.

285
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
 The cops are looking for the family dog.

286
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 And you go, why? Why are the cops looking for the family dog?

287
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 They released the statement. They said, "By determining the dog's actual weight and size, utilizing a scale,

288
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,360
 we'll assist in the criminal investigation."

289
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
 So they want the family dog.

290
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 And it's funny because this story's been kind of sticking with me, like I said for a while now.

291
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,360
 One, the visual of just the two children.

292
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 If they killed themselves, it's absolutely tragic.

293
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,360
 Although I don't see if they were hung in separate locations.

294
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,360
 I could see the eight-year-old killing the four-year-old and then hanging himself.

295
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,360
 But it would be really hard to wrap the dog leash around the support beam, wrap it around the girl's neck,

296
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,360
 wrap it around your neck, and then even if you jumped off to make her fall off the chair or her not second guess it,

297
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,360
 I mean, he could have talked her into it.

298
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,360
 I mean, come on, dude, four.

299
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,360
 But anyways, I can't even fathom that.

300
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
 This story's really bugged me.

301
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,360
 And I don't like to share my buggy-ness, like my...

302
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,360
 I don't want to use the word "grief," but my just like...

303
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,360
 There's a lot of stories I don't cover on this show.

304
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,360
 Like, I've found some really disturbing true crime stuff.

305
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
 And then I just kind of let it...

306
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,360
 Every so often I'm like, "Oh, why did I read that?"

307
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 Like, really disturbing stuff.

308
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,360
 And... But this one, I was just like,

309
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,360
 "This one is disturbing as it is."

310
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,360
 And maybe you're like, "No, wait, man, I watch Rotten.com."

311
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
 And that's fine.

312
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,360
 As disturbing as this one is, it's an ongoing investigation.

313
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,360
 And I think that it is a...

314
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
 It's interesting on that level.

315
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
 This could become... This could really turn out to be anything.

316
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,360
 But anyways, the cops said, "We want to find the dog."

317
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,360
 And I couldn't figure out why weighing the dog would be a factor at all.

318
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,360
 I was really kind of puzzled about that for a couple days.

319
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
 And then I think I figured it out.

320
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,360
 They want to know if the dog is a big dog,

321
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,360
 then it would need a big leash, a big, long leash,

322
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 and it would be enough to support the weight of an eight-year-old and a four-year-old.

323
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
 If it was a tiny little schnauzer,

324
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
 then someone must have bought this leash or brought it with them.

325
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,360
 So you go, "Okay, fine, dude. Get the dog. Weigh it."

326
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
 Figure this out.

327
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
 Can't be that hard.

328
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,360
 And this is where I think the biggest clue to the suspect is.

329
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 The mom goes, "I gave the dog away."

330
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
 I gave the dog away to somebody.

331
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 I don't have the dog anymore.

332
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,360
 Now, it's not being revealed to us whether or not she gave the dog away before or after this happened.

333
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,360
 It's not being revealed to us whether or not she's telling the police who she gave the dog away to,

334
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,360
 or if she's just like, "Oh, I just gave it away. I don't even remember who it was."

335
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 But that's where we're at in this investigation right now.

336
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,360
 The cops are looking for a dog so they can put it on a scale to find out

337
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,360
 if the leash that was used to kill two children was the same leash to take care of the family dog.

338
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,360
 And you have a mother who's saying, "Eh, I don't have it. I don't have the dog."

339
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,360
 Imagine being the police involved in this investigation.

340
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,360
 Because not only do you have to try to figure out what happened to these two children,

341
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
 eight years old and four years old.

342
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
 Connor would have been nine, I believe, this month.

343
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,360
 You're trying to figure this out.

344
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,360
 And there's no good option.

345
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,360
 One is an eight-year-old boy killed himself and killed his sister.

346
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,360
 And then the other one is that some stranger broke into the house.

347
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,360
 They were talking on Xbox and a guy came over, or woman, let's not be sexist, women can murder people too.

348
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,360
 Somebody comes over and murders these two children and then disappears back into the community.

349
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:20,360
 And then you have the mother or family member, supposedly a trusted individual in that own little community that we call family,

350
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,360
 murder these children and is now actively trying to stymie the investigation.

351
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:36,360
 A true mystery, a true murder mystery, that starts off with a disturbing visual and equally disturbing victims.

352
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 And the truth of the matter is, there is probably a 50/50 chance, we will never know.

353
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,360
 If someone in the family did it, they're gonna get arrested probably within the next six months to a year, it's gonna be over.

354
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,360
 But if it was a murder suicide, there will always be rumors that that's not true.

355
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:03,360
 There will always be rumors like, "No, somebody snuck into that house and did that," or a family member did that.

356
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:16,360
 But if they rule out the family and they rule out the murder suicide, that means that someone is out there who could commit such a horrible act and just walk away.

357
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:32,360
 But the idea of that lunatic being out there, honestly to me is less disturbing than the idea of an eight-year-old boy being so depressed and so afraid of dying alone.

358
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,360
 That he takes his four-year-old sister with him.

359
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,360
 Disturbing story.

360
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,360
