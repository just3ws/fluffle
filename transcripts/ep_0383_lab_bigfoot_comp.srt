1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 A doctor promises young women thousands of dollars to take part in an experiment,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,480
 but it turns out it wasn't an experiment. Can you imagine living in a world where the amount

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,080
 of hair on your head determines whether or not you live or die? That's a reality for men

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,120
 in the country of Mozambique today. And finally we take a look at one of the most bizarre

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:33,440
 workplaces possible. Livermore Laboratory, cutting edge technology, nuclear weapon development,

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,120
 black box projects. But all of that stuff is mundane, because apparently

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,920
 Bigfoot used to work there as well, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I got a

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,560
 lot, a couple little stories that I was like, let's get some of these little news guys going.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,200
 So we're gonna take a trip around the world. We're gonna, let's take the rabbit row boat.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,440
 We're gonna get them pecs working, get them back muscles working. We're both taking an ore.

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,680
 We're leaving the west coast of the United States, the best coast of the United States,

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,800
 and we're rowing all the way to Germany. I know it's a long trip. It'll give us time to talk.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,080
 And actually, since we have time to talk, over my break I saw the movie 1917. You know what? I

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,480
 gotta say this, short review. The movie's pretty basic. It's kind of has a plot,

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,640
 get from point A to point B. It's a lot like Mad Max Fury Road, just less dirt.

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,560
 But watching the movie, it felt like watching a fantasy film. It's really good. It's really good.

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,720
 I don't know if I'd say you gotta see it in the theater, or you have to see it right away.

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,400
 But to me it felt a lot like Never Ending Story or Lord of the Rings. It was more of that type

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,760
 of movie than a war movie. But yeah, check it out, 1917. Is it best picture material? I don't know.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,560
 Is it better than The Joker? I don't know. But let's leave behind, so we're done rowing. You're

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
 like, oh good. I thought you were gonna start talking about little women. I'm like, little women?

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,720
 That was the heartbreaking, fun-filled movie of the year. I know nothing about little women. I

25
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,160
 assume the movie ends with the father. I know a little bit about little women, okay? I have to

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,000
 at least admit that. Father's Off at Civil War, doing the Civil War thing. I'm assuming he's fighting

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,600
 for the North, because I'm assuming they're, you know, the movie isn't him coming back all defeated.

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,240
 And he's like, "Ugh, I had the worst day." There's a bunch of slave-free slaves running around in the

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,480
 background. The girls were like, "What's going on? Did we win the war?" He's like, "Uh-uh, no.

30
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,600
 This is not gonna be a good time for us. There's gonna be this huge thing called Reconstruction.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,480
 But anyway, so I'm assuming he was fighting for the North. I don't know. But I do know it takes

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,400
 place. He comes from the Civil War. I imagine there's a part where he comes home and goes,

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,000
 because he leaves and they have to like do all this work and stuff to like survive and, I don't

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,960
 know, assist the Underground Railroad or stop it, maybe? I don't know. They're like sneaking up behind

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,600
 Harriet Tubman. It's a shared universe. Little Women and the Harriet Tubman movie are both like

36
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,800
 they're building up to the shared universe, building up to the assassination of Lincoln.

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,200
 Anyways, I imagine he comes home and sees his young daughters and he goes, "When I left to go fight,

38
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,320
 to go fight the war of Northern aggression, you were but little girls. And now you are little women.

39
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,360
 And also we should move because you'll see S. Grant's troops start marching in." I'm assuming

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,960
 they're on the side of the North. But anyways, that's all for the movie review. You're like,

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,000
 "Jesus, that's not a movie review. You didn't even see the movie." 1917, watch it. Joker was pretty

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,760
 good. We've talked about that before. Let's get started with our first story. The boat,

43
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,080
 docks in Germany, these first two are really, really pretty short. We're going specifically to

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,360
 Bavaria. That's like a part of Germany, right? A province, a state, or a completely separate

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,600
 country? I don't know. We're in WÃ¼rzburg, Bavaria. Nowadays, it's happening right now. So hurry up and

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,520
 get off the boat. Story's happening right now. There's a dude there named David G. David G,

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,440
 he's 30 years old. He's a doctor. And he's working on this experiment and he needs test subjects.

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,560
 So he begins trolling the internet looking for young women, which is not a good, which is not

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,680
 something that you want your doctor to be doing. And you should be kind of suspicious of what type

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,360
 of experiment he's running. This guy, he goes, "I'm a doctor. He's on Skype. He contacted these women

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,880
 via Skype. They're wearing his lab coat." And he goes, "So how would you like to make $3,325?

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,160
 These women are like, "Yeah, sure. That's a lot of money." So I'm going to send you this device.

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
 You got to plug it in your wall. And then there's these two little wires you're going to attach to

54
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
 both of your temples. You got to do this while I'm watching you too, because I'm a doctor, right?

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
 I have to be able to test your response. And then once it's plugged into the wall and then a wire

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,640
 is attached to each temple, then you turn it on and I'm going to record your response. Now,

57
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,840
 this is one of those crimes where both people are equally dumb because, yes,

58
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,360
 I should guess this should jump to the finish. She was electrocuting these women, okay?

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
 He was shocking their brains. And he was eventually tracked down. He was arrested.

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,280
 He's charged with 13 cases of attempted murder, because it's possible that these people could

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,560
 have died by having electricity go through their brains. 13 cases of attempted murder. He does 11

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,200
 years. So basically, two of them don't even matter. They're like, "Oh, those two were extra stupid."

63
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,120
 But again, if someone sent you something in the mail, first off, they'd have to send me the money

64
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,680
 first. They go, "I'm going to send you a box. You've got to plug it in the wall. You've got to hook

65
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,520
 up to your brain. You turn it on and then I'll send you $3,325. I would say you've got to send

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,320
 me the money first, because there's no way I know if I'm going to survive this." But apparently,

67
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,280
 these people were stupid enough to go, or greedy enough, or both, to trust somebody sends them

68
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,800
 something over the internet that requires you to plug it into the wall and hook it up to you.

69
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,680
 Okay, now to be fair, I did famously tell that story on a past episode of Dead Rabbit Radio,

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:16,640
 where an anonymous company sent me a pill in the mail. Okay, so I guess I can't bash on these people

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,040
 too much. I don't remember what episode that was, but someone sent me a pill in the mail. It wasn't

72
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,560
 just me. They weren't targeting me. They sent him out to thousands of people. It was like,

73
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,800
 "This pill was like a mail virility pill. You take this pill and you'll last all night long."

74
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,760
 And I was like, "All night long? That's awesome. I'm not dating anyone right now. I'm just at

75
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,360
 home by myself, so I don't know what purpose it's going to serve." But gulp. And I took the pill.

76
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,080
 This true story. I took the pill as I was still reading the letter, and this took place shortly

77
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,120
 after 9/11. And afterwards, I thought, "This would be Alcadus' perfect plot." They just send pills

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,080
 out to all American men saying, "You want to be able to satisfy your woman?" "Golly! Of course I do!

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,760
 Who doesn't want to do that?" Gulp and then dying and everything like that. So, okay, maybe I can't

80
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,320
 be too hard on these women because I did swallow this pill. Now, this guy, the police believe he

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,240
 was doing it as a fetish that he liked watching women get electrocuted. Which to that, I would say,

82
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
 I guess he's never fessed up to that. That would be kind of embarrassing. He's like, "No, no,

83
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,400
 he's really running a steady now. Humanity's doomed unless we know how much electrical volts

84
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 a female brain can take." I think having a fetish would be kind of sucky anyways.

85
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,920
 Like, everyone has certain fetishes, like hair fetishes and stuff like that.

86
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,000
 But if your fetish is super specific and it's hard to get a hold of or hard to do, I feel bad for

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,800
 that. Like, what if your fetish is having sex on the moon? You're like, "Oh, you're constant looking

88
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,200
 up on the moon. You're like, some days you're like, steady in advanced trigonometry. Like, some day

89
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,080
 I'll be an astronaut." There was that big thing on the internet a while ago. This was probably like

90
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,360
 10 years ago. There was a weirdo, a pervert on YouTube who had a fetish for poop, like,

91
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
 falling into a toilet bowl. So, I can guarantee you at least two or three of you guys know who

92
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
 I'm talking about because it was a big thing. This is probably, yeah, it would have been back

93
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,240
 like in 2006, 2007. People were trolling this. He was blind and he loved the sound of poop falling

94
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,080
 into the toilet bowl. That was his fetish. And what a horrible fetish to have. One, what a

95
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,320
 okay, there's no, there's no qualifier to that. That's a horrible fetish to have. But then, to be

96
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,560
 blind and not being able to really enjoy it. And I mean, I remember reading all the stuff people

97
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,640
 were, they're trolling this guy. People were throwing fake stuff into a toilet bowl. These,

98
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,800
 these people were saying, "Oh yeah, dude, I'm totally into it too." Into a toilet bowl, right?

99
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,520
 And this blind guy, I don't, I should try to find the dude, but not, I'm not gonna find him in real

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,560
 life, not gonna store him. But anyways, this guy, he would request that young men, college-aged men,

101
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,600
 poop in a toilet and send him the audio of it. And these guys would be like, "Dude, let's, let's

102
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
 totally like trick this guy." So they'd be like, "Oh dude, I'm totally taking the biggest dump." And

103
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,960
 they'd be dropping stuff in the toilet. Not like Game Boys, but like stuff that would make a sound

104
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:14,080
 similar to poop hitting the toilet. Oh no, my Game Boy! And then I remember once the blind dude was like,

105
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,160
 "Ugh, I can totally, I can totally tell you're not pooping. The splash was too big. You're not

106
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,240
 trolling me, are you?" And they're like, "No, no." And a bunch of people were trolling this guy.

107
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,560
 And I remember it was reading about this. And eventually someone said, "Really guys,

108
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,720
 what's worse? The fact that this blind guy likes to hear college-aged men poop in a toilet or you

109
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:45,440
 for mocking him and for trolling this handicap dude, this guy can't see, into believing that people

110
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
 are pooping in toilets when really you're just throwing like, Play-Doh molded after pooping in

111
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:58,240
 the toilet." The way the story is, that would be awful. I'll see if I can find the info about

112
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,280
 that guy. I'll throw in the show notes if I do. But it'd be awful to have a fetish that would be

113
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,720
 really hard to pull off. Like electrocuting women or liking the sound of poop hitting the toilet,

114
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,600
 but being blind so you never know if it's legitimate human feces splashing in the water from a college

115
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,560
 age male or, you know, just someone tossing in, you know, frozen burritos. It would be the ultimate

116
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,120
 question. What is life? Why are we here? And what just hit the water in the toilet bowl?

117
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,840
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. The next story isn't so much a fetish, but it is.

118
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,000
 It's not a fetish at all actually. It's a bizarre belief. So the top back in the Deadrab

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,560
 Robo, we're leaving behind Bavaria. We're, our robo's now full of cinnamon rolls or pretzels,

120
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,320
 whatever they eat over there. Strudel. We're leaving behind Bavaria, the robo's full of goodies.

121
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,240
 We are headed to Mozambique, also currently taking place the year is 2020. So, and I know it's kind

122
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,480
 of landlocked. So we're really working out our pecs now. Ah, just get out of the boat. We'll just

123
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,680
 take the Jason Jalopy to Mozambique. We're driving through a town in Mozambique. I swear there's

124
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,480
 a bunch of women in town. Pretty cool town. A lot of women here. A bunch of kids are like, yeah,

125
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,760
 whatever. Kids are kind of lame. And then we notice we don't see a lot of men. We see a few of them,

126
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
 but the men we see tend to have a lot of hair or they're wearing baseball caps and they're hiding

127
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,000
 in the shadows. They run, what was that? What was that? Fred Durst. It was a guy running by with a

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,800
 baseball cap. That's weird. What's he doing out here? And it's just bizarre, right? I mean,

129
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,920
 I guess technically, pretty much any town. There's women, kids, people with hair and baseball caps.

130
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
 But anyways, in Mozambique, it's a little bit different. So we're walking through and we're

131
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,320
 like, we need to buy some Coca-Cola. So we walk up to like a convenience store. We walk in, hey,

132
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
 dude, we need to buy Coke. And the guy's like poking his head out. He's covering his head with

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 bag so we can only see his eyes and his mouth, everything but the top of his head. It's what

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,080
 I'm trying to say. He's wearing a baker's hat. He pops up and we're like, whoa. He's like, hey,

135
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,600
 yeah, you guys want to buy Coke? And we're like, yes. He goes, so what are you guys doing here,

136
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,520
 tourists? And we're like, yeah, yeah, we're here because we heard about this town. It's kind of

137
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,120
 weird. Actually, your whole country is quite odd right now. Everyone's running around baseball

138
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,280
 caps. And you apparently, you apparently are cosplaying as Chef Boyardee. He's like, I'll tell

139
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,160
 you a secret, but I hope you guys aren't here to do this. I hope it isn't a secret to you. And

140
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,280
 this is all new information. He removes his baker's hat, his chef's hat, whatever it is,

141
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:45,680
 the big poofy thing, and he's bald. And so he looks at us and he goes, you guys don't seem to be

142
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,520
 shocked by my bald head. That's very, very progressive of you in these troubling times. We're like,

143
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,480
 bald, you know, bald's pretty normal in most parts of the world. He goes, yes, yes, it is.

144
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,120
 But today in Mozambique, being bald can actually get you killed. Like, is there like a race thing?

145
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
 Like, do people hate bald people? Are they afraid? Like, if you look at a bald person,

146
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,440
 you'll become bald. He's like, no, no, no, no, that's foolish. You think we're a bunch of backward

147
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,440
 rubs? No, of course not. We're getting killed because people believe that bald people's heads

148
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,800
 are full of gold. And you crack their head open and you get a bunch of gold to come out of it.

149
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,280
 So this is a real thing that's going on. At this point, we're all making sure we're like,

150
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,960
 I guess you should have warned any of my listeners who are bald. I'm like, hey, let's go to Mozambique,

151
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,600
 listen to the story. You're like, okay, Jason, I trust you. And we're driving, we're driving around

152
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,200
 in the Jason Jalabi. No much people are chasing us with pitchforks. Apparently Mozambique, if you

153
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,200
 have a bald head, people are murdering you and cracking your head open to find gold. Now, this

154
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,920
 is one of those superstitions that I think would be easily disproven after the first time. You're

155
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,360
 like, oh, I heard from this dude that if I bash this guy's head open, gold will come out. Let's try it.

156
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,240
 No gold. Like that would be one that would be easily discouraged. You just show pictures. I mean,

157
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,000
 you wouldn't want to do this, but the police could just drive around town with pictures of bald

158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,520
 people with their heads bashed in and be like, look, no gold. Now, obviously you could say, well,

159
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,880
 maybe the police took the gold. The police are driving around in really fancy cars. Like, I'm

160
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,760
 telling you, there's no gold. Is there wearing these giant gold chains, gold rings? There's no

161
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,920
 gold in these bald people's heads. But that's what's happening. People are getting their heads

162
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,480
 bashed in. Anashio Dina, she's the spokesman for Mozambique's General Police Command, had these

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,360
 quotes. Our preliminary conclusion indicates that the phenomenon is due to cultural beliefs.

164
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
 We are currently investigating the case to find out more and to understand the dimension of the

165
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,760
 problem. The phenomenon can lead bald people to be pursued and killed. This is a serious homicide

166
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
 crime. That's actually part of the quote, just to remind everyone that you shouldn't be bashing

167
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,200
 in people's head. This is a serious homicide crime. So not just one of those lame homicide

168
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,000
 crimes that we don't investigate. Quote continues, our current interest is to catch and hold all

169
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,720
 those involved responsible. Now, some people are saying, to go back to my original thing about,

170
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,760
 isn't this stupid? It is stupid, but some people are saying if you crack a bald person, don't try

171
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,840
 this. Don't go, hmm, maybe in Mozambique it doesn't work, but in my country, in my, don't do this.

172
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,920
 Don't do this. If you are balding yourself and you're like, man, I really need to help pay

173
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,600
 for my student loans, hmm, you don't think, well, maybe if I just crack my head a little bit and

174
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
 get a little bit of that gold, don't do this. But anyways, some people believe you just,

175
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
 it's simple enough, you crack open a bald person's head, a bunch of gold comes out,

176
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,720
 and then other people say, oh, no, no, you foolish, of course not. You got to chop,

177
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,480
 you got to break open a bald person's head and then make like a potion and that will give you

178
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,160
 wealth. That's why the gold doesn't immediately come out and people are like, that makes more sense.

179
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,080
 But anyways, the result is, bald people are getting killed in Mozambique and it's not good over there.

180
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:04,720
 It is a serious homicide crime. Let's remind you guys of that. But we're going to leave behind Mozambique

181
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,120
 and now we're headed to Livermore, California. So we're leaving behind the Jason Jalopy,

182
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,240
 we're hopping aboard the Carpenter copter and we are flying out to Livermore Labs. Now Lawrence

183
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,880
 Livermore National Labs is what it's actually called. This place specialized and especially,

184
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,680
 I don't know what they do now, they do like lasers and stuff like that, but they used to do work for

185
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,080
 nukes. Back in the 60s, they were basically working on nuclear bombs, security systems,

186
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,000
 stuff like that, like high level national security stuff. But all that being said,

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,120
 that's the lame-o stuff, right? You laser beams and I mean, in a vacuum, lasers do,

188
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,920
 lasers work in a vacuum actually, scientifically speaking, don't they need? That's neither here

189
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,600
 nor there. The point is, is like in a metaphorical vacuum, lasers and nuclear bombs and secret

190
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,480
 lavatory, well it wasn't secret, it had an address, but what went on inside the building was secret.

191
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,960
 All this stuff is cool. But not for Dead Rabbit Radio, man. Get out of the way, you base that helped

192
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,360
 secure the United States during the Cold War. Move out of the way, lame-os. We don't want to

193
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,760
 hear about that stuff. We're going to put on, we should have Dead Rabbit Radio Letterman jackets

194
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,040
 and just like walk around with our leather sleeves and then the padded. Do that be dope?

195
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,120
 I'll look into that. I'll look into that for merch. Dead Rabbit Radio Letterman jackets were now

196
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,680
 officially a gang. We're just pushing over scientists and as we do that, we're going back to the year

197
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:40,160
 1960. Because apparently in the 1960s in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Bigfoot was there,

198
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:48,800
 we're like, what, what's that? We hear the sound, the familiar sound of Bigfoot, but we're used to

199
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,000
 hearing him in the woods, right? We did one episode where he was walking around military base, so

200
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,720
 we're prepared for this. Here, give me that. Got a stun gun, cock it. We're running through the

201
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,640
 laboratory. Get out of our way, nerds. They're like, oh, we're running in the same direction. We're

202
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,680
 helping you. We stopped to push them over. Then we keep running. Apparently, one day, Bigfoot

203
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:18,480
 wandered into Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. And because the building was so secure,

204
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:28,320
 he actually got locked into a cell down there, a little prison cell. Why a laboratory that works on

205
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,240
 nuclear testing has a jail in it? Save your questions for the end, gentlemen. And ladies,

206
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,080
 Bigfoot is apparently trapped in the cell and the janitor one day is walking through the laboratory

207
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,960
 and he's like, oh, I forgot. I'm supposed to be cleaning every part of this laboratory and I forgot

208
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,360
 to go clean that cell over there. So he looks in the cell and there's nothing in there. It's completely

209
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:58,240
 empty. Door opens up and Bigfoot knocks over the janitor, starts walking

210
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,080
 through the laboratory. Now, the janitor is obviously shocked. He looked in the cell and

211
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,880
 it was previously empty. The fact is an eight foot tall mythical creature started walking around

212
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,400
 the laboratory. And he said, I looked in the cell and it was totally empty. So everyone's like,

213
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,880
 now running through the facility and Bigfoot's walking around and they can't catch him. So now

214
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,520
 we're in a briefing where I've got our feet up on the desks. We're sitting in the back where all

215
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,640
 the cool kids and the main scientist is shaking his head at us. He's like, oh, who let those hooligans

216
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,920
 in? But he has to give the presentation anyways. They're throwing spit wads at him. We put a quantum

217
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,040
 tack on his chair. He's like, ah, I'm being pierced in every reality, which is a bunch of bullies.

218
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:50,080
 But he's like, okay, so here's what happens. Bigfoot, as some of you know, is a apparently he's

219
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,640
 Bernie Sanders. Bigfoot, as some of you know, is actually a fourth dimensional creature. Everyone's

220
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,560
 like, what? I didn't know that. He's like, yes, that's why people have a hard time finding Bigfoot.

221
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,600
 Because he can move between dimensions. Now, really fourth dimension is just time. So we're

222
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,160
 all fourth dimensional creatures, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. According to this story

223
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,960
 and according to the single source story, and I'll get to that in a second, Bigfoot is a fourth

224
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,720
 dimensional creature. He is able to phase in and out of reality. So what we believe happened was

225
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,760
 that Bigfoot phased into our facility was walking around invisible to us, but then walked into one

226
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,520
 of our super secret secure jail cells that we built. Everyone's like, what? We have jail cells?

227
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,440
 What are the jail cells for? And the lead scientist is like, for the purge. But until the purge, until

228
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,280
 the great scientist purge of 1968 happens, they're just sitting there. They're just ready to be used.

229
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,440
 Now this invisible Bigfoot walked into a cell and the cell is built to prevent fourth dimensional

230
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,400
 travel for whatever reason. And the Bigfoot got locked in there. He turned invisible. The janitor

231
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,320
 opened up the door to clean it and Bigfoot reappeared and came out of it. And everyone goes, well,

232
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,840
 that's horrifying, but it's over now, right? Bigfoot walked out of the cell and the lead

233
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,760
 scientist goes, no, he's still here. He's still in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

234
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,200
 And he's just gonna like chill here for a while, right? Here's a quote regarding this whole thing.

235
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,160
 "There was some panic, just some, right? Just some panic that a fourth dimensional

236
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,480
 eight foot tall monkey man is walking around your workplace. There was some panic,

237
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,920
 but I believe that only a few people stayed at home since it was technically fourth dimensional."

238
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:42,480
 So honestly, if I went to work tomorrow and Bigfoot was there, I would do anything but stay home.

239
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,640
 I'd be signing up for overtime. I'm like, Bigfoot, what's up? "Me no like workplace policies here."

240
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,560
 It's like, oh, no, dude, it's totally awesome. Don't quit. Don't quit. You just sit back, dude.

241
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,320
 I'll do your job. Human resources is not fair. It should be Bigfoot's resources. I'm like,

242
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,320
 ah, come on, man. No, it's totally, I would not stay at home if Bigfoot was at my job ever.

243
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,040
 So people go, you know what? If Bigfoot is here, let's steady it, right?

244
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,840
 What an amazing opportunity. So what they would, this is how they study Bigfoot. Again,

245
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,720
 according to the single source story, they would stand in front of it and Bigfoot would walk through

246
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,440
 them because he's like phasing through them. And they'd be like, whoa. Kind of dumb. They didn't

247
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,600
 really steady it. They just let him walk around for a while. Stephen Hawking, famous man, scientist,

248
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,560
 dude, he got involved in it. He actually went to Lawrence Livermore Laboratories. This was before

249
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,120
 he was a cyborg and he's walking around. He might have been a cyborg by now. So maybe he was just

250
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,320
 kind of like in the wheelchair, but not completely fused metal and man as one. And he goes, yeah,

251
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:58,800
 this is Bigfoot. Like, the fact, okay, let's take a break. I keep saying this is a single source story.

252
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,480
 This is a story from a commenter named Silver Eagle on a website called CryptoMundo. And you're

253
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,840
 like, Jason, seriously, this is your main story for the episode. What's fascinating is that CryptoMundo,

254
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,560
 the website that this was published on, Silver Eagle wrote it as a comment regarding another

255
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,120
 article. CryptoMundo looked at it and they said, we're going to publish this as its own article.

256
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,760
 And they say, we do not, we're not saying any of this is true. We're just reporting that somebody

257
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,000
 says this. Mysterious Universe's website then ran the account and it was like, geez, guys,

258
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,320
 you want to hear a true story? You want to hear something amazing? Listen to this. And it's funny

259
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,360
 because I obviously think that there's a lot of faults in this story, but it's funny because you

260
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,680
 have two major paranormal websites, the one that it was originally published on being like,

261
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,000
 you know, take it with a grain of salt. And then the other one that's actually a bigger paranormal

262
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,480
 website, which I think almost just need, and I go to mysteriousuniverse.com all the time as a whole,

263
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,400
 I'm not bashing the site. But their tone for this article seemed to be very like, this probably

264
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,760
 happened, guys. So the fact that Silver Eagle was the one who wrote the comment says, oh yeah,

265
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,200
 Stephen Hawking showed up. And it's, and then what, what did he do? Why are you introducing these big

266
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,200
 characters into your narrative and giving them nothing to do? If I'm making this event up, and

267
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,680
 maybe this story is true, because if I was making, it's not, but if I was making the event up, I

268
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,680
 would have the scientists do more than just stand there as Bigfoot walked through them to study it.

269
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,320
 That just doesn't make any sense. I think the story's made up. So I guess I'm criticizing Silver

270
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,600
 Eagle for not having more of an imagination. And then Stephen Hawking showed up. And then,

271
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,640
 then what did he do? Bigfoot puts him in the chair. That was all a cover story. Bigfoot's like,

272
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,320
 stay away Hawking. Stephen Hawking's like, no, I will run towards you with my powerful legs,

273
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,840
 and I will kick you. And Bigfoot grabs him and folds him up and then punches him in the throat.

274
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,720
 And he's like, oh no, robot voice now. He puts him in the wheelchair. Bigfoot's like, oh,

275
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,920
 that would be my version. I'd make that up. But this guy just has Stephen Hawking involved somehow.

276
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,080
 But eventually Bigfoot leaves the workplace. And the laboratory's like, oh, we really miss

277
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,040
 that giant creature. But what are the chances of us ever finding another one again? People spin

278
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,920
 80, 90 years. Like, oh wait, here comes another one. And so another Bigfoot comes into the facility

279
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:30,000
 somehow. And at this point, they decide, let's not just have it walk through us. That was kind of

280
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,880
 a lame experiment. At this time, I don't know why they didn't do this the first time. This time,

281
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,200
 it is placed under 24 hour surveillance. There is not a time where they are not keeping eyes

282
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,120
 on this Bigfoot. However, he does often turn invisible and shifts dimensions. So technically,

283
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,600
 I don't think, I don't think you can call that 24 hour surveillance. But he keeps

284
00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:00,480
 fading out and then back into the lab. Fading out back in the lab. They're like, great, this isn't

285
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,760
 really going to work. But at least we're making an effort. At least we're not just standing in a

286
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,960
 hallway. This Bigfoot decided, this different one apparently had braided hair. They could tell it

287
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,480
 apart maybe. This one decides to interact more with the laboratory. The original one walking

288
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,880
 through the hallways. This one hangs out in the break room. And this one, you're like, hey,

289
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,720
 I heard Bigfoot's back. No, no, no, it's different Bigfoot. You're like, okay, it's horrible about

290
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,880
 what happened to poor Stephen. Yeah, oh yeah, dude, he really worked a number on that dude, broke

291
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,840
 his back and everything. Pouring coffee in the break room, turn around, giant Bigfoot behind

292
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,680
 you. Bigfoot would hang out in the in the break room. So while the first Bigfoot got trapped in

293
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,480
 jail cell and was like walking around, this one just has his feet up on a table. He's reading

294
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,800
 a magazine. Even if he turned invisible, you'd still just see the magazine floating there.

295
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,680
 And he's like, oh, people magazine should be called Bigfoot magazine. They're like, yeah,

296
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,280
 yeah, you already told that joke. He's like, oh, I tell many jokes as I want. I'm Bigfoot.

297
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,920
 Disappears. Anyways, then people are like, that's kind of annoying because in the first one, at

298
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,400
 least he was doing something, i.e. he was mobile. This one's just sitting on the couch in the break

299
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:19,040
 room. He's basically you or me as an interdimensional creature, which again, I'm not faulting him.

300
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,560
 If I was an eight foot tall beast that could teleport between realities, I'd be tired a lot.

301
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,760
 Me nap. They're like, no, you have to go out and like explore the cosmos. Me nap.

302
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,920
 Explore cosmos and dreams. He also begins to do, okay, so walking around your workplace,

303
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,360
 you're supposed to do that. You're not supposed to be able to phase through your co-workers.

304
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,640
 Probably getting in trouble for that in real life. Hang out in the break room all day long.

305
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,560
 That's every worker's dream. But again, that's kind of annoying because you go to sit on the

306
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,440
 can you see an empty couch and you sit down and you sit on top of a giant invisible hairy man.

307
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,280
 You're like, oh, you want to be, well, people are like, come on, man, we want to use a break room.

308
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,760
 We got a shine monster in here. Can't we do something about it? Can we call Stephen Hawking?

309
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,520
 They're like, dude, he's still in intensive care. And what's he supposed to do anyways?

310
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,800
 What was he supposed to do the first time? I don't know. I figured maybe he's his big brain

311
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,240
 to do something. Then things can even worse because women work there. Now that's not the

312
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:24,640
 bad thing. I'm like, what? Then things get worse. Not only is there a big foot, there's women there.

313
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 Can you believe that? Well, deadriverradiojmail.com. That's not the end of it.

314
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,320
 It's not worse because women start working there. It's worse because women are working there and

315
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,400
 Bigfoot begins to sexually harass them. Oh, hubba hubba. Me, see, beautiful human woman

316
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:49,040
 walking towards him. Now, apparently, Bigfoot would walk up behind women and I don't know if he'd

317
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:56,080
 actually goose them with actual goose is all walk walk. He teleports out and comes back with a goose.

318
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,320
 I don't know if he was actually grabbing them, but what he would do is he would be invisible. He'd

319
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,960
 walk up right behind them and then appear and they'd flip out, drop coffee everywhere. A common

320
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,160
 occurrence according to Silver Eagle, he always waited until they were getting coffee and then he

321
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:17,600
 would appear right behind him. So anyways, the coffee bill was going really high. They're wasting a

322
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,200
 bunch of it. Well, apparently women were getting sexually harassed or assaulted by Bigfoot or both.

323
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,920
 I mean, he could have been just cat calling them or Bigfoot calling them or he might have

324
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,120
 actually been like grabbing them. Whatever he was doing, I don't know if it's a crime and I don't

325
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,560
 want to test this, but I don't know if it's a crime to just simply appear behind a woman.

326
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,320
 I mean, I guess the police would be more baffled. They're like, sir, that was really rude. But first

327
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,760
 off, we want to know how you shifted dimensions. Like, I don't think it's a crime to simply walk

328
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,240
 up behind a woman and get super close. I think you have to actually touch people for it to be assault.

329
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,560
 But anyways, I'm sure I can console my interdimensional legal team. Can I shift realities

330
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,920
 behind a woman? Would I be prosecuted for that? They're like, probably not, but don't. Don't do that.

331
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:13,520
 Anyways, this was a last straw. He was appearing behind women. He was taking up all their couches

332
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,960
 in the break room. He was making them watch some stupid lame show like Raw Hide. He's like,

333
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,680
 should be Bigfoot Hide. And they're like, that doesn't even make sense.

334
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,680
 The, you have this laboratory that specializes in building nuclear weapons. They want to get rid

335
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,880
 of Bigfoot. So how do you do this? It's so ridiculous. Now, again, I did make fun of Stephen

336
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,360
 Hawking showing up and not really doing anything. I do have to admit in the second half of this story,

337
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,360
 it does get pretty inventive, right? So you have Bigfoot just being a light, a lout for the second

338
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,680
 half of the story, a different Bigfoot. And then you have this scientist that's sitting around. We're

339
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,080
 at another meeting and the main scientist is like, we got to get rid of Bigfoot. He's goosing these

340
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,960
 women. We can't use our, we just love the fact that he's just in the break room all the time.

341
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,000
 We can't use the break room. We, there's no coffee because the women keep spilling it.

342
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,240
 They're like, dude, he's attacking us. They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm jittery. I don't have any

343
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,000
 caffeine. We have to get rid of Bigfoot. So how do we do with all of these cold war weapons that

344
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,160
 we've designed? How do we do it? This scientist, this is what they figured out. They're going to

345
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:26,080
 open up all the doors in the laboratory. An advanced weapons secret laboratory that the Russians

346
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,680
 have been trying to get into since it opened. They said, let's open every door in the facility,

347
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,240
 right? And then we're going to use this special space age weapon technology we've designed.

348
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,920
 It's a sonic weapon. It's banging pots and pans as we walk through the facility. So apparently,

349
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,600
 after all the doors have been opened and spy versus spy are trying to like sneak in, you have

350
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,920
 scientists, people with PhDs and astrophysics and nuclear physics and all this stuff walking

351
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:05,680
 through empty hallways going, just banging pots and pans. And they do that in all directions.

352
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,160
 And apparently Bigfoot disappears. He has not come back since. Here's some quotes to let us know

353
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:18,160
 what happened in the aftermath of this quote. Apparently one scientist was retired early because

354
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:25,040
 it was believed that the Bigfoot hypnotized him to go insane. He apparently did not respect the

355
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:31,120
 Bigfoot for being people and firmly thought it to be an animal. That was the only injury that I

356
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:40,560
 can recall. Bigfoot, I love this. So let's say this sentence is true. You have this laboratory,

357
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,200
 right? That deals with these high level weapons. And this scientist comes in and he goes, "Ugh,

358
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,760
 I don't know what's going on." And they're like, "What's up Murray?" He's like, "Ugh,

359
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,760
 I think I'm insane. I think I'm going insane." They're like, "What?" Yeah, I didn't think that

360
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:02,400
 Bigfoot was a person and that he was just a big dumb animal. And now I'm not a psychiatrist,

361
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,200
 but I can only diagnose myself with being insane. I have a bad case of insanity. And the

362
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,920
 government goes, "Uh, well, just retire." Yes, you know all sorts of weapon secrets. You know,

363
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:24,800
 all sorts of secrets that the government doesn't want anyone to know. And a Bigfoot got into your

364
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,240
 brain and drove you insane. Why don't you just take the day off? Why don't you just go home

365
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,560
 and we'll just start sending you retirement checks? The insanity thing, I'm sure it'll wear off.

366
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:41,200
 Fourth dimensional caused madness adds nothing. Silver Eagle does let us know that all of this

367
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,880
 government Bigfoot stuff goes on far beyond the intrusion of Livermore laboratories.

368
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,400
 Apparently, the government goes into the woods and steals Bigfoot bodies. That's why we can't

369
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,480
 find any proof. The government covers it up. Now, they're doing a pretty crummy job because every

370
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,720
 show after there's a giant footprint found. But all the big stuff, Bigfoot bodies, why can't you

371
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,160
 find those? Government, government takes them. He states that there is more money spent by the

372
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,840
 government to cover up or threaten Bigfoot researchers than has ever spent actually hunting

373
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,760
 Bigfoot. Huge conspiracy. He also states that most Bigfoot's are actually invisible, like the ones

374
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,120
 that we experienced at this laboratory. And they're everywhere. They're actually, you could be

375
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:34,400
 standing right next to a Bigfoot right now. And in fact, there are Bigfoot that live within the

376
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:40,000
 Portland city limits. These aren't a rural creature. It's not just a creature who lives in the woods.

377
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,560
 They're everywhere. Now, obviously, this is the rantings of a madman. He also said he took a photo

378
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,040
 of two gnomes, but they were invisible. But let's go back to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

379
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:57,440
 Still in operation today. They currently have a laser system that honestly, the technology is way

380
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,920
 too advanced for me to even comprehend, let alone describe to you. But this laser system they built

381
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,040
 that they're currently using is named Bigfoot. Now, could just be a clever name they came up with.

382
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:20,240
 Could be an acronym or it could be an inside joke. It could, and this is true. They actually do have

383
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,360
 a laser system called Bigfoot at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. It could be a callback to

384
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,600
 a rumor that some of the older scientists would talk about often. Because why else would you call

385
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:43,840
 a laser system Bigfoot? It could be a funny, gentle reminder of those old days when Bigfoot

386
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,120
 hung out at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
