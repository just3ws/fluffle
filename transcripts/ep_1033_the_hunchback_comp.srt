1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 It's a sexy time special as we take a look at two extremely sexual stories.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,120
 You're like, "Oh no, Jason, what do you have in store for us today?"

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,320
 Well, first off, scientists have finally created a male birth control pill that you can take

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,440
 an hour before sex and you won't have kids. Is this the pill we've all been waiting for or

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:39,040
 will it create an army of soulless goons? Probably the first one, probably the first one.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,200
 But who knows? Soulless goons may be on the horizon and then we travel to El Salvador

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,600
 to take a look at a young man who was out walking one night when all of a sudden he was abducted by

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 aliens. On board their ship, he learned how these aliens reproduce and the answer is horrifying.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:16,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,160
 Barber and I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys had a

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,400
 ton of fun over the weekend. We got a bunch of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters. Everyone

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,320
 get on your feet and give it up for Dave. Woohoo, yeah! Come on in, buddy. Walk on into Dead Rabbit

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,960
 Command. Dave, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you can't support the

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,600

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,160
 Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps out so, so much. Dave, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,200
 the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. Drive us all the way out to

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:09,120
 a scientific laboratory. As we're pulling up to this scientific research center, we see throngs

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:17,600
 of men outside going "Yay! Woo! Science! Yeah! Yeah!" and fireworks are going off. People are

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,640
 overturning science cars. But for fun, they're not doing it because they hate science. Men around

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:33,440
 the world have been given a W on this one. A male birth control pill has now been invented.

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,520
 Ladies and gentlemen, we, gentlemen, gentlemen, particularly, we have now crossed the Rubicon.

24
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:47,920
 We now have a male birth control pill, something we've wanted for ages because condoms are terrible.

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,040
 Condoms are awful. Now, I understand why we have condoms. I'm fully well aware of that.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,760
 But from the age where they used to cut out sheep intestine to use as a condom. I mean,

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,840
 it's easy nowadays. You go to the grocery store and you buy like a 12-pack. But imagine before

28
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,760
 when you went to have sex with someone, first you had to find a sheep and then you'd kill it.

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920
 I wonder if they had actually pre-packaged condoms in like Leonardo da Vinci's time because I don't

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,280
 imagine they're like "Oh, hot!" and bothered. They're like "Hey, hold on, honey. I'm gonna go out to this

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,160
 nearby farm." Because I don't think it was fresh sheep intestine. I'm pretty sure it was dried out.

32
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,560
 They're like "Oh, it's lubricated. This is fresh." I'm pretty sure they probably sold because they

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
 did used to make condoms out of sheep intestines, right? I remember reading that a long time ago.

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,280
 You're like "No, Jason, that's not right. Where'd you get your facts for a mad magazine?"

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,600
 No, no, no. I'm pretty sure that they did. And I'm sure they probably sold packs. I'm sure that

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,040
 you could go down to like an old-timey market. There's like a vendor selling apples and a vendor

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,080
 selling straw like hay and stuff like that. And then there's there's some good old-fashioned

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
 condom vendor. He's like "Get your cheap intestine here. Dry it out for her pleasure." And you're

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,240
 like walking. You're like "I'll take 12 of those. Good sir." I don't think they had like a sheep in

40
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,440
 the back that they were like "You know how you buy rope from a hardware store? They just keep

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,600
 wheeling it out and they tell they say tell us when to stop." I'm sure the sheep were already dead,

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,920
 long dead. And they probably weren't killed just for that. They probably were like making mutton.

43
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,680
 And then someone goes "Dude, what are we going to do with all these intestines?" And someone goes

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,600
 "I don't know." He looks at his sea of 12 children and he goes "Hmm, maybe we can use the sheep

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,080
 intestine to keep child number 13 from showing up." I understand. And also you know the thing is,

46
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,920
 is with condoms they're good to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. But the main reason I think

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,640
 most guys wear a condom is to not get a girl pregnant. Like nobody wants super gonorrhea.

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,680
 But most of us will take our chances with that. But the idea of having a kid with someone you just

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,440
 pick up on a Friday night or whatever, terrifying. Terrifying. But condoms are awful. Condoms are

50
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,600
 equally awful to having a kid that you have to take care of for 18 years. So I think the idea

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,200
 for me at least for a male pill, a male birth control pill has always been like,

52
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:30,080
 it's always been that noblest of all scientific pursuits. Can we invent a male contraceptive?

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,440
 That is not totally lame. Now I can take a pill. Well the pill's not official yet. Well anyways,

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,760
 the National Institutes of Health, they've recently discovered that this compound will work. And

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,440
 the way they tested it was they gave it to mice and then they made some unpaid interns sit there

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,600
 and just watch mice have sex constantly. He's like, oh man, I wish I became a botanist. This is

57
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,160
 disgusting. All these mice. Imagine that was your job. Your parents are so proud of you that you

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,680
 became a scientist and they're all, what are you studying? You're like, don't ask. Don't ask. Don't

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,640
 ask at all please. They bring you, your mom brings you a nice big cup of milk. You're all throwing

60
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,160
 one up. You don't want to be anywhere near it. They put on a biggie mouse cartoon. You're like,

61
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:25,840
 imagine that your day job is to watch mice bang and then you take notes as how often

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,600
 they're having babies. So some unpaid intern had to watch these mice have sex all day long and then

63
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,120
 it turns out that when they gave these mice this birth control pill, I'm sure they gave them an

64
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
 injection. I don't think they're actually trying to shove a big old pill down their mouth. The mice

65
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,560
 would take this compound and it would slow down their sperm. So when they bang the lady mouse,

66
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,160
 the sperm's like too lazy and stuff. They're just like sitting there and they don't make their way

67
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,600
 up the uterus of that mouse and the scientists are like, good job, Jerry. Good job. Good job. Sorry

68
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,680
 we gave you that lifelong fetish. Sorry we've broken your soul. But good job watching all those

69
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,560
 mice have sex because now we know that this particular compound works and they're expecting

70
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,120
 to start using it in people. They'll do a human trial obviously, but they said it's actually

71
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,760
 more efficient than women's birth control because women's birth control, you have to take like 20,

72
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,440
 25 days out of the month and then you get five tasty pieces of sugar as a treat,

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,280
 but you got to take it all month. This one you can take up to an hour before sex, swallow that pill

74
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,320
 and you'll be good to go. Your sperm will just be chilling and they won't want to swim around in

75
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:56,480
 your lady friend. They tested this on the rats out of 52 attempts. There were zero pregnancies and

76
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,280
 they said, yeah, they're just statistically, that's 100%. So they said that is even better than women's

77
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:11,120
 birth control and you take the pill up to an hour before you have sex and you have sex and then

78
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,640
 three hours after you took the pill, because they steady this all in mice,

79
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,400
 the sperm starts moving again, it starts wiggling around underneath the microscope

80
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
 and they're like, we didn't permanently sterilize these mice, like this actually will work.

81
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,680
 Basically it turns you sterile for a couple hours. Some of them start moving after three

82
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,280
 hours within a day, all of them or virtually all of them was a term they used, is moving around,

83
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,960
 they're ready to run that race. And this is awesome. I mean, they've been trying to figure out a male

84
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,960
 birth control for years because everybody knows that the condoms suck better than nothing, but

85
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,520
 originally I guess they were targeting testosterone. They're like, maybe if we can stop

86
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,800
 testosterone production, that will make the men less fertile and all, well, I should

87
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,160
 say all it did. I mean, it kind of worked, but it also made them super depressed and obese and gave

88
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,520
 them high cholesterol. So there has to be a better way, ladies and gentlemen, there has to be a

89
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,600
 better way. And they found it. Now here's my question. I would, I would take this pill myself,

90
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,240
 I would take this, I'm running into the mice laboratory, I'm like swallowing mice just to

91
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,400
 get the medicine. I would take a male birth control pill just to be safe. But then I was

92
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,400
 wondering what if you take this pill and your sperm's just kind of chilling, right? They're

93
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,960
 sleeping. And then the pill wears off. And then you get a girl pregnant, a girl you wanted to

94
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,520
 get pregnant. That was the last three hours I didn't love her, honey, but I love you. Let's have a baby.

95
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,200
 And your sperm's moving around. What would be the effects of sleepy sperm?

96
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,760
 Like sperm, like falling, taking a little nap and then waking up and then inseminating an egg?

97
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,720
 Now I'm sure they'll test that at some point. They bring that intern back. They check Jerry out of

98
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,680
 the insane asylum, make them come back to work. I'm sure they'll test that, like what is the

99
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:22,160
 long-term ramifications? But here's my question. A mouse, does a mouse have a soul? Does a mouse

100
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
 have a soul? I mean, you could argue that, you know, there's no really hard and fast answer

101
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,160
 to that question. Does a mouse have a soul? So if you gave a mouse birth control and you made

102
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,360
 his sperm fall asleep, and then they woke up a couple hours later, and then you impregnated a mouse,

103
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,840
 that baby mouse or mice, because if they give birth on letters, I don't think it's just one,

104
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,200
 they're like, "Well, name you Nick." I think there's a bunch of them coming out. They'll probably act

105
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,440
 just like regular mice, because, you know, a mouse is a mouse, right? It's all a series of,

106
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,120
 what's the term when they do the same thing over and over again, and it's not personality trait,

107
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,440
 it's not a habit. That's humans. It's called, like instinct. I wonder if, like, you go, "Well,

108
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,080
 that, okay, with this mouse, we, it was originally sleepy sperm, and now Nicholas, the mouse, is

109
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,920
 running around this cage, and he's doing mouse stuff. He's eating cheese and running through holes,

110
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,240
 painting holes on walls and making cat smash into him. Normal mouse stuff. But that mouse could be,

111
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,480
 like, totally, like, his brain could be totally messed up. Like, he's still, like, something's wrong

112
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,000
 with him. Something's wrong with his brain, but because it's like a mouse, it's just a basic mouse,

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,920
 you couldn't tell. And then, you know, maybe it dies, and you do an autopsy on its brain,

114
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,880
 and it looks like a mouse brain. So you're like, "Well, this stuff is totally fine." But what happens if,

115
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,080
 like, humans are different. At the end of the day, I know that mice and pigs, we have all these

116
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,880
 similarities as far as our brain structure and organs, how our organs work, and same thing with

117
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,800
 gorillas, chimpanzees, stuff like that, primates. But if humans, I believe humans do have a soul,

118
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:18,480
 would your sperm, would you being basically paralyzed as a sperm, and then you are, a couple

119
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,240
 hours later, you do successfully conceive, right? You're swimming around and you get up in that little egg.

120
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,440
 Would there be something wrong with you is my question. And I don't think that's something we

121
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,080
 can answer. It may not even be something biological so much. Like, you could register that if you're

122
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,320
 like, "That's weird. These mice that have been subjected to this medication, we gave it to their

123
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,400
 daddy, we gave him this medicine, after a couple hours it wore off, and then the sperms running

124
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,880
 around again. If you could measure, you could go, "This mouse is dumber than mice that's,

125
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,080
 dads didn't take this drug." Then obviously that'd be a safety concern, because nobody wants a bunch

126
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,280
 of dumb kids running around. But if you can't tell if it's something that is instinctively human, like a

127
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,520
 soul, that'd be something that you may not even know. It's just an interesting question because I

128
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,240
 thought about it and I go, "You can run all sorts of trials on all sorts of animals, and unless it

129
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,720
 is a biological thing you can measure, you would never know until guys start popping these pills,

130
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,040
 and then they, within that three hour time period, they have a bunch of sex, don't get anyone pregnant,

131
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,760
 and then tomorrow they go home and they have sex with their wife, and get her pregnant.

132
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:46,400
 What will be up with that baby? Maybe nothing. Maybe nothing, but maybe something. You know how

133
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,800
 science works, it's either something or nothing, and that's nothing we can measure until we have

134
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,280
 like a generation or two. It's interesting because I think when you're messing with the

135
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,000
 fertility process, because it's not like women's birth control makes it so, actually I don't really

136
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,720
 know how women's birth control work. I think it makes it so their eggs aren't fertile or something

137
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,680
 like that. I don't know, but that's different because I don't know how it works. I can't say

138
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,800
 it's different, it might be the exact same thing, but I'm pretty sure. I don't know. I don't know how

139
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,000
 it works, what I'm saying is my point is that that's the same sperm. Like if she's taking this

140
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,800
 medication, I know it messes with her estrogen levels and it basically does something,

141
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,280
 but I don't think that, now I'm talking out of my butt, I don't think that it's the same.

142
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,000
 If I went to sleep as a sperm and I'm chilling there for a while, then I woke up a couple hours

143
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,960
 later, I'm still that same sperm floating around, and I'd still be subjected to doses of that medicine,

144
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:04,160
 and then I'm like, okay woke up, time to go become a human. But anyways, fascinating story from the

145
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,720
 world of science. Somewhere out there right now, a scientist is holding a pill and he's going, ladies

146
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
 and gentlemen, we have it, the male birth control pill. You know what would be cool, because we always

147
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,040
 see these in science fiction movies where like you have a madman scientist and they're like,

148
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,120
 we have to go through all the safety regulation. He's like, no I hate safety, I joined science to

149
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,080
 blow stuff up. Omp and he swallows the pill, makes himself the test subject, and then people

150
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,320
 are like, we were expecting something more exciting. We thought you were going to turn into a goblin

151
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
 and fly around. He's like, no it's just pill. I'm going to go home and have sex with my wife,

152
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,280
 see if I can knock her up. Nothing super dramatic, but you should start human trials. Try these drugs

153
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,040
 on yourself scientists. Let us know how it goes. Get these things to market as quick as you can.

154
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,800
 Unless they destroy human souls and then you know, don't release those drugs that turn us all

155
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,120
 into I am legend monsters. Dave, go ahead and call in the world's famous carbonar copter. We are

156
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:12,480
 leaving behind this scientific laboratory. Fly us all the way out to El Salvador.

157
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:24,320
 Dead Rabbit Radio, the number one science podcast in El Salvador, is once again returning to El

158
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,160
 Salvador. We haven't covered a lot of stories on them. We did a story about a mule with a human

159
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,160
 face that turned out not to be true. That turned out to be fake. We covered it and it probably

160
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,760
 didn't even take place in El Salvador. There was a lot of questions of where that story took place,

161
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,840
 but it was just a deformed donkey. I think we did another story in El Salvador, but this one takes

162
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,960
 the cake. This one's absolutely horrifying. We're in El Salvador, specifically we're in the town of

163
00:16:51,520 --> 00:17:01,760
 Cuscattenesingo. Cuscattenesingo, El Salvador. It's February 29th, 1996.

164
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:08,000
 And we're about to meet a young boy. He's 17 years old and he doesn't give his name in this report.

165
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,200
 We're going to go ahead and call him Marcus. Marcus is walking through the town of Cuscattenesingo

166
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,880
 during a blackout. Not a supernatural blackout. We've covered those before on the show and I

167
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,680
 think that's one of my newest favorite supernatural phenomenons to investigate, but just an ordinary

168
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,440
 blackout. The grid's gone down. It's 10 p.m. at night, so it's very, very dark and Marcus is walking

169
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,480
 home. When all of a sudden there is a bright blue flash behind him. It's bright enough that it

170
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,600
 illuminates the landscape in front of him and his first instinct is it's the police.

171
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,440
 Marcus begins to turn around to see what they want.

172
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,960
 At this point, Marcus's senses are kind of overwhelmed. It takes him a couple seconds

173
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:09,600
 to put together exactly what's happened. He's in this white room or the more appropriate term might

174
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:18,640
 be a white space or a white void. There's no walls. There's no furniture. There's no light

175
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:34,000
 fixtures. It's just unending white. Then Marcus realizes that he isn't standing in this white

176
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,120
 space. He's actually laying down on a bed that he can't see. It's just part of the void and then

177
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:55,520
 he realizes that he can't move. He does seem to kind of have movement control over his eyes.

178
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,400
 He can move his eyes from side to side and probably a little bit of his neck because he does start to

179
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,320
 look around this room but definitely like he can't get up and run. He's at the very least

180
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:20,480
 paralyzed from the neck down if not more. He sees protruding out of his own chest cables

181
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:31,200
 reaching up into nothingness. He said on his right arm, attached to his right arm, was what he would

182
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,800
 call an IV machine. It was unclear on what that would actually be if that was actually like it

183
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,120
 because I know of like an IV bag and that's like on a dolly but he said it was attached to his right

184
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,720
 arm. It was an IV machine but he's paralyzed on this table. He has this stuff attached to him and he

185
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:59,760
 begins to see other figures moving around this space. He describes him as humanoids,

186
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:08,400
 not necessarily gray aliens. They probably do look more like humans, more like traditional humans.

187
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,480
 He sees these humanoids. He says they were all around five foot five

188
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,160
 wearing white tunics with a strange emblem or insignia on the right side of the chest.

189
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:28,320
 I said they weren't gray aliens. They definitely weren't humans either because they

190
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:38,320
 have some alien characteristics. He said that they all had very large heads and very large eyes as well

191
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,280
 and in the middle of their forehead there was a third eyeball protruding from the skull

192
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,520
 even in the world of aliens. This is all particularly weird. The traditional races,

193
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,160
 grays, reptilians, insectoids, even those tend to kind of fit certain parameters. This

194
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,640
 a humanoid race with these type of bizarre features. A very interesting look and he's

195
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,560
 little less interested. He's a little more terrified at this point. These beings are kind

196
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:17,680
 of moving around this void. They also had goat teeth which again facial hair on aliens is super rare.

197
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:24,320
 Super rare. We've come across them but they're it's incredibly rare. They had little goat teeth

198
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,160
 but again he's not worried about that. He's not like oh this is fascinating. He's terrified.

199
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,920
 He's paralyzed. There's stuff coming out of his chest. Little aliens with goat teeth. That's the

200
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,120
 least of his worries. He notices other humans in this void as well and in a other particularly

201
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:55,440
 bizarre observation Marcus said I couldn't tell how many of them were prisoners which makes

202
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,280
 you think some of them were there voluntarily. Some of them just seem to be walking around.

203
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,000
 Nothing sticking out of their chest. They weren't particularly scared. Just seem to be walking

204
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,440
 around milling about. But he knew for a fact that some of them were prisoners

205
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:29,920
 because of what he saw happen. He said he was able to look at somebody on another table similar

206
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:36,160
 to his. And actually it's interesting at this point I'm wondering if now he can start to perceive

207
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:43,440
 the reality. It doesn't specifically say that the white voids disappeared and now he realizes he's in

208
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,600
 a artificially constructed UFO or anything like that. But the terminology is becoming more concrete

209
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:58,400
 the more the story goes. Very very fascinating stuff right. He sees this woman sitting on a table

210
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:08,960
 similar to his. And the reason why he believes she's also a prisoner is because these aliens

211
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:20,400
 are slicing her in half. Right at the waist they're cutting her in two.

212
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,640
 And he watches them. He watches these aliens pull this woman apart and now they have two halves of her.

213
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:43,280
 And they carry this top half of this woman from the waist up. They carry her to where there is an

214
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:52,560
 alien female. Same thing big head big eyes three of them. The female alien who's laying down on

215
00:23:52,560 --> 00:24:00,000
 this other table has like a hunchback has like a big hump on her back. She's just laying there on her

216
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 stomach. And Marcus watches the aliens pull the human woman in half from the waist up.

217
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,800
 And now they're carrying this half of a woman over to the prone female alien lying on her stomach.

218
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,080
 And as Marcus is watching and what could only be described as pure horror,

219
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,520
 they attach the human woman's torso to the aliens hunchback.

220
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 They are now fused into one living being. They don't say that the woman was alive during this.

221
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,160
 Generally when you cut people in half they are not alive anymore. Right? You don't need a scientist

222
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,800
 to tell you that. But with alien technology and also because it's way spookier, right? If you cut a

223
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,920
 person in half and they died and then you sewed them to the back of an alien, I mean that sucks for

224
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,560
 their family. But it's not necessarily scary. I'm all yon board as the aliens are cutting me

225
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,400
 half of the laser saw. I was like I'm gonna die anyway so I don't care. But imagine if you were

226
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:24,240
 cut in half and then you were kept alive. And then sewed onto the back of an alien. You're like

227
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,920
 Jason they're both awful. Both ways I'm being cut in half by an alien. Yeah but I think it would be

228
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,920
 worse if you woke up and you're attached to the back of an alien. I mean there's no way we can win

229
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,200
 this argument. It'll never happen either of us. One day I show up on the podcast and I was like

230
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
 hey guys a bit of an update. I was wrong. It's actually not that bad to be attached to the back

231
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,880
 of an alien while you're still alive. But for spookiness sake I'm imagining the woman is like

232
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,080
 no don't put me up there. Don't put me up there. Don't put me. And then gets attached to this alien

233
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,160
 woman. But he didn't say anything. He didn't say she was begging for her life or anything. I just

234
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,120
 think it's scarier. Anyways you have this human woman attached to the back of this alien. Like

235
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,320
 this alien woman had this huge hunch on her and the human woman is like fused into the hunch.

236
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,360
 Fused into the hump I think is actually the correct term. And another interesting shift.

237
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,120
 We do see this stuff happen in UFO encounters where things don't necessarily like make sense

238
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,320
 time wise because as you'll learn a lot of this was he had a piece together over a couple days.

239
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,680
 The next thing he remembers is being told by the aliens. They start to give him a little bit of

240
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:52,320
 backstory. They said our race is in a state of war right now. We can no longer reproduce in the

241
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:03,360
 quote original normal manner. The aliens also told him we have a bunch of eggs

242
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,880
 that we used to reproduce. We have a bunch of eggs stored in Ilo Pango Lake.

243
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,240
 The next thing Marcus remembers is falling.

244
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,080
 But really he didn't remember any of that. He didn't remember any of it at all. He remembers

245
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:35,840
 walking through town on February 29th trying to make his way home. The next thing he knows

246
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:45,280
 there's a bunch of police officers all around him 20 miles away from where he was just two days

247
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,040
 ago. He'd been missing for two days. He was 20 miles away at Ilo Pango Lake.

248
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:58,560
 He was standing on the shores of the lake when he was found by the authorities.

249
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,560
 And they were like where have you been? You've been gone for two days. Everyone is freaking out.

250
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:13,520
 And he did not remember where he was at. It was only under interrogation where he remembered

251
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:24,000
 what had happened. Now it's interesting. The story was originally covered by Dr. Luis Ilo Pes

252
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,040
 in something called the Y Files. I actually tried looking for what the Y Files was. I'm assuming

253
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,760
 it's like a book or a magazine. Maybe even a television show. When I tried looking for this

254
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,320
 I almost got kicked out of the coffee shop that I was in because Dr. Luis Lopez is also a plastic

255
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,280
 surgeon on Instagram. Whose profile page includes a bunch of naked women. I guess he does like

256
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,680
 pubic surgery or something like that. So thanks a lot Instagram. I almost got kicked out of the

257
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,600
 wrong customers walking by. I would have been. I wasn't able to find any more information on Dr.

258
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,920
 Luis Ilo Pes or the Y Files. I'm assuming it was a book a magazine or a television show.

259
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,960
 Around that time he's the guy who reported this story. It's interesting because a lot of the

260
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,120
 words he uses he puts in quotation marks and a lot of the words are definitely like when we talk about

261
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,640
 he says in some sort of quote unquote bed. He uses terms like that in a completely white quote

262
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:36,480
 unquote space. So I wonder how many like obviously Marcus when he when the police found him he was

263
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,600
 very confused and disoriented. It took him a while to remember. When they say interrogation

264
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,880
 that's not in quotes. I don't know if it's that the police interrogated him and they were beating

265
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,600
 him up and he had to give him a quick story. I don't know if the police were just really trying

266
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,720
 to figure out where he was at and he slowly was remembering it. There's no mention here. I got

267
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,760
 it from thinkaboutadox.com which is one of my favorite websites. It's all UFO alien encounters.

268
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,720
 There's no mention on here of like hypnosis or you know regression therapy or anything like that.

269
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,000
 I think he probably was the cops probably were grilling him and it forced him to remember not

270
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,440
 physically forced him but it just forced him to remember what had happened that night or multiple

271
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,120
 nights. Was he walking along the shore for two days or did they drop him up because they found him

272
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,320
 at 6 30 in the morning. He originally disappeared at 10 p.m. February 29th leap year and then he

273
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,520
 is found two days later at 6 30 in the morning so it's possible that that is they dropped him off

274
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,520
 right before that. It's possible that he was wandering around the lake for that long. We don't

275
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,880
 know. We do know though that one thing that he's noticed. Remember these are the only details he

276
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,920
 remembered. After the encounter he noticed that he had strange scars on his body. Several strange

277
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,880
 scars on his body. So we don't know if that was just from the tubes in his chest. There's no detail

278
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,480
 of to where the scars were but this is what's interesting. Well obviously everything's interesting

279
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,880
 about this story but it's possible that they performed way more experiments on him than they

280
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:29,920
 would let him remember or that he even really wanted to admit because this alien mission seemed to be

281
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,240
 all about reproduction. In the sense that they were telling him where the eggs were which was

282
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,120
 weird you probably shouldn't let you probably shouldn't let a native species. You probably

283
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:50,800
 shouldn't let humans know that you're breeding in their lakes. But I figured the reason

284
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,560
 why they would is because the way I read it was this. They can't reproduce that way anymore.

285
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,920
 Like they used to have a certain reproduction cycle and they can't do that.

286
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,280
 So they're using humans to now reproduce.

287
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,400
 So I'm wondering let's put our conspiracy caps on to wrap this up.

288
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,640
 I'm wondering when you cut this is going to get pretty disgusting here.

289
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,720
 Could you cut like he said he saw the woman cut in half.

290
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,320
 He would refer to the top half as her upper torso that type of thing. I'm wondering if you could

291
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:45,360
 cut off a woman's legs and then maintain her uterus and all that and then attach that to a back of an

292
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:53,040
 alien and now the human woman's uterus is now part of the female alien's hump

293
00:32:53,040 --> 00:33:02,640
 and they're reproducing that way. Like the woman is just laying eggs. The human woman

294
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:11,680
 is now laying and maybe they speed it up. So it's not like once a month this human woman

295
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:21,200
 is putting human eggs right for lack of a better term. I know there is a better term for it but

296
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,240
 anyways maybe they took the human woman and they took the top half of her because they needed to

297
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,920
 keep her alive and she is now part of the alien's reproduction cycle. That's what I'm talking about.

298
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,680
 Now obviously if you cut a woman in half you're getting rid of the reproductive part. Now maybe

299
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,000
 they wanted to create a super warrior. Maybe in their war the alien women just are running around

300
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,280
 with human women on top of them shooting lasers. I don't know it's probably less disgusting than

301
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,200
 my theory but the reproduction thing would make more sense right. If you're going to chop someone

302
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,360
 on in half and attach them to an alien you're like no Jason that doesn't make any sense at all.

303
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,560
 The reason why I'm going this direction because they specifically mentioned reproduction. I'm

304
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,600
 wondering if you could take the legs off of a woman but keep everything. I mean if they alien

305
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,640
 technology you could do anything right but I mean you would figure that if you're having

306
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,400
 trouble reproducing as an alien just use a human's reproductive cycle and if you keep the woman alive

307
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,320
 for a couple years you're having like a baby a month. Like I don't know. I don't know alien biology.

308
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,800
 I barely know. I barely know human biology but that's what I'm wondering. And that's also why I

309
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,480
 was thinking that the human female was still alive. The woman was still alive when she was

310
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,120
 attached to the back of the alien woman. It's creepy story nonetheless. Whether or not the woman

311
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:53,120
 lived or died whether or not to this day she's still laying eggs for the Empress. It's terrifying

312
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,480
 either way and you have to wonder what else they did to Marcus. Like that's the thing. We

313
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,760
 he only remembers some of it. He was gone for days so they could have done horrific things to him.

314
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,040
 They could have chopped him in half and then put him back together for all we know. The amount of

315
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,400
 alien technology that's out there is astounding and the fact like even this race seems to be more

316
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,600
 advanced than the standard grays which tend to fly around in vehicles that can be picked up on radar.

317
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,760
 You can see them with your eyes. They have dimensions to them. You can go inside. There's all these

318
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,720
 control panels. These guys operated and avoid. These guys had complete mastery over dimensions

319
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,560
 and it's pretty interesting to note that even at that level of technology they're in a state of war.

320
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,240
 So you have to wonder who are they fighting against. It would have to be an alien race that

321
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,120
 had an equal level of technology and at that point we would just be ants watching two nations go to

322
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:07,120
 war. Like the technology that what he saw you can barely put it into words and this was their

323
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:14,640
 doctor's office. This wasn't even the highest level of tech they have. This is where people

324
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,680
 were kind of milling about with goatees wearing little tunics and who are the other humans walking

325
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:29,920
 around? Clones? Government officials in on it? Both? It's a terrifying story that we'll never

326
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:41,680
 have so many answers to but there is one thing that we can check. What is at the bottom of that lake?

327
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,120
 Was this just a 17 year old's delusion? Was it a lie he told so he wouldn't get into trouble of what

328
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,440
 he was really up to? Or was a young man actually kidnapped by aliens and taken to a place that

329
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:06,560
 defies explanation? Where he was told that a huge war is going on between two immensely powerful

330
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,560
 forces. Did he watch a woman get sawed in half so she would become part of the alien

331
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,040
 reproductive cycle? All those questions can be answered.

332
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:27,680
 Whether or not Marcus is telling the truth can be answered with a deep dive into that lake.

333
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,000
 But in the search for those answers

334
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:41,680
 we better pray that we don't awaken whatever is down there.

335
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:51,360
 Because out of all the alien races humans have encountered we are definitely no match for this one.
