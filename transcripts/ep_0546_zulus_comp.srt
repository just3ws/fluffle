1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 What happens when you sue the sexiest man alive?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,600
 And then we take a look at the urban legends of

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,040
 misfits

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,280
 creatures

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,600
 Monsters forming a community and living on the outskirts of town

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,800
 Almost every area has some form of this legend

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:28,160
 But what happens when one of these urban legends enrolls in your college and joins your study group today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
 *Music*

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 *Music*

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,160
 *Music*

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
 *Music*

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,880
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,300
 I hope you guys having a great day - I'm doing little pistol finger guns

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,640
 *Pistol Fingers*

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,160
 We're gonna give a shout out to one of our legacy patreon supporters gun of liberty gun of liberty

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,000
 *Pistol Fingers*

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,160
 Everyone shoot at him he has to dodge all the bullets he's a little too slow

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,000
 He's like, ah should have stopped supporting the show before I got shot gun

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,720
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode whatever vehicle we take you're in charge of you can't support the patreon

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,080
 That's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show that helps out so much so gun of liberty

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,880
 We're gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna take a little road trip. We're headed out to Collins County, Texas

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:23,320
 We're driving by a bunch of armadillos on the side of the road waving to us and has their exposed predators are eating them

23
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 They're like, ah, but we save them. I love armadillos. So we're gonna pick up a bunch of those little guys

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,480
 We're carrying them around I got big old backpack full armadillos. We're walking into this courthouse

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,920
 We walk in we see a woman standing there. That's not unusual

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,760
 There are women in Texas and sometimes they're in court. We walk in there

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,120
 We see a woman in here now. This is an ongoing legal case and I guess some of the documents have been sealed

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,620
 So we don't know her name so we're gonna call her

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,500
 Beatrice so beat and that adds just a shot in the dark if she happens to really be named Beatrice

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,760
 I'm just guessing but Beatrice is standing there and we get past security with my back full armadillos

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,760
 They let me in we're waiting for the defendant to show up

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,440
 so she's the plaintiff we're waiting for the other dude to show up and

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,400
 Then like a bunch of doves flying in like a beam of light. Whoa, it's not God

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,440
 God isn't the defendant beam of light comes in and in walks the sexiest man alive

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,980
 One of them at least according to People Magazine. It's Brad Pitt Brad Pitt walks in armadillos wrestling in my backpack

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,960
 They really want to get a good look at him Brad Pitt walks in sits in the defense area and the trial starts

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,280
 So now we're gonna do a little flashback

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,320
 What happened was back in 2018

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:43,720
 This woman Beatrice is sitting at home and she gets notified via Instagram email something like that. Hey, you don't know me

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,520
 Actually, you know me. I'm world famous superstar Brad Pitt

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,300
 But I was wondering if you could help me do this fundraiser because I have this

42
00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:00,120
 Charity that we help build houses in Katrina not in Katrina. They're building houses during the hurricane

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,120
 They're building houses. He has a time machine. He's like don't tell anyone we're building houses during Katrina. It's hilarious

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,400
 He was

45
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,760
 Building houses that were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. He has this charity. It's called making it right or something like that

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
 He asked this woman. Yeah, he pitches this idea to this woman

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,460
 Why don't you host this fundraiser for me in Collins County, Texas?

48
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,280
 And I will come out myself Brad Pitt

49
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,840
 I will show up at this fundraiser event. So, you know, well, you'll be famous. You'll get to meet me

50
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
 you know, that's always a benefit and

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,760
 We'll both make some money most of the money goes to charity, but you know, we gotta get a little something for ourselves

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,080
 So she is totally on board with this idea, right? Who's going to turn down Brad Pitt?

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,120
 So she begins a little musical montage of her like putting up flyers around town

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,780
 She's like gals. You won't believe what I'm doing

55
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,580
 You won't believe what I'm doing and they're like, what's going on Beatrice? She goes, I'm hosting a fundraiser for Brad Pitt

56
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:04,000
 She does all this marketing. She gets all these people super excited in tiny little Collins County, Texas

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,960
 Brad Pitt's coming and I don't know where Collins County is

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,800
 But I doubt it's the most happenin spot in the state

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,740
 So anyways the date comes and Beatrice is all like super excited. She's like, oh my god

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,840
 I can't wait till I meet Brad Pitt. I've only been talking to him online

61
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,000
 I haven't seen any evidence that he exists outside of a movie

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,120
 Everyone shows up except for Brad Pitt Brad Pitt does not show up and everyone's super disappointed. She's like, what happened?

63
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,480
 You know, I spent all this time doing this musical montage, you know how hard it is to pull those off

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,080
 So anyways, she emails Brad Pitt and she goes, hey, I did everything he wanted

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,700
 You didn't show up and Brad Pitt goes. Oh, I'm super sorry about that. Something came up. Something came up

66
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,200
 So there's another hurricane. I had to go build houses in the middle of it. This is not a good charity

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,660
 I should figure out something else

68
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,440
 Tell you what do it again do this again

69
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,960
 I will be there this time because we really need raise money for the charity

70
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,960
 However, I need some money like cuz you know, it's like a union thing

71
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,440
 I just can't show up places like when I go to the supermarket the cashier pays me

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,760
 I need like I need an appearance fee. So you need you wire me some money

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,200
 So you guys know where this is going you wire me some money and then I'll show up

74
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,480
 You do all the marketing again. You do what you did before do the musical montage

75
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,200
 You give me the money I'll show up and then you'll get paid back from the money we raise and all that stuff

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,840
 And she's like, okay, that makes sense. It doesn't but features goes out nailing up signs on telephone poles and stuff like that

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,640
 plastering flyers to the back of armadillos and rolling them down the street

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,400
 She does the whole rigmarole all over again

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,040
 Every layer is probably like 80% of the people are excited this time first time everyone was super excited this time people are like

80
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,720
 Yeah, no, it's the big day. They have this big fundraiser and

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,680
 80% of the people show up

82
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,640
 Brad Pitt's a no-show. She's like, oh man now everyone super disappointed in her this happens

83
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,720
 five times in total over the course of two years

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:15,600
 Somebody convinced this woman that they were Brad Pitt. They were gonna come to her town

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,320
 and she needs to basically get everyone in town together and

86
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,960
 Brad Pitt wouldn't show up now the first from what I can gather

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,160
 So she got ripped off a total of

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,440
 $40,000

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,840
 What I imagine I don't know if this is accurate because we don't have access to all the court transcripts

90
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,240
 Yeah, it'll be hilarious when we do it

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,600
 This is how I imagine it the first one was just a joke

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,320
 The first one was just someone trying to see if a person would spend two months trying to

93
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,800
 Convincing everyone Brad Pitt is going to show up

94
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,080
 I figure like it was first the joke and then someone goes hey dude

95
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,120
 You won't believe this this woman thought I was Brad Pitt and someone goes oh really and

96
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,560
 They then took on the mantle then they put on their Brad Pitt mask and was like I'm gonna take this even further

97
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
 I'm gonna get some money. I don't know they could have been built in her money out from the beginning

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But over the course of two years

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,160
 This trick worked five separate times. I would have loved to be there the fifth time

100
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,600
 To see like you're in a giant arena

101
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,240
 Everyone's expecting Brad Pitt to come in but at this point nobody in town believes Brad Pitt is actually gonna show up

102
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,160
 That would have been hilarious to sit in an empty auditorium with like three other people

103
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,040
 She didn't think it was funny. She's out $40,000. So she's suing Brad Pitt for a hundred thousand dollars

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,360
 She's suing him and his charity. She said Brad Pitt defrauded me. He kept telling me he was gonna come to my town

105
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,200
 I was sending him money and he never showed up. So I'm suing him

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,480
 Brad Pitt if Brad Pitt's response to this is wait, what what's going on? Huh?

107
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,160
 He goes I didn't know anything. I've never met this woman before in my life. I've never talked to her

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,640
 I didn't know anything was going on until my people got like court paperwork

109
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,720
 Like I have no idea what this is about and the lawyers are the ones who are saying we

110
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,520
 This is great that this is now in the legal system

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,160
 The lawyers have introduced the theory of quote fake Brad Pitt's

112
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,720
 They believe there's multiple people out there impersonating Brad Pitt who were ripping this woman off and the woman's like no

113
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,800
 It was Brad Pitt. You know like did you see him? Did you like meet him in person?

114
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,880
 Did you ever like have a video conference call?

115
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:35,640
 It was Brad Pitt and how dare you mr. Pitt for saying that we never met because you also

116
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,360
 Said you were gonna marry me

117
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,480
 At this point I can imagine the judge the bait lift everyone just kind of putting their head in their hands being like

118
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,160
 Oh my god, you got you fell for two scams at the same time

119
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,520
 You fell for the good old fashioned fake Brad Pitt scam and you fell for the marriage scam

120
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
 She actually thought she was gonna marry this dude

121
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,840
 I don't think that Brad Pitt was I mean listen. I think Brad Pitt has better things to do

122
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,080
 At this time then to rip a woman off of 40 000 dollars

123
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,400
 Although that would be hilarious

124
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,680
 If you found out like Denzel washington

125
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,160
 great actor

126
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,400
 Great family man. He's also turns out that he loves running

127
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,440
 Pyramid schemes in his spare time

128
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,960
 If you found out that he owned a bunch of like juice bars

129
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,160
 He's like, oh no, no, no you come under the juice bar and then you you buy a juice bar

130
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,120
 And then the people who go into that juice bar they have to buy a juice bar. You can't lose money

131
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,280
 Both of his fingers crossed me on his back. They're like, how do you run a juice bar?

132
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,880
 Your hands are always behind your back. He's like, I'm Denzel Washington. I can do whatever I want.

133
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 Yeah, I guess that's true. That'd be hilarious to find out that one of the biggest celebrities

134
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:52,040
 Is actually just constantly he's sitting he's putting malware on your computer because like oh thanks for calling Microsoft

135
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,880
 I can see your computer's locked up and you're like, hey, wait, wait, aren't you the guy from seven?

136
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,560
 He's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, can I get your credit card information?

137
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,480
 I don't think this court case is going to go anywhere. However, I did want to highlight it one because it is hilarious

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,680
 Two now the term fake Brad Pitt's is part of the American legal system

139
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,280
 But three gun of liberty get your guns ready because we're going to turn the lights down a little bit

140
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,160
 We're putting on our conspiracy caps. I made a joke

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,360
 Probably about 10 episodes back

142
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,440
 You guys remember this?

143
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
 about the brads

144
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:34,760
 There's a real offhand joke where I said there's a secret society of people named Brad and you can't convert

145
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,360
 You can't change your name. You have to be born a brad

146
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,960
 You can't just align yourselves with them. You only join this organization if you are born a brad. You got Brad Pitt

147
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,360
 Bradley Cooper

148
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,760
 Brad Paisley

149
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
 the brad from

150
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,040
 That guy the big old goofy guy on everyone lives Raymond and then um other brads

151
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,400
 Out there. You see and you think you're Jason. You're like, you're just joking, right? You're just joking. That's how these conspiracies start, right?

152
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,760
 That's how these conspiracies start. Everyone goes, oh man. He's just joking that guy that guy's constantly laughing on his podcast

153
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,400
 He's making it up

154
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,480
 Dude, I bet you you can follow the line back of brads

155
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,840
 I bet you you could find brads in ancient Egypt brads of the Illuminati

156
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,640
 So when we're looking at all these other groups

157
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,840
 We're going, oh, it's them. It's them. It's them. There's really right right behind you right behind you

158
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,280
 Is that big old lunkhead brad from everyone loves Raymond going like?

159
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,720
 Oh Raymond everyone loves you

160
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,360
 Because no one knows of the brads. You're like, what what how'd you get there?

161
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,560
 And he disappears in a puff of smoke the brads bro and

162
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,920
 I'll end the joke. Oh, no, it was not a joke. It's totally true. I'll end it with this

163
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
 I actually looked up the meaning

164
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,880
 I looked up the meaning of the name brad the name brad in English means

165
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,520
 Broad clearing in the woods

166
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,600
 Oh, that sounds like a place where secret societies hang out, right?

167
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:14,280
 They don't hang out in like cluttered forests think about it when you if I told you to picture picture a bunch of witches in the woods

168
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,320
 What did you picture? You pictured a clearing you pictured?

169
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,080
 A broad clearing in the woods. That's where the druids hang out. That's where a secret society would hang out, right?

170
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,560
 Their name literally means

171
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,280
 meeting place of the satanic

172
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,080
 And

173
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,360
 And stay with me brad we're getting ready to delete the show

174
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,800
 We're on to you and get this in welsh

175
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,440
 the name brad

176
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
 means treason

177
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,480
 So it's like the welsh people were aware of this brad takeover

178
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,720
 They knew that these guys were eventually going to make their move. So they declared them traitors

179
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,680
 Can you imagine being welsh and finding out that your name is brad and they're like, hey dad

180
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,400
 Uh, what what does my name mean and dad's like treason

181
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,080
 You're gonna be a traitorous scum to the human race

182
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,680
 Maybe the welsh knows something about the brad conspiracy. Maybe that's why the word rad is so popular nowadays in the year

183
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,440
 1986

184
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,640
 So be on the lookout for anyone named brad and if you get an email from a guy named brad bit asking if he can come to your home

185
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,400
 Don't do it. Actually, you know what do it do it do it because

186
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,600
 So you'd give me more stuff to talk about on

187
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,200
 I just I just read that article today and I was like just shaking my head

188
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,840
 anyways

189
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,280
 With the time we have left and talking about these two other stories, they're actually really cool

190
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:50,360
 They're actually really really good stuff and I'm glad I've kind of packaged this all together because we're getting ready to end the season

191
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 So I wanted to cover a lot of really good stuff to finish this out strong gun of liberty. Let's hop in that dead rabbit durgible

192
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,440
 We're gonna take a real quick trip to florida. We're specifically going to the florida everglade. So

193
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,200
 We're taking that durgible up. I still got a couple armadillos on me

194
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,720
 This story was actually recommended by benet. He actually went through a long time listening to the show went through and found pig

195
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,720
 People in every single state in america. I think there was only three states that didn't have them

196
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,360
 I wonder if there's one in alaska. He had gave me the list

197
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,760
 He gave me this huge list and every show i'm gonna go through

198
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,480
 That's what we're gonna pop around and check out here in the florida everglades where these

199
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,240
 Squallies is what they're known as they're not known as pig people. It's not politically correct. They're like, sir

200
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,120
 We are squallies. This is one of those interesting stories where we see real life and

201
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,280
 fiction or possible fiction collide and thanks for the recommendation

202
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,240
 In the florida and i got a lot of this information from the website phantoms and monsters as well

203
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,320
 So i want to give them a shout out also

204
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,560
 So in the florida everglades, there was actually this piece of land that was set aside for development because who doesn't want to live

205
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,840
 In the florida everglades assuming you're not a swamp witch. I don't know who would want to live there

206
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,680
 But they started to actually develop all of this property. They were calling it golden gate estates

207
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,880
 So there's actually like some roads apparently and there's some houses that were built and then they just go

208
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,520
 Why are we building them here? This is a horrible place. It stinks like a swamp

209
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:23,000
 The developers like yeah, i should have visited this place. So it's been abandoned and now it's called alligator alley because there's just like

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,600
 Alligators obviously a bunch of bears running around. I know there were bears in the swamp. How do they swim?

211
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,360
 Panthers down there. That's pretty dope a bunch of hogs running around and the squallies and the squallies

212
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,480
 So what the squallies are they're tiny little pig people

213
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,040
 Well to be specific they're tiny little people with pig snouts. So I think everything else is normal about them

214
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,840
 and at their peak

215
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
 people believed there was about

216
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
 50

217
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,960
 Of these little squallies running around now. I don't know where they got their clothes

218
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:00,280
 Maybe there are seamstresses and stuff like that. Maybe they all had like a class profession when they decided to mutate into a pig person

219
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,920
 They're like, ah, I'm a blacksmith now

220
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,760
 But apparently they had clothes and stuff like that and of course this is what's interesting because you have this is very typical for these urban legends

221
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,360
 We have a location

222
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,000
 That's remote and it's spooky because you see kind of a half developed area in the in the swamp

223
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,680
 Then you have to fill it with your imagination. You have to fill it with some sort of population in this area

224
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,840
 You came up with little pig people now you have to have an origin story

225
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,880
 And we actually have a couple of those one of them is that there was a government experiment that went wrong

226
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,720
 That that's one theory the government was trying to they're like, how do we build how do we build the perfect pig person?

227
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,000
 I can't believe that the so it's our head of us on this

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,200
 And so they are grabbing people and like taking pigs and just kind of pushing them together pushing them together until finally

229
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,760
 They morphed into one

230
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,760
 That's how genetics work during the cold war

231
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,520
 The other theory is that they're a bunch of freaks and obviously freaks, but inbred freaks

232
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,560
 So like people are banging each other and then like they're banging people are too closely related to them

233
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,360
 And this keeps going on and on and on eventually a pig person pops out and then that that's also

234
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:16,520
 Works during the cold war pig people are then banging each other and then that only begets more pig people until eventually

235
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,720
 You have a population of the squalys some people believe there's still a bunch of squalys out there

236
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 Again, this is an urban legend that you would pass around high schools elementary schools

237
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,840
 Brothers would tell their younger siblings to scare them. Oh, yeah, I saw I saw squally the other day

238
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,720
 It looked just like you. I don't look like a pig person

239
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,560
 You know all that stuff all that teasing and then of course you have the legend of the guardian

240
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,920
 You have someone looking out for him

241
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,000
 There's oh supposedly an old man out there with a shotgun that chases people on

242
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,280
 So that's why when you go to see the squalys you don't run into them

243
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,480
 You can be like, oh, maybe the guardian like made him go away or something

244
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,120
 Maybe the cardy was having a pork roast party

245
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,480
 Maybe seen a bunch of pulled porky adult squalys. Who knows?

246
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,240
 But you have these these are very very typical parts of the legend and then you have the one piece of the story

247
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,360
 Then you have a police report

248
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,560
 so supposedly back in 2011 so

249
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:16,920
 Very very recent as far as urban legends goes. This is june 14th, 2011. There was a guy named james scarborough

250
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,480
 He's riding his motorcycle down the floor to Everglades apparently it's a hydrofoil

251
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,600
 And he wrecks it probably because he's driving it through the swamp

252
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,760
 But he wrecks it and the police show up and they're like

253
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,400
 Hey, dude, what is going on? Why are you like just laying there underneath your motorcycle and he goes?

254
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,160
 I'm sure you might have told that he laid there the whole time. He's like, oh, this is kind of comfortable

255
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,400
 Hot exhaust right on his belly. He said he was driving on the road. Yeah

256
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,040
 and a boogie man

257
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,600
 Jumped out at him quote unquote boogie man. The cops are looking at each other. They're like

258
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,320
 I told you

259
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,640
 Cops like I shut up mark boogie man is not real

260
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,360
 But he said the boogie man jumped down in front of him and he wrecked his bike

261
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,880
 So he's in the general vicinity of this and people go

262
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,200
 Was it a really a little little pick person? Was it a squally?

263
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,880
 Is that what he actually saw that got in front of the motorcycle? So you have that police report

264
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,080
 Also, apparently in the police report the police report. He smelled of alcohol

265
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,040
 So whether it was a boogie man or just he was inebriated. He's like, oh, I'm trapped underneath my motorcycle cops

266
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,880
 He sees the cops cars coming up. He's like come up with the story come up with the story real real quick

267
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,360
 He's like, aha the boogie man that'll get me out of trouble

268
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,720
 This is all the hallmarks of a classic

269
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,520
 urban legend a contained

270
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,920
 Urban legend. This isn't something that you would hear about in romania or brazil

271
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,360
 But you would be very familiar with it if you lived in the florida everglades in that area

272
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,320
 Just the same thing if you lived in brazil or romania, they

273
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,160
 There would be cities in those countries that would have very contained

274
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,320
 Little urban legends like that and we got one more to check out. It's another recommendation gun of liberty fire up that carboner copter

275
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,400
 We are headed up to canada

276
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:07,400
 We're headed to huntington that is in mont reggae

277
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,320
 kubeck

278
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,840
 Canada it's a small town as of 2016. They only had about 2400 people

279
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,280
 So it's a small town, but it has a legend very much like the squally

280
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,920
 This one was actually shared with me his personal story

281
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,280
 From a patreon supporter named dave. So we're gonna wave to dave. He's kind of hanging out there

282
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,760
 He's eating some canadian cheetos and we're like, hey, what's up, bro? He's talking with his mouth full

283
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,920
 We're like, okay, you can wait till you know what the cheetos, bro

284
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:41,160
 He actually has given me a bunch of video games on steam too. So I appreciate that as well. I'm gonna play some on my vacation

285
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,360
 Takes a huge star. He's he swallows his food and he starts talking to us. He tells us this story

286
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,280
 Really interesting story

287
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,840
 Dave tells this story. So he went to high school about 50 miles away from huntington

288
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
 He's 50 miles away. He's in high school and one of his buddy starts talking about

289
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,640
 The zulus. He's like what?

290
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,160
 But he's like, oh, dude, you haven't heard about the zulus. He's like, no, I don't

291
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,800
 What are you talking about? I've heard of zulus. I know of the zulu empire, but

292
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,720
 Why are you bringing them up? He goes, no, no, no, no, no, not those zulus the zulus in huntington

293
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,280
 And davinus friends are like, what what are you just just to get to the point?

294
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,800
 We have no idea what you're talking about and their friend

295
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,920
 Tells this story about how in huntington on the outskirts of town

296
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,680
 There's a group of humans, but are they human the friend posited and paused a little too long. He says

297
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,400
 They have all white skin

298
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,080
 with

299
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,440
 White hair. It's falling out. Some of them don't have any hair at all

300
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,200
 You're thinking albinos. He's like, no, no, no. These are zulus, man

301
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,840
 They're completely white

302
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,560
 They're completely bald. They have no eyebrows. They don't even have eyelashes

303
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,040
 Their teeth are crooked

304
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,640
 Jagged in each direction. They stare at you with bluish gray eyes

305
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,760
 You're like, you're just describing an albino, right? It's like, no, no, no, they have pink eyes and

306
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,880
 Here's the most odd thing about the zulus

307
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,600
 They have no fingernails

308
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,200
 You're like, what that is kind of a weird combination of details like he's like, no, no, no, no, I'm not even done

309
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,280
 And then he adds because that's just like a physical abnormality. He goes, no, they're actually incredibly vicious as well

310
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 Inbred hillbillies is what I heard

311
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,800
 Hillbillies in Canada. I guess they have them up there too

312
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,520
 They're banging each other. See?

313
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,920
 Yeah, I know what inbred means dude. He's like, okay, I'm about to pull out a chart

314
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,160
 He goes these dudes. They're banging each other and they're having more of these little freakish zulu babies

315
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,680
 And and Dave thought this was one of the dumbest things. He was just laughed. He's like, what?

316
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,360
 Because we've all heard these urban legends growing up

317
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,880
 But usually we hear when we're like eight or nine don't go down the tunnel. That's where pennywise lives

318
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,880
 You don't say that to a 20 year old. They're like, gulp. Oh, no. I'm not going down the tunnel

319
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 You hear that when you're kids and there's only 50 miles away. So Dave's like, what? No, I don't know

320
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,920
 And he said that that became a running joke with him and his friends

321
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,440
 They'd make fun of the idea of these pale inbred hillbillies

322
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,840
 running around

323
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,680
 And kind of make fun of the friend at the same time for believing it. No, no, they're real. They're real

324
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,320
 It's getting dragged into the bush by bunch of zulus

325
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,160
 He doesn't really think about it over time and five years later

326
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,880
 He's in college and the teacher is setting everyone up with their steady buddy

327
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,400
 And it's all random. You can pick to someone he meets this guy

328
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,520
 He's super and he got one of the nicest guys you could ever meet this guy was super dope

329
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,360
 Hella chill and we're sitting there talking and we're getting you know, building the report doing notes and all that stuff

330
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,400
 He goes and then I he goes. I don't really he looked a little pale, but I really think anything of it

331
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,680
 When I got home a little light bulb being pops up. He goes wait a second

332
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,400
 He was pale

333
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,520
 He didn't have a lot of hair. He didn't have any eyebrows

334
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,720
 He didn't have any fingernails either

335
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,760
 So he's thinking listen again

336
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,360
 The guy in college was obviously not an inbred cannibal freak wasn't trying to eat him

337
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,320
 They weren't in cooking class. He's like oh, this this is my favorite class. Everyone looks so delicious

338
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,080
 This is super nice guy

339
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,880
 He goes people have albinism and things like that

340
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,160
 But it sparks him in his head and he begins to do research

341
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,760
 Which he didn't do when he was in high school and even if he had done it in high school

342
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,320
 He most likely wouldn't have found anything

343
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,920
 Because what he found was an article written

344
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,960
 In the kubek newspaper called the myth of the zulus of huntington

345
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,960
 And it was a full out investigation

346
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,120
 Into this group. It was written by marco forrier

347
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,920
 And these people are 100 real. They are not inbred. They are not

348
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,200
 Vicious cannibals. I kept adding the cannibal part. He never said anything about cannibals. They are not inbreds. They are not vicious

349
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,800
 They were a very very fascinating

350
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,960
 story of

351
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,200
 Bigotry. What happened was they believe that a french settler when he's coming over to the region

352
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,120
 Carried a gene that causes something known as

353
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,200
 Closed in syndrome and it is all of the physical markers

354
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,120
 That dave described all you don't have fingernails

355
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,880
 Hairs missing all that stuff some of them have a little more hair than others

356
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,280
 But it is 100 a very real genetic misfire

357
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,200
 It's extremely rare, but it is genetic

358
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,720
 And what would happen is and it's funny because all the time we talk about urban legends

359
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,760
 And origins and how these things work take that template even take the template for the squallies and we can put it over this one

360
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,240
 We can see how the legend is so close to the reality. What happened was you had these people who were born with this

361
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,080
 Like 150 years ago and they were ostracized

362
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,840
 And then someone else who was still in that family was ostracized and over time those people

363
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,600
 I don't know. They're not inbred. They're not inbred, but they had a distinct ancestor

364
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,400
 But if someone with claustin syndrome has a child with someone else with claustin syndrome

365
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:28,440
 There's a one and two chance the child will have claustin syndrome and because these people were purged from society

366
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,880
 They could only really have sex with other people with this disease

367
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,880
 They were pushed to a place called the back town

368
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,800
 It was between two railroad tracks in huntington

369
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,360
 If you had claustin syndrome

370
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,960
 You lived in the back town. Your neighbors had claustin syndrome. Your friends had claustin syndrome

371
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
 So when you got older your mate

372
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,720
 Had claustin syndrome

373
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,480
 The people in huntington would not let you work in any job that required you to be in the public

374
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,160
 There's one kid goes a lot of them ended up doing it work

375
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,280
 Because one kid goes I always grew up. I wanted to work at a gas station. I always thought that'd be so fun

376
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,960
 Here I am sitting sitting behind a computer making 50 000 a year. Oh no, but you know what I mean? Like people have different dreams

377
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:25,000
 I love working retail. I love working retail of walking into the place and organizing all the

378
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,840
 The merchant dot I love it. I love every aspect of working retail

379
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,040
 That was his dream, but there he was like I knew as I got older

380
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,280
 There was no way I could work with the public and he goes I'm really one of the lucky ones a lot of people with this

381
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,920
 They just became drug addicts

382
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,600
 They got spit on all the time the police used to come into this neighborhood just knock down doors

383
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,240
 because they could

384
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,960
 Other people in town would say I remember when the who didn't have claustin syndrome

385
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,600
 They go oh, I remember like on sundays my dad would get us all in the car. We drive to the back town

386
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,200
 Drive through and view all these freaks

387
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:09,240
 So in the town itself it was a knowing that these people existed, but as you got further out from huntington

388
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,280
 Yeah, no idea and and pre internet pre anyone really researching this stuff. It was just a local story

389
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,280
 Dave heard it and didn't believe it if there was no corresponding like there was no article for that

390
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,600
 Dave would have just went on thinking that even that guy wouldn't have been like, hey, you're not one of those zulus

391
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
 Are you you just thought oh this guy has

392
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,560
 Albinism and if I told you that story the first part of that story about the zulus

393
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,040
 Like I told the story of the squallies

394
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,720
 We'd go oh another weird urban legend a bunch of inbred freaks running around nowadays

395
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,120
 They've actually come a long way

396
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,760
 No, no, that's not fair to say nowadays

397
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,480
 Society has come a long way into just accepting them for what they are

398
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,480
 Because for the longest time they were considered to be the way they were because they were

399
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,120
 Syphilitic they had syphilis

400
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,120
 So you don't want to be anywhere near them. You definitely don't want to date them. So they end up dating each other

401
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:11,720
 Nowadays people go at this just some sort of medical quirk. It's a genetic quirk. We know these things happen

402
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:20,440
 And people say you know the kids today now because they would basically get beat up at school nowadays

403
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,200
 They go yeah, I get teased every once in a while. It's not as bad as my parents had it

404
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,680
 I heard my parents, you know looking them over there. He's not just doing heroin now

405
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,840
 That's my dad because they had a really rough go at it. You couldn't work

406
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,080
 You got spin on every time you walked outside. You got people

407
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,440
 50 miles away talking about you eating other people

408
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,280
 It's an interesting story and thanks day for sharing that with us

409
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,920
 It's an interesting story because it carries all the hallmarks of an urban legend and it's true

410
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,800
 There's obviously the embellishments. They weren't vicious freaks. They weren't running around eating people. That was my own embellishment

411
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 They didn't have syphilis. They are more than capable of

412
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,480
 integrating with society with society that held their hand that would say no

413
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,200
 Because they believe those rumors about them

414
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,680
 Dave who heard the story and didn't really

415
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,400
 Believe it. He thought it was fake when he came face to face with one. It didn't even cross his mind

416
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,560
 But what if Dave's friend had met that guy?

417
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
 Oh my god, you're one of those

418
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,800
 They're different reaction to that

419
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,480
 And stories like this really make us have to take another look at urban legends

420
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,200
 How many times do we hear of these stories and go? Ah, I can't be true. Aren't you big people in florida?

421
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,400
 But there probably was

422
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:43,720
 A at least a a kernel of truth to that there may have been a disfigured man or a disfigured family

423
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,040
 out there

424
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:52,840
 And one sighting became five and then five became 20 and then 20 became 50 and so on and so forth

425
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,400
 But a lot of these urban legends have some

426
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,600
 Grain of truth in them, but no one expects to go to college and meet one of them

427
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,200
 So the next time you're driving in the middle of nowhere

428
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,080
 Remember that the pig people could be real

429
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,240
 The next time you're getting into your car late at night

430
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,720
 Just remember there really may be a serial killer in the back seat

431
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 and know that

432
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,200
 When you shut that bathroom light off before you leave the bathroom

433
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,840
 And there's that quick glimmer

434
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,240
 Of something in your mirror that could be bloody mary

435
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,120
 Waiting to prove herself to you

436
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,000
 Yes, I did just come here bloody married to a group of people living in canada, but you know what I mean

437
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,760
 Urban legends are so easily dismissed as jokes to the point that you can laugh in someone's face when they tell you something

438
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,400
 But they may be right

439
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,000
 They may get the facts wrong, but the truth is often interwoven

440
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,960
 into fiction

441
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,160
