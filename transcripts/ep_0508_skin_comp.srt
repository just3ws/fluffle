1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 Did the elites of the world try to control a secret nectar and keep it from the masses?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,220
 And then we cover a disturbing story.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,160
 A story about drug addiction and body horror.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,080
 When a young couple begins smoking meth, they just use it as a supplement for their sexual

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
 activities.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,800
 But soon they find that meth is not only transforming their personalities, it's melting them from

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,800
 the inside out.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,640
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,640
 I hope you guys have a great weekend.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,680
 I hope you guys have either some cool stuff to do on the weekend or nothing to do on the

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,680
 weekend.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,200
 Cause on my days off I like to do nothing.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,880
 I just want to sit.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,400
 I just want to kind of just sit and absorb media and not move.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
 That's my day off.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,900
 But some days some guys going to be like, "Hey, hope you have a great weekend white water

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
 rafting."

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
 I'm like, "What?

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
 No, I don't like that."

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,720
 Next thing I know I'm like, "Uh, curse you Jeannie."

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,160
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Camp Counselor Steve.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,000
 Camp Counselor Steve.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,560
 You're going to be our pilot, our chauffeur this episode.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
 I guess that's probably not a compliment.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
 Hey, great.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,760
 I donated money to this dude's show.

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,920
 Now I'm his chauffeur.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
 But thank you so much.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
 You can't support the Patreon.

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
 That's fine too.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,800
 Just help get the word out about the show.

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,520
 Really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
 So Camp Counselor Steve, let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jollopi first.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,520
 We're going to take a little drive.

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,900
 Cars driving, little dotted line across the map.

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,680
 We are going to, it's a little more than a dotted line.

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,360
 We're in ancient China.

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,760
 So again, Camp Counselor Steve's like, "Oh man, I think I left my front door open.

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,160
 I thought we were just going to be gone for a minute."

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,800
 No, we drive all the way back to ancient China.

45
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,920
 There once was a deep kept secret that the elites didn't want us mere mortals to know.

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,480
 And so we're walking through the snow.

47
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,040
 We see this old Chinese dude.

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
 I don't know.

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,560
 He may have been in his 20s, but old has in the sense that this is ancient China.

50
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
 This is like 2 BC.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
 He's taking a bunch of snow and he's like thrown in his backpack.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,400
 He's like, "Hope this stays snow by the time I get down.

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,000
 Otherwise, my journey is for naught."

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
 He walks back down to the emperor and the emperor's like, "Do you have my snow?"

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,880
 And the explorer throws his back down.

56
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,760
 Actually, he's probably more polite than that.

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,240
 He's like, "Here's your snow."

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,200
 He gives it gently to the emperor and the emperor's like, "Yes.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
 This is what we must keep from the mortals."

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
 When George Washington became president, there was a little bit of a time jump there.

61
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
 Camp counselor Steve was like, "What?

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,400
 We just magically appeared in old timey colonial clothes?"

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,680
 "Yes, we did."

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,640
 When George Washington was president, he said, "I want to have a lavish party."

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,920
 And these people are writing down notes like lavish party.

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
 And he's like, "And I want it to have the secret."

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
 And everyone's like, "Mm-hmm."

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 And they all wink at each other.

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,380
 At the same time, a lot of confusion.

70
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,960
 People thought they were being flirted with.

71
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,320
 But no, they were like, "Hmm, the secret."

72
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,880
 "Shhh, secret."

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,800
 When he died, he spent $200 on this secret concoction at the time, which would be like

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,160
 5,600 in today money, right?

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,800
 Which he really still isn't even that much.

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,280
 And I was like, "$200 in George Washington?

77
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
 That must be like 100,000 a day."

78
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
 And I was like, "Oh, just 5,600."

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 That's like a car.

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
 That's like a used car.

81
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,180
 Nice flex, George Washington.

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,200
 But when he died, they found tools that he used to personally make this concoction.

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
 It had been passed down.

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,360
 It's not like the ancient Chinese emperor was like, "Hey, George Washington, here you

85
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
 go."

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
 It had been passed down through the ages.

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,480
 And at one time or another, the masses started to get just the taste of this.

88
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,640
 But it was so expensive to make.

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,600
 The ingredients were so rare, really.

90
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,000
 I mean, other than the snow on the mountain.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,840
 It was really hard for the commoner to get it.

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,800
 So what was that ancient concoction?

93
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,740
 Well, my friends, bing!

94
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,860
 Now we're standing in a ice cream shop.

95
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,660
 You're like, "Jason, are you just telling us trivia about ice cream?"

96
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
 No.

97
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
 Well, yes.

98
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,940
 But there's two reasons why I'm doing this.

99
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,540
 So we're standing in this ice cream shop and there's a guy behind the counter.

100
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,660
 It's President George Washington.

101
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,900
 He's been reincarnated as a soda jerk.

102
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,860
 Those are the guys who would put ice cream and stuff and then put a little soda in it.

103
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
 Hand it to us.

104
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
 So we're drinking ice cream sodas.

105
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,640
 It's really interesting, at least to me.

106
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,200
 Ice cream, I was out having ice cream with Sabine the other day and this is how I am.

107
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,880
 I go, I'm like, "Lick.

108
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 Lick.

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
 Lick."

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,000
 And then I go, "I wonder when ice cream was invented.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,320
 Like I can never shut my brain off."

112
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,800
 Sabine's like, "I don't know."

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,000
 Like probably when people had access, you would need ice, which was hard to get for

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,760
 a long time, like mass shipping of ice and butter and stuff like that.

115
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
 And I go, "Hmm."

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,480
 And I went home and I looked it up and I found from the International Dairy Foods Association

117
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
 I found all this information.

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,860
 I found their one-sided information.

119
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
 There's some insider.

120
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,100
 He's going to email me later.

121
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,940
 He's like, "Oh, you don't know half the truth."

122
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,060
 And starts sending me all these diagrams.

123
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,260
 It was invented in the 2BC and that was just basically those gross snow cones where they

124
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,660
 would take snow and then put honey on it and they eat it and stuff like that.

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,460
 And it went like, the Romans had it and in the medieval ages they had it.

126
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,880
 And it wasn't until about the 1500s that we actually had ice cream where it was like

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
 milk.

128
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,400
 Milk were its actual dairy product.

129
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,760
 Before that there were a bunch of losers that just had to eat ice with gross toppings

130
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
 on it.

131
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,360
 The 1500s they were able to add the cream and the sugar and all that stuff.

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,360
 But even then it wasn't even available to the public until 1660.

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,320
 And it was still very expensive.

134
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,760
 Like the chances of, there were people who lived and died that never ever tasted ice cream.

135
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,220
 Now to be fair, there were people who lived and died that you haven't done a lot of things.

136
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,660
 But ice cream just seems so normal, right?

137
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,860
 It seems like something that everyone should do.

138
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,780
 When a baby's born, here you go.

139
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,460
 Entire generations died without even knowing that ice cream existed.

140
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,380
 But anyway, even when it did exist people couldn't get it.

141
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,660
 So here's one more bit of ice cream trivia.

142
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
 I thought this was interesting.

143
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,220
 Because again, we're talking about conspiracies, right?

144
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,620
 We're all at this ice cream shop.

145
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,360
 And then we're drinking these ice cream sodas.

146
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,760
 It's soda water with ice cream in it.

147
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
 And the door gets kicked open.

148
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,920
 We're like, "Ugh!"

149
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,680
 And it's a bunch of religious leaders.

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
 And then at that point we look at the clock and that doesn't tell us anything.

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,480
 So we look at a calendar and it's Sunday.

152
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,560
 And these religious leaders go, "You shouldn't be drinking that stuff."

153
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,840
 They're like knocking it out of our hands.

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,040
 And we're like, "Whoa, whoa, we don't want any trouble, clergy."

155
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,800
 They have leather jackets.

156
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,800
 What happened was in 1874 you had the religious community thought you should not drink something

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,060
 so rich and sinful on a Sunday.

158
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,180
 But these places are super popular.

159
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,460
 I mean, George Washington's working at one for crying out loud.

160
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
 That's a good sign.

161
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,620
 So people were going seven days a week to be drinking at these soda shops, these ice cream

162
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,620
 sodas.

163
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,100
 And the religious leader said, "No one should do anything so sinful."

164
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,240
 And that delicious, that creamy, delicious soda, "No, I must resist.

165
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
 I must resist."

166
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,080
 You can't drink that on Sundays.

167
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,280
 So then the ice cream, the ice cream, the Illuminati got together and they go, "We'll

168
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,920
 show them."

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,280
 They created the Sunday, which was just scoops of ice cream.

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,480
 It was syrup on them, like chocolate syrup.

171
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,440
 And that is why that's called a Sunday.

172
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,320
 Eventually they changed the Y to an E, how it's spelled today, because the religious

173
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,020
 controversy had ended.

174
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,640
 But that's why it's called a Sunday.

175
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,360
 Because it was basically a, "You can't tell us what to eat."

176
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,380
 Technically they did because they stopped serving it with the soda.

177
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,560
 The religious problem was specifically with the soda and the ice cream.

178
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,040
 So they started serving ice cream, no soda, with syrup on it, and that was called a Sunday.

179
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,680
 Oh, and one last bit of trivia.

180
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,160
 During World War II, so you know this is the second one, right?

181
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,320
 During World War II, you had the different branches of the U.S. military.

182
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
 They had a war.

183
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,560
 They had an internal war.

184
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,520
 So not only did you have the World War going on, you had this internal war.

185
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,600
 Each branch of the military was trying to figure out the best ice cream bar.

186
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,480
 Like they wanted to be able to serve their men like the most toppings available.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 As like they're like, "Sir, sir, we need to get these fuel lines.

188
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,680
 We need to get the Germans have blown up our transportation lines."

189
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
 She's like, "Shut up!

190
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,000
 Do we use the chocolate sprinkles or the multicolored sprinkles?"

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,720
 They're like, "Ah, general patents, slapping soda jerks."

192
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,600
 They had this huge war over who could serve the best ice cream to the point that in the

193
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,240
 Pacific front, where we were fighting the Japanese, there was a floating ice cream bar.

194
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,040
 Now, I don't think it was just like one dude.

195
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,400
 I don't think it was like a dingy.

196
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,400
 I think it was probably like a pretty sizable boat.

197
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,320
 I don't know if it was all ice cream, actually.

198
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 They're like, "Sir, sir, protect the ice cream."

199
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,240
 Like Kamikaze playing crashes into the ice cream bar, just gets stuck in the ice cream.

200
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
 The pilot gets out and starts eating some.

201
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,480
 "No, they've taken our resources."

202
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,640
 I don't know if it was, they dedicated a single destroyer to serve nothing but ice cream.

203
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
 It's shooting out chocolate syrup.

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,960
 I think on one of their existing ships, they just happened to have an ice cream bar, but

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
 it is true.

206
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
 They did.

207
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,040
 Each branch of the military would get in fights over who could serve the best ice cream bar.

208
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,640
 And George Washington wipes a little tear away from his face and he goes, "I always

209
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,200
 knew being reincarnated as a soda jerk would make me proud to be an American once again."

210
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,760
 And he's just floating over the Pacific battle and planes are blowing up, but the ice cream

211
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
 is safe.

212
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,360
 The reason why I wanted to tell this story is one, I found it very fascinating.

213
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,280
 I found all that ice cream stuff fascinating.

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,240
 Secondly, because this next story is gross.

215
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,280
 This next story, "Enjoy your ice cream now," is what I'm saying.

216
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,440
 "Enjoy your light-filled, happy memories of George Washington, transparent George Washington,

217
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,000
 revenue ice cream, and your time in the Pacific eating ice cream as war is raging around you."

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,160
 Think about those happy memories as we move to this next story.

219
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,760
 Hey everyone, I'm back.

220
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
 I'm back.

221
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,720
 I can run in around the corner and everyone's like, "What did I even know you were gone?

222
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,280
 You were just eating ice cream with us."

223
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,400
 I actually took a break after I recorded that story.

224
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
 I went for a jog.

225
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,520
 I started doing intermittent fasting.

226
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,920
 I've moved away from the keto because I think I've kind of hit the limit of what I can lose

227
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
 on that.

228
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
 I can eat fast.

229
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,240
 I only eat between noon and 6 PM.

230
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,000
 I can go up to 8 PM as my official window, but I'm usually eating dinner pretty early.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'm jogging.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,120
 You can just eat a bunch of ice cream.

233
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 That's the cool thing about intermittent fasting, as opposed to keto.

234
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,160
 If I want ice cream, as long as it's the right amount of calories and stuff, I can treat myself

235
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
 to some ice cream.

236
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,520
 And Camp Counselor Steve paid for all of our ice cream, so we're good.

237
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,360
 I can eat as many calories of ice cream as I want as long as someone else is paying for

238
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 it.

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,680
 So, Steve, let's hop in that carbonicopter.

240
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,880
 We're done jogging.

241
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,120
 We're leaving behind the ice cream stand.

242
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,800
 George Washington's ghost is waving to us.

243
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,320
 We're headed out to an American city.

244
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
 And in this American city sits an apartment complex.

245
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
 We're going to land on the roof.

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,840
 We're going to enter this apartment complex.

247
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,080
 And in this complex, we are going to meet a young couple.

248
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
 "Hey guys, what's up?"

249
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,240
 And they wave back to us.

250
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,120
 We don't have the real names of these people.

251
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,080
 So we'll call the woman Brittany, the husband Tom, and the son we'll call Barrett.

252
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,840
 So if those are the real names, it's just the shot in the dark.

253
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,720
 This story comes from a website called AeroWid, which before I found out, I've always had

254
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,280
 a fascinating, I don't use like hard drugs and I used to smoke weed and stuff like that

255
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 way back in the day.

256
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,840
 But I always have a fascination with drug stories, with the effects and how people are

257
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
 going through it.

258
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
 Particularly bad drug stories.

259
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,560
 I don't want to hear about, "Oh yeah dude, I took LSD and everything was normal."

260
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
 I want to hear that, right?

261
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,000
 I want to hear about like really trippy horror stories, right?

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
 Horror stories involving drugs.

263
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,640
 There is a website called AeroWid, which I'm sure a lot of you guys are familiar with.

264
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,000
 It's a very, very popular website.

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,720
 It doesn't seem to be as active as it used to be, but I used to, "Oh dude, I used to

266
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,840
 just consume it.

267
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,040
 I was just like this monster.

268
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,000
 Give me your horrible experiences.

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
 Let me eat them."

270
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,960
 Any drug you can think of, this website, it's very informative and has a lot of harm reduction

271
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
 stuff to it.

272
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
 But it also has reviews.

273
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,920
 Basically right, and you guys know I love reading reviews.

274
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
 What's better than a Yelp review?

275
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
 A Yelp review for methamphetamine.

276
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,120
 So AeroWid has all of these experiences or trip reports a lot, I believe is the technical

277
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
 term.

278
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,160
 And back in 2007, there was a trip report posted on there called "Skin."

279
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
 And I remember reading it.

280
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,120
 I don't know if I read it right when it came out, but I read it about 10 years ago.

281
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,480
 I read it a while ago.

282
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
 It's almost iconic.

283
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,160
 You either have red skin or you're going to hear it now.

284
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,840
 Because this story is 100% pure body horror.

285
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,680
 We're walking through this apartment complex and we see this couple.

286
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,760
 We see Brittany, Tom, and Barrett.

287
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,440
 We just kind of wave to them.

288
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
 They wave to us and they go into their apartment.

289
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,280
 This New Year's Eve 2006.

290
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,880
 I'm assuming they were casual drug users because if someone came up to me and said, "Hey, you

291
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,840
 know, meth makes sex feel really good."

292
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,160
 I'd be like, "Fine, fact of the day.

293
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
 Go about my business."

294
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,720
 But Brittany, because I'm not a psychonaut, I'm not someone who wants to go and explore

295
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,240
 drug use and stuff like that.

296
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,760
 I'll read the reviews, right?

297
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,240
 I'll read the reviews.

298
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,440
 But Brittany and Tom had been hearing for a while that methamphetamine makes sex feel

299
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
 so much better.

300
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,200
 For them, they said, "Hey, let's try it.

301
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,880
 New Year's Eve, let's smoke some crystal meth and have sex."

302
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
 Because we hear so many good reviews about it on Yelp.

303
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 So they do.

304
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,760
 They smoke meth and Brittany says, "The sex was amazing."

305
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,680
 It was just exactly what the rumors were.

306
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,360
 When she woke up to go to work the next day, she had a little bit of meth left.

307
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,680
 Smoke that went to work.

308
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,480
 But when she comes home from work, there's a gram of meth.

309
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,320
 Her boyfriend went and copped some more.

310
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,200
 And that would be the beginning of them smoking every single day for about two months.

311
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,000
 And when I say every day, multiple times a day.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,480
 They may have started off just smoking it in the morning, but as the story progresses,

313
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,000
 they're smoking lots of crystal meth.

314
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,520
 By the time three weeks pass, she starts to notice something wrong with her skin.

315
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
 It's brittle.

316
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,320
 It's like paper almost.

317
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,840
 Now, it's not falling apart, but it just feels like it's lost some of its firmness.

318
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,680
 But that's not the only thing.

319
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,480
 That's not the only thing that's going wrong with this young mother.

320
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,440
 Her body's starting to swell.

321
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
 This is happening at the same time she's severely dehydrated from her continual use of meth.

322
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,240
 Because we're three weeks now, if her using it constantly.

323
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,320
 Her and Tom are using it constantly.

324
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,400
 So she's extremely dehydrated.

325
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,000
 She's drinking tons of water, but she can't urinate.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,680
 Or she urinates so infrequently, she realizes, wait a second.

327
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,040
 All this water I'm drinking has to be going somewhere and must be making me bloated.

328
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,100
 So she begins taking a diuretic to help flush the water out of her system.

329
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,600
 But it's not working.

330
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,720
 She's continuing to use meth.

331
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,160
 She's continuing to drink a ton of water.

332
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,080
 And every day she swells just a little bit more.

333
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,040
 And then one day she notices something when she wakes up.

334
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,720
 She kind of pushes down on her arm.

335
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,520
 It's not just bloated anymore.

336
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,880
 Underneath her skin, her muscles begin to feel doughy.

337
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,360
 Not even really her muscles.

338
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,640
 She said it was like in between her flesh and her muscles was a layer of play-doh.

339
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,880
 And she could actually squeeze her arm or squeeze her leg.

340
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,200
 And she could feel clay underneath.

341
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,640
 Brittany and Tom continue to smoke meth.

342
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,960
 She's turning into a putty from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but that's not going to stop

343
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,600
 you, right?

344
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,480
 They continue to smoke meth.

345
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,240
 And then one day, eventually at a certain point you would just stop wanting to wake

346
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 up, right?

347
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,800
 Because every day she wakes up something disgusting happens.

348
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,040
 One day she's looking at her arm and she sees black little pieces of dirt on her skin.

349
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
 So she brushes it away.

350
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,680
 It doesn't really think much of it.

351
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,200
 I need a shower.

352
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
 Brushes it away.

353
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
 But she continues to see these black dots.

354
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,960
 When she talks to Tom about it, she says, "Can you check?

355
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
 Can you see what's going on?

356
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
 Like I don't...

357
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,400
 I got this stuff on my arms.

358
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
 I got it on my chest.

359
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 I don't know what it is."

360
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 She takes her shirt off.

361
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,640
 She asks her husband to take a look.

362
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,760
 It's on her back as well.

363
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:11,520
 And when he touches her, he can actually press more of this black byproduct out of her skin.

364
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,080
 Now she has it too, she discovers.

365
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
 He's getting it too.

366
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,320
 Now they had this massage oil around because these guys were total freaks, right?

367
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,800
 They basically love sex so much that they're like, "Let's do a toxin to make sex feel better."

368
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 Not saying if you have a massage...

369
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,520
 There's a massage artist out there.

370
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
 What do they call it?

371
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
 Masseuse?

372
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
 They're like, "What?

373
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
 I have massage oil.

374
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 I'm not a freak unless you come over, Jason."

375
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
 And I'm like, "Ugh."

376
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,920
 But not everyone who owns massage oil is a freak, but every freak owns massage oil.

377
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
 How's that?

378
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,240
 So they realize if they push on the muscles, the black dust, the black flakes will come

379
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,680
 out of the pores.

380
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
 So there you go.

381
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
 This has to be a toxin.

382
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,400
 Okay, if anything to do with the meth we're smoking, let's not stop smoking that meth.

383
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,640
 Let's continue to smoke meth, but we'll give each other massages at night.

384
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,760
 And Brittany would lie down and Tom would crawl on top and give her a back massage and

385
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,320
 he could just push.

386
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,360
 Ugh, work those muscles and this black, unknown substance would come out of her pores.

387
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,040
 She would do the same to him, give him a massage, and she would massage this toxin out of his

388
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 body.

389
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,800
 They got to the point though where they didn't necessarily have to push on it.

390
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,960
 Whatever this substance was, it was also heat activated.

391
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,720
 If they got really hot and sweaty, they'd be outside working, they'd look at their arm,

392
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,400
 there'd be a black grime coming out of their skin.

393
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,320
 Taking a hot shower, standing under the water, this black dust would just pour out of them

394
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,880
 into the drain.

395
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,440
 Now obviously there's something wrong with their bodies, right?

396
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,240
 So what's the worst thing that they can do?

397
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
 Let's get someone else involved in this horrible disgustiness.

398
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,800
 This apartment complex has a sauna and we're sitting in the sauna, we've got our towels

399
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,880
 on, I'm eating ice cream, eating ice cream in the sauna, I've got to eat it quick before

400
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,840
 it melts, and Tom and Brittany walk into the sauna.

401
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,480
 We're like, hey guys, what's up?

402
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,560
 We've been a couple of weeks since we've seen you.

403
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
 Is everything okay?

404
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,400
 You look a little off and they're like, oh no, no, we're fine, we're fine.

405
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,600
 We just come into the sauna because it's hot in here and their eyes shift side to side

406
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,400
 and we're like, yeah, we know it's hot and it's nice, but what's that smell?

407
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,920
 And they're like, what?

408
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,600
 I don't know, it smelled like that when we came in here.

409
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,040
 As they would sit in the sauna, this black substance would just come out of them.

410
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,440
 The sauna opened their pores up enough that they would begin to leak it.

411
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,160
 It made the sauna have a stench of ammonia.

412
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,760
 Now this is a communal sauna, remember?

413
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,640
 This is a communal sauna.

414
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,160
 They would use the sauna for an hour at a time, four times a day, if not more.

415
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,280
 They would just sit in there and sweat and let this toxin come out of their body because

416
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,280
 they knew whatever this was, it shouldn't be inside of them.

417
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,440
 It shouldn't be inside of them.

418
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,800
 They wanted to get it out as quickly as possible.

419
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,200
 It's February 2007.

420
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,720
 It's been two months since their first hit of meth and this is their life now.

421
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,440
 Brittany has lost 20 pounds.

422
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,880
 Tom has lost 30 pounds.

423
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,040
 One day Brittany's sitting in the sauna.

424
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,400
 She wants this black ooze out of her.

425
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,120
 That's on her calendar for the day.

426
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,000
 Her blackberry ding.

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Get black goo out.

428
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And she's like, oh, I almost forgot.

429
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,520
 I almost forgot about this disgusting illness inside of me.

430
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,300
 Brittany goes into the sauna by herself and she's sitting there.

431
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,200
 That heavy hot air surrounding her body, she notices something coming out of her skin,

432
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,280
 which shouldn't be notable, right?

433
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,960
 That's kind of the flavor du jour.

434
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,880
 But this time it's not this black substance.

435
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,360
 It's a white grayish goo leaking out of her.

436
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,560
 Before it would just be black flakes that you could kind of squeeze out.

437
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,720
 It would be like if your arm was perpetually dirty.

438
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,240
 This was like Crisco pouring out of her body.

439
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,600
 Her pores would just open up and this gelatinous ooze.

440
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,440
 She said tablespoons worth.

441
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
 This wasn't a nice sheen.

442
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,960
 It didn't look like she just got out of the shower or the sauna.

443
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,480
 This was a slick, slimy substance.

444
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,680
 She said it was just coming out of her.

445
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
 Out of everywhere.

446
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,400
 She said it was like, quote, "Plato through a garlic press."

447
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,480
 Unquote.

448
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
 This episode sponsored by Plato, by the way.

449
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,080
 She could just see it lift up out of her skin.

450
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,720
 Tablespoons worth.

451
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,280
 Just Crisco coming out of her.

452
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,240
 She lost eight pounds in one hour in the sauna that day.

453
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,680
 Now she thinks that it's the fat coming out of her body.

454
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,520
 When you lose weight, the fat is secreted through your urine.

455
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,560
 But remember, she's not able to really urinate.

456
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,600
 And even then, I don't think the fat's just like, "Well, I don't have anywhere to go."

457
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
 They jump out your pores.

458
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,320
 I think the fat would cause some medical problems.

459
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,040
 But I don't think if you put a plug in your pee hole and then said, "I'm not eating."

460
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,280
 You would basically just be, you wouldn't be Plato in a garlic press.

461
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,400
 You might just die.

462
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,680
 Your kidneys might just not function.

463
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,520
 But anyways, she at this point thinks this Crisco, it's sponsored by Crisco too, this

464
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,040
 Crisco greasy substance coming out of my pores is me burning fat.

465
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,240
 The swelling is even worse now.

466
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,600
 She'll wake up in the morning and she can feel how bloated she is.

467
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,760
 Her skin is bruising.

468
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,240
 Whatever's building up inside of her is pressing so hard against her skin, it's threatening

469
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,960
 to rip it.

470
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,400
 It's busting blood vessels.

471
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,120
 Her head begins to swell.

472
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,560
 The thin layer between her skin and her skull begin to fill up with whatever this was.

473
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,000
 She said if she brushed her hand through her hair, by the time she got to the back of her

474
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,040
 head, her hair was soaking wet.

475
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:16,120
 She could push out this white gray ooze just right out of her scalp to the point of drenching

476
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,280
 her hair.

477
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,760
 Her body was full of it everywhere at all times.

478
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,160
 On top of that, there's psychological problems going on.

479
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,400
 She says she would be up for 3-4 days.

480
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,720
 That's why I'm thinking they were smoking a lot.

481
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,120
 Because if you just smoked once in the morning, you're going to be buzzing for a while.

482
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,640
 But to do that actual 3-4 day meth head thing, you have to keep re-dosing.

483
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,520
 She's up for 3-4 days and she said she'd sleep for about an hour and then she'd be good to

484
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
 go.

485
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,040
 To the point where when she was at work, she had a job this whole time surprisingly.

486
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,840
 Hopefully she didn't work at a sauna.

487
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,800
 She had a job at this whole time and she said she'd be at work.

488
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,440
 She was customer service and she would be talking to a customer and the next thing

489
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,040
 she knew, she'd wake up.

490
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
 She would have micro sleep.

491
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,960
 She would fall asleep in a heartbeat and then wake back up and the customer would be like,

492
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
 "What?"

493
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,720
 She's like, "Oh, you must have noticed I was asleep.

494
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,480
 Better brush my hair back."

495
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,840
 How do you keep a job when you're leaking flu?

496
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
 How do you do that?

497
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,880
 It must have been a job at an ice cream shop.

498
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,600
 It must have been super cold all the time.

499
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
 She's like, "Oh, you want butterscotch, eh?"

500
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
 She puts over to get the ice cream.

501
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,760
 Goose falling out of her hair into the ice cream.

502
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
 Here you go.

503
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
 Kids are like, "Yay!"

504
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,680
 Eventually, they go to the sauna.

505
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,120
 Her and Tom go to the sauna and someone's standing there and is like, "Uh-uh, you're banned from

506
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
 the sauna."

507
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
 They're like, "What?

508
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
 What are you talking about?

509
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
 What are you talking about?"

510
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,720
 And they go, "Well, it might just be a coincidence, but every time you've been using it an hour

511
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,480
 a day, four or five times a day, and every time you leave, the next person who would come

512
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,240
 in would be choked by the smell of ammonia."

513
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
 "What?

514
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,720
 That's not us!

515
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,400
 Ma'am, you smell like ammonia right now.

516
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
 What?

517
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 Uh-uh, no, I don't."

518
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,360
 They're plugging the guy's nose, see?

519
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
 Take a big whiff.

520
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
 You can't smell anything.

521
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,280
 They were banned from the sauna, so that was their big way of helping to get this goo out

522
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
 of them.

523
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,120
 Now, they're restricted to only using the hot showers at their apartment.

524
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,320
 One day, Brittany is taking a shower alone, that hot, hot water on her skin and she can

525
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
 push the goo out.

526
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,000
 "Ugh, get out.

527
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Ugh."

528
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,880
 But she falls asleep in the shower.

529
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,600
 She'd been up too long and her body just gave up.

530
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,000
 She actually falls asleep in the shower.

531
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,840
 And when she wakes up, she's laying there in the bathtub.

532
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,520
 The hot water had been pouring on her body for who knows how long.

533
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:40,800
 And there is a puddle of this gray, white liquid surrounding her body.

534
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,000
 While she was asleep, it just began pouring out of her, leaking out of wherever it could

535
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,080
 come out.

536
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,720
 She turns the water off and weakly gets out of the shower.

537
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,720
 And that's when she realizes that the position she was in caused all of this Crisco-like,

538
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,520
 fat, Play-Doh fluid, this thick, white gelatin to coalesce in her abdomen.

539
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,080
 Imagine if you had like a bag, 'cause I don't have to give you an imagination thing, but

540
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,380
 I'm gonna, anyways.

541
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,920
 Imagine you had a bag of gravy and you held it up by both ends of the bag, how all the

542
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,400
 gravy would just settle into the middle.

543
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,080
 She was that bag of gravy.

544
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,320
 So she gets out and she can feel all the goo that had been in her extremities in her chest

545
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,320
 had leaked in to her abdomen.

546
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,480
 And it's extremely painful.

547
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,480
 It's congealed in there, it's all stuck, and she can feel it in her pelvic region as well.

548
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,740
 She has this intense need to urinate.

549
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,340
 Whether it was to expel the urine or to simply unplug something, she didn't know, she didn't

550
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,900
 care, she had to urinate.

551
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:59,380
 And she sat there and she pushed and she pushed and she pushed and then a hard chunk that

552
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,180
 had congealed in her urethra.

553
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
 Bleurgh.

554
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,880
 You like that sound effect?

555
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,840
 Comes out of her and splashes into the toilet water.

556
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,160
 After this shower, and again we don't know how long she was in the shower for, she doesn't

557
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,240
 know either.

558
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,040
 Whatever substance was inside of her was completely melted loose.

559
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,660
 Before she could sit in the sauna and would come out of the pores, she could push on it

560
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,840
 to get more of it out.

561
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,140
 Now it's coming out of her eyeballs.

562
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,280
 It's coming out of her ears.

563
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,640
 It's coming out of her nose.

564
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,020
 It's coming out of her vagina, but that's preferable to where else it's coming out of.

565
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,400
 She could feel it in her throat.

566
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,100
 She said sometimes she could spit it out of her mouth.

567
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:52,820
 She'd spit out speckles of this fluid, but sometimes it was so thick she just had to

568
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,460
 swallow it.

569
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,720
 She would feel it start clogging up her throat.

570
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,780
 She tried to spit.

571
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,780
 She tried to cough, but she couldn't.

572
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,100
 She had to swallow it down.

573
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,420
 It's no longer limited to her pores.

574
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:11,980
 It's now loose in her body, coming out of every single orifice that it can.

575
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,900
 She's lost a total of 50 pounds since December 31st.

576
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,260
 It's March.

577
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,940
 She begins having this delusion because she knows that this is not normal meth behavior.

578
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,020
 Nobody would ever do meth ever.

579
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,860
 The sex is really good, but eventually you turn to Play-Doh.

580
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,020
 No one would ever do meth if this was true.

581
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,860
 She begins to have this delusion.

582
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,580
 She believed that her drug dealer wasn't giving them methamphetamines.

583
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,740
 He was giving them something else.

584
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,100
 It had the same initial effects of meth, but it was highly addictive and had these horrible

585
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,100
 body-altering side effects.

586
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,020
 She believed that the drug dealer would actually sell this meth and he would smoke it and get

587
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,340
 addicted to it and couldn't stop using it.

588
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,380
 She believed that at some point after enough time had passed, the drug dealer was going

589
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,180
 to break into their apartment.

590
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:10,460
 She imagined herself being chained up in a basement with his past customers.

591
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:17,940
 Each of them with a meth pipe being held to their lips, forcing them to inhale.

592
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,740
 And then the drug dealer would come down each night and he would scrape the goo off of their

593
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,420
 skin, dry it out, and sell it as a methamphetamine.

594
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,180
 She believed the liquids and the black dirt and all of that stuff coming out of her body

595
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,980
 were drugs that were then to be sold to other people.

596
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:44,020
 The drug dealer was actually transforming her into a recreational drug.

597
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,300
 This delusion haunted her.

598
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,740
 It was really the only thing she could think of to be rational of anything that's going

599
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
 on.

600
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:57,140
 On being turned into a drug, but the whole time she doesn't stop smoking.

601
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,660
 She wakes up her eyes crusty with goo.

602
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:08,900
 She's at work trying to concentrate but swallowing tablespoons of an unknown liquid before it

603
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,300
 can choke her.

604
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,220
 All of this ends when the drug dealer gets arrested.

605
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,940
 Before she can score any more meth, she crashes for 3 days.

606
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,620
 And apparently the husband didn't really try that hard because when she woke up 3 days

607
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,340
 later he goes "I couldn't find any meth."

608
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,460
 She said that "I know this must sound like meth psychosis, but after I was sober I was

609
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,260
 still cleaning this stuff up out of my bathtub.

610
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,980
 It's been weeks since the last time I used and I'm still cleaning up my bathroom.

611
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,460
 I'm looking at it now.

612
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,740
 I haven't used meth in a while.

613
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
 I can still see the physical proof of this.

614
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
 So this isn't meth psychosis."

615
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,100
 There were some issues in the story where Tom began physically abusing Brittany and where

616
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,620
 Brittany began neglecting their son.

617
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,300
 At one point she says "My son went a whole day.

618
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,820
 I forgot to feed him."

619
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:08,740
 So the house was chaos, where before it wasn't.

620
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,020
 That's how quickly this drug destroyed that life.

621
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,900
 Let me read you the ending of this story.

622
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,340
 "My husband and I haven't done any drugs at all for four weeks and things are slowly

623
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,260
 going back to normal.

624
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,740
 My son is happy.

625
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,100
 He has his mother back and his daddy plays with him again.

626
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,780
 I'm happy because I'm not so afraid anymore.

627
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,740
 Not afraid of my husband or of dying painfully in the near future.

628
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,140
 We're happy because we've nearly paid all the bills we neglected and have cable TV again.

629
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,500
 We are happy because we resemble the normal, healthy family we once were.

630
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,580
 But I still want it.

631
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,580
 I can't sleep tonight because I want it.

632
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,460
 I wrote this in all honesty, mostly to help myself, to remind myself why I don't want

633
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,340
 it and I still want it."

634
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,140
 So we don't know if she ever stayed away from methamphetamine.

635
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,700
 The story was written in 2007 by unspun was the user's name, but we don't know who wrote

636
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,700
 this.

637
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,140
 We don't know what city it took place in.

638
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,940
 So it's possible, hopefully, right, that she was able to write this out and it reminded

639
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,660
 her of why she should never do meth again.

640
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
 And she goes back to it.

641
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,900
 She may be checking that post even today when she gets something in her head and goes, "Oh,

642
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,620
 you know, I really like the energy.

643
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,220
 The sex was good."

644
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,820
 She may have to return to this post to remind herself why she should never do meth again.

645
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,260
 Or she may have never done meth in the first place.

646
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,100
 This may have been something else.

647
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,860
 Because there is nothing else in the meth literature that I've ever come across that

648
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,780
 even comes close to this.

649
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,460
 It's possible that even if she didn't want to start smoking meth again, it would not

650
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,700
 have any of these effects.

651
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:56,740
 But there's also another option that that drug dealer, like all drug dealers do, eventually

652
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,220
 gets out of jail.

653
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,780
 And he comes to her apartment when she's alone with a little sample of his drug.

654
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,940
 Without Tom's knowledge, because she knows how much he loves the happy family dynamic,

655
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,820
 she begins using again.

656
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,740
 Just here and there, nothing serious.

657
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,740
 And then she goes missing.

658
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,300
 One of a hundred thousand people that goes missing every year in America.

659
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,260
 If Brittany ever did start smoking that drug dealer supply again, she could be, right now,

660
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,180
 13 years later, in some basement somewhere.

661
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:41,580
 Barely alive, a skeleton of the woman she once was, as a man slowly scrapes her skin,

662
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:50,020
 her bruised, parchment-like skin, getting every drop of fluid out for his next batch.

663
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,820
 And while she sits in that basement, she doesn't think about her husband, she doesn't think

664
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,500
 about her son, she doesn't think about the pain of her skin being pressed against, all

665
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,540
 she can think about is when will she get another hit of her drug.

666
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,420
 Because even in the end, she still wants it.

667
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:16,700
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.
