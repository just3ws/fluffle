00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
 Hey guys, I'm going to give you a real quick sneak peek of episode 666 that comes out tonight

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,960
 on Dead Ravra Radio and I'm telling you, this is not a lark.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,040
 I don't know what was going on during the recording process.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,920
 I was recording it in the haunted closet as I normally do.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,680
 And first I thought it was me shuffling around in my chair.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,080
 I had recorded a lot of stuff that day.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
 Maybe it was uneasy but throughout the editing process and it gets worse through the episode

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,960
 there's wrestling in the closet.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,520
 And this particular segment you're about to hear, you'll hear first off a set of three

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,280
 knocks and then a weird sound.

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,920
 And then I continue on because I'm not hearing anything in the closet while I'm talking.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
 And then you'll hear me continue talking and then you'll hear a set of three knocks again.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
 I don't know what this is.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,840
 It could easily be me shuffling around in the super hot closet because I did have a long

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
 day of recording.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,760
 It could be someone else doing stuff nearby that it's picking it up.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,000
 I've been editing out 90% of the knocks but it's getting to the point where they're happening

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 while I'm talking.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,400
 So I wanted to share it with you.

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,600
 Possible demonic intrusion into episode 666 or the ghost of the closet warning us or

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,560
 totally rational explanation that doesn't involve any of those but I wanted to share

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,360
 with you as a preview for tonight's episode of 666 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 And sorry for the sound quality.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
 I'm recording this on my gaming headset while I'm editing.

25
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,000
 And people are at the end of the day I think people who do try to summon demons it's because

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 of two things.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,840
 One they're seeking power is three things.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,400
 One of them is seeking personal power.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,000
 One of them is trying to prove that they exist some sort of validation.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,320
 And the other one is they're desperate.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
 They're desperate.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
 And that's the saddest one.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,440
 Like someone just trying to figure out like I wonder if demons exist and they do these

34
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,000
 rituals and nothing happens then that just confirms what they think.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,160
 But there are people who are desperate who they're backs to the wall they don't have

36
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,600
 enough money things like that.

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:29,600
