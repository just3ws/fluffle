1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 You thought you were just gonna have a fun day dropping acid at the happiest place on earth.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Instead you come face to face with a face.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a boat ride across Seneca Lake in New York.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 It was supposed to be a fun relaxing evening aboard a steamship,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 but everything changed when the sea monster showed up today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having lots of fun.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Just hanging out, throwing a beach ball around.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm assuming you're outside. Don't do that if you're in a moving vehicle.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 It's Daimon. Everyone give a round of applause to Daimon.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Doing a little bow.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Daimon, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Just helps her the word about the show. Really, really appreciate it.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Really helps out a lot when you talk about the show to your friends, your family, to your online patriots.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Daimon, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Jason Jalopy, we are gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 We are gonna drive all the way down to the happiest place on earth, Disneyland.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 [Diamond sounds]

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And while you're driving us down there, Daimon, I'm gonna pull out my phone.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I'm gonna show you guys something on the internet. Daimon's like, "Let me see." No, that's not safe.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 There's a website I found the other day I think you guys might want to check out.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 It's the...

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Remember that 40-in-map we've used so much on this show?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It's basically like a Google map where someone has put in pushpins for all these weird and bizarre stories?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Someone made another one of those, but it's strictly missing people.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And it's really creepy when you see how much of this map is covered.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It's mostly in the United States, but it looks like every square inch the United States has had a missing person,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 and they actually have it divided up. I'll put the link in the show notes, but they just have it set up between like...

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Men and women, missing men, missing women. It's color-coded, and then John Does and Jane Does.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 So it's not like you can just see all these people who went missing and haven't been found.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 You see all the people who've been missing, and we don't even know who they are.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It's really cool. I clicked around on there a bit. It's spooky.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's a lot different when you're reading about ghosts and goblins and ghouls and werewolves and stuff like that.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 When you're looking at a photo of someone who... the werewolf may exist, may not.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 You know, the ghost, the ghoul, whatever.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's a cool, spooky story, but when you're looking at photos of people and they're like, "Yeah, we don't know what happened to this dude."

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And they're everywhere.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 So check it out. I'll put it in the show notes. If you want to go to it right before you go to bed, be my guest.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 If you find something particularly interesting or chilling or creepy, go ahead and send it over to me, and maybe we'll cover it.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And if you happen to be missing yourself right now, you're in the woods and you just have your cell phone and you have enough reception here in this podcast.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 You're like, "There I am. I'm not missing after all." But you are.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 We don't know where you're at. You just now know that you're on this map.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Diamond, let's go ahead and pull up here to Disneyland. We're walking around the happiest place on Earth.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And that's when I was like, "Bro, dude, did you bring it?" And you're like, "What?"

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I didn't know we were on Disneyland until like six minutes ago. What are you talking about? What did I bring?

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'm like, "Dude, dude, did you bring it?" And you're like, "I don't know."

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And then I'm like, "Dude, come here." And then like, we're walking around the park and my goofy's walking by and Alice is walking by and all these characters.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And I open up this little pouch and I go, "Dude, this is acid."

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And there's like little pieces of paper in there. And I go, "Oh, no." And I start eating them.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I've never done acid. My friends who have done acid. I don't think I've ever even been in the same room as acid.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I'm pretty sure that's true. I'm not a fan of hallucinogens. My grasp on reality is so shaky to begin with.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So I just, I've seen them though. I'm like vice documentaries. They're little pieces of paper.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And they usually have like little drawings on them, little stick figures.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And if you flip them really quick and make some animation, you're getting super high. You're all, "Ugh!"

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Anyways, I remember when I was a kid, we were told this, the kids from the 80s will remember this and don't put on temporary tattoos.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Because some of them may have acid in them. I remember being told that like crackerjack tattoos, fine.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But I remember being told, if someone ever comes up to you with a temporary tattoo, it might be drugs.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I was like, "What? How does that even work?" So then my parents are like, "Okay, so they're explaining me what acid was because a kid thinks,

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 'Oh no, I'm gonna melt!'" They're like, "No, dude, it'll make cartoons way better. And even the suckiest of movies are brilliant."

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And I go, "Dude, we gotta trip out on acid. It's the happiest place on earth. Let's make it the trippiest place on earth."

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And as we're tripping out, we're like getting ready to go on Pirates of the Caribbean.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 We're like, "Dude, this is gonna be so dope. I'm totally gonna get the keys from that dog and free those prisoners at last.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 They've been trapped for 50 years." As we're going into Pirates of the Caribbean, let's take a look at another man, someone who will not be as fortunate as us.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I'm getting this story from someone on the internet known as EpiCurus23. So thank you, Epi, for posting this.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And this is a story that did not happen to him. It is a story that happened to a friend of a friend.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 But isn't that how the best urban legends always start?

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 In 1990s, Disneyland. A friend of a friend, let's call him Joey, has the same idea we did.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 He walks into Disneyland. This guy, he takes a piece of acid and he's like, "I can taste the Disney."

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And he's walking around Disneyland. And he's not like us. You can't tell that we're hella trippin' out on Space Mountain.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 He is obvious. He's like, "Oh dude, Goofy. Goofy, I've always wanted to meet you, dude. Take my photo."

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And he's actually talking to that frog from Wind in the Willows. That's when I'm like, "Dude, this guy has to be on something."

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So anyways, the authorities, Disneyland has park security. They see this guy. They can tell he's trippin' out.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 He's walking around. He's like, "Dude, I pulled the sword out of the stone. Isn't this awesome?"

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 They're like, "Sir, that's just a salad fork and it's stuck in the head of a toddler. You're gonna have to come with us, please. Come with us."

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And they take Joe into a room. Here is the urban legend.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Apparently at Disneyland, if you get caught tripping on acid and oddly enough, only acid, you get taken to this room.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It is a room with four walls, like most rooms are. Three of those walls are just a really bright white.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And there's a chair in the middle of the room and it's facing the fourth wall.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And security takes you in and they sit you in the chair and they said, "We'll be back later." And the door locks behind you.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 That fourth wall is a giant drawing of Mickey Mouse's head.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And you're sitting in the chair and you're just staring at this oversized Mickey Mouse and he has a frown on his face.

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You're like, "Jason, wait, is that it? Wait, is that it?"

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 That's it. They take you in a room and they're like, "You love acid? We're gonna give you all the acid in the world."

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And they totally pump you full of acid and then make you watch "Song of the South." No. That's it.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So it's nothing super spooky, but I love this urban legend because it could be true.

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Let's dissect this really, really quickly. One, just on its literal reading.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 If you're tripping off acid, which I've never done, but I've seen movies where people trip off acid freaking out,

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 imagine if you're tripping off that drug. Really any drug.

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I think being drunk, you might be able to be fine, but like smoke a weed and totally trip you out.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And you're sitting in a room in Mickey Mouse's house, Disneyland, and there he is on the wall just staring at you with a frown on his face.

95
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 He's like so disappointed in you. Remember I entertained you with all those cartoons growing up?

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 You're like, "Did you make the worst cartoons ever? They're super boring."

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 He goes, "It doesn't matter. I still made those cartoons and you still watched them."

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And I'm ashamed of you, Joey. Like you are turning out to be such a bright young boy.

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And here you are. You come into my house, my land, and you're dropping acid, bro.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And so you have to sit there and I'm gonna frown at you.

101
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So right there, that would be super discouraging. Like for me, what if I got busted like selling weed

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 and they took me in a room and Optimus Prime was just going, "Mmm, mm, mm, nope. Mm, mm, mm, mm."

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I'm like, "Well, Optimus Prime, you're real?" He's like, "I'm not real to drug users."

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 So, "Mmm, mm, mm, mm." And you do that for hours. Like, "It would break my heart. I'd be like, "No, Optimus, no."

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So that on its own is creepy. Maybe not creepy is the right word, but that on its own would be torment.

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Because this lasts for hours. This guy was stuck in this room for a long time.

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 This lasts for hours. And you'd be kind of shifting in your seat and you're trying to look away from the Mickey Mouse face.

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 But even if you were able to look away from it, you know that that giant Mickey Mouse head is still just staring at you.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Those big, soulless eyes digging into the back of your brain.

110
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So that's just a very interesting urban legend. But on the other hand, I think it might be true.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I think this is probably what happened. Is that the dude, because a lot of these urban legends do have a seat of truth.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I bet you anything this guy was tripping on acid at Disneyland. I'm sure people do that. I'm sure a lot of people do that.

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He's tripping on acid. The security grabs him and they take him into a holding area.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And they're like calling the cops and they're like, "Yeah, can you come down and pick this guy up?"

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Like he's obviously on drugs. He's sticking kids with the fork in their head. What are we gonna do?

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And he's in there for maybe, I don't know, 45 minutes, an hour before the Anaheim police show up.

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And while he's sitting in the chair in this busy office and people are kind of walking around behind him,

118
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 there's like just a picture on the wall of Mickey Mouse. And he's just staring at it.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And this moment becomes hours long in a silent room where he's all alone.

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And this massive Mickey Mouse face is staring at him.

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I think it happened, but it doesn't happen like he remembered it.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 It became such torment in his mind it turned it into almost like a hellish punishment.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Imagine having to stare at a frowning Mickey Mouse face for 10 minutes, let alone several hours.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 But he didn't. He probably stared at it for probably 20, 30 minutes and they're like, "Bruh, dude, come on, snap out of it, snap out of it."

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 The cops are on their way, "No, you're not getting your money back. They're gonna take you downtown

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 and we probably won't press charges because we don't want it on the police record that we got a bunch of drug users here."

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But you're gone, you're out. And he probably imagined himself in this empty void saved for a massive Mickey Mouse head for hours and hours and hours.

128
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I think it's an urban legend with the seat of truth. I think this dude was just tripping so hard he created this reality.

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 But if he didn't, if this is something Disneyland is actually doing, mwah, it is the perfect punishment to someone who comes in

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and is on heavy hallucinogens at your park because that's not fun for anyone else.

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Like, sure it's fun to watch some guy totally tripping out on drugs, but where do you draw the line?

132
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Like, sure the guy on acid might be walking around the tiki room trying to like hunt the birds,

133
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 but then you got the people going there, they're doing synthetic weed and they're like collapsing within the gears of the roller coasters

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 or you have the people on meth and they're like trying to beat up the bears as they're singing their jaunty tune.

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 You have to draw a line somewhere. So if this actually is a punishment, it's a good one Disneyland.

136
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Daimon, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Disneyland.

137
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 We're leaving behind Disneyland. We took all that guy's acid. We're gonna be dropping it the whole way mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah.

138
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 To New York. Fly us on out to Seneca Lake in New York.

139
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

140
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 We have good newspapers. We do have this. There's a lot of people who've covered this story,

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 but the fact that we don't even know the year makes me a little suspicious, but July 4th, the date's always the same.

142
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 July 14th, 1899 or 1900 and we'll say 1900 on this one.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 7pm. And in New York State there are the Finger Lakes, these long lakes, and Seneca Lake is the largest of the fingers,

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 the middle finger you may say. And this night, July 14th, there is a boat traveling across Seneca Lake.

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 It's the Oteonni and it's a side wheeler steamship. So that's like the one with like the big paddles going splosh splosh splosh splosh.

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And then there's like the thing on the top like Jason, this is real theater of the mind.

147
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You know, like the big steam stack and they probably have a horn.

148
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And the boat's just going and there's a bunch of people on it. And this has like, it's not a bunch of like hobos and not a bunch of fishermen.

149
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 It's like city council people. Like on this particular voyage, there's like a lot of hootin tootin people.

150
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And one of them is a geologist. He comes into the story later. Imagine super boring crews.

151
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And rather than being on a cruise with a bunch of hobos and fishermen than these dorks, city council members and people who own banks and a geologist,

152
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 a bunch of nerds. And anyway, so the Oteonni is going down to Seneca Lake and Captain Carlton Herondine is standing there.

153
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 He's like behind the big wooden wheel. And he's like, what a beautiful night to be a captain.

154
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I got all these dorks on my boat. They paid a lot of money and everything's just going great.

155
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And then he hears a ruckus. Hey, look, what's that? Hey, dude, what's that in the water? Huh?

156
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Well, sure. And he sees like kind of people jostling to see what's off the boat.

157
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And he pulls out his little telescope and he's like, and he's looking and he sees there's an overturned boat in the water.

158
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And he's like, dudes, turn the boat. They're like, Captain, you're right in front of the steering wheel.

159
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 You lazy bum. But they turn the boat and the boat is then coming towards this overturned vessel.

160
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 The Oteonni is approaching this lump in the water. They're about 100 yards away from it.

161
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And he's like, there's the boat to keep going that way. And they're pushing. They're like, this is the worst captain ever.

162
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And then the lump starts moving. And the captain goes full.

163
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He's been waiting his entire career to say this full steam ahead.

164
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And back then that was literal. They actually were like, great, they're throwing in more and more coal.

165
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Steam shooting out and the boat is chasing this lump. The Oteonni is coming towards it.

166
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And that's when they see it.

167
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's not a boat. It's not a lump. It's not some sort of weird mass floating through the water.

168
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 What they've been pursuing is a sea monster.

169
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 25 feet long. And this creature raises its giant neck out of the water.

170
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Showing off its monstrous head.

171
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Its head was in the shape of a triangle. It's like a four feet long triangle.

172
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And when its mouth opened up, it had two rows of white sharp teeth.

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 The geologist who was on board, Professor George R. Elwood, gave this description of this creature.

174
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 He said it looked like it had the carapace of a terrapin.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Which, if I don't speak nerd, but I'm pretty sure that is a shell of a turtle.

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It's like it had armor. It had armor on it.

177
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And then he said it was like a brownish with a greenish tinge.

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And then underneath its little neck, because when it raised its neck out of the water, it was white.

179
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 It had like a white belly.

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 This was interesting. He said its eyes were round like those of a fish and it did not wink.

181
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I don't know. I just thought it was an odd detail.

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And not something that I would notice on a 25 foot sea monster with a triangle head.

183
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 But he did.

184
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 The captain sees a sea monster in his first inclination.

185
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 A man cut after my own jib.

186
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I like this guy.

187
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 He sees a sea monster and he gives the order.

188
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Ram it.

189
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So the boat begins to pursue this creature.

190
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 It's just in the water right now just floating.

191
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 His goal is to kill it with his boat as the weapon.

192
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 The boat's getting closer.

193
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Everyone on board is like, oh no, I have bank dividends to count later.

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Boats coming towards the monster and the monster's sitting there.

195
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Boats getting closer and monster's sitting there.

196
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 The boat is so close. The monster goes underwater.

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 The boat goes past the monster.

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 That story was...

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I'm just joking. That's not the end of the story.

200
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 That would be the worst.

201
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Okay, so anyway, that's not the end of the story.

202
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 The boat goes past it and the captain's like,

203
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 "Dagnav it, are you kidding me? I want to kill that thing."

204
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 If someone ever wants to tell this story on a podcast,

205
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 it's better have a better ending than that.

206
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 The Oteone turns around and the sea monster is now resurfaced and do this.

207
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 This boat captain is out for blood.

208
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 He smashes his boat into this creature.

209
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It hits the monster so hard that all the passengers on the boat are knocked off their feet.

210
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Because the boat just comes to an almost sudden stop.

211
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And then our excited geologist gives this description of what happens.

212
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 "It raised its head, gave what sounded like a gasp and lay quiet.

213
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Its spinal column had been broken and it was dead."

214
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 So Captain Herondine is looking down at this thing.

215
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 He's always heard the tales of the sea monsters.

216
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 All of his men had heard tales of sea monsters growing up.

217
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But the problem is there was never any proof of these.

218
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And he's looking at this dead creature with a busted spinal column laying in the water.

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And he goes, "Let's haul it on board. Let's haul on board this 25 foot long sea monster."

220
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Because otherwise no one will ever believe us.

221
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So they start dropping off life rafts and people are wrapping ropes around it.

222
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 They're like holding it there with hooks for a bit as they're getting all the ropes adjusted.

223
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And then they're like, "Okay, let's hoist it up."

224
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Now remember, this is a crew of like a steamboat that goes on tours across Seneca Lake

225
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 and a bunch of high-fluten people from the nearby town.

226
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But all of a sudden they've been put into hard labor.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 They're grabbing the ropes.

228
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 "Heave! Hoo! They're hoisting this monster up onto the boat."

229
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 The problem is Professor George R. L. Wood, he's been giving us this running description this whole time.

230
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 He said how big it was. He said, "It looked like..."

231
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 He also estimated it weighed at least 1,000 pounds.

232
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 So no matter how many men you had on this ship, unless one of them was Hercules,

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 they weren't getting this thing on board.

234
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And they're hoisting it up. They're hoisting it up.

235
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And eventually the tail slips out of one of the ropes.

236
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 The other ropes are quickly pulled from the hands of the men on board.

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 The creature splashes back down into the water.

238
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I'm sure they probably only had it like a foot or two up.

239
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 But it then sinks into the depths of Seneca Lake.

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Never to be seen again.

241
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Or was it? Was it seen again?

242
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 This is an interesting story. It was originally published in the Rochester Herald in July 1900.

243
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So the Rochester Herald ran the story in July of 1900.

244
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That's why I think it happened in the 1900.

245
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 You will see...

246
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I could not find the original Rochester Herald article,

247
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 but I did find articles about the article and articles about the Seneca Sea Serpent and all that stuff.

248
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And they are mixed on whether the story took place in 1899 or 1900.

249
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I could not read the original article, so I could not tell you if it's like a year, previous or whatever.

250
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 But the legends go back way before this story.

251
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 There was the Seneca tribe in the area.

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And they believed that Seneca Lake was bottomless.

253
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And it was home to a great monster.

254
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 In more modern times, you had Kyuga Lake, which is nearby.

255
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It's also one of the Finger Lakes.

256
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 That one has a lake monster that's seen almost every year.

257
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 It has a nickname. It's called Old Greeny.

258
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And it's seen like once a year, if not more times a year.

259
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Very, very active.

260
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 With the Seneca Lake Monster, we have the native legends.

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 We have this more recent story in the 1900s.

262
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Every so often, you'll hear a story about it,

263
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 but it's not nearly as popular as Old Greeny in nearby Kyuga Lake.

264
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And both of these lake monsters, they've had their number of hoaxes over the years.

265
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So it's always harder to tell which stories are real, which stories are fake,

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 which stories are real, but they saw something fake.

267
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 It's always a gamble with that.

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 But let's go ahead and put on our conspiracy caps here and wrap the episode up like this.

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I say that I don't like sea monsters, but it's not that I don't like sea monsters.

270
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I don't like sea monsters' stories because they're so boring.

271
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Most of the time, it's just a lump in the water that's unidentified.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 It's the same thing, "Oh, there was a light in the sky."

273
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Sure, that's a UFO story, but it's boring.

274
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 So I don't have anything against the existence of lake monsters.

275
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I think lake monsters could exist,

276
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 but I don't want to keep telling stories about a lump in the water.

277
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 And I don't even like reading those stories.

278
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 I like reading stories like this.

279
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So I don't want it to be when I say I don't like sea monsters that I poo poo their existence.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I do believe they could exist.

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I just find the stories boring.

282
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 But this story has a unique twist to it.

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Again, this story isn't a blurry photo.

284
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 This story isn't some people seeing something through the mist or anything like that.

285
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 This story, if it's true, if the newspaper article wasn't making it up,

286
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 involved some of the most successful people in the area on this boat.

287
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And this boat smashing into this thing.

288
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 It's not that they just saw it and they, "Oh yeah, I saw a lump in the water."

289
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 No, the lump in the water was because they killed it when they smashed it with this boat.

290
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So we have that.

291
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 We have this different thing.

292
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Now, obviously, like where their insurance paperwork filed, that stuff should all be available.

293
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I mean, 1900 is kind of far back, but you could probably really dig into this to see

294
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 because the boat would be damaged or people suing the captain did he lose his job.

295
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Is there any other paperwork for this?

296
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Rochester Herald just write this up and they wanted to have a fun story about it,

297
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 which we've come across on this show.

298
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 But what makes this one interesting is not only is it a sea monster that got killed during the story

299
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and they're trying to bring its corpse up.

300
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That all could have happened.

301
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 That could have been a tall tale.

302
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 What we know for sure is today, in the deep waters of Seneca Lake,

303
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 it's a US naval testing area now.

304
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Since 1995, you have the Naval Undersea Warfare Center built there.

305
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And they test, quote unquote, test out sonar technology.

306
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Now, we've covered that before.

307
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 There's been a couple stories.

308
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I'll try to put them in the show notes.

309
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 I'll find them where we've had areas that have been reported to have paranormal activity

310
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and the military takes it over.

311
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Everyone's concerned about Area 51, but there was a hole that supposedly went into the middle of the Earth

312
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 that Charles Manson was going to lead his followers into during Helter Skelter.

313
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And then they would come out of this tunnel after the race war and rule over the planet.

314
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 That's a real place that little shaft to the devil's pit or the devil's hole or something like that.

315
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 You cannot go there now.

316
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 It is owned by the US Army.

317
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 They just expanded their base perimeter and now they own this hole.

318
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Why?

319
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So that's what makes the story to me as a conspiracy theorist more believable.

320
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Like, sure, it is a giant sea monster that they smashed with a boat.

321
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 We technically, there should be insurance records for the damage of the boat.

322
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 There should be lawsuits of the people stewing the captain because they fell down and the monocle popped out of their eyeball and stuff like that.

323
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 But we don't have any of that.

324
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 So that makes it seem, but out of all the places, why did they choose to build this in a lake that even going back to before Europeans even showed up was considered a place of a monster?

325
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 That's where you choose to build your underwater testing facility?

326
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Are they really testing their sonar down there?

327
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Or are they looking for something?

328
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Or even more chillingly, have they already found it?

329
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Countries are always trying to one-up each other with their weapon technology.

330
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But sometimes it might be better to go backwards.

331
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 If you need to kill someone silently, you don't use a machine gun, you use a knife.

332
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 What if you have a government that thinks, well, we can build a sub and Russia's going to build a better sub and then we build a better sub and then China builds a better sub and all these subs can detect each other and eventually da-da-da-da-da-da.

333
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Or, ladies and gentlemen, this.

334
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And then the guy points.

335
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 God, you didn't notice?

336
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 There's a giant sea serpent in the room in the Pentagon.

337
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 That's why it's shaped like that so the sea serpent can wrap around it.

338
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 This is our new technology.

339
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 We're going to learn to control this sea monster.

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It will pop up on sonar and they'll be like, that's weird.

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I've never seen a sub like that before.

342
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 I've never seen a sub bite through another sub.

343
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, if we can control the sea serpent, we can control the seas.

344
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 So is there a secret U.S. plan to train sea serpents?

345
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 To fight for the red, white and blue?

346
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 It's unlikely, but not impossible.

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Because if you believe in the paranormal, if you believe in cryptids, if you believe in sea monsters, and you know the track record of every human government that's ever existed on the planet Earth, why wouldn't they turn these things into weapons?

348
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 They will say that they are just fairy tales or old legends or let's laugh at the people who believe in the sea serpent.

349
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 But all the while, crafting the perfect weapon.

350
00:26:47,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 If the governments already lying to us about UFOs, about the lights, about the objects, about the things we see in the night sky, why would we trust them when they tell us they are not testing on sea serpents?

351
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Underneath the deep waters of Seneca Lake.

352
