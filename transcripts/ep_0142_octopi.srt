1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Is there a way to give a woman an instant orgasm?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Then we take a brief look at a political scandal that rocked South Korea and the ramifications it has for conspiracy theorists today.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And then we end with a trip into the ocean.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Or octopuses, actually from outer space.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Scientists think they might be.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 But am I having a great day?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 That's always the question.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I'd say 99.9% of the time I am, but right now, my most hated enemy has returned to this planet.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Some people call it...

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I guess everyone calls it snow.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Don't they say there's like 27...

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Eskimos have 27 different words for snow, but I couldn't think of one extra word.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Snow?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I hate snow.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Anyways, it's falling. It looks like it's going to be pretty slushy, so I'm not too worried about it.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Anyways, let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Now, this first story we're going to look at is from that magical year of 2004.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Yes, we're delving back into the new news folder, but this particular article is still happening today.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Very, very interesting thing.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Probably more interesting if you're a woman, and equally interesting if you're a man who likes watching women have orgasms.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 That was a weird way to put it.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 But anyway, so back in 2004, there was a doctor named Dr. Stuart Malloy.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Now, he was a pain specialist, and one of the things he used to treat pain was they would put electrodes in your back and you just eat, eat, eat.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You wouldn't make the noise. It would actually like electrocute you.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Generally, most of the time that he did this, your back pain would go away.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You're like, "Hey, thanks Doc. Take off."

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Back pain would be good for a bit.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Little electrotherapy.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But one time, this woman was having a particular pain and a particular point in her spine.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So he puts the electrodes in, turns it on, tells me when you feel something, and the woman starts hyperventilating.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Maybe it wasn't that exaggerated, and I don't think you guys want to hear me simulate a woman's orgasm, but...

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Or maybe you do.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 But anyway, so he's turning on the...

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 He's upping the amputage or the voltage, whatever it is.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 He probably should know because he's ejecting into a woman's body.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 What he realized was that at that point in the spine, if you put these electrodes in there and you turn it on,

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 for a woman, at least, you'll have an orgasm.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now, obviously, like you can imagine the doctor standing there and like little money signs, little dollar signs appearing in his eyeballs.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 He's like, "Duh-ching!"

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He actually heard the sound effect. That was real. That was in the article.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I heard a sound effect and my eyes turned to two dollar signs.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Because immediately he's like, "I'm sitting on a million dollars share with this piece of technology, with this piece of information,

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 if I can go around and start giving women insinortgazums."

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Because women, this shouldn't come as a shock to most of you unless you live your life watching pornography.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Women can have a harder time reaching climax than a man.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 A man can get his, you know, ding-dong stuck in a donut, and he's fine.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Like, any sort of friction.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He's like, "Oh, this feels pleasurable, but for women it can be a little more complicated."

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 However, you can't start marketing a device that shoots electricity into people's bodies and just be like, "Ah, to help you get off."

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He had to package it as a medical device, and I can't believe I used the word ding-dong, but anyways.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So, he had to package it as a medical device.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And so, he was marketing it towards women who couldn't have orgasms, either through some sort of injury or some sort of psychological issue.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Women who can't have orgasms.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 This device will help you do that. It is a medical device.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And he's tested it on women who have kind of fit that pattern where, you know, they just can't have...

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 They've never had an orgasm, or they physically or mentally can't have an orgasm because of some incident.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 So, he does this like a small study.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I believe there was like 11 women involved, and 10 of them had orgasms using that machine.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And one of the women was sad when the study ended because she's like, "Oh, I can't have orgasms. Normally, I really want this machine."

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Now, it's controlled. You put the electrodes in your back, and it's controlled by a remote control.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And I'll tell you right now, do not lose that remote control because if someone else gets a hold of that thing,

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 you're gonna have a really fun but very, very sore afternoon.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So, you make sure like you... You'd have to keep that like on your key chain.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And you're like, "Where's my car?" And you're trying to turn it on, you're like, "Uhhh..." in the parking lot, which would be quite interesting to see.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The problem is, there are two problems.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 One, the device, because you have to have it implanted, you have to have the little electrode things plugged in your spine.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 That procedure costs $17,000.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And the doctor's like, "Oh, I have no doubt in my mind that women will pay $17,000 to be able to give themselves instant orgasms with this machine."

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So, the bigger problem is that we're in the year 2014 now, so 10 years later, he's still trying to get this made as a medical device.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He has to do a full trial for the FDA.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And to do that, you need a ton of people, and you need a bunch of researchers, and you need like, you need to buy like a thousand lab coats,

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 because I'm sure they're gonna get dirty at some point.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And the FDA required like for this study, the cost is $6 million to be able to run a full study

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 and the FDA can look at all your results and say, "Yeah, this works."

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And he's trying to raise the money, he can.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 As of 2014, he wasn't able to raise the money, and that was kind of the latest information I'd seen on this.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 So, if you happen to have $6 million sitting around, don't know what to do with it, and you're like, "You know what, I have all this money, but zero orgasms."

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I'd rather have all these orgasms and zero money.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 You can donate it to this guy, get the full trial run, make sure it's totally healthy, FDA stamps it.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 You'll be the first one with two little electrodes in your back and a little remote control in your hand.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You're just walking down the street. That would be so weird.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 You're like sitting on the bus, and you're just, you know, reading your book, and you hear like a...

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 'Cause you'd have to learn how to stifle the vocals, but you hear like a...

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And you look over and you see a woman just completely tense up and then go completely noodle.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Just completely relax. She's just sitting on the bus.

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 You'd be like, "What?" And you'd start seeing that through the other day.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You'd be at the office. You'd be watching the secretary sitting there.

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 She's talking and all of a sudden, "Huh?" And then just go noodle everywhere.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Brave New World, my friends. Brave New World.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So our next story is a request from two different listeners.

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 We have on YouTube a Caesar Pizza 133, and then through email we have Jeremy.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So both recommended this story.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Now, the story itself is a corruption story, and it's quite by the book.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But when we look at the details and the ramifications going forward,

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 it actually is a win for conspiracy theorists, and I'm surprised they don't bring this up more often.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 So we're going to South Korea. We are going to take...

102
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 We're not, we did have a dirgeable that will leave that for a while,

103
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 but let's go ahead and hop into the carpenter copter.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I have a special buffer. I have like a special EMP around it, so your orgasm remote controls won't work,

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 so I don't have to worry about you going all noodley in the back.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Anyways...

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So we're going the long way, so don't fly over North Korea.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 We will be going there for future episodes, but...

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Lay in. We get out South Korea.

110
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 A little too close to the DMZ. We did catch some fire, but it's okay.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 It's okay. North Koreans missed us.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I think they were just trying to get some attention, but...

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So now we're in South Korea, and the year is 2016.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And this whole story broke on something super mundane.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 There's a private college. Very, very wealthy kids are going there.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And it's very competitive.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And the other kids are telling their parents,

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 "This girl, she never shows up, ever shows up to any of the lessons."

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 She always passes.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It's not fair. It's not fair.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And so people using their connect... This went on for a while, and people using their connections were like,

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 "You know, you might want to look into this because we know that girl knows her mother's a pretty important person."

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 "There might be something kind of corruption thing going on here."

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So reporters started looking into this daughter who attends this college,

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 and they did find out that things were not on the up and up.

126
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Now, the daughter's mother is a woman named Choi Soon-sil,

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 and she is the daughter herself, because that's how families work, of a cult leader.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 This cult was known as the Church of Eternal Life.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Very, very popular in South Korea, but still a cult.

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 They weren't like this mainstream thing.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It was a mix of Christianity, Buddhism, and Shamaism.

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 So they believed a lot in the spiritual world, contacting the dead, things like that.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 So they're thinking, "Okay, maybe the cult's pulling some ties. Maybe they're talking to the college president."

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Because even powerful people, they want their kids to learn.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 They're not going to go that far off the reservation where they're like,

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "Oh yeah, no, I don't care if my kid doesn't even show up. Just make sure they all get eggs."

137
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 So reporters are looking into this, and then they discover something deeply troubling.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Choi Soon-sil is controlling elements of the leadership of the college through the president of South Korea.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 The president of South Korea at that time was Park Goon Hee,

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 actually the first female president in South Korea history.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Her father was previously president, and her mother was killed in an assassination attempt against her father.

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And then a few years later, her father was assassinated, successfully assassinated.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 So Park, I'll just call her Park, sorry, I don't know how to pronounce the other name,

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 but Park is a total orphan at this point.

145
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Now she's a young kid at this point when her parents are killed, and she has no one.

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 She was friends with the daughter of the cult, and she's just kind of brought into it.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And over the years, they kind of orchestrated her return to power,

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 knowing full well that when she became president, they would rule the country.

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 At this point, where we're at in 2016, Choi Soon-sil runs the cult.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Her father has passed away as well.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So you have Choi Soon-sil, and then you have Park as president, and together they pretty much ran the country.

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 This was all discovered because her daughter wasn't attending classes.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And when the news got out, massive protests.

154
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Protests of over one million people.

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 It just was this insane thing.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 You have this president who was being controlled by the...

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 She wasn't like a Jonestown level cult, but it would be the equivalent of, say, a weirdo street preacher,

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 who just happens to have a bunch of followers.

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Like, it wasn't an acceptable version of religion in South Korea.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It was still a cult.

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And the South Korean people felt betrayed by the president, and they felt tricked by this cult leader.

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 She was considered... Choi Soon-sil was considered a modern-day Rasputin, the way she just kind of pulled strings.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I remember reading one report that one time the president went up, President Park went up to give a speech,

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 and the reporters were like, "Why is she wearing those clothes? She looks kind of dumpy in that outfit."

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Like, that's kind of a weird outfit for a president to wear doing a speech.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Now, she wasn't dressed in like rags. She was in a hobo with a spindle, you know, smoking a big corn cob pipe.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 But it was out of character for her, and it was out of character for someone of that stature.

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 The rumor was that she was being punished, and Choi Soon-sil said,

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 "You know what? You're not doing what we said, or you're being disrespectful. Where are these hobo clothes?

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Where are these poor people clothes? These non-designer clothes?"

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And the next time you give a speech, she was under that level of control from the cult.

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 The cult's gone by name also was Eight Goddesses. That's really Eight Goddesses' scandal was kind of how it was known in western media.

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It's a very evocative term.

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 But the end result was, protests happened, Choi gets sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption,

175
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Park, the president, gets sentenced to 24 years for corruption,

176
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 and Choi Soon-sil had to pay $17 million in fines because she had all the money from her cult.

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Now, a fairly basic corruption story with simply an added element of a shaman and a cult and this religious belief system and things like that.

178
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 On its face, you're like, "Okay, you know, I've heard of politicians being corrupt. I've heard of people being bribed and things like that."

179
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So this one just has kind of an added supernatural element to it.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 But the reason why I think this is important as a story is that it's a conspiracy that is true.

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 We can take that, and this is why I'm surprised it's not bigger news in the West.

182
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 You have that and it's provable.

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And so why don't more conspiracy theorists say, "Well, look it, this happened in South Korea and we know it was happening."

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 So who's to say that the same thing isn't happening here with this other group?

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Like, anytime you can find an actual provable conspiracy theory, especially something along these lines where it is a religious cult controlling the highest person in the country,

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 why isn't it used more in Western culture and Western conspiracy culture?

187
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 This is my theory. It's too mundane.

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Western conspiracy culture, and I don't want to go off on a rant here, but Western conspiracy culture has really gotten super bizarre recently.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 I think it's too mundane for them.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 They don't want to have one group controlling one person, because they can take this evidence and go, "Hey, look it, here we have this cult that was controlling the president."

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So maybe this cult was controlling Obama, but they don't want that.

192
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 They want this huge overarching conspiracy where the Queen of England, George Soros, and Obama, and Hillary Clinton, and all these Katy Perry,

193
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 and on it somehow, Katy Perry and Kevin Spacey are at the same level of Barack Obama and George Soros in this weird mind of theirs.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It's this huge net that comes around the world.

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And so it's too ridiculous.

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 If you want to tell a good conspiracy theory, you keep it simple.

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 To say that Henry Kissinger and Rihanna have meetings, and they're like, "You know what we need to do? We need to push more sexy young women on the people of the world."

198
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 That doesn't make any sense.

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Pettowood and the Hollywood Elite and the Reptilians and the demons and stuff like that, it's way too unwieldy, and they all end up like that.

200
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 The reason why it gets so weird like that and so big?

201
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Because it's mostly made up.

202
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 It's mythology.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's really, conspiracy theory is modern-day mythology, and just like Myths of Old, everyone kind of picks and chooses what they want, and they deform the story,

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 and turn it into their vision, and then they put it out there, and someone picks and chooses from what they want, and it builds this mythology.

205
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Reality, I love a good myth, and I love a great story, but reality like this story right here is more interesting because it happened, and that was it.

206
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And it's super bizarre that this doesn't get brought up more in conspiracy theory circles.

207
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Approvable conspiracy theory, the most powerful person in the country, was under the thrall of a cult leader who believed she could talk to the dead.

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Dude, that should be a conspiracy theorist's wet dream.

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 They wouldn't need the orgasmatron if they listened to this one.

210
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our last story.

211
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Out in the darkness of space, a planet explodes.

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 [Explosion]

213
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Except there's no noise in space, so you just see a bunch of rocks fly away.

214
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I guess if you were on the planet when it exploded, it would be quite loud.

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And there's a frozen chunk of it, creaning through the darkness.

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 [Explosion]

217
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Flying? Who knows where? But we know where.

218
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Because millions of years later, this giant, frozen block of an alien planet crashes into Earth's oceans.

219
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 [Explosion]

220
00:17:36,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 All the single-celled organisms are like, "What the hell was that? Oh no, we're evolving! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

221
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So, where life came from on Earth, what we can do is we can look back to the Cambian era, where we saw this massive explosion in advanced life.

222
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And most of the modern species that are here today, we can trace back to the Cambian era.

223
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Before that, it was just a bunch of little amoebas dancing around on the planet, having a good time.

224
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 It was like the movie Flubber, but it was just all just goo, goo hanging out.

225
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And at some point, something happened that caused life to just explode.

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Now, an idea of that is this thing called panspermia, which I think that's how you pronounce it.

227
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Where life is seeded from other planets, that somehow something came from another planet and helped advance life here.

228
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 That's not super- the panspermia thing is a bit- I'm pretty sure I'm mispronouncing that, but the panspermia thing is kind of debatable.

229
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 But, science goes, there was this big explosion of life at this certain point in time.

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Now, Waffenbeer, who suggested this, is looking at an actual article written by 33 Science in particular.

231
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 This was quite recently wrote this. They're saying, "Yes."

232
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Oh, Cambrian, not Cambian, but anyways, the Cambrian explosion happened. That's all fine.

233
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But, when we look at the octopus, when we look in its big eyes, I think it has two of them, and it's not squirting ink at us,

234
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 we're like, "Look out." And there are lab coats, they're all covered in black now.

235
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Why don't they wear black lab coats, or like red lab coats, or something like that?

236
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 In Star Trek, the doctors wear red. Not their uniforms, but their medical- never mind, never mind.

237
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So anyways, these 33 scientists recently released a report, and it was in the Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology Journal.

238
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Peer reviewed, article, by the way, saying that they had a different theory when it comes to the octopus.

239
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Well, I thought the polar-olar of octopus was octopi, but anyways, when you look at the octopus, you go,

240
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 "It has a bunch of evolutionary advantages that it's previous- that nothing had previous to that.

241
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 They had the ability to camouflage and change shape almost instantly to hide themselves.

242
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It was a brand new evolutionary advantage. Large brains, also a huge advantage that was not seen previous to the octopus.

243
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 A sophisticated nervous system, camera-like eyes, which I don't really know what that means, but I'm assuming it's some sort of eye that's just more advanced.

244
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Rather than your lame-o eyes over there, dude, the octopus is looking at the squid and being like, "Dancing, dancing so fast, the squid's like,

245
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 I don't know what to see, what I'm looking at. I don't have camera-like eyes, little GoPro eyes."

246
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So, this is the theory that was put forth by these scientists in this journal.

247
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 But what their idea is this? Because the octopus showed up after the Cambrian explosion, according to these guys.

248
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So, their theory is this. That a chunk from another planet was frozen with octopus eggs.

249
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 That they are literally an alien species on this planet. They did not evolve on Earth.

250
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And this chunk of octopus eggs crashed into the ocean and they hatched. And that's where the octopus comes from.

251
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Now, obviously there's debate about that. The interesting thing is the... the infer... like the debates I've seen, at least in the articles that I read, aren't the best.

252
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 When the scientists who wrote the report, they said, you know, the... there's a huge... the octopus genome is very, very complex.

253
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And 33... this is weird. 33 shown up a lot in here. Ooh, conspiracy. Uh-huh, uh-huh.

254
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Maybe the octopi are the Illuminati. The Illuma... the... the Illuma Inky, maybe.

255
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 There was a long pause there. If I edited that down, I had to think about that one for a while.

256
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Octopus genome is very complex. It's over 33,000 protein-coding genes, which is more than is present in a human.

257
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And a lot of the articles that are like, you know, like the debunking articles, they're like, you know, they say that it's complex, but, you know, we've decoded the genome so it can't be alien.

258
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 But I'm thinking, why couldn't you decode an alien genome? Like, and every article that was debunking it kind of had that same phrase.

259
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And they're admitting, hey, we know what the genome is of this alien octopus. There's no argument about that.

260
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 They're just saying it's more complex than human, and the pushback's like, what? We've decoded it, and they don't really go into detail.

261
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 One of the best debunking articles I read said that if an octopus from another planet came here, it wouldn't be able to evolve from the squid unless there were also squids on the alien planet.

262
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 So whether or not it was straight up like eggs coming in on the comet or asteroid, or that whatever came down somehow mutated existing squids, the pushback to that was you would have to have a squid on another planet, like a descendant of a squid on another planet for it to be able to mutate or breed with the squids down here.

263
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 That's fair. That's a fair pushback, but again, that's really not what the scientists are saying. They're straight up saying octopus eggs came from another planet.

264
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Now, I know this is getting messy because I keep going back and forth, but you know, they did this journal, it was an appear-reviewed journal, and so that gives them a bit of credibility.

265
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 However, I can start a journal with my-- I don't know the pedigree of the Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology journal.

266
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 We'll assume it's decent.

267
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Oh, and another pushback was like, there was no zoologist in the 33 scientists, so we should just throw out the whole study.

268
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It's really bizarre that the disagreements with this paper are pretty-- at least the ones that are being quoted in news articles are pretty weak, actually.

269
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 What if what started the Cambrian explosion was panspermia?

270
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Was rocks of life flying from other planets to come here?

271
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 But it was just like-- I don't know, gene juice. It was just like little bits and pieces of alien dudes, like they got blown up, and their skin fell everywhere, and then their skin fell--

272
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 I guess I should let you guys know now. I don't know what I'm talking about, so let's skip that part.

273
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Here's the thing. This is my pushback to this.

274
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 The fact that an alien egg could be frozen on an asteroid and crashed on Earth, I really don't have any problem with that. I could see that happening.

275
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 It would be one in a million that it would survive-- like, it would be frozen at the right temperature, and wouldn't melt too close as it got close to any sun as it was flying around, and then crashing in the water and survived the impact and all this stuff.

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 But one in a million chances in a universe that's infinite and time that's infinite is going to happen.

277
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I would think it was weird that an alien-- let's say the Cambrian life explosion was going on, and you started to have all these sea creatures evolve and land creatures evolve, and a creature shows up that is not only slightly related to other creatures that are currently there, but--

278
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Dude, wait a second. Oh, man, I just thought of something. This isn't in the article, so you'll have to forgive me if I go off the "science"--

279
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 the "science" stock for a second. What if it's true? What if it is an octopus is an alien life form?

280
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 But it wasn't by chance that they look like they're related to a squid. What if it's by choice? What if it's by some sort of design?

281
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Like, what came down was the matrix for some sort of life form, and it took the makeup of an existing creature in its environment, one of the best ones, which would be a giant squid, and then added in its own--

282
00:26:40,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Basically, what I'm trying to explain is some sort of shape-shifting alien, but more like it can adapt its-- if that comet had landed on land, we may have had a four-legged creature, like a dog type of thing, but with more learning capability, it could instantly camouflage, it could change its shape, and things like that.

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Like, what if-- I mean, that's science fiction. Let's go back to the article just to reaffirm it real quick. Some scientists believe that an asteroid crashed into the Earth, and it had octopus eggs on it, so octopi are an actual alien species.

284
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But we could extrapolate that to say that it could have just not been an accident, where it landed determined what it would look like, and the advantages that it would have, because it landed in the ocean.

285
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Basically, I guess what I'm explaining is when an Autobot crash lands on Earth, and they scan the nearest car, they can become that car. Because once we're in the realm of-- why not? Why not? What if the octopus is not an accidental hitchhiker, but an intentional resident?

286
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 You know, the only reason why the octopus is not one of the most advanced species on the planet, because they're incredibly smart, they can learn things by watching people, and they're very, very smart.

287
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 The only thing that limits them to not becoming a dominant life form on the planet is that they only live to be five years old. A lot of them die after mating.

288
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 So if they lived longer, if they lived as long as a blue whale, they actually would be the dominant species of the ocean. And it's funny to think that there is a possibility in a world where the octopus lived longer, let's say 60, 70 years.

289
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 I don't think humans would have control of the oceans. I think once we first started sailing out across the oceans, I think boats would just be disappearing all the time.

290
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Because that's their land. And it's totally inhospitable to humans. You can't drink the water, you'll drown in it, you gotta build something to go across it.

291
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 But if just a little twist in the genome where the octopus lives as long as a human, there is a world where the continents are completely separated.

292
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Other than the Bering land bridge, there would be nobody on the Americas. And everyone would just be where they're at. There would be no international trade.

293
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Because every time you send a ship out, it would crash. And you would just be like, "Well, I guess there's monsters out there."

294
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And then as society did develop and we started to do science stuff, I mean think about it, the Americas not being found until the invention of the plane is what would happen in a world where the octopus, everything's the same.

295
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 They just simply lived a little longer. This wouldn't be our planet. It would just, parts of it would be. You'd have a totally different advanced species controlling two-thirds of the planet.

296
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 You know, we talked about grey aliens and dolphins the other day. And there was a theory. But the idea that if octopuses just lived a little longer, they would basically, we would be the ones, dude, what if they fished for us?

297
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 They'd outnumber us, probably. They'd control more of the world's surface. A world where octopi, eight arms are sneaking into your bedroom at night.

298
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 "Mommy, I think there's a monster under my bed." When a kid said that, the parents would be like, "Oh my God, there's an octopus in here."

299
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Because you would have to believe it, because octopi are constantly climbing into the surface, grabbing you, ripping your guts out.

300
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Whether or not the octopus is from another planet, we don't really know. Some scientists say yes, some scientists say no.

301
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 But wherever they're from, with just a little switch, they could have been the dominant life form on this planet. We could have been the ones that were their food supply.

302
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 They don't need, I mean, they can walk on land. We could have no coastal cities, no ports.

303
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Because at night, these eight armed creatures would come up and grab a little bite to eat. Maybe they would just do it for fun on the weekends.

304
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It's weird to think how the world works, like how science works, how those little things can make big differences.

305
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Is it possible that the octopus is actually an alien life form from another planet? It is possible.

306
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 And I think the arguments that are being used against it are relatively weak, which makes me think we don't have to look to the stars to find alien life.

307
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 The stars already came to us.

308
