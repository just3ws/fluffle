1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,340
 A war in heaven, demons invading our planet,

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,140
 Satan's forces standing at the threshold.

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,860
 These are stories we've heard for hundreds of years.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:23,800
 In the city of Miami, the boys and girls of homeless parents cuddle together for warmth.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,840
 Whether they're sleeping in a shelter or at a bus stop,

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,420
 they believe one thing.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,760
 God has abandoned them all, and only they can save the world.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,300
 [music]

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,460
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,920
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover this episode.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,280
 We're not gonna do a shout out because we're not gonna be flying any vehicles.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,680
 That's why this is actually a story I've been wanting to do for a long time.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,840
 And I got to give a shout out to the journalist who compiled this entire saga.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,240
 Her name is Linda Edwards, and she wrote an article for the New Miami Times called Myths Over Miami.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
 Let's go ahead and get started here guys.

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,800
 December 25th, 1996.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,080
 God is sitting in his palace in heaven.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
 [gunshots]

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
 Something is pounding on the gates of heaven.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,480
 His angels are running to and fro, getting their weapons to hold off the assault.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,360
 But God just sits there on his throne.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,000
 He's been waiting for this day, but he doesn't know how to fight back.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
 The gates of heaven are thrown open.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,560
 The arm is of hell.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,640
 Poor over the walls.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,400
 Climb the battlements.

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,240
 Slaughter God's angels.

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,280
 And he only watches this.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:11,360
 He can stop it at any moment, but he just watches this horror in front of him.

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
 And then he sees her.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,560
 God left the palace that night.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,920
 And the angels are all that's left that's keeping the world from being overrun by Satan and the forces of evil.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,800
 It was the angels who first came to earth realm.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
 They decided they needed a place to mount a counterattack.

38
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,240
 Heaven had fallen to the forces of Satan.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,160
 The angels have the ability to simply appear on earth.

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
 Since God created it, it's a heavenly realm, an extension of his glory.

41
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
 So angels are just able to come here.

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
 Demons though quickly follow.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,080
 They're a little more limited on how they can move about this planet.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,800
 They crawl out of mirrors in the darkness.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,360
 Abandoned refrigerators that litter the streets, the dumps underneath bridges.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,800
 At night those doors open up and demons can enter our world.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,640
 If you ever see a Jeep Cherokee sitting on the side of the road with black tinted windows, look close.

48
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,880
 You'll see something moving in that window.

49
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,320
 That's another way a demon can invade our planet.

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,520
 Andre is an eight-year-old boy sitting outside a Salvation Army homeless shelter.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
 And he's talking to other homeless kids.

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,240
 He's telling them the story I just told you.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,720
 They're sitting underneath a flickering neon light and Andre looks up and goes,

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,320
 "We're safe under the light."

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,560
 You see angels eat light.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,000
 They're always around the light.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,920
 It's what gives them the ability to fly.

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
 So you're always safe in the light.

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
 Always remember that kids.

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
 Andre tells the reporter.

61
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,000
 He gives this quote.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,640
 There's a lot of killing going on in Miami.

63
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
 You want to fight?

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
 You want to learn how to live?

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
 You got to learn the secret stories.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,080
 The children of Miami have created this entire mythology to explain their world.

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,400
 It spreads from shelter to shelter.

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,360
 And because a homeless person is the definition of transient,

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,200
 they're moving from place to place.

70
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,960
 In one homeless shelter, you'd have the children tell a part of the story,

71
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,720
 and then they would all be separated.

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
 Families would get kicked out of the shelter.

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
 They'd been there too long.

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
 Maybe a job opportunity opened up on the other side of town.

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,920
 They move.

76
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,680
 Maybe drug abuse, alcoholism, took the parents to go somewhere else looking for those things.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
 They remove them from the shelter.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
 You have all these reasons why kids are leaving these shelters.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,960
 But each time the kids would tell these stories and the mythology grew,

80
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,640
 you had ultimate evil in the city of Miami.

81
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,120
 And they could see with their own eyes.

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,640
 They'd see drive-bys.

83
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,680
 They'd have friends of theirs who were killed, little kids,

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
 four-year-olds, eight-year-olds, 10-year-olds, shot in the head.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
 How do you explain that?

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
 The adults had their own problems.

87
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,160
 The kids would get together and tell these tales.

88
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
 Not just tales of horror, but tales of survival.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,240
 In the streets of Miami, there is a figure known as the Blue Lady.

90
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
 Pale white skin, beautiful blonde hair.

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,320
 Arms adorned in pink and golden flowers.

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,400
 She used to live in the ocean off the coast of Miami.

93
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
 But now she has come to save the children of Miami.

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,600
 But with a caveat, you have to know her real name.

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,520
 If you call her name out at the time you need her the most,

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,920
 she will save your life.

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
 She's a symbol of hope.

98
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
 Here's a quote from one of these homeless children about the Blue Lady.

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,920
 "If you and your friends are on a corner, on a street,

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,840
 when a car comes shooting bullets,

101
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,160
 and only one child yells out her true name, all will be safe.

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
 Even if bullets are tearing your skin,

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,560
 the Blue Lady makes them fall to the ground.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
 She can talk to us, even without her name."

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 She says, "Hold on.

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
 It lets me to girl name Maria, seven years old.

107
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,200
 One day a horrible storm hit Miami.

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
 She was with her father and her mother,

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,320
 and they broke into a building.

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,000
 The Freedom Tower is what it's known as.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
 It's in downtown Miami.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,920
 They broke in along with a bunch of other homeless people.

113
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,960
 They broke into this building to outlast this storm,

114
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
 which was quickly becoming a hurricane.

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
 And I have to say, I've never ever thought about

116
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,760
 what happens to homeless people during a hurricane.

117
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,400
 I've never even considered that in my mind.

118
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
 And now I have this story.

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,720
 This girl is seven years old, and she's living this moment.

120
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,040
 It was an abandoned building.

121
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
 There was no electricity.

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,040
 The place was dark.

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
 She said the only time that she could see

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,200
 was when lightning struck outside.

125
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
 The room would become illuminated.

126
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,560
 She was there with a lot of other adults, a few other families.

127
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,280
 But she was mostly focused on her parents.

128
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
 Her father was an alcoholic,

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
 and he was eating the last piece of food that that family had.

130
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
 It was a can of sardines.

131
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 Lightning strikes and illuminates the room.

132
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,720
 And she sees her mom trying to get her dad to stop eating the sardines.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,160
 That's all they have left.

134
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
 In the darkness, she hears the unmistakable sound

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
 she's heard it several times of her father hitting her mother.

136
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
 Now they're around a bunch of other people.

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
 Lightning strikes.

138
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,320
 She sees all the other people crowded

139
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,560
 into the floor level of this building.

140
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
 But people are just laughing at this.

141
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
 They're doing nothing about it.

142
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,720
 Maria stands up for her mother,

143
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,040
 and the father turns around and punches her in the face.

144
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 Arguments over.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
 She said that her head hurt,

146
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,320
 but her stomach hurt as well.

147
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,400
 She was so hungry.

148
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
 And she's laying there in the corner of this room.

149
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
 She can feel the pain in her stomach.

150
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,840
 She feels the pain from her father's strike.

151
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,800
 She's trying to sleep as much as she can when

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,560
 the wind and the rain smashes a window in this building.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,600
 She feels completely powerless.

154
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
 She says, quote, "I was so scared.

155
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
 I prayed out loud.

156
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,640
 Please, God, don't punish me no more."

157
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,600
 A boy overheard her prayer.

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,480
 He knew the stories.

159
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,040
 He knew the secret stories that have been passed along the street.

160
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,960
 He said, "Hurricanes ain't God.

161
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
 It's Blue Lady bringing rain for the flowers."

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,160
 Later that night, Maria wakes up,

163
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,480
 and the Blue Lady is standing over her.

164
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,080
 She reaches down and touches her forehead.

165
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
 Maria says the pain went away.

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
 The Blue Lady had helped her.

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,040
 The Blue Lady then sang Maria a song.

168
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,160
 Maria memorized the words as best as she could.

169
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,600
 And the Blue Lady told Maria that that song would help her.

170
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,160
 Be good.

171
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,000
 Be a good person.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,680
 Not like her daddy.

173
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,080
 We see this come up a lot in the secret stories in Miami.

174
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,160
 We see this idea that you have kids who are powerless,

175
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,520
 but there is this great war going on around them.

176
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,840
 They can't start arming themselves.

177
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,640
 Everyone else has guns in this area.

178
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
 They're in gang infested area, drug infested area.

179
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,280
 Your natural reaction would be to maybe join one of the gangs

180
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,640
 or get a gun yourself, defend yourself.

181
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,760
 What we see a lot in these secret stories is what the Blue Lady was explaining to Maria.

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
 You have to be good.

183
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,080
 We have a ton of these stories in this article that have this element

184
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,480
 where people are told if you want to join God's army,

185
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,120
 do good in school, be a good person, make good moral choices.

186
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,400
 That's how you will become a warrior in this angelic war.

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,840
 Which is very interesting component because that's something you can control.

188
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,680
 If you were to say if you want to join this group, this militia,

189
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,560
 this holy militia or something like that, you have to train,

190
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,240
 you have to do all this stuff, you have to have these weapons.

191
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
 That's how we would talk about in real life,

192
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,320
 but a child can't do any of that stuff.

193
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,280
 They can't drop $400 on infrared gear or anything like that.

194
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,040
 They can be good.

195
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
 They can study their textbooks.

196
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
 They can be a good person.

197
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
 But they know that death is right around the corner.

198
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,880
 These children live in an environment where at any moment they can be executed,

199
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,120
 they can be accidentally killed in a drive-by, their parents could kill them.

200
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,600
 These kids are living on the edge of civilization.

201
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,280
 And it's one thing to be a homeless adult.

202
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,040
 It sucks.

203
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,080
 I've been homeless before.

204
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
 It sucks.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,400
 But I can place it in context in the story of my life.

206
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,680
 But if you're seven years old and you're homeless,

207
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
 you know something's wrong.

208
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,280
 Like you know this isn't a natural state of being,

209
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,520
 but you are totally powerless about this whole thing.

210
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,320
 So you're seeing this violence on the street and you're being told that God has left heaven.

211
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,280
 Heaven's been overrun by satanic forces.

212
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,280
 So if I die, what is there for me if I can't go to heaven?

213
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,160
 And that's when one of the other children at the shelter

214
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,440
 would tell you the truth about life after death.

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
 When you die, you become a spirit.

216
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,280
 And the children were very adamant in this article.

217
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,160
 Not a ghost.

218
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
 Ghost is what a Casper is.

219
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,080
 That's a kid's word.

220
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,680
 You become a spirit and you can appear in front of people.

221
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
 But you can't talk.

222
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
 Not at first.

223
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,040
 They say it takes a while for you to be able to speak.

224
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
 A lot of times spirits will appear.

225
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
 They'll just be moving their mouth.

226
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
 They haven't mastered the ability to actually speak from beyond.

227
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,560
 It's a spirit's job to actually be a war correspondent.

228
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,240
 To share stories about what is going on between the angels and the demons.

229
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,400
 So when you die, you do have a place in that world.

230
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,560
 Where you can deliver messages to the living, messages of support, calls for reinforcements.

231
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,080
 You can become an active participant rather than just a child who's living this nightmare.

232
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,680
 If you're good enough, you're a good enough person while you're alive,

233
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360
 you can help the angels fight more than just deliver messages.

234
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,720
 One of the creepiest elements to this story too is this one.

235
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,400
 I hadn't heard this one before.

236
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,080
 Is that spirits and demons, once they see your face, they can track you wherever you go.

237
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,360
 You can never hide from them.

238
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,640
 This whole story I find absolutely fascinating.

239
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,120
 This is modern myth making among a very unique subculture.

240
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,600
 Locked into an age range and a geographical range.

241
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
 They had older kids in the article going "Yeah, I really don't believe that anymore."

242
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,040
 They had a 12 year old being like "Yeah, I don't really believe that anymore."

243
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
 But you have that age range where it makes sense.

244
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,280
 It's trying to make sense of this world.

245
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,120
 So if you're an angel or a demon or a spirit, if they ever see your face,

246
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,640
 if you ever wake up in the middle of the night and something's watching you from the darkness,

247
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,320
 you're basically, you better hope that's an angel or a spirit

248
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,720
 because they'll be able to track you wherever they go.

249
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
 But heaven is abandoned.

250
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
 Where do you go when you die?

251
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,120
 Well you see outside of Miami in the swamps.

252
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,280
 There's a little place where the swamps slowly turn into a jungle.

253
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,360
 A place that's hidden from the forces of evil.

254
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,720
 But just in case they find it, this jungle is patrolled by massive alligators

255
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,520
 that will devour those who attempt to invade the last refuge of the angelic forces on earth.

256
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,680
 Inside this jungle is a massive palace and that is where you go when you die.

257
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,280
 But there is a ritual that these children have been told.

258
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,640
 You have to give the dead a fresh palm leaf.

259
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,440
 That's the key to get into the city.

260
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
 Without the fresh palm leaf, you can't get into paradise.

261
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,760
 Miguel was eight years old.

262
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,280
 I actually should say this right now.

263
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,640
 This article is from 1996, so I don't mean to throw a, you know,

264
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,920
 rain bucket on your parade or anything,

265
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
 but a lot of these kids probably aren't alive anymore.

266
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,320
 Like this, this article is 24 years old

267
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,080
 and these kids were having a rough go of it back then.

268
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,440
 So this article wasn't written in 2020.

269
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
 I don't know if there's any happy Indians to any of these guys.

270
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,920
 You can definitely hope there is, but the way they talk about,

271
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,640
 I'm not going to, there's a very long article and I recommend you guys read it.

272
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,760
 I'm leaving a bunch of stuff out,

273
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,000
 but one of the things, one of the stories was this girl was talking to the reporter

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,600
 and finally earned the reporter's trust and she was drawing pictures of these different events of

275
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
 the different characters and stuff like that of these stories.

276
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,040
 And the reporter asked, can you draw a self portrait and the girl draws a gravestone?

277
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,880
 So, I mean, that probably brings it down a bit this, this has been 24 years.

278
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,600
 This eight year old kid, I hope everything's okay,

279
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,520
 but I wanted to include that detail.

280
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,160
 Miguel, he's eight year old boy.

281
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,200
 His parents were immigrants from Nicaragua.

282
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,560
 And his dad had a job at a gas station and every night,

283
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
 they weren't homeless at this point.

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,520
 They had a home, dad had a job.

285
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,960
 Every night, Miguel would walk through the street and he'd bring a soda to his dad.

286
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,400
 And then they would sit at the gas station for a while and then it would be time for Miguel

287
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,000
 to go to bed and he would make the walk back home, wait for his dad to come home.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,440
 But one night before Miguel could get there, his father was murdered at that gas station.

289
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,360
 He was brutally murdered.

290
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,720
 He had heard, through the grapevine, that not only was his dad shot to death,

291
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,760
 before they did that, the murderers were lighting matches and putting them out on his body.

292
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
 So Miguel had heard this story.

293
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,400
 Without Miguel's father's job, the mother wasn't able to keep the apartment.

294
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,800
 She wasn't able to support Miguel and Miguel had a younger sibling.

295
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,840
 They became homeless.

296
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,920
 So they're sleeping on the streets.

297
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,600
 It's not easy being homeless.

298
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,840
 And I know I've said that earlier, but it's not like you're just like,

299
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,200
 "I'm homeless. I'm going to go to a shelter."

300
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,120
 There's waiting lists and there's all sorts of stuff.

301
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
 Sometimes the shelters can be more dangerous.

302
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
 There's all sorts of stuff.

303
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,120
 So a lot of times there are shelters in the area,

304
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,960
 but you'll spend time sleeping on the streets.

305
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,040
 You'll spend time sleeping on bus benches.

306
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,880
 You'll spend time sleeping at churches.

307
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:53,760
 But every night Miguel woke up and there standing over him was his father's spirit,

308
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,160
 just staring down at Miguel.

309
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
 The spirit was beaten up.

310
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,040
 He was bloodied.

311
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,320
 And Miguel saw little flames, little dots of light,

312
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
 all over his father's ghastly figure.

313
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,600
 The matches that had been put out on his body had followed him into the afterlife.

314
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,360
 At school, Miguel would often get caught trying to leave,

315
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
 trying to break out of school.

316
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
 And the teachers would chase him down, grab him.

317
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,400
 "Miguel, what are you doing? What are you doing?"

318
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,880
 And he said, "I have to find my dad's grave.

319
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,280
 I have to find my dad's grave."

320
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,360
 "What? What are you talking about?"

321
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,680
 And he was holding, each time he did this,

322
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,760
 he'd be holding a handful of fresh palm leaves.

323
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,880
 He knew he had to get his dad into that city in the jungle.

324
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
 You see, the teachers don't know these stories.

325
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,960
 These stories are passed around in homeless shelters.

326
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,640
 So they're like, "What is going on?"

327
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,520
 It sounds like gibberish.

328
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
 It sounds like made up.

329
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
 Might as well be saying he has a lunch date with April O'Neill.

330
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,800
 It doesn't make sense to them.

331
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,560
 But a social worker who's spending a lot of time with kids in the homeless shelters

332
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,760
 and talking to Miguel personally goes,

333
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,080
 "Oh, it's this ritual he has to do."

334
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,840
 So one of his social workers takes him to the grave site,

335
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,320
 finds out where the dad is buried, takes him to the grave site.

336
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,680
 Miguel has the palm leaf.

337
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,200
 He's standing in the graveyard.

338
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,720
 He puts the palm leaf on the grave.

339
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,840
 Miguel says, "I need my daddy to find the fighter angels.

340
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,400
 I'll go there when I'm killed."

341
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,280
 Here's an interesting thing with this article.

342
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,360
 Again, it's just a very, very well-written, very well-researched article.

343
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,000
 Where the reporter, Linda, is actually talking to folklorists and ethnologists,

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,040
 these people who really dive into how cultures are created.

345
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,280
 And one of the, I think it was the folklorists, said,

346
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,840
 "A lot of times when we look at how folklorists are created,

347
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
 we can carry them back to a certain amount of time and say,

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,560
 'Okay, it came out of this region and then we saw it evolve.'"

349
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,160
 They said, "When we look at the stories,

350
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
 the secret stories of the homeless kids in Miami,

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,960
 the stories all end with like,

352
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
 when you track it back to the beginning,

353
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
 they go, "Oh, a spirit told me."

354
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,640
 And they're like, "What?"

355
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
 Like, there's no start point other than,

356
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,600
 "I woke up one night and a spirit told me the story about the jungle palace.

357
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
 And the spirits are the dispatchers."

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
 So that wouldn't make sense in their mythology.

359
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,880
 They go, "We can't really track it back to a patient zero.

360
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,400
 The stories are just spreading."

361
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 There's another person, I think it was a psychologist,

362
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
 might have been a folklorist, but they have this interesting statement.

363
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,200
 They said, "When you have a child that is going through a rough patch,

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,960
 their parent comes down with cancer,

365
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,120
 or maybe they even have come down with cancer,

366
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,680
 something, death in the family, things like that.

367
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,520
 A child, a lot of times, thanks, God is up there,

368
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,480
 but he's so busy and I'm just a little tiny person.

369
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,640
 So God loves me, but he just doesn't hear me now.

370
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
 But if you have a child that's under constant stress,

371
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,360
 where they are homeless at any point,

372
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
 they can be killed, their loved ones can be killed,

373
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,360
 they meet a friend, it's their best friend for a week,

374
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,480
 and they get killed.

375
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
 God is absent.

376
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
 God does not exist in their world.

377
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,920
 They don't see God as a fatherly figure who's too busy with the other.

378
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,640
 God's gone.

379
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,920
 So they go, "It is no surprise that this mythology,

380
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,120
 they have removed God.

381
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,560
 They believe that he exists,

382
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,640
 but he isn't, he's not ignoring them,

383
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
 he has abandoned them.

384
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
 But you still have the hope."

385
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
 See, the angels represent the potential of hope.

386
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,120
 There's not an absence of angelic intervention,

387
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,800
 just an absence of God.

388
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,040
 He's no longer watching over us.

389
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
 It's a fascinating mythology.

390
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,400
 This whole thing, this whole story I find so awesome.

391
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,560
 And guys, we're just getting started,

392
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,160
 because I think we're about to move on

393
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,400
 to probably the most intriguing part of the story.

394
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
 Satan has his army,

395
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,880
 but there is a demon that even Satan fears.

396
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
 It is one that we all know of.

397
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,680
 Her name is Bloody Mary.

398
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,440
 Bloody Mary is a major figure in the Miami myths.

399
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,840
 Sometimes they use the name La Lorna.

400
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
 Sometimes they use the name Bloody Mary,

401
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
 but in this mythology it's the same person.

402
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,760
 Bloody Mary is a figure that loves the death of children.

403
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,480
 Bloody Mary creeps through the streets of Miami,

404
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
 waiting for the sound of gunfire.

405
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,000
 Every time a child is shot, stabbed, beaten,

406
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,800
 murdered in the city of Miami,

407
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,120
 you can hear Bloody Mary cry out with joy.

408
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,320
 Another child is dead, and that's all that she wants.

409
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,280
 Oteus is a 10-year-old girl,

410
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,240
 and when she's being interviewed by Linda about these stories,

411
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,560
 she tells Linda, "I can tell you a story,

412
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,800
 but this story is very, very dangerous."

413
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,320
 No boys know this story,

414
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,120
 because if a girl tells a boy this story

415
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,800
 that I'm about to tell you,

416
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,360
 that girl's best friend will die.

417
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,680
 Homeless girls in shelters experience something

418
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,200
 that the boys don't.

419
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
 They'll wake up in the middle of the night

420
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,280
 with burning scratches appearing across their arms.

421
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,800
 In the darkness, Bloody Mary is grabbing at them

422
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,760
 and trying to yank them off the bed.

423
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,520
 But it's not so much a physical yanking off the bed,

424
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,480
 because then you're off the bed,

425
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,600
 and then what does Bloody Mary do?

426
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
 Just stands there?

427
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,880
 No.

428
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,840
 She's trying to pull you into a world of slavery.

429
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,440
 If Bloody Mary can get her claws in deep enough into you,

430
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
 you'll join a gang,

431
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,800
 you'll get addicted to crack,

432
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,400
 you'll fall into the world of madness and violence and blood,

433
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,360
 and Bloody Mary loves to kill children,

434
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,760
 but she also loves to corrupt them.

435
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
 Not all death is immediate,

436
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,880
 but all of it pleases Bloody Mary.

437
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,200
 However, one in 1,000 homeless girls is a special one.

438
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,720
 This is a girl who is impervious to the control of Bloody Mary.

439
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,480
 You don't know you're a special one until she appears.

440
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,000
 You'll wake up in the middle of the night,

441
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
 and Bloody Mary will be standing there at the edge of your bed.

442
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,320
 She goes to grab your arms, but there's no scratches.

443
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,520
 There's no claws in the skin.

444
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 She's powerless to attack you.

445
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,880
 When Bloody Mary realizes that you are one of the special one,

446
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
 one out of 1,000 homeless girls have this ability.

447
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,960
 Bloody Mary fades away into the darkness,

448
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,800
 but for a split second,

449
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,840
 where Bloody Mary used to stand,

450
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,040
 you see a glimmering blue face,

451
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,560
 perfectly beautiful girl.

452
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,400
 That's what Bloody Mary used to look like

453
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,040
 before she became corrupted by darkness.

454
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,720
 Bloody Mary stories are universal.

455
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,840
 We did a whole episode or a whole segment on Bloody Mary.

456
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,760
 It's interesting because this Bloody Mary has been transformed

457
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
 into a very active demon.

458
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
 As opposed to something Bloody Mary,

459
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,280
 just for a quick overview,

460
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
 Bloody Mary started off as a parlor game.

461
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,520
 Originally, you would look in the mirror

462
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,160
 and you would see the version of your,

463
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,000
 what your husband would look like standing behind you.

464
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
 That was how it really started off.

465
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,480
 And then that became corrupted and became something spooky.

466
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,040
 This Bloody Mary is a straight up OG.

467
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,280
 Like she, you know, she doesn't need to pop out of mirrors.

468
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
 Like that's one way you can communicate with her.

469
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,480
 She has free reign of Miami.

470
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,600
 She can go wherever she wants.

471
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,880
 She is not limited to a mirror.

472
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
 If she sees your face once, she can find you whenever.

473
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
 If you're not one of the special ones

474
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,560
 and she's trying to pull you out of bed

475
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
 and she gets her fingers into you

476
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,880
 and you brush her off but you can't stop it.

477
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,040
 You can do all the schoolwork you want.

478
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,560
 You can try to be the best student.

479
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,760
 You can be the best daughter.

480
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
 You can be the best friend you can be.

481
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,320
 But Bloody Mary is always standing behind you

482
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,760
 and she only has to wait for you

483
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,440
 to make that one bad decision that leads you down that path.

484
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,320
 She's relentless.

485
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
 But if she's not using psychological tricks,

486
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
 she actually carries a rosary with her

487
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,840
 which she uses to slash kids' faces open with.

488
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,680
 That's some brutal, that's some brutal Bloody Mary stuff.

489
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,080
 She's always been a very passive demon,

490
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,600
 but not in this world.

491
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,840
 Not in the world of the homeless children of Miami.

492
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,480
 Bloody Mary in this world will hunt you and kill you.

493
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,560
 Whether or not you invoke her yourself,

494
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
 if you see her, you are marked.

495
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,920
 Children also believe that they live in a world of real life violence

496
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,960
 and they live in a world of demonic forces.

497
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,280
 When they try to explain the two,

498
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,640
 they think, "I know parents are supposed to love their children.

499
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,280
 Why don't my parents love me?"

500
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,480
 Answer simple in this situation.

501
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,200
 Bloody Mary.

502
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,880
 Bloody Mary is what causes your parents to fight.

503
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,920
 Bloody Mary is what causes your father to punch you in the face.

504
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,240
 Bloody Mary is the cause of all that household strife.

505
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
 To the point that when the kids in the shelter

506
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,840
 are talking about one of their friends

507
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,280
 and he got beaten by their father,

508
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
 got murdered by the mom,

509
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
 the kids in the homeless shelter just kind of look at each other and they know.

510
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,160
 It was Bloody Mary.

511
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,560
 It was Bloody Mary who influenced that parent

512
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,600
 to harm or kill their friend.

513
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,200
 We see how all of this stuff is weaved together

514
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,040
 and it makes so much sense from a child's point of view.

515
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,680
 Why are things happening?

516
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,800
 And it's not even that things are just happening to them.

517
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,560
 If this was in the middle of nowhere

518
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,440
 and they were the only bad family that they knew of,

519
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,200
 they would internalize it more.

520
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
 But when you are hanging out with other homeless children,

521
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
 of course the myths are going to evolve to the point that they make sense.

522
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,200
 Now as an adult we obviously know why parents

523
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
 abuse and murder their children.

524
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,960
 We don't understand, I guess when I say we know,

525
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,400
 we don't, we can't understand it on a human level,

526
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,120
 but we can step back and we can go alcohol,

527
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,960
 drugs, psychotic delusions, anger,

528
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,000
 and then sometimes we will even say evil.

529
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,080
 Chris Watts, who we talked about on yesterday's episode, was evil.

530
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
 But it was a narcissistic evil.

531
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
 It was an egotistical evil.

532
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
 His crime was horrible and you could say demonic.

533
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,320
 But do I think Bloody Mary or a demon infused those events of those nights?

534
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,600
 I mean, who knows?

535
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,760
 But we can look at it psychologically

536
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,880
 and say that guy was a narcissistic evil bastard.

537
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,280
 But these children, they're not reading psychology textbooks.

538
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,440
 And even if you don't read psychology textbooks,

539
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,040
 I've been around for 44 years.

540
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
 You've been around for a good amount of time.

541
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,800
 We can take in our experiences.

542
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,880
 Seven, seven years old, eight years old,

543
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,280
 ten years old trying to explain these dynamics.

544
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,200
 Bloody Mary did it.

545
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
 When you see that level of violence, Bloody Mary did it.

546
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,040
 They're not watching it on television like we are.

547
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,160
 They're seeing it happen on the street corners.

548
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,600
 They're seeing that empty cot in the homeless shelter.

549
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,720
 Bloody Mary did it.

550
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,440
 Let's wrap the story up like this.

551
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
 We're going to finish it where we began.

552
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
 God is sitting in his palace.

553
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,680
 It's a week before Christmas, 1996.

554
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,480
 He starts to notice things aren't right on earth.

555
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,360
 His wall has projections of every human doing everything.

556
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,880
 He's an omnipotent being.

557
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,080
 And he's watching all of reality play out in his palace.

558
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,520
 And he hears something.

559
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,440
 He hears that Satan has made a deal with Bloody Mary.

560
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
 God has lived since before time existed.

561
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,160
 But this frees him.

562
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,280
 Bloody Mary had made a pact with Satan.

563
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,520
 Satan actually is afraid of Bloody Mary.

564
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,680
 Satan hates Bloody Mary.

565
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,440
 But this will get the job done.

566
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,280
 Bloody Mary says, "I will help you take down God."

567
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,120
 And I will help you take over the earth.

568
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,600
 But I want to kill all the children.

569
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
 Do what you want with the adults.

570
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,000
 Do what you want with God.

571
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,040
 But you saved the children of earth for me.

572
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,080
 Now, Satan gets a pretty bad rap about stuff.

573
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,400
 Right?

574
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,720
 Well, that's cold.

575
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,560
 That's cold.

576
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,720
 I don't want to kill anyone over the age of 12.

577
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
 That's insane.

578
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,760
 So, Satan probably has a good reason to hate Bloody Mary

579
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
 and to fear Bloody Mary.

580
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,480
 But he makes the deal.

581
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,280
 God is watching this play out.

582
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,160
 And he knows it's only a matter of time.

583
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,120
 God can't sleep.

584
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,160
 He can't rest.

585
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,080
 Every moment he's kept awake by the chaos on earth,

586
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,240
 something is going to happen soon.

587
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:50,320
 All he hears is crying and laughter, celebrations and misery, joy and horror.

588
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,440
 And it's louder than it's ever been before.

589
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,120
 The images on the wall are becoming more chaotic.

590
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,240
 Things are happening.

591
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,520
 The images on the wall eventually just become shadows

592
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,920
 of what's going on on earth.

593
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,360
 But the madness continues.

594
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,280
 And then BOOM!

595
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,920
 BOOM!

596
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,240
 BOOM!

597
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,800
 The gates of heaven are pounded on.

598
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,560
 Bloody Mary has the legions of hell at her back.

599
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
 God just waits there.

600
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,320
 The legions of hell

601
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,520
 crawl over the walls, up the battlements,

602
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,560
 invade the mansion of God.

603
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,400
 The front door is busted open.

604
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,880
 And Bloody Mary stands there.

605
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,240
 God looks at this invader, this woman with no eyeballs,

606
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
 just sockets, bleeding black blood.

607
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,440
 She stands in front of the creator of the universe.

608
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
 And he recognizes Bloody Mary.

609
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,040
 He always knew who she was.

610
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,720
 They had met before.

611
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,480
 The night he impregnated her,

612
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,080
 with his son, Jesus Christ.

613
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,680
 It's not that he couldn't destroy Bloody Mary,

614
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,200
 it's that he didn't have the heart to.

615
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,040
 And so he fled.

616
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,920
 And she took that throne for herself,

617
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,800
 and the invasion of earth began.

618
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,720
 I mean, you know, I've heard a lot of variations

619
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
 of the Bloody Mary story before.

620
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,080
 I don't think I've ever heard,

621
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,280
 you guys correct me if I'm wrong,

622
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,880
 because maybe I've mentioned in past episodes,

623
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
 but I don't think I've ever heard of a time

624
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,280
 that Bloody Mary has been equated with Mary,

625
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,320
 a mother of Jesus.

626
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,920
 But you see how that mythology is,

627
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,080
 it's perfectly weaved together.

628
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,440
 Actually, the article is purchased for film rights.

629
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,520
 I think Clive Barker had it at one point.

630
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,400
 They were going to turn.

631
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
 This would make, on the one hand,

632
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
 I can imagine this being an amazing movie,

633
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,040
 but I could also imagine it being like a 1990s

634
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,920
 New Line Cinema movie, just really trashy.

635
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,040
 So, I mean, you've got the podcast version,

636
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,160
 but there's so much stuff you can dissect with this.

637
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,280
 The one, just the narrative alone of God leaving us,

638
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,240
 of Bloody Mary being an active participant in murders.

639
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,840
 And then Plot Twist, Plot Twist, right?

640
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,120
 No one saw that coming.

641
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
 That's actually Jesus' mom.

642
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,720
 Story of the Blue Lady being like one of the forces

643
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
 that you can fight for you,

644
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
 but you have to know her name.

645
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,120
 It's an interesting thing.

646
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,520
 That way you can't call out for the Blue Lady.

647
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,320
 She doesn't come to you,

648
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
 and then you tell the other kids at the shelter,

649
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
 "That's fake! She doesn't come!"

650
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,440
 Like, I've called for her multiple times.

651
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,080
 She didn't show up.

652
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,680
 People go, "That's because you don't know her real name."

653
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,320
 So, there's kind of like that safety lock

654
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,920
 on that part of the myth.

655
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,760
 Bloody Mary's always looking for you.

656
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,120
 The special ones, very interesting detail.

657
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,240
 It's one out of a thousand homeless girls, see?

658
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,520
 It's an entire mythology,

659
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,600
 based basically in one city,

660
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,320
 among a subculture of a subculture,

661
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
 homeless children.

662
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,520
 Absolutely fascinating.

663
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,960
 I almost feel like it would be

664
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
 bastardized if they turned it into a movie.

665
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,880
 Because I could just imagine a bunch of kids

666
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,840
 running around being like,

667
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,800
 "Stop! Bloody Mary!"

668
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,560
 And they're using slingshots to stop her.

669
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,240
 She's like, "No, my only weakness!

670
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
 Stones you can find on the road!"

671
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,400
 When in reality this story was crafted

672
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,720
 on the bodies of dead homeless children.

673
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,560
 Kids actually suffered and died,

674
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,840
 and this story was created to make sense of that.

675
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,640
 So, you know,

676
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
 there's really not any other way to wrap this up.

677
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,520
 I will say this, I mean, obviously,

678
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,720
 it's very cinematic,

679
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,560
 but you guys know how I feel about a lot of this secret war.

680
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,280
 Maybe you guys don't.

681
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
 I talk about it a lot, I think in real life.

682
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
 They can talk about it more in real life than I do on the show,

683
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,480
 but I've always had a fascination with the secret war,

684
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,040
 with something going on just out of view.

685
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,840
 The abandoned warehouse that you're driving by,

686
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,120
 you're driven by a hundred times.

687
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,560
 Inside there, there's some secret arms deal going down

688
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,320
 between Shredder and the Purple Dragons.

689
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,240
 Like, I love stuff like that.

690
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,800
 I love the idea that we live our lives

691
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,160
 blind to a whole other war going on around us.

692
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,440
 I think that's what always attracted me to shows like Angel

693
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,240
 and things like that,

694
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,600
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer,

695
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
 but getting back into the world of reality,

696
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
 this article,

697
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,040
 I think I'm very fascinated by the idea that

698
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,080
 Angels and Demons are duking it out on the streets of Miami.

699
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
 Obviously, I hope it's not true,

700
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
 because it's quite bloody,

701
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,760
 but I love the narrative to it.

702
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,120
 I love the idea that somewhere out there

703
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,080
 that the Angels are fighting a good war,

704
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,400
 and I love the lesson to the kids.

705
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,920
 It's the one thing you can control.

706
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,200
 If you're a good person,

707
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,120
 you can be a part of this war,

708
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,800
 which is, again,

709
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
 like, they can't control anything else,

710
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,280
 but how they interact with each other.

711
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,320
 So amazing lessons coming out of these myths.

712
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,200
 Like I said, this article,

713
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,720
 I said earlier, it was 1996.

714
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,920
 It came out in 1997,

715
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,160
 but I think it's fascinating to see

716
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,680
 if someone else would go down there

717
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,120
 and investigate these stories more,

718
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,240
 how they've evolved.

719
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,000
 Now, I think the myth would actually spread quicker,

720
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
 but it's still very, very unique

721
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,960
 to a population of homeless children

722
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,760
 who have to tell themselves stories

723
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,640
 to make sense of a violent and chaotic world.

724
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,080
 But really, I guess even adults still do that.
