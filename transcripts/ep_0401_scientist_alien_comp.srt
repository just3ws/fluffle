1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 When a man wakes up and notices something very valuable as missing, he'll do anything to get it back.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,100
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story of an alien encounter.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,800
 Now, so many stories involving aliens take place in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,800
 with someone who may not be the most observant person to begin with.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,300
 This story takes place at 9.40 in the morning, in a man's bedroom,

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,400
 and the victim is a scientist, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:40,100
 [music]

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,100
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,100
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,200
 Still getting used to this losing an hour.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,300
 I don't know, but I never really...

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,700
 When I was younger and we leapt forward, do they do that in every country?

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,400
 I don't think they do. I think some countries, they don't care about it.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,600
 But you lose an hour of sleep or you gain spring forward. That's what I'm looking for.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,800
 When I was a young man, it didn't really faze me, but for some reason, now that I'm old, I'm like, "Ugh, one hour.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,500
 I lost a day ago. Uh, so lethargic."

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,300
 So yeah, that's my boomer ran for this episode.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,100
 Let's go ahead and get started. Now, actually, before we get started,

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,500
 I have to thank yet another awesome Patreon supporter.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,400
 We have Mike G. Really, really appreciate the support.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,600
 If you can't support the Patreon, you totally understand.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,100
 In some countries, you can't do it. Financial situation may not allow it.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,700
 If you can't support the Patreon, though, you can support the show by getting the word out about the show,

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,200
 leaving a review where every listener podcast.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,800
 I got flyers. You can print up at deadrabbit.com, put around your town, coffee shop, stuff like that.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,300
 Just help getting the word out really, really helps the show a lot.

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,300
 Okay, so for our first story, Mike G. fire up that carbonara coffee.

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,600
 After we were headed out to Madagury, Nigeria, we were flying out to Africa.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,600
 The year is 2004. The date is September 27th.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,100
 And our helicopter appears over the city.

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,400
 But we're in stealth mode because we do not want to be anywhere near this story.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,000
 On September 27th, there's this dude named Jabril Na'ala.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,400
 He's a council official and he actually is not a local.

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
 So he's in this other city and they're like, "Hey, Jabril, what's up?"

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,600
 And he's like, "I don't know. I'm just doing council stuff."

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,800
 And they're like, "Well, we need you to do more council stuff.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
 Would you be willing?"

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
 Actually, no, it's just, they're not going to ask him,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,600
 "You are going to Madagury for a two-day conference."

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,500
 And he's like, "Oh, I've heard good things about the Big M, the village that never sleeps."

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,300
 They're like, "Yeah, it's a pretty dope place.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,400
 You need to go down there and like hang out and like learn some stuff and then come back and teach us."

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,300
 Because that's how seminars work.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,700
 Now, we don't know if Jabril had a weird feeling about this.

46
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:56,300
 Maybe as he was going home that day, he's like, "Hmm, this trip may not be as fortuitous as I imagined

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,600
 when I signed up to be a council official.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 I imagined a life of luxury, but instead, I have the sneaking suspicion I'm going to be accused of something."

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,300
 But he shrugs it off and just drives home, goes to bed.

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
 Next day, I don't know the chain of events.

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,300
 The point is, is that this dude named Jabril, I'm like giving him a whole backstory.

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,800
 He's like, "He had two brothers."

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
 Oh, I don't know. I don't know any of that.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,300
 If any of that's true, his mental is what he was thinking.

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
 I'm not Professor X, but what I do know is this.

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 On September 27, 2004, he does end up in Madagury.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,300
 And he's hanging out with three of his work buddies and they're like, "Oh, this is a pretty dope place, man.

58
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
 I really love learning stuff about council work."

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,800
 But, you know, the other thing I love is eating.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,300
 The other thing I love is sustaining my biological force

61
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,300
 so I can live another day and learn more about council operation.

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
 So they're looking around for a place to eat.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,800
 And there's a group of dudes just kind of hanging out on the street corner.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,300
 Now, I think this is pretty much everyone's worst fear.

65
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,300
 This is the reason why people don't like interacting with strangers.

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,800
 I interact with strangers all the time, but I also always have at the back of my head,

67
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,300
 "This guy's going to stab me. This guy's going to stab me in the back of the head."

68
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,800
 Like, I interact with strangers all the time, but I never let my guard down.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 So this should be proof of why you should either shouldn't act with strangers at all

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 or be very leery of them, at the very least, or be prepared.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 Jabril and his buddies, his work buddies, walk up to these guys and go, "Hey, do you know where a good restaurant is?"

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 And as they're talking, looking for a restaurant, one of the strangers,

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,800
 one of the people that Jabril is talking to, all of a sudden goes, "Huh? What? Huh?"

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,300
 "What? Hey, hey, dude, not just his buddy. Hey, dude, I think he stole it."

75
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,300
 "I think this guy, see this guy right here? I think he stole it."

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,300
 And the buddy's like, "What are you talking about? This guy right here? These people from out of town?"

77
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,300
 "Yeah, yeah, look. Look."

78
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
 "My penis is gone."

79
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,300
 And his friend's like, "What? I don't want to look. I don't want to look because I think it might be there."

80
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,800
 And I don't want to look. "No, no, no, no, no, no. Look at these guys who just walked up

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,800
 and then I felt something weird. I looked down. My penis, my penis is gone."

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,300
 And at this point, the out of towners, Jabril and his buddies,

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,800
 notice that a guy is frantically grabbing at his crotch and then pointing at them,

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
 which is a bad sign to begin with, right?

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 But then begin saying, "You stole my penis. You stole my penis."

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 Commotion, obviously. That's something you're going to stop.

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,800
 If you're like reading the newspaper at a coffee shop and you're used to people screaming out random stuff,

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,300
 like, "I'm just honking sirens going by."

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,800
 Someone starts yelling out, "You stole my penis. You're putting down the newspaper."

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 Now, the next thing that happens-- What would you do if someone stole your penis, right?

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
 Assuming you have one to begin with.

92
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 If you don't have one, then you don't know what you're missing.

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,300
 But if you do have one, what would you do?

94
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,800
 Like, you really only have one option at that point.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,300
 First off, you'd have to believe that leprechauns exist, that magic is possible,

96
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
 that penises can simply disappear.

97
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,300
 Secondly, you almost have to attack the guy, right?

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,300
 Because you can't let him go. You can't give him the benefit of the doubt, right?

99
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 Because what if he does have your penis? You have to.

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,300
 But you don't have to kill him. And that's where this story goes.

101
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,300
 So I had to preface this. The dudes begin stomping these out-of-towners.

102
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,300
 And then his buddies bounce, but Jabril can't get away and they beat him to death.

103
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,300
 You know, that's not funny, right? That's horrible. That's tragic.

104
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,300
 And eight people have been arrested for this crime.

105
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,300
 Now, this is a story, again, from 2004. I found it on my new news folder,

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,300
 which is a folder of old articles from an old project I was working on.

107
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,300
 No follow-up. Which, I'm not shocked. I don't think that this would be on court TV.

108
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
 I don't think Nancy Grace would be having these guys on every day.

109
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,300
 It wouldn't be a highly documented case. Apparently, penis theft is an issue over there.

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,300
 Not in the fact that it actually happens, but that people think it happens.

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
 But the story opens a whole box of worms.

112
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,300
 One, it's not funny that he got-it would have been funny if everyone got beat up and everyone ran away.

113
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,300
 But the fact that Jabril died that makes it less funny, I don't think I need to explain humor to you.

114
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,300
 But just so we're clear, I don't-I wish it had a happy ending.

115
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,300
 Secondly, here's my question. When does he notice his penis is gone?

116
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,300
 Like, he says that he noticed it when they were standing in the group.

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,300
 But I gotta be honest, if I was just standing there and my penis disappeared, I don't think I would notice it right away.

118
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,300
 I don't think-it's, I mean, like, yeah, it's cool to, like, have, but it's not some-it's not like-

119
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,300
 Think about it, when you lose your keys, you don't immediately realize your keys are missing, right?

120
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,300
 And I use my keys more than I use my penis, so the point is, is that-and my keys make noise.

121
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
 So, I wouldn't even notice if my keys were missing. I have a theory, his penis really was missing,

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,300
 but he woke up that morning, his penis was missing, and then he realized that he was, like, banging some witch doctor's daughter or something like that,

123
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,300
 and then the whole day he's like, "Uh-oh, I can't let my wife know that I'm banging that witch doctor's daughter."

124
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,300
 Well, you know what, that's very sexist of me. Maybe the witch doctor is a female. Maybe it's a witch nurse.

125
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,300
 So anyways, he's like, "Oh, I'm banging this witch nurse, and I can't, like, let my wife know,

126
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,300
 I'm just gonna have to walk around with no penis for a while, hoping someone from out of town will show up."

127
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,300
 And the whole time, like, he's at a bar, you see someone come and he's like, "He's so-oh, wait, no, I know that guy."

128
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,300
 And then he sees someone, "Oh, that guy-oh, no, hey, what's up, Charlie? Yeah, no, no, no, it's cool.

129
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,300
 I wasn't pointing at my crotch, and then you-and then finally some guys walked up and said,

130
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,300
 "Hey, do you know where the restaurant is?" And then he's like, "Oh, the perfect patsy. Perfect patsy for a missing penis."

131
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,300
 The biggest question, though, really is, where is this penis now? Like, I don't get this kind of grind, you know?

132
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:59,300
 No one knows where it's at, like, right now, as of the recording of this podcast, but the question is, is, like, does he have it back?

133
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,300
 Like, did he get arrested and they take him downtown and the cops, like, do a strip search, and they're like, "Sir, it's right there."

134
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,300
 Or did they do a strip search and go, "Oh, my God, it's gone." Like, where's it at now?

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,300
 Because it would really suck if someone stole your penis or any sexual organ, really. Maybe you're like, "Oh, my ovaries.

136
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:25,300
 That, again, would be really, really hard to detect." I'm assuming. I don't think you feel them inside of you, but you wouldn't notice that right away.

137
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,300
 It wouldn't be until you needed them that you're like, "That's weird. I've gone eight years without a period.

138
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,300
 I should check out and see what's going on." If they-you see some dude walking around with bolos around his neck,

139
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 "Oh, this is my ovaries. No, no. I bought these at a bed bathroom."

140
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,300
 "You sell bolos there? Flesh-colored bolos?" Yeah, yeah, totally. It's in the back.

141
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,300
 So, the point is, where was I going with this?

142
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 If you're being-oh, yeah, yeah. So, if your genitals are missing, you would beat people up.

143
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:05,300
 But then, if you think you would just double check or triple check before you started punching people,

144
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,300
 and then even then, would they show back up? I don't know, but apparently, penis theft is a big thing over there.

145
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,300
 People just dudes wake up with no genitals, which would be terrifying, which would be absolutely terrifying.

146
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,300
 So, I'm no real other way to end that story. I could do a typical dead rabbit radio ending where I'm like,

147
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,300
 "So, the next time you're walking down the street, and you're in a town that you've never been to before,

148
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
 be careful of that group of people standing on the street corner,

149
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,300
 because they may not only know the perfect way to a nearby restaurant,

150
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,300
 but you may also have their dick in your pants."

151
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:53,300
 Dead rabbit radio gmail.com. I could do that, but that's-that's-that's actually probably more distracting

152
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,300
 than just ending it. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

153
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,300
 So, for our next story, Mike G, fire up that carbonicopter. We are headed out to a town.

154
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,300
 I don't have the specific name of the town, and here's the thing. Normally, if I don't have a lot of specific details,

155
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,300
 like who, what, when, where, why, how, if I don't have a-leave some majority of those, I'm a little suspicious,

156
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,300
 but there's a reason why we don't have this town, because this is where this dude currently lives.

157
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:29,300
 There's a bunch of people chilling at his house. Now, we're flying out to this town, Scienceville, USA, we'll call it,

158
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:37,300
 and as we're flying out, I noticed my flight suit that I'm magically wearing now to make this joke work is a little tighter.

159
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,300
 I'm like, "What?" I look down, and something's missing, huh? And then Mike G has a bag.

160
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:50,300
 Mike G has a bag. He's like, "Another one from my collection. It was I, a long, who would have thought the Patreon supporter

161
00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:20,300
 stole men's genitals?" Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

162
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,300
 would have thought the joke they should have sent to Poet?" And I've heard that comment used not jokingly, but when you talk about, like,

163
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,300
 people have said, you know, when you send an astronaut up, we should have sent a Poet. Like, someone who has a command of the English language,

164
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:40,300
 or just language in general, when you send a Poet up, they're able to just, they have a different visual language for things.

165
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:49,300
 So, this is kind of similar to that, but this is kind of the inverse. We have a lot of stories of alien abductions where people like me

166
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,300
 get abducted. They happen in the middle of nowhere, not under the best circumstances for the observer. Either there's like clouds,

167
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:07,300
 or mist, or it's far away, or it's super close and bright. A lot of people who get abducted by UFOs, they seem to lack the best way to describe these events.

168
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:16,300
 And I think when you're talking about something that's so out of this world, if you have observational skills that are above a normal human,

169
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,300
 it definitely helps. And I've always felt that way. I've always felt that way. When you have farm girls getting kidnapped,

170
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:30,300
 or, you know, people driving home late at night getting abducted and stuff like that. Their main thing is, I'm a carpet salesman.

171
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:37,300
 I sell carpet by the pound, and then I meet these aliens. I don't have the language to really discuss this. This guy does.

172
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:48,300
 And this came on a Twitter thread, so Deep Prasad really had nothing to gain from this story. I mean attention, obviously. People like attention, but he's a successful businessman,

173
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:57,300
 he's a successful scientist, and one day he posts on Twitter, the Twitter link is in the show notes, and I think it's interesting to read for yourself.

174
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:06,300
 We're going to go over it here, obviously, but just to see the level of observation he has. So it's 9.40 in the morning, and Deep is wide awake.

175
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:14,300
 He's been awake for over an hour, so this wasn't, I was just falling asleep, or he's in the middle of the night. He's been awake, he's working on his laptop laying in bed,

176
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,300
 and he has all these detailed sketches of where he was laying, and it's a really, really interesting Twitter thread. But he's laying in bed,

177
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:30,300
 wide awake though, he's working on his computer, and then just instantly, they didn't beam in, they're just instantly there.

178
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:42,300
 There's three grey aliens standing around his bed, and his brain is flooded with thousands of sentences, as he puts it.

179
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:58,300
 And he sees Japanese, and he said it was a, you could see Japanese lettering, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, and it's just kind of projected in the room, floating around, and he can't move.

180
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,300
 He's completely petrified, obviously, he's completely petrified, but at the same time he's super curious about what's going on.

181
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:15,300
 None of the theme that he sees makes sense as far as the language goes, but he sees three letters, three very familiar letters in English pop up a couple times, DNA.

182
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:27,300
 And everything else is a mixture of what seems to be Japanese, what is it, cuneiform? Japanese lettering, and then you have Egyptian hieroglyphics, or something similar to that.

183
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 And this is interesting because we've talked about this before, and I made the comment that aliens don't have this, and he said that he heard, quote, "weird rock," not English, but English sounding music played at one point briefly, unquote.

184
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:55,300
 And I made a comment, you never hear about music involving aliens, we have this one, found a story recently where a UFO ship was descending, and it sounded like electronic music was playing through it, but really that's it.

185
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:07,300
 And that is the only time I've ever really come across music, but he's laying here, and I know some of you are thinking, I have my own theory about this, and I know what some of you are thinking, we'll get to that in the end, don't start commenting on YouTube just yet.

186
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,300
 He's laying in bed, he's frozen, he hears rock music that's not English, but sounds English.

187
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:22,300
 And then this is where things get really weird. So you've got three great aliens walking around, you've got all this projection stuff, and you're like, that's not even the weird stuff, no, we're not even close to the weird stuff.

188
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:33,300
 Sunny bedroom, 9.40 in the morning, so now he's not frozen, he can move his head, and he can lift his head up, and he is somewhere else.

189
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,300
 He doesn't go into description of what this place is, but he says, when my head's up, I'm somewhere else. When I put my head back down on the pillow, I'm back in my bedroom.

190
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:48,300
 Lift my head up, totally different location, put my head down, sunny bedroom morning.

191
00:16:48,300 --> 00:17:01,300
 And the aliens the whole time are just kind of walking around him. He decides at this point he's going to stop fighting this feeling, he's going to stop fighting it, and I'm just going to observe.

192
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,300
 I'm going to focus on what's going on, I'm going to take mental notes of how this is going on.

193
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:12,300
 He said the aliens, they did look like rays, they look like a typical alien, you'd see in X-Files or something like that.

194
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:20,300
 But their skin felt like hard plastic, so they didn't have an organic feel to them, which is common.

195
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,300
 There's a lot of people who think that great aliens are actually robots.

196
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:30,300
 Some people believe, and I was talking to Sabine about this, some people believe that great aliens, that's actually a space suit.

197
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:38,300
 I've heard that conspiracy as well, that it's a space suit that they wear, and underneath it, they're reptilians.

198
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:50,300
 If someone saw human astronauts dancing around on the moon, you would think, oh, there must be some sort of robot or some sort of inorganic thing, and it's not until the visor came up that you saw our beautiful human faces.

199
00:17:50,300 --> 00:18:02,300
 But that's a conspiracy theory as well, they're actually reptiles in disguise or that's some sort of suit, and the giant eyeballs are basically, I've also heard you can remove those big giant black eyeballs, are coverings.

200
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:11,300
 Basically UV light, coverings. We could really go into that, and I'll see if I can dig up some more sources on that, but when he touches these things, they feel like they're hard plastic.

201
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:22,300
 He said, and I thought this was interesting because we've covered this in other stories, these creatures, these aliens had an emblem, a holographic emblem, showing a rank, showing a division type thing.

202
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:31,300
 These ones, it was on their arm, and it was a hologram that was rotating around their arm, which, you know, like his military will have the badge on their arm, which sounds cool.

203
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:43,300
 They have a holographic rotating symbol, the only problem is it's so impractical, because what if you walk up to someone and you want to know what rank they are, but you're like, great, I gotta wait five seconds, as it slowly rotates around your arm.

204
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:55,300
 So that makes us think, you know, again, that level of observation, he has all these sketches and stuff, the hard plastic to the touch, they're wearing these tight white suits.

205
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,300
 Makes you think, well, okay, typical gray aliens might lead towards the inorganic or might lead to the suit.

206
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,300
 He said though, looking at them, he got the feeling one.

207
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:11,300
 They quote, exuded immense scientific and emotional intelligence.

208
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:24,300
 So just being in their presence, he could tell how great these things were, which is interesting because there are people who believe that angel visitations in the past,

209
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
 were alien sightings.

210
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:45,300
 And if this observation is true, an alien just appeared in your room and you were some old dude in like 400 BC, and you were just, oh, you didn't even know what the word scientific meant, but you were being visited by this being.

211
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,300
 And you're just like, I know this thing knows more than all of humanity put together.

212
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,300
 Kind of an interesting take on that.

213
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:58,300
 He says that, kind of going along that, he goes, they felt etheric.

214
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:07,300
 They felt more etheric than a biological entity, which again is a very, very fascinating read on the thing.

215
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
 And I mentioned this in past episodes too.

216
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,300
 If you saw a wolf walking through the woods, your brain goes, that's a biological animal that evolved on this planet.

217
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:27,300
 If you saw an animal you'd never seen before, like if you had never read one of those kids books and then one day a koala walked in your bedroom, you'd be like, whoa, that is some weird looking animal, but it's from Earth.

218
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
 It evolved on this planet.

219
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,300
 You would recognize it as a biological entity.

220
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
 He's saying that's not what these seemed like.

221
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:43,300
 They seemed more spiritual than a biological construct or even an inorganic construct.

222
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
 Then we get into some weird stuff.

223
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,300
 I'm going to brush over some of this stuff because it's almost just a list of things he sees.

224
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,300
 As all this stuff is going on, he sees kind of floating, he sees kind of floating in the background.

225
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 A 3D, what he describes as a 3D wizard hat.

226
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,300
 He says it looks like it's a reconstruction from an old video game he played as a kid.

227
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
 So that's kind of floating around in the back.

228
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
 You're like, what? I know, I know.

229
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
 This is where, again, it just keeps getting weird.

230
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
 That's kind of floating around in the background.

231
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:19,300
 One of the aliens has a monitor on his chest and it begins producing these beautiful golden hieroglyphic images,

232
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
 these holograms on this alien's chest.

233
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 And at this point, he goes, quote, this is an effing joke.

234
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,300
 What is wrong with me? What are these things?

235
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,300
 He's thinking that.

236
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:34,300
 And then alien jumps on top of him, begins to walk, so starts walking on him and gets to his head.

237
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
 And then, bam.

238
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:43,300
 He says, "A bright light hit my head," and here we're going to have this quote because we got a lot of these great quotes.

239
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,300
 "I will try my best to describe it.

240
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,300
 It felt like the universe was sentient and aware of my existence.

241
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
 The feeling was of warmth and nostalgia."

242
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,300
 And to be fair, he put a little question mark next to a nostalgia.

243
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
 He's like, that's the best word he could use to figure it out.

244
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,300
 The feeling was of warmth and nostalgia.

245
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:13,300
 It was like a reminder that space is teeming with life and that we're all related to each other by virtue of existing.

246
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,300
 I used the word oneness, which meant nothing to me before.

247
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
 He's knocked out.

248
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,300
 And the next thing, he comes back to reality.

249
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
 Aliens are gone.

250
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:32,300
 Not one second has passed in the real world.

251
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:41,300
 He said for a long time, for a couple of weeks after that, he was flooded with just feelings of euphoria.

252
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
 He felt greater than he'd ever -- true bliss.

253
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,300
 And it slowly wore off.

254
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,300
 Slowly wore off.

255
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,300
 But he had some permanent changes to his personality.

256
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:02,300
 He used to be atheist, now he's not necessarily religious, but he considers himself spiritual.

257
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,300
 He began dreaming of UFOs, which he goes, "I never dreamt about UAPs," is what he called them.

258
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 An unidentified aerial phenomenon.

259
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,300
 He goes, "I never dreamt about them before, but now I'm having dreams about them all the time."

260
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,300
 He goes, "Then I started seeing them when I was walking around.

261
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 Sometimes I would be out with my friends and we would all see them together."

262
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:27,300
 But it's interesting because he has this beautiful life-changing experience, according to him.

263
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:33,300
 And he feels this utter oneness with the universe, which is a beautiful thought, right?

264
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,300
 That everything is connected and harm against one is harm against all.

265
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:46,300
 And knowing that we are part of the universe, knowing that we do have a place in the universe,

266
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:53,300
 it doesn't matter if you're a shoe shine guy or a penis thief, or CEO of a quantum computer company.

267
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:00,300
 Everyone's equal because everyone is alive, or spent a moment alive, or will be alive.

268
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,300
 The universe is just one giant organism.

269
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
 This is a very beautiful thought.

270
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,300
 He had, it's interesting because again, I can totally relate to this.

271
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,300
 I've had experiences that were life-changing and there's this element where you go, "No, no, no, I don't want this."

272
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300
 Let me read you this quote.

273
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,300
 "I started feeling unnerved because I felt I had lost my free will to an extent.

274
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,300
 I didn't like that this newfound fearfulness, unconditional love, and so on, were not coming from me.

275
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,300
 I didn't think I had earned it."

276
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 So in this moment, so after this event when he has all this bliss, the rational part of his head is going,

277
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:47,300
 "Who are you to feel these emotions? Who are you to have this connection with the universe?"

278
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:53,300
 And he fights it, and he fights it, and he fights it, and eventually he does return to normal, which is where he's at now.

279
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,300
 But I've had experiences like that where I go, "Whoa, that really was amazing.

280
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:05,300
 I changed my view on things, but it's kind of scary. Can I go back? Can I go back to being a little more mundane?"

281
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:11,300
 And you get, and the universe gives you what you ask of it.

282
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,300
 The universe gives you what you ask of it.

283
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,300
 He's definitely, I think it was a great experience for him.

284
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,300
 I'm very, very brave to share the story for us.

285
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,300
 The fact that he doesn't list his home address, we don't know what city it took place in.

286
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,300
 But to find with that, he goes on the record, he tells the story.

287
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,300
 That's really all we can ask. I think it's a great story with a high level of observation.

288
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,300
 It's just an amazing story, and it's from the point of view of someone who's surely observant.

289
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,300
 However, let's be a little skeptical, because that's kind of what this show does.

290
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,300
 I do have to say, I believe that this story happened, however, on a skeptical bin.

291
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,300
 It also seems similar to a possible stroke, right?

292
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,300
 The fact that you're not being able to move, and the random images pop into the head,

293
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,300
 and then there's just some things, like the perception changing, depending on where the body...

294
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
 You could say it was a stroke.

295
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:08,300
 I believe it's more likely that it's real, because it hits on enough tropes,

296
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,300
 it hits on enough stuff that we supposedly know about alien encounters.

297
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:18,300
 But there's also new information, and also they don't talk about the environment, which was a nice change of pace.

298
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,300
 It rings true. It rings true. I don't think it was just a stroke, or a stroke at all.

299
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,300
 But I just wanted to throw it out there, because I think some of you guys may have done it.

300
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,300
 I think the creepiest thing about it, though, is we always got a hint at reverting on a creepy note.

301
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,300
 I love this story. I'm glad that he had that. I'm glad that he shared it with us.

302
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,300
 I do think it's creepy about him raising his head, and he's in a different location.

303
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:45,300
 I think that's kind of spooky, because it makes you think that the veil between the two worlds,

304
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:52,300
 or the multiple worlds, is that thin? Maybe the aliens being here on Earth weakened it?

305
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,300
 But it's weird to think that you could turn your head and you could look and see another reality.

306
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 Because that's obviously not what goes on here.

307
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,300
 Unless you're turning your head and taking a fat bong at it while you're doing it.

308
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,300
 For the most part, we have a "agreed upon reality" and we're here.

309
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 I think it's creepy that when he lifts his head, he's somewhere else.

310
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 And the fact the level of detail he has in this story, his "somewhere else is so vague,"

311
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,300
 kind of makes me think that's a part of the story he doesn't want to revisit.

312
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,300
 It's one thing to have aliens walking around in your bedroom.

313
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:33,300
 It's one thing to be on an alien spaceship that's within our reality.

314
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:40,300
 But being transported to an alien dimension would have to be terrifying.

315
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:48,300
 There may be a sense of oneness in our universe, but in an other dimension,

316
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,300
 who's to say it's just not you?

317
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,300
 Alone and lost.

318
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,300
 And the only thing that we have to go on is some scientist went missing in his bedroom one day.

319
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
 They found his laptop on.

320
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:13,300
 And an odd possible clue. They find a wizard hat sitting on a dresser.

321
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,300
