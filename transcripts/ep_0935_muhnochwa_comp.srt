1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 A man who believes he's being gangstalked by his neighbors decides to take the war to

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,940
 them.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,180
 And then we travel to India to take a look at a cryptid that was so feared, thousands

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,880
 of people protested in the streets demanding that the government take down the Munochawa

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,080
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:35,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 I really do mean that.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,520
 I hope today is an awesome day for you.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,000
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started walking into Dead Rabbit Command as one of

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 our newest Patreon supporters.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,400
 Everyone on your feet and give it up for Terry Malica.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
 Woohoo!

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
 Yeah!

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,320
 I'm Terry and I'm going to pronounce your last name right Terry.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
 Come on in.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,560
 Even if I didn't, you're still a little loud inside.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,920
 Dead Rabbit Command Terry, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,160
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 I really do.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,520
 Just please, please get the word out about the show.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,600
 You have no idea how much that helps.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,160
 If you can't support the show financially, just tell your friends and family or talk

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,600
 about it online.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,560
 Really, really, really please do that.

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,400
 It helps the show grow.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,720
 And the show needs to grow.

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
 It does need to grow.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,160
 Terry, let's go ahead and get this journey started.

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,120
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the Bunny Bicycle.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,440
 We're going to take a nice leisurely ride all the way from Dead Rabbit Command out to

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,720
 a very depressing story in Butler Township, Ohio.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
 Squeaky, squeaky, squeaky, squeaky, squeaky, squeaky.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,320
 That is the Bunny Bicycle.

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
 You see?

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,960
 We need new listeners to hear the squeaky noises of the Bunny Bicycle.

38
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,720
 We're headed out to Butler Township.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,840
 We're sitting on the handlebars.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,200
 We're enjoying the last days of summer.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,600
 It's August 5th, 2022 in Butler Township, Ohio.

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,560
 Specifically, we're going to a sleepy little area known as Haverstraw Avenue.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 Terry peels out on the bicycle.

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,120
 We go flying on the handlebars.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 Uh, actually, you know what's funny?

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,680
 This is going to be a little side segment.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
 It's going to be super depressing in the beginning.

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,640
 I keep making these jokes about us sitting on the handlebars of this bicycle.

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,040
 I got to be honest with you guys.

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,520
 When I was a little kid, I don't remember this super clearly, but this would have been,

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
 I was born in '76.

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,240
 I think this was like in '79, '80, '81, something like that.

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,960
 One of my older brothers, good friends, they, I remember the street we lived on.

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,400
 This was when we lived in Orangevale back in the late '70s, early '80s.

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,280
 Like, I don't remember this, right?

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,960
 Because I was such a little tiny guy, but my brother does.

57
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
 My family does.

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,720
 There are these kids in the neighborhood.

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,960
 We lived on this street.

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,840
 Like, the tones totally changed.

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
 Terry's like, "Uh, what?

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,760
 Are we still going to Ohio or what?"

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,240
 We're in Orangevale, California.

64
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,440
 There's the street we lived on.

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 Kind of ended in a cul-de-sac.

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,840
 It was a long street with a cul-de-sac on the end.

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
 And it was my brother's best friend and his little brother.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
 I don't remember any of their names.

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
 I was like, "Baby, what do you expect?"

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,600
 They're a little baby person.

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 But I remember this story like very clearly being told to me as a kid, safety first, right?

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,880
 My brother's best friend and his little brother were riding on a bicycle.

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,720
 The brother, the older brother, was pedaling and the younger brother was on the handlebars.

74
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,160
 And they weren't wearing helmets because, again, it was the 1980s.

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
 Children were indestructible.

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,760
 And they were riding on the bicycle and there was some sort of accident, right?

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,720
 He was going too fast down this street.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,960
 And he hit the brakes or they hit a rock or whatever it was.

79
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,560
 And the younger brother flew off the handlebars and landed right on his head and died.

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,400
 Like he didn't die right there, but he had bleeding in the brain and they took him to

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 the hospital.

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 Yeah, killed him.

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
 Killed him.

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
 How is that a way to start off this one?

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,320
 Because there was one of those, like I have very, very clear memories of like bicycle safety,

86
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 right?

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,560
 It was on like a summer day.

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,560
 You know, it was just a normal day and this little kid died on the street we lived on,

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
 as my brother's best friend.

90
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,040
 So, anyways, we're going to make shows about us falling off the handlebars that always

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
 pops on my head, that poor kid.

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
 But anyways, always forgetting that depressing story or remembering it and using bicycle safety

93
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
 for yourself and your kids in the future.

94
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,480
 We're in Butler Township, Ohio.

95
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,400
 It's August 5th, 2022.

96
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
 And there's this guy.

97
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 So this is August 5th is when everything comes to a head, but Steven Marlowe, he's 39

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
 years old.

99
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,920
 He's living on Haverstraw Avenue.

100
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,720
 He's living with his parents, which isn't a bad thing, right?

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,840
 A lot of people live with their parents, but he's also insane.

102
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,680
 So that's a bad thing, right?

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,040
 If you're insane, you at least have the decency to do that by yourself.

104
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,440
 He's living with his parents.

105
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,240
 He's insane.

106
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,600
 And the reason why we know he's insane other than the story I'm about to tell you is the

107
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
 neighbors said this guy was nuts.

108
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
 The people lived near him.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 He would constantly be yelling at people for being too noisy.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,880
 But you know, maybe the neighbors were too noisy.

111
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,320
 Well, they said it was really weird.

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,160
 They go, if we came out of our house, like right after we came out of our house, maybe

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,480
 like a couple of minutes would pass, he would come out and start screaming at us.

114
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
 You're being too noisy.

115
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,960
 What are you guys doing out here?

116
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,200
 And they were like, they would get it just for walking around outside.

117
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,560
 He also though, this might put you in the insane category.

118
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,040
 He had recently gone off probation just back in February 2022 for aggravated burglary and

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,600
 aggravated medicine.

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,640
 He broke into one of his neighbor's houses and threatened them.

121
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
 Right?

122
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,080
 We have no, we don't know if it's because they were being noisy or not.

123
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,640
 But he did break into someone's house and he just got off probation for that in February.

124
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,720
 So people, they were fed up with him in this neighborhood.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 But what are you going to do?

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 Right?

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,880
 Well, the problem is, yeah, there's nothing you can do, right?

128
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 People have bad neighbors.

129
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
 What are you going to do?

130
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,000
 But then on August 5th, 2022, the real depth of this dude's insanity of Steven's madness

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,120
 became apparent when he started a murder spree.

132
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,040
 Now the problem is, is that this happens so often that a lot of these kind of just, you

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,240
 just forget about them, right?

134
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,200
 Unless they're absolutely bizarre, the casualties are just even hard to comprehend.

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,560
 As I'm recording this, they just had that mass stabbing up in Canada.

136
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,240
 Like 10 people were stabbed to death.

137
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,080
 They're still looking for one of the stabbers.

138
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,640
 They found one of them.

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,480
 There's two brothers who just went randomly door to door and started stabbing people.

140
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
 Have you guys heard of this?

141
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,680
 You're like, "No, you're super scared here in Canada now."

142
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
 You're like, "Huh?"

143
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,720
 Two brothers, I should probably just have done a second one on this, but I'm kind of

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,400
 waiting to see what happens.

145
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,680
 Two brothers in Canada begin stabbing people randomly.

146
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,520
 They said it was basically like door to door stabbings.

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,640
 And as of now, as of September 6th, they found one of the stabbers.

148
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
 He stabbed to death.

149
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,840
 They found one of the guys who was walking around stabbing people.

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,000
 They found him at some location stabbed to death.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,160
 And the police go, "They weren't self-inflicted stabs."

152
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,640
 So now they think one brother stabbed the other brother and the brother who is still

153
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,440
 alive still stabbing is out there somewhere.

154
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,960
 That's unusual, right?

155
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,920
 Mass stabbing over a large geographical area.

156
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,080
 But these family annihilations, these mass casualty events, they just kind of start to

157
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,320
 blend together, right?

158
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,120
 This one is notable for two reasons.

159
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
 One, he did go to different locations to kill some people.

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
 First off, he went and these people were lived in the area.

161
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,360
 He shot and killed Clyde and Eva Knox.

162
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
 Clyde was 87 and Eva Knox was 78.

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,560
 He shot them to death.

164
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,720
 And then nearby, it actually kind of, the articles I read made it seem like it was in

165
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 their car.

166
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,580
 But I could be wrong on that.

167
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:05,240
 He shot and killed Sarah Anderson, 41 year old woman and her 15 year old daughter, Kayla

168
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,040
 Anderson.

169
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
 And then he disappears from the scene.

170
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,880
 These murders took place near his address and then he disappeared.

171
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,320
 This is what makes, so that's unfortunate, right?

172
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,960
 We see this happen all the time.

173
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,160
 Majors, crimes in major cities.

174
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,880
 We see horrible, horrible stuff.

175
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,200
 At least I do, because I read all the true crime websites every single day.

176
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,740
 What made this one extremely notable for what we talk about here on Dead Rabbit Radio, I

177
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,460
 mean we do do true crime, but as far as the world of the conspiracy goes, as he was on

178
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,340
 the run, so this was after he had committed the shootings, but while he was on the run,

179
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,340
 he released a manifesto.

180
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,220
 An audio manifesto.

181
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:54,180
 Now I'm gonna play this for you in full, because it's creepy.

182
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,400
 This is what I've been warning about.

183
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:04,180
 This is the end boss of the gangstalking conspiracy theory.

184
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,600
 If you truly believe you are being gangstalked, if you truly believe that the government or

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,000
 aliens or some sort of shadowy organization or group of perverts are monitoring everything

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,440
 you say and committing psychological warfare against you.

187
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,140
 If you truly believe that that is happening, this is the final stage of that.

188
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,980
 And I'm gonna play this for you, and I'm gonna play this for you, and I want you to keep

189
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,020
 in mind that there are thousands of people out there who think just like him, but have

190
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,740
 not taken this step yet.

191
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,100
 Let's go ahead and listen to his manifesto.

192
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,780
 Hey guys.

193
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,740
 So mom, dad, Kevin, Carrie, Brendan.

194
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,480
 I just want you to know I love you more than you will ever know.

195
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,160
 I could not have asked for a better family.

196
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,280
 What you cannot comprehend is that we have been attacked by this weapon our entire lives,

197
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,640
 and the attack against me personally is one of the most vicious attacks a human being

198
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
 has ever faced.

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,960
 I have tolerated the most inhumane torture and hopes that the FBI and CIA would come

200
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,880
 to my defense, but they have failed to come to my aid.

201
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
 My only hope is that you come to understand what has happened here.

202
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,420
 When the world realizes what has happened, there will be justice, but I cannot sit by

203
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,300
 and be a victim any longer, and I refuse to sit by and do nothing while my nieces and nephews

204
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,580
 and the rest of my family are operated on with mind control.

205
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,420
 Our thoughts are not private.

206
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,540
 It is disgusting, and it is cruel.

207
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,900
 I will be launching the first counterattack against mind control and human history.

208
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,460
 I want to be very clear this will not be an active shooting event.

209
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,480
 I will be executing some of the people responsible for activating shooters.

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,420
 If I happen to survive, please visit me in prison if only to see the same man you have

211
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,080
 always known rather than the victim of some mental disorder that does not exist.

212
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,440
 What you may not understand is that I will gladly die to expose this, and I will gladly

213
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
 die to help one other victim discover the truth of what has happened.

214
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
 If I can help another targeted individual fight back against telepathy, then the sacrifice

215
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,560
 will be well worth it.

216
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,740
 To any TIs who read this understand that your attackers use the form of entrylliquism I

217
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,860
 describe in the paper to move your thoughts, but your thoughts can also move their mouths.

218
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,260
 To my friends in Chicago, Lexington, Dayton, and all over the world, get this email out

219
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,740
 to everyone you know.

220
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,700
 The most horrific weapon ever made is being used on human beings, and if you ever learn

221
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,940
 the truth, you will understand what I did here to protect myself and my family.

222
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,640
 Get this out to other TIs, other voice hearers, so the world has a chance to fight back.

223
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,220
 To my family, especially my nieces and nephews, I want you to understand that what I do here,

224
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,620
 I do for your future, and hope that you can live a life free of mind control.

225
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,780
 I love you guys.

226
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,280
 It's terrifying, isn't it?

227
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
 It's terrifying.

228
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,620
 He's been caught now.

229
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,540
 He was caught on August 6th in Lawrence, Kansas, which is 600 miles away from where

230
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,100
 his home was, and they don't know why he was in Kansas.

231
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
 He had no relations there.

232
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,060
 He didn't work there or anything like that.

233
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,140
 They don't know why he ended up there.

234
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,520
 But think about the two quotes I really pulled out of that was, quote, "My only hope is

235
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,080
 that you come to understand what has happened here.

236
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,000
 When the world realizes what has happened, there will be justice.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,480
 But I cannot sit by and be a victim any longer, and I refuse to sit by and do nothing, while

238
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:37,960
 my nieces and nephews and the rest of my family are operated on with mind control."

239
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,180
 We know that's not real.

240
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,020
 We know that's a delusion, because we can see these shared delusions and other gang

241
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,420
 stalkers, right?

242
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,900
 But this is righteous anger, right?

243
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
 It's not.

244
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,100
 I'm not pro him doing this.

245
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,460
 It's absolutely horrible.

246
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,980
 But he's looking at it through that prism.

247
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,620
 Like if I don't do something now, the same thing's going to happen to the people that

248
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
 I love.

249
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,820
 And really, that quote, I'll say it again, but you probably don't need me to.

250
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,400
 It was probably the most standout quote that he said too, where he goes, quote, "I will

251
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,320
 be launching the first counterattack against mind control in human history.

252
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,720
 I want to be very clear this will not be an active shooting event.

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,840
 I will be executing some of the people responsible for activating shooters."

254
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,440
 So there we have a couple of different conspiracy theories kicking in.

255
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,240
 But that first one, I will be launching the first counterattack against mind control in

256
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
 human history.

257
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,740
 This is the end game for gang stalking because they believe that this is some insidious agency

258
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,340
 that is doing this to them.

259
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,740
 And it might be the first.

260
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,060
 I think that you could probably look through other people who thought they were being gang

261
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
 stalked.

262
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,620
 We might have even covered people who thought they were being gang stalked by members of

263
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,860
 their family or something like that.

264
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,420
 And they attacked members of the family.

265
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,500
 That kind of rings a bell.

266
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,260
 But where he's just randomly shooting people, right?

267
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:11,640
 He believed that these four people, this elderly couple and this mother and this daughter, were

268
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:20,800
 not only gang stalking him, were not only inflicting mind control against him, but also possibly

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,840
 part of an organization that would attack his nieces and nephews and everyone else he

270
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
 loved.

271
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,480
 He believed that these are the people who are responsible for mass shootings.

272
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:39,740
 Because in this idea that all of these mass shootings are actually mind control victims.

273
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,660
 And I believe this is just the beginning.

274
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,540
 I'm not saying we're going to have a winter of blood.

275
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,420
 I'm not going to say that all of this stuff is going to happen instantly.

276
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,180
 But I think you are going to see over the next few years gang stalking victims, quote

277
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,820
 unquote gang stalking victims fighting back against who they think their oppressors are.

278
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,840
 And since their oppressors don't exist, it is the guy.

279
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,680
 We've covered so many gang stalking people on this podcast.

280
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
 I find it infinitely fascinating.

281
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,720
 The guy who when you're finally sit down to eat some top ramen, your neighbor turns on

282
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,080
 his lawnmower.

283
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,960
 And these people go, every time I go to eat, my neighbor's mowing his lawn.

284
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,640
 He's gang stalking me.

285
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,200
 Whenever I'm walking down the street, I see a guy wearing a white t-shirt.

286
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,160
 And every time I pass him, he kind of scratches his chest.

287
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,740
 He's signaling to me that he is a gang stalker.

288
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,220
 He's trying to drive me nuts.

289
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,820
 That's who they're going to target.

290
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,060
 The neighbor, the person driving by in the car who drives by in the same car every day,

291
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
 they don't think, oh, they're just on their way home.

292
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,820
 No, at 3pm, he always sees a black Honda drive by and that's the gang stalker showing,

293
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
 hey, look at me.

294
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,500
 I'm keeping track of you.

295
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,700
 It's the right, it's going to be insane.

296
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,060
 It's going, and it's going to be terrifying.

297
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,400
 You're not going to be able to stop it.

298
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,920
 You're not going to be able to stop it.

299
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,040
 Once these quote unquote targeted individuals, what they call themselves, begin to follow

300
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,320
 the path of Stephen, it will be bad.

301
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,640
 Because we have these mass shootings where people go into schools or they go into work

302
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,000
 or they go into churches, things like this.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,400
 These are going to be neighborhoods.

304
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,920
 These are people going to go door to door just like that.

305
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,900
 I don't, not seeing the people in Canada were gang stalking.

306
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,460
 I don't think that was the thing, but you're going to see neighborhoods get annihilated.

307
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,540
 Large casualty events.

308
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,620
 Because the thing about it, if you're going to take out a neighborhood and you live in

309
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,020
 a house and you have all the time to prepare, you, I'm not trying to give people ideas,

310
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,740
 but you could fortify your house and just pick people off.

311
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,380
 You're not going to another location to do something.

312
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,300
 It's your home turf.

313
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
 It's going to be bad.

314
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
 It's going to be bad.

315
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,960
 You're going to make things even creepier tomorrow.

316
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,000
 I know I've covered a lot of gang stalking stuff this week, but tomorrow I got one of

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,760
 the creepiest gang stalking stories that I've come across in a long time.

318
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,240
 I mean, this guy murdered people and it's creepier than that one.

319
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:16,640
 Is it possible that gang stalking is contagious?

320
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,460
 Is it possible by being near one of these targeted individuals that you could catch

321
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,300
 the madness that makes you think everyone in the world is after you?

322
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,560
 We're going to talk about that story tomorrow.

323
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,160
 Right now, Terry, let's lighten things up a bit.

324
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,460
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

325
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,240
 We're flying all the way out to India.

326
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,600
 [imitates flying]

327
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,580
 Specifically, we're headed to Uttar Pradesh.

328
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,880
 Uttar Pradesh in India.

329
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,460
 It's a state up in the northern part of India.

330
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,840
 We're going back to the year 2002.

331
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,600
 Before I continue, I want to give a shout out.

332
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,800
 I found this story on a really cool subreddit called Mechthology.

333
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 They cover a lot of really obscure stuff.

334
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,320
 We've talked about it before on this podcast.

335
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,520
 It's been a while since I covered anything from there, but Mechthology on Reddit, they

336
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
 have a whole website.

337
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
 They have an Instagram in anywhere.

338
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
 If you hate Reddit, you can follow them on Instagram as well, but they're always posting

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,680
 really cool stuff.

340
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,720
 The user who posted this was named to BellyCrow101.

341
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,900
 Thank you so much for bringing attention to this.

342
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,180
 I love a good cryptid.

343
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,180
 We've covered so many.

344
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,580
 There's not that many cool ones left or so I thought.

345
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,500
 The Munocha is this creature.

346
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,660
 Its name literally means something that scratches the face.

347
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,860
 So that should tell you where we're at right now.

348
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,700
 If you like your face a lot, this would not be a guide to run into.

349
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,060
 But our story starts in June 2002.

350
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,660
 We're in Uttar Pradesh, India.

351
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,680
 Now, at this time, there's a massive drought going on in this area.

352
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
 That's bad enough.

353
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,280
 Even water is one of those things you need for yourself, let alone your cattle and everything

354
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
 else.

355
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,440
 So they have this huge drought in this state in India.

356
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,320
 But then, just when you thought life couldn't get worse, you're sitting outside late at

357
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 night one night.

358
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
 You're sitting there smoking a little cigarette.

359
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
 Oh yeah.

360
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,560
 This is the best thing to be doing during a drought.

361
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,040
 Lighting things on fire and then flicking them off into the darkness.

362
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,620
 You're smoking a cigarette and then all of a sudden, up in the sky, you see this bright

363
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,620
 light.

364
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,060
 This bright light doesn't have a jaunty tune or anything.

365
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,340
 You just see this bright light getting closer and closer to you and you're like, "What

366
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,700
 in tarnation is that?"

367
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,180
 And then all of a sudden, "Sing!

368
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
 Ahhhh!"

369
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:45,580
 You're holding pieces of your face together with some sort of metal claw, this little

370
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,340
 creature or whatever it is.

371
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,320
 We'll get into that in a second.

372
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,480
 Slice your face open.

373
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,560
 You're like holding one cheek on and blood squirting out everywhere.

374
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
 You're like, "Ahhh!

375
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
 I ruined my cigarette too.

376
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,320
 I got blood all over my cigarette."

377
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,160
 And you run to the doctor and he's like trying to put your face together and stuff like that.

378
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,600
 And trying to save your life really.

379
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
 You have such deep lacerations.

380
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,240
 He's like, "Don't smile.

381
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,800
 If you smile, your face is going to explode.

382
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,760
 Everything's all cut up."

383
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,060
 And these attacks begin to happen all over the state.

384
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,460
 Throughout this region that is being devastated by drought, people begin to report attacks

385
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,020
 from this creature that they name the "Muno Chawa."

386
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,780
 The "Muno Chawa," which I now have pronounced differently six or seven different times.

387
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,420
 I apologize to you, Cryptid Man.

388
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,620
 "Muno Chawa" literally means something that scratches the face.

389
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:52,400
 And people keep seeing this thing, but what's so weird about this Cryptid is no one could

390
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,520
 really agree on what it looked like.

391
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,120
 Some people said it was just a bright light that would come out of the sky and slice your

392
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,020
 face open.

393
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,220
 Other people said, "No, no, it was actually a fuzzy creature.

394
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,820
 You could actually see some sort of outline to it, but it's all fuzzy, but it's eyes."

395
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,860
 As it got close enough to you, you could look into its soulless eyes.

396
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,780
 Slice your face up.

397
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:28,380
 Some people thought it was a ghost, a vengeful spirit that was wrecking havoc on the population.

398
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,180
 Some people said it looked like a giant insect.

399
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,500
 Some people said it looked like a tiny insect.

400
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,580
 Some people said it looked like a three inch insect that would just come buzzing around

401
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,180
 at night, all the attacks are at night.

402
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,060
 And when it got close enough to you, slice your face up.

403
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,180
 What's interesting is you never really got a cohesive description of this, which would

404
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,580
 make you think they're making it up.

405
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,380
 They're just making this stuff up.

406
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,060
 But in the world of this phenomenon, it could be in the eye of the beholder.

407
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,620
 Because what happens is you start to get all these different descriptions going from a

408
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,340
 flying turtle to a ghost to a light that only flew sideways.

409
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,100
 You started getting all these weird things.

410
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,420
 And then you started getting people saying, "I saw it up close and it didn't have soulless

411
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
 eyes.

412
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,220
 It didn't have this fuzziness to it.

413
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,220
 It actually looked like a robot.

414
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,460
 It actually looked like something that maybe one of our enemies built.

415
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:37,460
 Like a little Pakistani robot was flying around and slicing her face up.

416
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,820
 What's really interesting about that definition, because they said it had red and blue lights

417
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
 on it.

418
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,580
 See, it wasn't like this glowing ball.

419
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,780
 They said it had red and blue lights on it and it looked like a robot.

420
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,020
 This story takes place in 2002.

421
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,460
 If this story took place in 2022, we would all just say drone.

422
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
 Right?

423
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,700
 We would immediately go.

424
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,940
 It's a drone, right?

425
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,060
 Maybe it's cutting them up with the propellers.

426
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,940
 Maybe it does have some sort of appendage on it that's being controlled, like a little

427
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,820
 razor sharp hand.

428
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,500
 But in 2002, that type of technology, I mean, I'm sure they were working on it.

429
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,260
 And obviously we had remote control cars and things like that.

430
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,580
 But to think of a drone, right?

431
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,940
 A drone at least being operated in public like that in civilian areas.

432
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
 You know.

433
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
 It was small enough too.

434
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,940
 That's what I'm saying.

435
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,780
 Like, yeah, I'm pretty sure we had those big giant predator drones during the Iraqi war,

436
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,780
 the second Iraqi war.

437
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,660
 But like a little guy floating around a neighborhood of those commercial drones.

438
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,260
 I don't think they were that small back then.

439
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,300
 But that was a theory, right?

440
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,460
 This was a Pakistani robot that was being controlled.

441
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,420
 It's definitely a valid one.

442
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,260
 Pakistan and India hate each other.

443
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,860
 Maybe Pakistan hates India enough that they would send a robot after them.

444
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,500
 Now some of these scratches, because people weren't going to the doctors for these, some

445
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,460
 of these scratches were superficial, right?

446
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,900
 It just looked like someone maybe took their fingernails and drove them across somebody's

447
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
 faces.

448
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,300
 But that didn't stop the stories from spreading that this thing could actually rip your face

449
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
 off.

450
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,340
 It could take off your entire face and you would go into shock and die.

451
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,500
 This thing was actually killing people.

452
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 This creature was so...

453
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,860
 So when they're not scratching you, when there's just a superficial scratch or you died, people

454
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:31,700
 didn't want it to happen and people started to become paranoid of running into the Moonshawah.

455
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,220
 So people were refusing to go to sleep.

456
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,500
 They figured I'm safe if I stay up.

457
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,860
 Now the first guy wasn't going to the cigarette, he was awake, but maybe if I stay up it won't

458
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,460
 attack me.

459
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,940
 And you had towns organize nightly patrols.

460
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,820
 They would walk through the streets banging on drums chanting "Everyone alert.

461
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,620
 Attackers be aware.

462
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
 Everyone alert.

463
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,860
 Attackers be aware" which that probably explains why no one was sleeping, right?

464
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,300
 It wasn't because they were afraid of this thing, they were like "Oh I can't sleep, that

465
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,500
 song stuck in my head."

466
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,660
 But even with these neighborhood watch groups and their snazzy new single coming out, "Everyone

467
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
 alert."

468
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,700
 The attacks continued.

469
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:20,740
 Now Uttar Prash is a giant state, there's a ton of cities here and it was region wide.

470
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,140
 And it actually seemed to be happening in multiple cities at the same time.

471
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,140
 So when we look at the idea of a cryptid, it's incredibly mobile.

472
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,220
 It's able to traverse this entire area, multiple times, like it can attack multiple people

473
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,980
 in multiple different villages a night.

474
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:46,700
 This story became such a big issue in India.

475
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:55,660
 In the town of Situpur, 10,000 people showed up demanding the government stop this cryptid

476
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,980
 from scratching their faces.

477
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,660
 They jam-packed the city and they were telling the police and telling the local government

478
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,340
 you have to stop this thing because all the drums aren't stopping it, our songs aren't

479
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,260
 stopping it, we can't sleep, our faces are getting scratched up, you have to stop this.

480
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,060
 Now the police go, "This is just a bunch of bumpkins, this isn't real, this isn't a real

481
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
 thing."

482
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:24,580
 But it's a real thing when 10,000 people show up and they're chanting "Fight the monster,

483
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,380
 fight the monster."

484
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,460
 Well anyways, 10,000 people of anything eventually becomes a riot and the police begin to fire

485
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,500
 rounds, fire live rounds to disperse the crowd and someone got killed.

486
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,300
 Someone got killed, not by a cryptid but by a police officer because of these Muno Chawal

487
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,140
 riots.

488
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,460
 You days later in the town of Barabanki happened again.

489
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,180
 Massive again, apparently they figured out, you know, Situpur they didn't bring enough

490
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
 people to riot.

491
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:04,060
 In the town of Barabanki another riot broke out, "Fight the monster, fight the monster."

492
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,020
 The police again opened fire, they didn't learn the lesson from the previous day either,

493
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,980
 someone else died in that one.

494
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,180
 And what we started to see was these police officers who were being tasked with hunting

495
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,860
 this thing and they got sergeants like, "Listen we know this thing doesn't exist but just

496
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,140
 walk around the town in your uniform late at night, people will feel safer, maybe they

497
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,580
 can get some sleep, maybe they'll stop being so cranky about getting their faces scratched."

498
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,780
 But it's not really happening, so just go out there and take care of it.

499
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,820
 What happened was you started having police officers get attacked by this thing.

500
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,540
 So police officers who were formally skeptical, they were either attacked or knew someone

501
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,460
 who was attacked.

502
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,820
 Because this just kept going on for months and months and months.

503
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,340
 This started in June, now we're in the month of August and you actually see mainstream

504
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,260
 newspapers cover this, the Sydney Morning Herald ran an article written by the Associated

505
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:05,460
 Foreign Press on August 21st, 2002 and it was called, "Scientists Explain Indian Monster."

506
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,860
 Monsters and quotes there.

507
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,980
 Interesting article, kind of just doing a summary of the events that we just did and

508
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,420
 then it has an answer by the Indian Institute of Technology.

509
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,180
 They were actually tasked, the Indian Institute of Technology was like, "Okay we're gonna

510
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,260
 get to the bottom of this whole monster thing, monsters don't exist, we'll figure out what

511
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,900
 this is."

512
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,740
 And they came up with a really interesting answer.

513
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,020
 They said, "Listen, there's a huge drought striking this entire area."

514
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,980
 And we're not seeing this Muno Chawa, or whoever you want to pronounce it, anywhere else.

515
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:45,620
 So only in this area where this massive drought is AND very, very dry conditions causes a

516
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,220
 phenomenon known as, "Ball Lightning."

517
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,740
 Now "Ball Lightning" was something that scientists thought was a myth.

518
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,180
 It was something that you would hear people in the rural areas, country bumpkins talk

519
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
 about, "What?

520
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,740
 I saw a ball of light floating down the river one day and then it came into my house."

521
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,340
 It happens in dry areas and Uttar Puresh has been dry for a while now, we've had this

522
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,460
 prolonged drought.

523
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,820
 They said it matches what they're talking about, it's a glowing form, it's illuminated,

524
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,820
 and if it hits you, it may not kill you, it could, it very well could, but if it hits

525
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:26,260
 you it could easily cause abrasions on your face.

526
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,780
 Really, it would probably look like you got cut and it would be extremely painful.

527
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,820
 So the Indian Institute of Technology said they're just having a lot of ball lightning

528
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,620
 in the area and it's possible so at this point there's been over 70 reported attacks

529
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,900
 of this Muno Chawa.

530
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,180
 But the question is, 70 people getting attacked isn't going to get 10,000 people in the street

531
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,340
 protesting, those are the recognized reports.

532
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,140
 There may have been a ton of reports that were in farther off townships and then there

533
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:01,700
 also probably was a lot of reports that was just mass hysteria, right?

534
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,700
 You wake up with a scratch interface, you're like, "No, I got attacked by the cryptid."

535
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:12,780
 I guess it would be weird if you woke up with a large gas on your face, like "Ah, sleep

536
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
 it off."

537
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
 You're like, "What, I got this while I was sleeping?

538
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,380
 What are you talking about?"

539
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,540
 There's probably more a lot of people exaggerating this and what's interesting is that we have

540
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:28,980
 the ball lightning theory, but then there's an even creepier theory is that when, so this

541
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,980
 had gone on for a couple months, like it started in June, we're in August now, you started having

542
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,340
 like scientists want to check this out and doctors are going out to these regions because

543
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,820
 they're like, "We kind of want to see what's going on."

544
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,020
 Like these people are talking about getting scratched.

545
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,500
 They go out there and the doctors are a little disappointed.

546
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,980
 They're a little disappointed.

547
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,060
 They thought it was going to be gorier.

548
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,700
 Some of these wounds during this investigation, some of these wounds, and this to me is creepier,

549
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
 honestly.

550
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,420
 If I had a choice between something flying through my house and scratching my face, I

551
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,780
 don't want either one, but something flying through my house and scratching my face, that

552
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,540
 would suck, but this other one was that these people were, they were so terrified that this

553
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,500
 creature was going to get them, it actually drove them mad.

554
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,900
 And as the doctors were examining these wounds, they go, "Oh, a monster didn't do this.

555
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
 You did this."

556
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
 And they're like, "What?"

557
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,820
 They're like, "Yeah, this is actually, you're so scared that the monster is going to get

558
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,420
 you, you sliced your own face open."

559
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
 That's worse.

560
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
 That's way worse.

561
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,500
 Apparently, like, you can get whipped up in such a frenzy that people were scratching

562
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,340
 their own faces and it says sometimes they used their fingernails, that'd be bad, but

563
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:48,180
 it says sometimes they used forks or, quote, "other instruments."

564
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,020
 I don't think they were talking about melon ballers.

565
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,140
 I think someone's picking up a knife and cutting their face.

566
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,860
 And it's not because they wanted to be in on the hip-neutron of getting attacked by

567
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,580
 a cryptid, it's that they were so paranoid and so distraught and just they had lost their

568
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,020
 mind they were cutting open their own faces.

569
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,620
 That's worse.

570
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,380
 That's way worse than getting attacked by a cryptid.

571
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,780
 But what's so interesting about this is this is one of those rare cryptids that has an

572
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,300
 end-by date.

573
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,260
 Bigfoot's been around for hundreds, some say thousands of years.

574
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:32,220
 This one started in June 2002 and it was over by October 2002.

575
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,540
 Somewhere between September and October.

576
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,820
 The last article that you can really read written about this, that's, you know, of the

577
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:44,940
 time, was in a website called Skeptica by Sennahl Edamarku.

578
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,300
 He wrote an article on October 1, 2002 called "The Truth About the Face Scratcher."

579
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,660
 And that's really where they really start to hammer in the ball lightning theory because

580
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,500
 what happened was, the drought ended.

581
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:07,780
 All sightings of this creature stopped once monsoon season began.

582
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:14,580
 So once the rain fell, the Muno Chawa left.

583
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,780
 Which really makes you think it might have been the ball lightning theory, right?

584
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,380
 Because the conditions changed.

585
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,020
 The environment that would cause all of this ball lightning to appear is gone.

586
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,740
 But see, ball lightning in and of itself is still pretty rare.

587
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,220
 But it makes sense.

588
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,740
 And what's interesting about this is let's say that this wasn't a cryptid.

589
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,900
 Let's say that this was a natural phenomenon.

590
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:45,220
 That a couple of people, this ball of light flew by them and electrocuted them basically.

591
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,780
 Maybe killed a couple, burned their faces.

592
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,260
 It looks like scratches on their faces, right?

593
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,060
 Let's say that's a handful of them.

594
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,100
 Out of the 70 reports, let's say that's maybe 10.

595
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,580
 Because ball lightning is very rare.

596
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,700
 Other people were cutting their own faces open and they were so terrified of this creature

597
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,580
 coming they would, because it says they go, "This is a possible psychiatric illness where

598
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,180
 you don't remember doing it.

599
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,220
 You injure yourself and you don't remember doing the injury.

600
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,720
 You're hysterical."

601
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,900
 You have people who are actually being attacked by ball lightning.

602
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,940
 Not attacked by ball lightning, this is floating down the street, right?

603
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,420
 You have people being hit by ball lightning.

604
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,900
 It's total natural phenomenon.

605
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,100
 It's painful, but it's natural.

606
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,180
 And then in response to that, you have people mangling their own faces, cutting their own

607
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:39,660
 faces up in this delusion, in this blank mind state.

608
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,780
 They're the cryptid.

609
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,100
 They're the ones doing the injury.

610
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,660
 And so you have that.

611
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,700
 And then you have people being killed by the police over this.

612
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
 That was another thing.

613
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,060
 That was another thing I skipped over.

614
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,580
 Other people were getting killed.

615
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,520
 People were thinking that they're... that's funny.

616
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
 I totally forgot about that.

617
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,580
 It was in my notes, but just like the gangsta thing, people began to become very paranoid.

618
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,840
 They thought one of their neighbors might be the Munochwa.

619
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,680
 Or remember their family might be.

620
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,940
 People were getting beat up because they were being accused of being this cryptid in human

621
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
 form.

622
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,720
 Even though that's not in the lore.

623
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,000
 Really, there is no lore.

624
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,120
 It just started in June.

625
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,880
 This isn't something ancient.

626
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,460
 This is incredibly recent cryptid that only lasted for a couple months.

627
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,220
 But you had people getting beaten up.

628
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
 You had people getting killed.

629
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,980
 You had people mangling their own faces.

630
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,940
 If you accept the hypothesis that this was a natural event, this was all... all this chaos

631
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
 was happening.

632
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,700
 10,000 people took to the streets because of ball lightning.

633
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
 It's insane.

634
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,500
 The story's nuts if you look at it just from that angle, but then you look at it.

635
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,900
 It could have been alien.

636
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
 Right?

637
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,500
 Put on our conspiracy caps.

638
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,120
 They don't stay in one area for too long.

639
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
 A rolling spaceship.

640
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,000
 Gather's no space moss.

641
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,120
 Could have been a spaceship doing some experiments.

642
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,720
 It could have been a rival government.

643
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,880
 It could have been the United States.

644
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,320
 We love doing stuff to other countries.

645
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,240
 I mean, they drew...

646
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,840
 They just... for whatever reason.

647
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,480
 United States is like, "Hey, we invented this new thing.

648
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,040
 Let's go mess up another country."

649
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,680
 That's the big theory about Project Plate.

650
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,020
 The flying saucer thing in Brazil that we covered a long time ago.

651
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:22,140
 I don't remember exactly what it was, Project Plate, but Project Plato.

652
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,180
 But the idea was that America was testing out some high-tech vehicles and we were attacking

653
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,180
 Brazilian villagers.

654
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,700
 I'll put that up in the show notes.

655
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,180
 That's like episode 80 or something like that.

656
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,740
 That was a long time ago.

657
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,100
 But yeah, it could have been American.

658
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
 It could have been Pakistani.

659
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,220
 It could have been really any government.

660
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,100
 It could have been India's own government, right, testing out this new technology.

661
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,840
 Because although back then it would have seemed novel, it would have seemed alien.

662
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,560
 Nowadays you could buy a Munichawa drone right off the shelf.

663
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,920
 You could fashion it with a bunch of forks stuck to its side and then fly it around.

664
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,960
 Was it a cryptid?

665
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,880
 Was it a lonely spirit that was finally banished by the rain?

666
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,640
 Was it some sort of... being some sort of devil that could only come out in these conditions?

667
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
 Who know?

668
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
 I mean, it could be anything.

669
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,860
 Like most likely it was ball lightning.

670
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,260
 But even if we go with the ball lightning scenario, it was this natural phenomenon that

671
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:23,540
 drove people insane to the point that they were slicing their own faces up because they

672
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,220
 feared the cryptid so much.

673
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:36,420
 A terrifying tale that lets us know that even in our modern scientific rational world, there

674
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,360
 is still a lot of superstition.

675
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
 There wasn't.

676
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
 I wouldn't have a podcast.

677
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,480
 I wouldn't have anything to talk about.

678
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,880
 But even when you can explain something, can you really explain something?

679
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,560
 Even 20 years later we still look at these events, we still look at all of these things

680
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,080
 and go, "Was it ball lightning?"

681
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,200
 Or was there something even darker going on there?

682
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:12,780
 The truth is we'll never know unless the Munochwa decides to visit India once again.

683
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
 Slice!

684
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,180
 Ahhhhh my face!

685
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,860
