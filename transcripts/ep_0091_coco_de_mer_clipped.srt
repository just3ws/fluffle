1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A controversial therapy resulted in a 10 year old girl getting squished to death.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,400
 It's horrible.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,560
 And then we look at a magical coconut that many people believe cures all poisons and

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,200
 comes from the bottom of the ocean.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:29,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,080
 I'm having a better day.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 I'm feeling a lot better.

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,400
 The antibiotics are kicking in.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,160
 And speaking of feeling better, this episode, the first story is a little rough.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,200
 I have a couple rough stories this week.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,880
 And when I say rough, I mean slightly depressing.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,800
 I know we talk about some disturbing stuff from time to time, but this one's actually

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,400
 a little depressing because of what happened.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,720
 Spoiler alert, a 10 year old girl gets squished to death.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,320
 And part of being a paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast, part of doing that is

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,760
 you do have to focus on crimes.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,840
 I try to cover crimes if you haven't noticed.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,400
 I don't cover a lot of true crime.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,600
 I try to cover stuff that's borders on paranormal or conspiracy.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,400
 That's one thing I look at.

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,720
 The other thing is if it's funny, like John Eric Armstrong is the biggest loser, the serial

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,200
 killer who's just a total dork.

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,360
 I love that guy.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,800
 No, I love that episode.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,400
 That guy's dick.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,920
 And then the weird unsolved ones like Jonathan Luna, like we did yesterday.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,880
 Candice Newmaker, the reason why I'm covering this story is one, it was a request from the

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,200
 Bilal Bilal on Gmail.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
 So thank you for the request.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,120
 Secondly, because this practice, people still use this practice.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,080
 It is still, some people consider it a legitimate form of therapy.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,200
 It's been altered a bit in the preceding or I know what it would be, post-seeding.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,560
 After this event, it's been modified a bit, but people still use a variation of this.

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,720
 And I want to focus more on the actual procedure rather than this girl's death, but I do have

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,160
 to go into it a bit because it's basically a cult.

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,280
 You have a group of therapists who are basically a cult.

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,000
 But anyway, so back in 2000, there was a young girl named Candice Newmaker.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,160
 She was adopted at the age of seven.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,360
 By the time she was 10, her adopted mother was like, "I can't, I'm having a really hard

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,680
 time with my new daughter."

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
 What is it called when you adopt somebody?

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
 Is it your daughter?

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,800
 It's not like a stepdaughter.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
 That's when you marry somebody, right?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
 I guess that's just...

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 So anyways, her daughter.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
 We'll just say it's her daughter.

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
 I'm sure that's what it is.

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,600
 Because you don't go, "This is my adopted daughter."

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,280
 Like you just say, "This is my daughter."

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,560
 I don't know, I've never adopted anyone or been adopted.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,480
 But so Candice Newmaker, they take her to this therapist out in Colorado and they have this

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,200
 thing where it's basically like building the bond between the new mom and the adopted

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 kid.

59
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,760
 And for the first week, everything went relatively well.

60
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,800
 Like they were bonding, she seemed to be behaving better.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,280
 And then they got to this part of this therapy they call re-birthing.

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,200
 Now what it is is the child has to basically be reborn into the world.

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,240
 And the new mom is there and the child is like, "Mama!"

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,760
 And the woman's like, "Oh, my daughter."

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,080
 And so you go through the traumatic experience of being born and then you come out a new

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,280
 person in front of your mom.

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,720
 Now they wrapped her up in a blanket and put some pillows on her so she could like squiggle

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 out.

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,880
 Now that would be fine in and of itself, but that wasn't the only part of it.

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 Candice was 70 pounds.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,400
 Four adults got on top of her.

72
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,280
 It was a combined total weight of over 400 pounds.

73
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,780
 No, sorry.

74
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,160
 It was a combined weight of over 600 pounds out of these four people.

75
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,320
 I guess if it was four people and it was only 400 pounds, it would be very, very skinny

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
 people.

77
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,480
 But so anyways, Candice had to try to force your way out of this canal.

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,040
 They're constantly pushing pressure on you, putting pressure on you to make you fight

79
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,600
 harder.

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,760
 This went on for about an hour and Candice Newmaker died.

81
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,080
 She basically suffocated.

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,640
 She became brain dead.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
 She passed away.

84
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,960
 The people in charge of it who were in charge of that session went to jail and the mother

85
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,160
 got probation and there were some other people there who got probation or time served or

86
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,860
 something like that as well.

87
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,040
 So that is the story of Candice Newmaker.

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
 If you want more of the gory details, that's fine.

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,200
 I don't mind giving gory details like ghost stories and conspiracy theories and stuff

90
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 like that.

91
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,320
 This one, I was just like, that's pretty much it.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,600
 It's not like her gut shot out of her body or anything like that.

93
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,800
 It's just, if you want to read last words and stuff like that, I'm not that kind of,

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,560
 I'm not going to do that with this particular story because that's not the point of the

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 story.

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,960
 So that's basically the story of Candice Newmaker.

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,240
 Ten years old, killed during this stupid therapy session.

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,280
 Now you would think that one, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,880
 To think that if their theory is true, every time I crawled out of a tent, the first person

100
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,400
 I'd see, I'd be like, mom.

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 Now you should say, no, no, what if people are pushing on the tent still?

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
 Every time I crawled out of a sleeping bag that someone was, if someone jumped on a sleeping

103
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,720
 bag and I slid out, I'm like, mom, and it's like Teddy Repskin.

104
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
 It doesn't work.

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
 The logic behind it doesn't work.

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,960
 And the people, this is generally a practice that is only really, really recognized in

107
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,400
 a small community in Colorado.

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,520
 And it's only been around since the 70s.

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,240
 Now when I read about this, I was like, that poor little girl, that's so horrible.

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,920
 And I could just imagine those therapists, they were probably half like, when they were

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,920
 doing it, they're probably thinking, man, we're geniuses and this works.

112
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,720
 And honestly, and I'll say this, they were probably a little like turned on by it.

113
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,480
 You know what's so funny is when I first read the story, I imagined it like in a clinical

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 laboratory.

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,560
 I remember when I was reading the article, I imagined it in like a laboratory.

116
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
 And I was thinking like, you know, it's like linoleum floors and metal walls and like metal

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,200
 cabinets for whatever reason, because I imagined it being fairly scientific.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,760
 But the more I looked into what I thought, this was probably in someone's basement.

119
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,960
 This was probably in like a strip mall.

120
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,280
 They rented out a room in a strip mall and these people were acting like they were these

121
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
 behavioral psychologists or whatever.

122
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
 And they were just throwing kids and sleeping bags and sitting on them and charging a lot

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,920
 of money.

124
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,920
 This practice, even though it has led to Candace Newmaker's death, it's actually one of the

125
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,360
 tamer practices of this community who talk about basically this whole set of therapists

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,600
 in Colorado.

127
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,440
 They focus on building up the bond between a foster and adopted child and the new parents.

128
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,080
 That's what this whole therapy is created for.

129
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
 This is what they do.

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 This is nuts.

131
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,160
 It's a common form of attachment therapy is the holding therapy where you restrain them

132
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
 in some way.

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,440
 It says, and I'm quoting here, "In theory, when the child's resistance is overcome and

134
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,240
 the rage is released, so basically they're, 'Ugh, I'm so mad, get off my sleeping bag!'

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,920
 Once they are like, 'I give up.

136
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,240
 I absolutely give up,' they return to an infantile state in which he or she can be

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,000
 reparented by methods such as cradling, rocking, bottle feeding, and enforced eye contact."

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
 Remember Candace was 10 years old.

139
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
 These aren't actual babies.

140
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,880
 What they're doing is they're breaking these young...

141
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,480
 They still do this, by the way.

142
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,840
 There are still places out there, especially in Colorado in this community that do this.

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,360
 They take a kid, they break him down or her down mentally to that of a child, and then

144
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,640
 the adopted parent will cradle you and feed you with a bottle.

145
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,400
 That's some cult stuff right there.

146
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,240
 They're actually breaking the child's brain, and so it is regressing to an infantile state

147
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,000
 and then re-experiencing childhood with the new parent.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,560
 So you're breaking these kids down completely.

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,400
 They, the critics of these groups have said they are using the same techniques that are

150
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,160
 found in concentration camps and cults.

151
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,040
 The breaking down and building back up of a new personality.

152
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,440
 Candace Newmaker wasn't the only child who died either.

153
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,520
 Six children have died over the years.

154
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,920
 Not technically in the same re-birthing session, but they were either involved in this type

155
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,520
 of therapy or shortly afterwards died of this.

156
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,640
 I will tell you this a little behind the scenes thing.

157
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,880
 The story you're going to hear of Candace Newmaker should be about 9 to 10 minutes long.

158
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,040
 The recording right now, I've just passed 28 minutes and 35 seconds.

159
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,560
 I've been going back and forth and back and forth having an internal debate over whether

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,440
 or not these people should still be able to practice for basically 20 minutes.

161
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,000
 I'm going to throw the question out to you guys.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,760
 Should pseudoscientific beliefs be allowed to be practiced alongs as normal therapy?

163
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,040
 Should they be labeled as this therapy has not been proven by science?

164
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,960
 Or should they be banned outright?

165
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,840
 That's basically what I've been debating with myself for the past 20 minutes.

166
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,000
 I'm not going to put it online or anything like that because it just goes all over the

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,240
 place.

168
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,800
 But I'm going to throw that out to you because I have a lot of different opinions about it

169
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,680
 and really not enough time to talk about it in this podcast.

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 Maybe we'll talk about it in the comments, but at this point I'm just going to throw

171
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,120
 it out to you.

172
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,600
 So 20 minutes later of talking to myself into a microphone about a girl getting squished

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,760
 and the sociopolitical ramifications of this.

174
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
 Oh you know what I'm going to do now?

175
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,160
 I am actually going to say damn the time limit of the episode because I don't know how long

176
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
 it's going to be now because I've talked so long about that.

177
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,600
 And I am going to do because I want to and I've wanted to for a while.

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,520
 I'm going to do another Dead Rabbit Recommends.

179
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,360
 Now this Dead Rabbit Recommends is one of my favorite.

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:14,080
 I would go so far as to say it is probably in my top 50 films of all time and that may

181
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,760
 not sound high, but it is and it's easily the best conspiracy film.

182
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,880
 I can't think of a movie that is better than that about conspiracies and it is called The

183
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,400
 Conspiracy.

184
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,560
 Now the conspiracy, that's the name of the movie, but the title of the movie is actually

185
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,400
 partially blurred out.

186
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,480
 So when you look at generally posters of the movie it will be the blank, it will be all

187
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,600
 blurry conspiracy and you find out in the movie what the title of the movie actually

188
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
 is.

189
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,560
 It's amazing.

190
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
 This movie caught me off guard.

191
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,120
 I saw an ad for it in The 40 in Times which was a magazine that pretty much dealt with

192
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,600
 everything the podcast talks about.

193
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,520
 It is the story of two independent filmmakers who find this crazy guy on the streets of New

194
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,400
 York who is always ranting about the Bilderberg group and 9/11 was an inside job and the Rockefellers

195
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,960
 and all that stuff and they say, "Want it to be awesome to see what this guy is like

196
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,880
 when he is not out on the street?"

197
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 Yelling.

198
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,400
 So these two young men begin filming him and they start to see the pattern.

199
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,040
 So one of them starts to believe in the conspiracy and the other one has a wife and kid at home

200
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,160
 and he kind of starts to believe in it but he is just kind of like, "Oh, it's all nuts."

201
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,400
 And then the guy, the conspiracy theorist, goes missing and his house, his apartment

202
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,960
 is trashed.

203
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,440
 And so the two young filmmakers have to make a decision.

204
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
 Do they continue to shoot their documentary with the information that they have or do

205
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,200
 they just go, "Let's file a missing persons report and end it."

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,760
 Now of course they continue to shoot their documentary with pretty awesome results.

207
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,680
 It is a really, really good film.

208
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,480
 It has easily one of the best first act to second act changes I've ever seen.

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,640
 You're watching the movie and there's this scene and you feel the whole movie shift.

210
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,800
 You know right then the second act has started, the movie is going to go in a completely different

211
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,160
 direction from where you've been.

212
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,520
 And I remember watching it and I kind of like, just as a writer and a fan of film, I remember

213
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,360
 thinking what that, it was amazing.

214
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
 Like you're like, "Now the movie is headed in a completely different direction.

215
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
 It's constantly zigging and zagging.

216
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,480
 I recommend that it is the conspiracy.

217
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,960
 I believe it's on Netflix.

218
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,040
 You can definitely rent it on YouTube.

219
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,920
 It's not as obscure as like the evil within that I recommended.

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
 But the conspiracy, you'll enjoy it.

221
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,040
 Trust me, you'll enjoy it.

222
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,560
 Okay, so we're going to talk about one more story here.

223
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,000
 I'm dreading having to edit the Candace Newmaker stuff, but let's go ahead and get started

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,480
 with this one because I do want to talk about it.

225
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
 I want to end on a fun note.

226
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,160
 This is the story of the Coco de Mer.

227
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
 Coco de Mer.

228
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,360
 So the Coco de Mer, this was really fascinating to me.

229
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,920
 And I think it's just one of those stories that's fascinating to me because it kind of

230
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,440
 relates to how humans observe things and the stories we create from just observation.

231
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,760
 So the Coco de Mer is a coconut.

232
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,320
 It's about 40 kilograms.

233
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,160
 So what is that in like normal pounds?

234
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,720
 That's like 35 pounds, something like that.

235
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,360
 I think a kilogram weighs a little bit more.

236
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,680
 But anyway, so I'll just say 40 kilograms because I know that it's this 40 kilogram coconut.

237
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
 So it's bigger than a regular coconut.

238
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,320
 It's actually the biggest seed on the planet.

239
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,680
 It's the world's largest seed.

240
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,640
 And what happens is just like the coconut, they fall off the trees and they'll generally

241
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,400
 they're just landed the dirt and then a new Coco de Mer tree will grow.

242
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,760
 These are in the, well, how do you pronounce it?

243
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,960
 Say cellies, side cellies.

244
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,840
 It's some island stuff.

245
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,920
 It's an archipelago in the Indian Ocean.

246
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,520
 Anyways, so anyways, these Coco de Mer's will fall and grow a new tree.

247
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,520
 Now you're going, but wait a second, Coco de Mer, like is that like a mermaid?

248
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,040
 And I'm like, yes, clever man.

249
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,140
 You guessed it.

250
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,840
 What happens is these things will also fall and roll off the little island that they're

251
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 on.

252
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,920
 I imagine it's like a desert island just like with one tree.

253
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,880
 They'll fall onto the water, but they're so heavy.

254
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 They're not like a coconut.

255
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,720
 So a coconut will float across the ocean and wash up on the sea of another beach and then

256
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,680
 a coconut tree will grow there.

257
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,660
 So that's how the coconut tree spread.

258
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,720
 That's why whenever you see a single desert island in a far side comic strip, there is

259
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,400
 a coconut tree there, just a single one, because a seed floated from somewhere else.

260
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
 It's very weird.

261
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,600
 It's kind of like how like an amoeba would kind of like break off and spread.

262
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,920
 I don't know how amoebas work.

263
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
 Anyways, so the coconut will do that.

264
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,640
 A Coco de Mer is so heavy, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean and then the furry part

265
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,280
 will slough off and then it will be light enough that it will then float to the top

266
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,960
 of the ocean and then float to an island.

267
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,200
 But because the furry part is gone, it's no longer a fertile seed.

268
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,160
 So it would just float along and then it would wash up on the sea.

269
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,520
 Now what happened was they refined these, there's two unique things about these things

270
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,720
 other than they're the world's largest seed.

271
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,720
 You would find these things on the beach and one side looks like a shapely woman's hips

272
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 and thighs and then you flip it over and it looks like a woman's buttocks or maybe a

273
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 man's buttocks.

274
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,040
 I don't know if he had like that nice shape, but generally they would find these giant

275
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,920
 seeds on the beach or floating in the water and one side looked like a hot chick and the

276
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
 other side looked like another her butt.

277
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,240
 The front thought chick and the back thought chick, it's the same hot chick, it's like

278
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,840
 a Kim Kardashian shaped coconut.

279
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,680
 And they would find these and they were fairly rare.

280
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,320
 One of them was bought for 4,000 florins and I'm assuming that's the 4,000 gold florins

281
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,000
 as opposed to the silver florins.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,520
 I'm sure that's a lot of money just because they're gold, but anyway so you would find

283
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,680
 these things and they looked super sexy and so people wanted them and they're like, "Oh

284
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,000
 dude, they didn't have pornography back then."

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,240
 And when I say back then we're talking like way back in time.

286
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,840
 Like so far back in time it is before the 1700s and the reason why I know that is because

287
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,920
 I have 1700s written on my notes here.

288
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,560
 These are really good notes for this part of the story.

289
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,960
 So before the 1700s these big seeds were floating around.

290
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,920
 People would find them as a shapely woman.

291
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,480
 People believed if you drank the juice out of them it would cure all poisons.

292
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,760
 It was an antidote for all poisons.

293
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,720
 And it was also just like this really sexy thing to look at because what else are you

294
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 going to do?

295
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
 You're going to have like papyrus porn?

296
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
 You're going to have like sexy hieroglyphics?

297
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,360
 No, you have this cocoa de mer.

298
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,280
 What's interesting about this, so again when I was talking about the way humans observe

299
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,520
 things is that so they would fall off the tree from one island, sink to the bottom of

300
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,400
 the ocean, slough off and then float to the top.

301
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,480
 Seeds would be sailing and they'd see these seeds every so often pop to the top of the

302
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,960
 water and they'd fish it out and be like, "Oh, this is sexy.

303
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,320
 I'm going to take this to my room."

304
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 The captain's like, "Where are you going?"

305
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,040
 He's like, "Oh, I'll be back in like five minutes."

306
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
 They knew they were seeds.

307
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,120
 They were like, "Hey, this is kind of like a coconut without the furry part and it's

308
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,680
 way more sexy."

309
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,400
 So if you saw seeds floating up out of the ocean and nobody knew where these plants were,

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,280
 nobody knew these were actual trees on an island in the sagellies or whatever you pronounce

311
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
 that.

312
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,640
 If you saw every so often a seed pop out of the ocean, you would think there must be

313
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,880
 trees at the bottom of the ocean and the seeds are falling up.

314
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
 So that's what they actually thought that there was a forest at the bottom of the ocean

315
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:00,280
 because just observational, just based on observation, if a seed falls off a tree, you

316
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,960
 go there, there's a tree in front of me.

317
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,640
 So if seeds are coming out of the ocean, therefore there are trees at the bottom of

318
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,760
 the ocean.

319
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,000
 This then grew to the legend that sometimes these trees would get so high, that's what

320
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,320
 would create choppy waters.

321
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,680
 And then as time went on, they said, "Well, if there's trees down there, there must be

322
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,800
 birds down there."

323
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,480
 So they created the story of this giant underwater bird and they tied it into local mythology

324
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:30,240
 and it would eat ships, ships that went missing, basically got trapped in these waves created

325
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,600
 by these trees and the bird would come and eat them and stuff like that.

326
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,840
 Just based on observation, this whole story built up over the centuries.

327
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,040
 Seeds come out of the water, therefore there's trees under the waters, birds live in trees,

328
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,920
 therefore there's probably a bird down there and sometimes ships disappear, it's probably

329
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,560
 the trees and the birds.

330
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,480
 It wasn't until 1768 that they actually found the island with these on them, which probably

331
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,360
 really sucks for that guy who spent 4,000 gold florins for one because then you're like,

332
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,920
 "Oh man, I could have just went there.

333
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,000
 I could have bought a boat and found them."

334
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
 Anyway, so they found whole trees of these things.

335
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
 They're fairly endangered now.

336
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,200
 But they found trees and they're like, they found them with the coconuts, they're still

337
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,040
 all furry and stuff like that.

338
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:22,040
 The story doesn't end there because when they get to the island, they find these trees,

339
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,840
 most plants have like a male and a female.

340
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,040
 I think some are the same.

341
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,960
 Anyways, these trees have male and female.

342
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,640
 The female is the shapely coconut with the buttocks and the hips and the thighs.

343
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,720
 The male one looks like a big penis.

344
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,000
 The seed that comes off the male tree is like, I don't know, 10 inches long and tubular.

345
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,320
 And the people are like, "What?

346
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 How?

347
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
 What?

348
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 Like what?"

349
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,120
 And so then another rumor grew at night during storms, the two trees would knock together

350
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,120
 and that's how they fertilized the tree.

351
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,880
 That's how they were able to fertilize the seeds.

352
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,720
 And if you ever saw two of these trees having sex, you went blind or you died on the spot.

353
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,400
 And what's even more bizarre is science can't figure out how these trees are fertilized

354
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
 or germinate.

355
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,720
 I'm not saying they're actually having sex during a storm, but that's just added more

356
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,440
 to that legend that these trees are having sex.

357
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,560
 And to be fair, if any two trees in the world look like they could actually have sex, it

358
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
 would be these trees.

359
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,280
 Now, I know you're thinking, Jason, you've talked for about 10 minutes about what these

360
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,160
 trees look like and it's a podcast.

361
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
 Fair enough.

362
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:49,120
 But I know for a fact that about 80% of you are now Googling Coco De Mer and you guys

363
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
 will be.

364
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,720
 That looks like the Kim Kardashian of coconuts.

365
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
 It's bizarre.

366
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,760
 I think the fact that, oh, and there's another legend that this may have been the fruit that

367
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,120
 Eve gave Adam for the Garden of Eden, but I thought he took a bite out of it.

368
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,600
 How do you take a bite out of a coconut?

369
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,160
 Don't you have to crack it open with a machete or something or smash it on a rock?

370
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,960
 If I had one of these I wanted to smash on a rock, dude, I wonder if I can buy one on

371
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
 eBay.

372
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,480
 I wonder if they go bad, actually.

373
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,440
 I wonder if, like, if I bought one it would just kind of like, molt in my apartment.

374
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
 I don't know.

375
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
 Coco De Mer, though.

376
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
 Again, cool looking coconut.

377
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,880
 Interesting story.

378
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
 I want one.

379
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,120
 I should start a Kickstarter to buy myself a Coco De Mer.

380
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,600
 Maybe that will be our first, or would that be a GoFundMe?

381
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
 I don't know.

382
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,040
 GoFundMe, my perverse desire to have a sexually attractive coconut in my house.

383
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,600

 DeadRabbit Radio, this was a tough one, man.

387
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,200
 I'm dreading editing that Candice Newmaker story.

388
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,000
 DeadRabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

389

 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

390
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
 Have a great one, guys.

391
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,480
 Bye.

392
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,060
 (upbeat music)
