1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Are humans breeding with aliens to create a new race?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
 And the battle of the sexes heats up today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:17,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,480
 Carpenter, having a great day. I hope you're having a great day. You know, it's funny,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,600
 I'm a big stats guy. As far as kind of looking at the stats of Project Simonvolve that I don't

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,560
 care about like statistics in general, but this is how I was back when I was doing music.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,000
 This is kind of how I've approached everything. I like to look at the stats. I like to look at

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,560
 feedback. I like to look to know what people are responding to and what people aren't responding to.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,240
 And luckily with the podcast, I can see a ton of stats. I can see general, you know, countries

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,280
 where people are visiting from, which is great. We're hitting all sorts of countries, countries

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
 I've never been to, are listening to the show. States, I see people in all these other states

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
 listening to the show. I've actually stopped naming those states and countries because I've

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
 noticed once I do, viewership drops off. I think they're afraid that I'm going to track them.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,640
 But one of the things that YouTube allows me to do, the podcast just shows me downloads,

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
 but YouTube will actually show me views and how long people are watching the videos.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
 And it kind of gives me an average. And we've been hitting about a four minute average on

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,360
 YouTube and I'm taking the 20 minute podcast, breaking it into maybe two, six to 10 minutes

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,280
 stories. So a four minute average is actually really good. Now the last episode I uploaded

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
 the YouTube video, our porn star psycho, our porn star psychic sexual vampires.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,560
 Within a couple hours, it was my most viewed video with 140 views right out the gate. It had only

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,400
 been live for two hours. And I was like, Oh, this is great. You know, I hope this isn't too clickbaity.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,080
 And then when I dug into the numbers, it had only been watched an average of about 10 seconds

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,560
 at that time. It's, it's leveled off now. Now it's up back to around maybe two or three minutes.

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,040
 So it's still under averaged. One of my least people are watching the video on average, less

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,040
 than they've watched the other videos. And it's, I think what people thought it was, obviously the

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,480
 subscribers know what they're getting into. People are coming back to this channel know what

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
 they're getting into. But people who are recommended the video, I think they probably think it's Dad

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,480
 Porn. Now when I say Dad porn, I don't mean porn with dads in it, incest or anything like that.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,040
 I mean porn that is made for dads, which tends to be very, very, very soft core. You see it a lot

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,840
 on Fox News. They'll do news reports like what is your daughter doing at spring break. And you

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,080
 know for the next five minutes is Tucker Carlson. Bill O'Reilly was notorious for this when his

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
 show was still on the air. But you'll have, you know, Sean Hannity or whatever doing their segment.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,520
 And in the, in your hearing him talk, but for about five minutes, you're seeing these

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,760
 young, beautiful 20 year old women dancing around on the beach. And it's so the dad who can't watch

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,680
 porn, you know, some of them can't watch porn because they may have a moral objection to it,

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,560
 or their wife doesn't let them, or they have child blocks on their computers or whatever. And some of

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,880
 them may like to look at a beautiful woman, but don't want to see a prolapsed anus. They don't

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,080
 want to see like that hyper porn that's flowing around out there. They just want to look at a

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,960
 beautiful woman dance around on the beach. And it's dad porn is basically porn that if someone

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,720
 walked in on you while you're watching it, you could be like, I'm just watching the news, honey.

41
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,240
 I'm just listening to this crazy YouTube guy talk about psychic vampires and porn.

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,720
 Haha. And I think they clicked on it and they heard my voice. Hey, everybody, welcome to

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio. And they just clicked off within 10 seconds. But I really like that story and

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
 I've actually gotten some feedback on it already. You guys are really fast with responding to stuff.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,040
 And I appreciate that. It's one of the things that keeps me going. But no, sorry, guys, you're

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,760
 just clicking in because there was a sexy woman picture there. That was it. It was just a sexy

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:04,000
 woman picture and then me talking about vampires for the next 10 minutes. So now we're gonna,

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,880
 we got two stories again today. The first one we're going to talk about is something I just

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,400
 found out about yesterday. And I know what you're thinking, oh, Jason has a hard enough time researching

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,960
 stuff that he's been preparing. Now he's going to talk about something he just discovered.

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,320
 But I think it's interesting. So the battle of the sexes takes all shapes and forms. It can be a

52
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,920
 professional battle. It can be like a mental battle. But it can also be a who can manipulate who the

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,480
 most. And that's what we're going to be talking about now. So I'm sure you're all familiar with

54
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,320
 the term sugar baby and sugar daddy. What a sugar daddy is, it's a wealthy man or a man of means

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,440
 who doesn't want to really deal with the act of like courting a woman or going through all that

56
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,560
 regular role at dating. He's just basically I will provide you finances and you will be my girl.

57
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,800
 A sugar baby is the girl is the one who's like, you know, I'm just looking for a rich man to

58
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 take care of me. That term has been around forever. It's changed into now it's almost like a professional

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,520
 agreement. So there's a website called seeking arrangements. And it is set up for wealthy men

60
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,360
 who get verified somehow their their wealth is verified. They post their profiles on there and

61
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,760
 then young women who simply want to be taken care of in exchange for companionship, really sex.

62
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,640
 But it's not like a prostitute where it's on like a case by case basis. It's a lifestyle choice. So

63
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,360
 some of these women get paid and they get they call it an allowance of up to $5,000 a week. A lot

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,320
 of people are talking about, oh, yeah, you know, I get $5,000 a week from my man and I'm reading all

65
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,400
 these I found out about that. Well, I knew about that. I didn't know so much about there's whole

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,880
 forms dedicated on how to be a better sugar baby and how to find the right men who are going to take

67
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,960
 care of you who aren't, you know, total losers, warning signs to look for abusing people who are

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,120
 abusers and so on and so forth. That in and of itself is something that I again, in general,

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,440
 knew about didn't know so much about the how tos. What I found out yesterday is there is an opposing

70
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:21,680
 side. There is a Skeletor to the he man of sugar babies. And the Skeletor is what is called a salt

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,840
 daddy. So instead of a sugar daddy, you're a salt daddy. And I saw that term yesterday and I was

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,000
 like, okay, this is going to be interesting. This is going to be something interesting of research

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,280
 at 11 o'clock a night. Assault daddy is a man who pretends he's wealthy and seeks out sugar babies

74
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:49,600
 and manipulates them into sex. And I'm like, oh, you know, the thing is with life is there's a lot

75
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,840
 of times predators and predators bump into each other. I would consider somebody who is basically

76
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,600
 trying. I mean, you can be a kind of you could say the relationship is

77
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,000
 consensual, but there's something slimy about it on all sides, the sugar daddy and the sugar baby.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,800
 And now you have this third third predator in the group, the sugar assault daddy, who will

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
 basically go on these websites, contact these women and be like, oh, yeah, you know, the Maserati

80
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,760
 is in the shop right now, but I can pick you up in my on the cord that I borrowed from my butler.

81
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,760
 Let's go to this hotel and have sex. And of course, a lot of the sugar baby forums, they're

82
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,120
 like, how do I keep an eye out for salt daddies? You know, I got salted last night. I went out

83
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,920
 with this guy. This was one of the salt stories, by the way, to me, this is a massive amount of

84
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,120
 money. But this is one of the salt stories. So this woman, she met this guy who said he was a sugar

85
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,880
 daddy. And she brought him, he brought her champagne, but he pulled it out of his backpack and it was

86
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,480
 an expensive champagne. Then when they met up again, this time he brought red wine, which he also

87
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,360
 pulled out of his backpack. I don't do rich people not have backpacks. Is that a stereotype? I don't

88
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,320
 know about that. But anyways, and she said it was kind of a cheap red wine. Now to me, cheap means

89
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,000
 like $7 wine. So I don't know if it was that cheap. I don't know if it was like Thunderbird.

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,880
 Then she takes he takes her out to a fancy restaurant in her words, a fancy restaurant. So

91
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,080
 he obviously has some sort of money. I don't even buy. I have a backpack. That's the only thing I

92
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,480
 can share in common with this kind of story. I don't have enough money to buy wine to give to

93
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,680
 people. But he takes her out to a fancy restaurant. And then that night, he says, Hey, you know, I'm

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,560
 going to give you a little bit of a less allowance this time because I bought you dinner. Now the

95
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,680
 allowance, these three dates they went on each time he gave her $500 cash. That's that's insane.

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
 And she's saying, Oh, he must not be rich because if he was rich, he wouldn't ask for a discount.

97
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,800
 Well, maybe or maybe he maybe you ate $400 worth of food. I don't know. The whole thing seems super

98
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,400
 weird for me. Now when I think of assault daddy reading this, the definition that I got were

99
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,760
 people who are actually like poor, not like just not as rich. Like maybe the guy said he made a,

100
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,840
 you know, a million and it turns out he only made like $800,000. The shocker.

101
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,640
 That's that's the tragedy of it all. I was thinking more of somebody like me who was pretending that

102
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,720
 he was an astronaut, but I'm still in moon rocks for millions of dollars a gram. So I did find assault

103
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,560
 daddy like that on the on seeing this is the opposing side, I found a website where a guy teaches

104
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,560
 you how to be a assault daddy. And his his tips were that you have to make it believable. So you

105
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,560
 say that you're worth a million dollars and you make about 300,000 a year. You know, he goes,

106
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,240
 that's believable. If you say you're a multimillionaire, it's harder to prove. He went and he researched

107
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,400
 up names of what a rich person's name would be like. And he settled on the name Donovan Chase,

108
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,680
 which sure, I guess it does sound like a rich person, but it sounds more like a rich person

109
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,360
 from a romance novel. But he's saying it worked for him. And he goes on with this website. He's like,

110
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,400
 you know, what I did was I created this Tinder profile and not Tinder, he went on seeking

111
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,720
 arrangements, you know, went on that website and created a professional profile showing how much

112
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,120
 money he had. And then he goes, I would see women in my area on Tinder and they wouldn't give me

113
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,080
 the time of day. And then I would see them on seeking arrangement and they'd be all over me

114
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,760
 because now they've perceived me as someone of value, someone who had money that can give them

115
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,960
 something. And so he goes, you know, I used to have all of my stats and all of my phrases that

116
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,960
 I used on seeking arrangements on this website. But what happened was this website got so popular

117
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:47,040
 that all the women read it. So they knew exactly what to look for. So I put that in another article

118
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,480
 called Salt Daddy 102. This article with Salt Daddy 101, like introduction to Salt Daddy.

119
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,880
 So of course, at this point, I'm curious, I click on the link. It's not another website. He's selling

120
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,280
 a book on how to be a salt daddy for $89. Now he's a sugar baby. Now he's ripping me off.

121
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,880
 I'm gonna pay $89 for a book on how to be a salt daddy. Here, page one, chapter one, why?

122
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,560
 In the book, just lie about stuff that you think people will believe. And the beauty of the internet

123
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,640
 is, is that if the lies don't work, you shut down the profile, open up a new one with a new lie.

124
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,800
 I don't have to pay $89 to know how to deceive people. Wait, no backup. I don't want to pay $89

125
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,600
 simply to deceive people. And I'll bet you anything. If anyone buys that book, that book is full of

126
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,400
 the most useless knowledge. And I bet you he's trying to sell other products around the way.

127
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,160
 I hate it when people manipulate people and I hate it when people rip people off. I mean,

128
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,080
 it's just predators versus predators versus predators. And prey gets caught up in the net

129
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,840
 sometimes. Don't pay $89 for a book telling you how to lie. Ridiculous. Although I do think the

130
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,640
 term salt daddy is still pretty, pretty funny. But I don't recommend becoming a salt daddy yourself.

131
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,080
 I don't really recommend becoming a salt daddy. Oh, and there's weird, there's a war between the

132
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,520
 sugar babies too. Some sugar babies are like, you need to have an allowance of $5,000 a week.

133
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,560
 Like that has to be agreed to upfront. And other sugar babies are like, I don't need an allowance

134
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,960
 as long as I'm taking care of like if I'm with a rich man, he's flying me around the world.

135
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,760
 And he buys me stuff that I want. The fact that he's not giving me cash every Friday doesn't

136
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,360
 matter. And there was like a war on the forum and they're like, you don't know how to be a sugar

137
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,680
 baby. I'm just looking for comfort. And I mean, you can meet somebody and it get get a genuine

138
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,720
 relationship out of it. That actually would be a really interesting romcom where it's like a salt

139
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,600
 daddy tricks, I guess I'd probably just be called rape by deception. I don't think that would be a

140
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,240
 good romcom. Never mind. Let's move on to the next story. So the next story is part of our

141
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,440
 sex, spiracy week, our week of sexual conspiracies. This one's a little different,

142
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,080
 because this one has absolutely no proof to back up any of the claims. It's all just people

143
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,200
 saying stuff. And like all the other conspiracies on this show that are rigorously tested and

144
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,520
 scientifically proven, the first story, first part of it is a little sad. But the second part is going

145
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,600
 to make you chuckle. So I think it bounces out pretty well. There's this woman. She was a she

146
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,880
 worked for the US Air Force, you know, generally give military personnel more credibility.

147
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,080
 Maybe not this time. She works for the she worked for the US Air Force. And back when she was 25,

148
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,440
 she was just going about life. She had a little kid. She was working as a radar technician officer,

149
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,080
 radar tracking officer, I guess I should say the exact job she had details matter in these

150
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,440
 types of stories. And then one day a reptile, a reptilian alien shows up,

151
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,960
 kidnaps her, takes her to the moon because they need slave labor up there. And what better way

152
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,400
 to get slave labor than to kidnap a 25 year old American woman. I mean, forget that there's people

153
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,880
 all over the world and continents that have no tracking software when people go missing.

154
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,720
 Can nap her, take her to the moon. She works all day moving boxes in this factory, they're building

155
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,160
 this military installation on the dark side of the moon. And then at night, the alien bangs her

156
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 and invites his alien reptilian friends to bang her too. So there's like this gang bang going on.

157
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,080
 And then the oddest, the oddest detail of that whole thing is there's a bunch of grays standing

158
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,480
 on the corner watching them. So I imagine like the grays are just like cuckolds to the reptilians,

159
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,800
 like the reptilians are like these strong, virile creatures. And the grays are just like these

160
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,520
 emaciated creatures like smoking cigarettes in the corner being like, yeah, take it hard.

161
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:48,960
 Yeah, give her that a, give her that big juicy egg. That might have gone a little too far. But

162
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,280
 anyways, and she says this happened like eight to 10 times and she didn't remember any of it,

163
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,880
 but she had some missing time in her life. And she got hypnotized and through hypnosis,

164
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,720
 this was all revealed to her. Now, it goes without saying that didn't happen. There's

165
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,360
 multiple things wrong with that story. One, I don't even have to go through them. The whole

166
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,840
 thing is ridiculous. What's sad is the woman either did suffer some sort of sexual assault,

167
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,720
 and this was her only way of coping with it, or she's just nuts. Like I think this story,

168
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,960
 they couldn't find really any incident that mirrored this type of thing in her past. But the

169
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,600
 whole thing is just weird. And I read that and I was like, okay, that woman's just a little nuts and

170
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,480
 it's just kind of sad. We do cover a lot of people on this show that seem to have some sort of mental

171
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,440
 illness, your host, most likely included. And from there, so that woman was like, oh man,

172
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,240
 I can't believe it happened. I had sex with all those aliens. I feel so ashamed. Then I found a

173
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:53,520
 group of women who are the opposite and they're like, sex with aliens is the best. Reptilian sex

174
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:01,840
 is the most savage, primal, fierce sex you can ever have. And I feel bad for women who don't have it.

175
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:09,920
 And I gave birth to a hybrid baby. There's a whole group of these women who believe that not

176
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,040
 only have they had consensual sex with the reptilian species, they've actually gone through

177
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,720
 pregnancy and delivered birth. These women actually do have proof, proof of this. They have pictures

178
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,280
 of their children, hand drawn pictures of their children. They have all sketched out drawings

179
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,440
 of what they believe their hybrid children look like. And they look like precious moments pictures.

180
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,360
 They're just normal kids with like eyes that are really big. Some of them have like little

181
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,720
 reptilian foreheads, but they're like women, you have to bang these aliens. It feels so good.

182
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,760
 I'm reading this article and sometimes the women say they'll actually be brought up to the spaceship

183
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:57,200
 for some hot, sexy, scaly sex. And they said, one woman says, one time she just saw a light come

184
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:05,040
 through the sky and her ovaries began to ache. And she's like, that's it. They just beamed an egg out

185
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,440
 of me and I have another hybrid baby. So you're going, oh, Jason, great. You're just picking on

186
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,360
 people with mental disorders. No, not really. Well, kind of. But what I think is interesting about

187
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,320
 this is there is a gen. It's not just these women, these two women featured in this article. Aside

188
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,400
 from the woman who got taken to the moon, these two women are having hybrid children. It's not

189
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,720
 just them. There is a forum. There is a website called hybrid children online. And this is a

190
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,280
 website specifically for women who have hybrid children or who have hybrid children and don't

191
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,600
 know it. See, you can take this workshop. You can take this workshop that this very slick,

192
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,240
 admittedly slick website has where you can learn to connect with your hybrid child. You can remember

193
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,360
 your galactic heritage and soul mission. You can rekindle your own inner child and you can cultivate

194
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,800
 your extrasensory abilities. So basically pay me money and I'll teach you how to imagine stuff.

195
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,880
 I'm looking through this and this website is creepy. So you have the hand drawn pictures,

196
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,520
 which was weird enough because they're saying this is my own child. This is Bucky. And it's just a

197
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,440
 drawing. This website goes the extra step. They've taken photos of normal children and photoshopped

198
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:32,000
 their eyes to be huge. It's really disturbing and it gives it this kind of anti uncanny valley thing

199
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,320
 where it makes them look less human. It's not that uncanny valley thing where they look too human.

200
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,760
 So this package where you you can sign up for this thing and you'll get all these interactive videos

201
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,800
 that'll help you telepathically communicate with your child. I mean at this point they're praying.

202
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,440
 I may be making fun of them but they're praying on people who have mental illnesses. You can watch

203
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,160
 these videos. They have you can access their Facebook group. You can be on these four these

204
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:06,640
 group calls with each other. $444 for this program. So let's say that I have a mental illness and I

205
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,800
 think that I have a hybrid child out there and this is a real mental illness I have and I'm

206
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,560
 suffering with and I finally find people who agree with me. They will only agree with me and they

207
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:26,880
 only help me out if I have $444 or to be fair two payments of $225. So you can save six bucks

208
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,800
 if you just buy it in full but come on and they have that little trick where they go maybe you

209
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,960
 have a hybrid child and don't even know it. So if you're lonely and you don't know why you don't

210
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,720
 remember last Thursday night it's not because the wine it's because an alien abducted you had hot

211
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,720
 passionate alien sex with you took out your baby and dropped you back off on earth. And people

212
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,520
 believe this. People believe this. You know this the idea of humans breeding with aliens has been

213
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,800
 around for a long time but I don't understand it with. I can't have sex with a dog but I can't

214
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,840
 have a baby with a dog. A creature that evolved on another planet we wouldn't be able to breed with

215
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,160
 and then you go okay maybe they came here first and were maybe they're there the progenitors of

216
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,400
 our species. Again I think the most likely thing that aliens are from earth if the aliens exist

217
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,560
 I don't think they're coming from the cosmos I think they're from either under the ocean or a

218
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,480
 cave system or from another dimension which think about it they're based I just realized aliens are

219
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,160
 salt daddies because think of this if and reptile shows up and the woman's like oh my god you're a

220
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,720
 reptile and he's like yes I came from the star Cyrus or is it serious I can't even the aliens like

221
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:49,040
 I'm serious Cyrus anyways I'm from a star a long way away and I came across this vast distance to

222
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:56,240
 make hot animal passionate love to you and the woman's like oh my god she's all a flutter

223
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,120
 and he takes her and he just ravishes her and then after that as he's putting back on his little

224
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,720
 reptilian silver suit he's like see you later and he just walks into a cave by mount Adams like I

225
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,240
 think they're probably telling these women that they're from the farthest reaches of space but

226
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,720
 then it turns out like they're just like swimming underneath the Gulf of Mexico like they're basically

227
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,480
 salt daddies because they can't be coming that from that far away doesn't make sense and if they did

228
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,720
 why would they be banging these women these women are pretty hot actually if you look at the article

229
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,760
 I wouldn't travel light years to have sex with them but aliens might actually be the ultimate salt

230
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,520
 daddies the intergalactic salt daddies they're lying about it they don't have hyperdrives they have

231
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,040
 like a submarine at tops a really fast submarine that might be able to hover outside the water

232
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,440
 the women are like hey why aren't we on your UFO and he's like uh my thrusters in the shop I have

233
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,720
 to borrow this RV from my butler so we're just gonna have sex in this and then they just slink

234
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,800
 out the back and go into like some deep cave system and they're telling the graze all the

235
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,680
 stories are like oh yeah dude she totally put out she let me get to the earth and the graze are

236
