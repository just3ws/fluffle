1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Two men go missing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And then law enforcement has to ask the ultimate question.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we take a look at the story of the billowak monster.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 The story itself is half spy intrigue, half sci-fi,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 where a creature who's half man and half sheep is all sorts of trouble today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 You know what's funny? I would have never watched this if I wasn't doing the show.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I was never a huge fan. I didn't hate them,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 but I just never really watched anything by the Logan Paul and Jake Paul, the Paul brothers.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 But because of the show, I was like, I should check out that new documentary,

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Flat Earth to the Edge and Back by Logan Paul,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 where Logan Paul, the trailer he released,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 showed him being convinced that the Earth may be flat.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And then they released the trailer and he's like slowly realizing the Earth may be flat.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And a bunch of other YouTubers are like, oh my god, of course, Logan Paul is,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 if Logan Paul, if you don't know, is basically Gaston with the YouTube channel.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I mean, that's really the impression that you get when you first see snippets about this guy.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And his brother is pretty much the same.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 But they're like, oh my god, of course Logan Paul is so stupid,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 he could easily be convinced of the flat Earth.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And that's what the trailer looked like.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 The movie is 100% a mockumentary.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 The opening scene, a character dies and then comes back to life.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It sets it up right within the first five minutes, I said, oh, this is a comedy.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 This is basically a Borat version of conspiracy theory flat Earth stuff.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Because I was like, obviously a guy, his buddy did not die and then come back to life,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 or go into a coma and come back to life.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So the first scene set it up, it's a total joke.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And that's exactly what the movie is.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 It's a mockumentary.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 He really does go to a flat Earth convention and they have an actress who's this super hot Australian chick

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 and she's a flat Earth or two and they fall in love and like, she's like, let's run away and find the edge of the-

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Oh, and his best friend grew up in Antarctica and he found the edge of the world

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 and his buddy who had flat feet fell off of it.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And it's so, it's just funny.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Like, I actually laughed out loud several times during the movie.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I highly recommend watching it.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Of course the people at the flat Earth convention weren't in on the joke.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 He's making fun of them.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 By the end, Logan Paul is such a- his character is so stupid that at the end he doesn't believe the world is flat.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 He believes the world doesn't exist and that there is no Earth.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And it was really well done.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Definitely, I would check it out.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Like I said, I laughed a couple times.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I've never watched anything from him.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I've seen a couple of rap videos from Jake Paul and I wasn't impressed,

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 but I was actually very impressed by this.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 This guy and his team really went out and made a funny documentary.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Basically, it was this show with a $10 million budget.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 It was better than the show.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I mean, you know what I mean?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Like he has a whole crew, but it was the same type of vibe.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 It was something I would do if I had access to that kind of money.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I would just troll people constantly who believe in ridiculous stuff, i.e. flat Earth.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 So, good job, Logan Paul.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I really enjoyed it and I recommend it highly.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I'm a hard guy to get a laugh out of in a movie.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I'm really...

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Yeah, I can't remember the last time I laughed in a movie theater.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Well, I don't go to a movie theater anymore, but I'm not a big fan of comedies in general.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But you want to hear a story that's not funny, which involves a human misery

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 and mothers crying over their missing kids.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 If you want to hear that story, let's go to Florida.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So for our next story, let's go ahead and we're hopping over to Florida.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Literally, because we're dead rabbits, we hop across the country from Logan Paul's house

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 all the way to Naples, Florida.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And while we're hopping, we actually hop through a time portal and end up in the year 2003.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's October 2003.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Beautiful sunny day.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Solstice music playing.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I don't know, what do they play in Florida?

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Like the big bass...

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 A Two Live Crew is playing.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 They're doing a reunion tour in Naples this year.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 In 2003, for whatever reason.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Two Live Crew is back.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 It's a They So Horny dot dot dot still tour.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So in this city, you had a young man named Felipe Santos.

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Now he was an illegal alien and he was working illegally.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And he's driving through town and he gets in a minor car accident.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Now a minor car accident to most people is like, "Oh, this totally sucks."

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But got my insurance stuff.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I got actually hit by two cars at the same time once and neither of them had insurance.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It was the worst thing ever and I was a pizza delivery driver and I wouldn't let him leave the scene.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So I just fed him pizza.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I had all these pizzas in my back seat and they...

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Two of the people, they didn't speak a word of English and then the people in the other car was like a mom and a son and neither of them had insurance.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And I was like, "No one leaves until the cops show up."

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Took him three hours.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Because at any point, if you get a car accident, even a fender bender and someone says, "I'll just we'll let her hash it out later."

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 They could just say it never happened.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So I made him stay there and I actually got a fat settlement from my company for that.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Because I totally messed up my shoulder.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 So fender benders though, generally.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Getting hit by two cars is a little more than a fender bender.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 But fender bender, you're like, "Ah, you know, little scrapes and stuff like that."

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But it was a minor car accident.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 However, again, you want the cops to come out.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now, Felipe knew that this was more than just a minor scrape.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Like he is not supposed to be living or working in the United States.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So he's a little nervous.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 He's a little nervous.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 The other guys bumping some two-life crew to lift his spirits.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 He's like, "Yeah, you're right. I am kind of horny."

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So the police show up and it is Deputy Steve Calkins, who had been with the force for a while.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 He's getting their information.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 At that point, he realizes Felipe is illegal.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So he's like, "Listen, man, you know, I'm gonna have to take you to jail."

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Felipe's like, "Yeah, I get it, dude. It sucks."

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Gets in the back of the cop car.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 The cop car drives away.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And the other person involved in the accident is kind of like,

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 "That's the one that kind of sucked."

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Drives away as well.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Now, Felipe's boss finds out that he's been arrested.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And he's like, "Oh, great."

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But he wants-- he doesn't want to just have him rot in jail until all this is settled.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 He calls up the police station.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 This is a boss.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 This is a pretty dope boss.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Calls up the police station and says, "I want to pay his bail.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Let's get him out of there.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He can come back.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 We'll figure all this stuff out."

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 'Cause at that point, the boss is like, "Yeah, he's probably getting deported.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But, you know, I just don't want him to sit in jail for 90 days."

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 He's a good guy.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 He's a nice guy.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So he calls up the police department and says, "I want to bail him out."

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And the-- well, he called him to jail, actually.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 But the jail goes, "No, we don't know who you're talking about."

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 This guy was never booked in here.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And he's like, "I know he was arrested."

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And they're like, "He might have been arrested, but he was never booked in our jail."

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 At that point, day or two later, Felipe just never shows back up to work.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So people are starting to get suspicious.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 They're like, "Where is Felipe?"

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 He would never miss this Two Live Crew concert.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But the Two Live Crew concert came and went.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And no Felipe.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I actually don't know if Felipe was a fan of Two Live Crew.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I'm just trying to lighten the story as much as I can.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Felipe never shows back up.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And they keep pressing on the police.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And the police go to Deputy Steve Colkins, because they know he was there.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And they're like, "He's a good officer."

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 They say, "What happened?

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Like, why do you know where he could be?"

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Because you were the last person I was kind of seeing with him.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 The deputy says, "Okay, here's what happened.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 There's a car accident.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 I realized he was illegal.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I put him in my car."

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 But as I was driving him to jail, he actually was super polite.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And just kind of a really nice guy.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And I said, "You know what?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 I'm not a DEA officer.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I don't really care if you're illegal or not.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 I was just kind of following protocol.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I'll just drop you off somewhere where you want to get dropped off."

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And he goes, "Circle K.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Drop me off at a Circle K.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I'm going to get one of their disgusting, generic slushies,

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 and some four-day-old donuts."

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And Deputy goes, "Yeah, that's Circle K. All right.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Let me drop you off over there."

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 The police are like, "Whoa, you should have filed a report."

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, but I just...

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I don't want to arrest them."

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So what would the report say?

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I let an illegal immigrant go.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, I guess so."

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 So they tell the boss that.

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 They're like, "Listen, this is what happened."

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 He picked them up, dropped them off at Circle K.

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Because he was really polite.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And the boss is like, "Yeah, he's a really nice guy.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 That's why I wanted a bail amount and stuff like that."

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So that sucks.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I wonder what happened to him.

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Cops go, "Well, we'll keep looking.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I have for him."

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But again, he's an illegal immigrant.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 He may just be scared and on the run.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 He could be anywhere.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 So that was that, right?

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Deputy Steve Calkins being wooed,

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 being charmed by this man,

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 dropped him off at a Circle K,

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and then something bad befell him.

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But three months later,

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 it's January 2004,

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 and a black man named Terrence Williams

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 goes missing.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 No one can find him.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 His mom starts pestering the police.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Rightfully so.

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 She's not being like a nag.

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Her son's missing.

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 She wants to know where her son is.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 She goes to the police.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 She's like, "Where's my son?"

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And they're like, "Listen, your son is an adult.

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 He had an expired license.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 He could be anywhere.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 He could be out partying.

210
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 He could have a big hangover somewhere.

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Like, give us a couple days.

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 He'll probably turn up."

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But he doesn't.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So the mom keeps looking for him,

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 and eventually she gets her family involved,

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and her aunt tracks down his Cadillac he was driving.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 The last night he was seen,

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 it's in an in-pound lot,

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and on the paperwork that ordered the towing

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 for the car, Deputy Steve Calkins.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So the mom starts pressing the police,

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 and goes, "Who's this Deputy Steve Calkins?

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 He must know what happened to my son."

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So the cops go, "That's weird.

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I mean, like, yeah, we have this towing paperwork,

226
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 but we don't know anything about Deputy Steve Calkins

227
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 pulling over your son."

228
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And so they go to the deputy, and they go,

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "What happened?"

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 He goes, "Okay, here's what's happened."

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I was driving down the road,

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 and I saw this Cadillac,

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and this was a while back,

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 because it had taken this long for them

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 to get to this point in the investigation.

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But he says, "I was driving down the road,

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and I saw this Cadillac in front of me.

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And he was driving one night,

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 and it was driving a little, like, in distress.

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Like, I figured that the driver was drunk.

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I pulled him over.

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 There's a dude in the car named Terrence Williams.

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And they're like, "How'd you know his name?"

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 He's like, "Well, I got his name.

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I asked him for it.

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I'm not a psychic, but the guy in the car told me

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 his name was Terrence Williams.

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And he was begging me to let him go.

249
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Like, he had to get to--

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 He was late one more time for work.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He was gonna get fired.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And he just seemed really nice and polite.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And so I said, "Tell you what, I'll give you a right to work,

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and then I'll come back and I'll process your car.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And if anything's wrong with it, I may come back

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 and arrest you, or you may get a ticket or something like that."

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And Terrence Williams was like, "Thank you, thank you, thank you.

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 You're the nicest officer in the world,

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 and you're so buff and handsome.

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 You're so strong."

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And Stephen Calkins was like, "Ooh."

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 They flattered, and the investigators he's talking to

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 are like, "Uh, this story sounds made up."

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But anyways, Terrence Williams gets in the back of the car,

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 and Stephen Calkins is telling the cops this story.

266
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Now, I'm not about the handsome part,

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 but Stephen Calkins is telling the people this story.

268
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 They had other cops' story, and he says,

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 "So I asked Terrence Williams where he worked,

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 and he goes, 'Well, I work at Circle K.'"

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 The cops are like, "What?"

272
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 So he takes Terrence Williams to Circle K, drops him off,

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 comes back to process the car, paperworks bad,

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 license plates are expired.

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 At that point, he calls up the work and says,

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 "I want to speak to your employee, Terrence Williams."

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And they say, "He never worked here."

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Dun, dun, dun.

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Stephen Calkins makes those piano noises,

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 and the investigators are like,

281
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 "What? Are you insane?"

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And Stephen Calkins was like, "No, no, that's exactly what happened."

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Now, at this point, the cops are super suspicious

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 of one of their own,

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 because they have two people

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 who went completely missing under similar circumstances,

287
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 and both dropped off at a Circle K.

288
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Now, again, it could just be a coincidence.

289
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 But at this point, the cops are now suspicious of this guy.

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 They had Felipe disappear, and they had Terrence disappear,

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 and they really start digging into this guy.

292
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 They go, he got, Terrence Williams got pulled over near a cemetery.

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 The cemetery workers say, "That's not what happened."

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 We saw Terrence Williams getting back to the cop car,

295
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 and we saw the cop car drive off.

296
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Then we saw the cop car come back an hour later,

297
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 move his car to illegal parking area

298
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 so a tow truck could pick it up.

299
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And Calkins goes, "Oh, yeah, no, I did that,

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 so it would be easier for the tow truck."

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And then the guy at the car accident for the Felipe Santos thing

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 said, "Yeah, Felipe was really polite,

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 but Stephen Calkins was kind of a jerk to him,

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 and was saying, "I hate when you people are here illegally

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 and taking our jobs," and stuff like that.

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So the cops are like, "Okay, the story,

307
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 maybe he is a secretly racist guy,

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 but the story could still make sense,

309
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 and maybe he did move the car,

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 but maybe it was to make the tow truck."

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 They don't have enough, so they say,

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 "Hey, we want to investigate you,

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 we want you to come in and really talk about what's going on."

314
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So even Calkins completely shut up, wouldn't talk,

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 and because he was interfering with an investigation,

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 they fired him.

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And to this day, no one knows what happened to those people.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Disappeared from the face of the earth.

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 No bodies, no evidence, nothing.

320
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 They're gone.

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Obviously, when law enforcement commits a crime,

322
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 it's more gruesome,

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 because they're the ones, it goes out saying,

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 they're the ones that society says you should protect us.

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 But what's bizarre is I'm wondering,

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 these two got connected,

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 and it was because the families were kind of able to track it back to him.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I wonder how many people else that got pulled over by this guy

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 who just went missing, who didn't have families to report it.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 People who were out of town, who didn't know how to track this down.

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Is he connected to other things?

332
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 He's actually, for the first time in 2018,

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 started in 2018, he's facing a wrongful death suit

334
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 from the family of Terrence Williams.

335
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 They're suing him over their son going missing,

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 which has a lower threshold of evidence.

337
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And he, of course, and here's the thing,

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 this is what made me think he's more suspicious,

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 even more suspicious.

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He's representing himself,

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 which either means he's totally broke and can't afford a lawyer,

342
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 or he's one of those guys who thinks he's smarter than he actually is.

343
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 He's one of those guys who thinks he's the smartest man in the world,

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 and he can fool everyone,

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 i.e. someone who thinks they can defend themselves in court.

346
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Civil court actions are not dramatic, really, at all,

347
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 unless it's the people's court.

348
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 But I'm very curious to see how this is going to pull off

349
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 a possible serial killer,

350
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 representing himself in court to avoid getting sued

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 from the family of one of his alleged victims.

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Weird.

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And again, these two stories,

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 they just had the people were able to track it back to Deputy Culkins.

355
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 You gotta wonder how many other people went missing in Naples, Florida.

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Last thing they saw was some red and blue lights behind him,

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 and a smiling officer with a flashlight,

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 telling them to get into the back of his car.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I guess he wouldn't be smiling then, but you know what I mean?

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Like, what are you gonna do?

361
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Cup tells you to get in the back of the car, you're just gonna be like, fine.

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And then once you're in the back of the car, man, all bets are off.

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 You're lucky if you end up in jail.

364
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 But enough of Naples, enough of Florida,

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 we're gonna say goodbye to sunny, sunny Florida.

366
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Next year, though, is the 25th anniversary of Two Life Crew.

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I don't know if that's true.

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 They're probably like the 40th anniversary of Two Life Crew,

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 but they're the only band from Florida I know,

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 other than Florida, Georgia Line.

371
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But we are now going, we're coming back to California.

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 We should have done this one after the Logan Paul story,

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 but we're back in California.

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 We're actually going to a place called Ohai County.

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Now Ohai County actually has a lot of ghost stories and monster stories

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 and stuff like that down there.

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It's kind of weird how many they have.

378
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Ohai County has a lot of monsters already, a lot of monsters.

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Not like if you go there to tourist boards like,

380
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 "Watch out for the sea monster."

381
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 But I mean, it has a lot of like legends of monsters, I should say.

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 But like all legends, they have to start somewhere.

383
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And that is why we're going back to the 1960s.

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I had to look over at my notes.

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We're going back to the 1960s.

386
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Do-wop-ba-ra-bop-ba-do-wop-ba-ra-bop-ba-do-wop-ba-bop-ba-bop.

387
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 The people are, wait, no, that was the 50s.

388
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Okay, anyways, we're back not around us.

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 We're farther back in time.

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 So 60s music would be like, "Never mind, never mind.

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 I'm going to stop doing the music thing."

392
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I just imagined like a 1950s movie. It's 1964.

393
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 There are these teenagers walking through the wooded areas of Ohai County.

394
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 They've always been told to stay away.

395
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 You kids, you stay away from billowak dairy.

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Don't go there.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 They're like, "Why is the milk tainted?"

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And the old man's like, "No, it's just don't go there."

399
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 But you know, teenagers will be teenagers.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It's do-wop music and malt shops in 1964 are all the rage.

401
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Kids with switch blades and leather jackets was a crazy time in 1964.

402
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Anyways, these teenagers go off into the woods because they want to explore this abandoned dairy.

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So it's late at night because that's the only time to really explore abandoned dairies.

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 They got their flashlights.

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 "Ooh, Charles, I'm so cold."

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yeah, here, where are my Lutterman's jacket?

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 So anyways, they're walking through and these teenagers are kind of shining their flashlights around.

408
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And billowak dairy, even in ruins, is quite impressive.

409
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It was basically a two-story building and the walls have all crumbled away.

410
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And you can actually look and you can see where all the decay has taken place.

411
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 You can just walk in through any entrance.

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Quite spooky to see an abandoned building that's actually dissolving before your eyes.

413
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 But as they're walking around billowak dairy, they hear something.

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 They're actually walking through the woods.

415
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Like, what is that? It sounds huge, whatever it is. It sounds super big.

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, you need to go do your SATs again."

417
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 But anyways, the kids start, keep moving and they hear their "kshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhshhsh

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 But anyways, the kids start, keep moving and they hear their "chhh" and something's moving through the woods. And again, it's not like little ghost girl footsteps behind them. Something big is coming.

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And so the kids turn and they look and they see it.

420
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 That wasn't a baby. It wasn't a weird baby jet airplane.

421
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 That was a creature, a giant humanoid.

422
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 That's a better noise. With the head of a ram, some later will say the head of a sheep, but we'll get into that.

423
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 The head of a ram, huge massive curly horns looking at them.

424
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Big old muscular ape body, totally just like yoked out.

425
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Covered in matted gray hair.

426
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 SHINK! Large claws. The kids book it.

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I think, you imagine they're like looking at the creature from top to bottom. I would just see the horns eight feet in the air and I'd be out of there.

428
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 But anyways, they take off and this creature begins chasing them through the forest.

429
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And those are the kids making that noise, not the monster.

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 The kids jump onto the car and the creature actually picked up a boulder and threw it at them and missed them.

431
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And the kids are like, "Start the car, start the car." I can, I can.

432
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 The creature shows up and starts beating up the car.

433
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And just in the nick of time, the car drives away.

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Now they drive into town and they're like, "Townspeople, look, 1950s town people who happened to live in 1964, look at our car."

435
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And it was all beat up.

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 "What happened? What in tarnation happened to you kids?"

437
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 A big monster started punching our car.

438
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Townspeople go, "You were at Billywack Dairy, weren't you?"

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Kids are like, "Yeah, we went there to go check out the building."

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And they're like, "I guess the building checked you out."

441
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 The kids are like, "That doesn't even make sense."

442
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But see, here's the thing.

443
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 The story of the Billywack monster had long preceded these kids going out in the middle of the woods.

444
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Back in the 1950s, so that's why I got my confusion, back in the 1950s,

445
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 a little boy ran home with huge scratches across his back.

446
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Gums and crying, "Mommy, mommy, something scratched my back up."

447
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Now of course the mom thinks maybe he's running through branches or maybe he fell off a cliff or something.

448
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 The mom didn't care about him very much.

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 She's too busy smoking cigarettes.

450
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But he said a monster attacked them.

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And that was one of the first sightings of the Billywack monster.

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And over the years people had seen it off and on,

453
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 but it was people would go out to the woods to just kind of check out the creepiness of the building.

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Now the urban legend had been there, but it wasn't super concrete.

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But after the teenagers are like, "No, no, we got attacked by this thing,"

456
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 newspapers started running articles on this.

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Now, newspapers will run articles on anything,

458
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 but it definitely doesn't mean that it's true, but it gave the rumor more legs.

459
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 The LA Times runs the article saying that these teenagers got attacked by this giant monster.

460
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 The police ended up getting called out multiple times to the forest, not to fight the monster,

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 but to stop kids from fighting the monster.

462
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 At one point these cops pulled over a child carrying a sword into the woods,

463
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 saying he was going to go fight the monster.

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 You're like, "Who is this kid? Connor McLeod?

465
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Like, at what point do you think you're going to be able to sword a dude who's eight feet tall?"

466
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Well, I guess that's what mythological heroes did.

467
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 But anyway, so this kid thought he apparently was Hercules or Pericles,

468
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 or any of the Cleese back then.

469
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 At one point a woman called the police.

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 I don't know what the cops were expecting to find when they got there.

471
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 A woman called the police and says, "I got a group of kids."

472
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 There's about 43 of them.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 The cops are like, "What?"

474
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 She's like, "Let me finish. I got a group of kids.

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 There's like 43 kids in my front yard.

476
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 They're trying to go to the dairy.

477
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 They're just going to get injured."

478
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 The cops are like, "Okay, yeah, we'll be there in a second.

479
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 We'll help you."

480
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 And then she goes, "Don't worry, I got them under control.

481
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I have a shotgun pointed at them."

482
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 This woman had kept 43 kids at bay with a shotgun,

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 so they want to go into the woods.

484
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 That's a weird call.

485
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 The cops show up, and of course it's the 1960s/50s.

486
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 They show up and they give the kids out,

487
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 and they give the mom like a medal.

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 They're like, "Hey, thanks for keeping the kids from going into the woods."

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 They don't aim shotguns at them, but you know.

490
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So where did this legend come from?

491
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 That's the first thing we got to look at before we go into

492
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 whether or not the billowak monster is real.

493
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 The billowak dairy is real,

494
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 and that story is intriguing as well.

495
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 In 1924, billowak dairy was set up,

496
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and it was a state-of-the-art dairy facility.

497
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It was a two-story building.

498
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 It had some of the most technologically advanced milk technology in the world.

499
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 It had...

500
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 How technically advanced can a dairy get would be my question.

501
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Like, they have like, "Lookit, we have titanium vats.

502
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 You just keep yours in wood."

503
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Like, I mean, but I'm not a dairy technician.

504
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It was the most advanced of its time.

505
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 It was founded by a guy named August Rubel.

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Now, he was originally from Sweden,

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 and he had worked with the American Field Service in World War I.

508
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 So there were already people who were like, "Well, that's weird.

509
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Why is this guy from Sweden working with the American Field Service?

510
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 A military veteran, but he was working with kind of like an operative group?"

511
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Now he's in California, and he has this state-of-the-art dairy,

512
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 a million-million-dollar dairy set up.

513
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Kind of weird.

514
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 The rumor started that he didn't just work with the American Field Service.

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 He worked with the OSS, which was actually the precursor to the CIA.

516
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 So now people are really intrigued about this foreigner in their area.

517
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 How did he get the money to build this giant dairy?

518
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 But everything seemed to be on the up and up.

519
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Dairy was incredibly successful, brought in tons of money,

520
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 but at a certain point August said, "You know what?

521
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I'm gonna leave the dairy behind.

522
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 My heart calls for me to go back into the field service,"

523
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 and he apparently joined up with the American Field Service again.

524
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And the last we know is he blew up in a mine attack in Africa.

525
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They weren't attacking him with mines.

526
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 He drove over one.

527
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I mean, that's how mines work, but he blew up.

528
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And over the years, eventually, the dairy went out of business

529
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 and fell into a state of decay.

530
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 That is when the dairy was discovered to have,

531
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 in real life, apparently, I've never been there,

532
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 but underneath the dairy was a whole other floor.

533
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Now, I actually have a friend who grew up on a dairy farm.

534
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I was running to my friends today, Paul and Robin, and I said,

535
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 when he mentioned he was a dairy technician,

536
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I go, "You know, I'm actually working on a story right now."

537
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Now, I don't know.

538
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Is it normal for dairies to have a floor underground?

539
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Because I don't know.

540
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Maybe that's where the milk gets pasteurized.

541
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Maybe that's where the baby cows hang out before it's time to get milk.

542
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I don't know.

543
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 He's like, "What?"

544
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And I go, "Is it-- do dairies normally have

545
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 like a secret underground fortress underneath them?"

546
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And he's like, "I've never heard of that."

547
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Now, it doesn't mean that this underground facility,

548
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 this secret underground facility that was only accessible

549
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 if you poured the right colored milk into the right vials.

550
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Like, you have to put a little strawberry, a little chocolate.

551
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 No, it wasn't that secret, but it had a whole floor underground.

552
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Is that normal for a dairy farm?

553
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And he said, "No, that's not."

554
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And so that started the idea that maybe he was running a secret

555
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 experiments in this underground lab underneath the dairy.

556
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Because it'd be the perfect cover.

557
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 You'd have stuff coming in and out.

558
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 You'd have livestock coming in, not leaving, really,

559
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 but you'd have livestock showing up.

560
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 You'd have big cargo container things full of milk coming in and out.

561
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I think you can understand at my level of the economics

562
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 and production of milk is pretty weak.

563
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But you'd have constant traffic there.

564
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 You'd have the perfect cover.

565
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 You'd have something come in, put it in the lab.

566
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 You'd never know about it.

567
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Now, again, he may have found a reason to keep a floor underground

568
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 for whatever reason.

569
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 So that didn't necessarily make me suspicious.

570
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 But what does make me suspicious was that people for years after

571
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 the billowak dairy going out of business, which was around the 40s,

572
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 people said that they could find checks payable to August,

573
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 just floating all over the place.

574
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 People said that you could go through the dairy,

575
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 because as it was crumbling away, you would look into walls

576
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 and see checks for his business made out to him stuffed in walls.

577
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You would just be walking through the forest and find checks made out to him

578
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 from distributors and suppliers and stuff like that that were uncashed.

579
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 If you had a successful multimillion dollar, or maybe not multimillion dollar,

580
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 but if you had a very, very successful dairy,

581
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 why wouldn't you cash those checks unless you were getting more money

582
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 from somewhere else?

583
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And that was all just the cover operation.

584
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 When's the last time that you've gotten checks and never cashed them?

585
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Especially if they're checks for your business,

586
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 that your for-profit business that you're running,

587
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 you're just stuffing them in walls.

588
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Then as you're building decays, they just fly everywhere.

589
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 So was there some secret experiment going on underneath billowak dairy?

590
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I think the answer to that is it's very possible that there were things going on in that dairy

591
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 that it was a cover business, because when he left,

592
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 the dairy stopped really operating, or it started to decline very rapidly.

593
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Like he sold it off to someone else and it lasted for another 30, 40 years and stuff like that.

594
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 State of the art dairy, he leaves.

595
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 I think someone took it over shortly, but then it just falls into disrepair.

596
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Other than like, even when a restaurant goes out of business, another restaurant moves in.

597
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 You're telling me this dairy, they just abandoned.

598
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 But if the purpose wasn't to have, if the real purpose wasn't for it to be a dairy,

599
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 but for it to be a cover, once you didn't need the cover anymore, you leave.

600
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 So I think it's very possible that the billowak dairy was a cover for something.

601
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 The question is, is does the billowak monster exist, and did it come from that dairy?

602
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Now that's obviously a more difficult question.

603
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 There has been no photographs of the billowak monster.

604
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 There have been no, like, real evidence of the billowak monster, other than what people have seen.

605
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Other than a couple dents in a car, claw marks, which you know what I mean?

606
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 There's been no plaster casts of footprints that I was able to find, or, oh, look it, here's where one of his horns molted off.

607
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 He must have grown a new one. There's nothing like that.

608
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Does the billowak monster exist?

609
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 I mean, again, I really, the answer to that is, do you believe in monsters or not?

610
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 There's been no proof that it exists.

611
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 There's been sightings of it, and people say they've been attacked by it, and things like that.

612
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 But there's urban legends all over the place.

613
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Does the creature exist?

614
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 What I find interesting about the billowak monster is that it has an origin story,

615
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 rather than Bigfoot who just kind of pops up, or the fey, or goblins, or whatever like that.

616
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Like, this creature is really a product of its time.

617
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 The first sightings were in the 1950s out of the sci-fi movie, so it has a sci-fi origin.

618
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 It has a location that it came from, a real life secret building underground, an existing building,

619
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 that was run by a guy who was rumored to work for the CIA, which sent, or the OSS, which sounds a bit of a retcon.

620
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 But it's a cryptid that has, it's a modern day cryptid.

621
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 A lot of times you look at these cryptids, and, you know, Bloody Mary started off like in the 1800s,

622
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 and then it became more personified in the 1950s.

623
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Bigfoot has been around for the longest time.

624
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Obviously, fairies and giants and stuff like that are cryptids of old.

625
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But it's interesting to look at this one, because going forward, when we...

626
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 The world's not even close to being over.

627
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 We're going to be around for thousands and thousands of years after that.

628
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And so going forward, the cryptids that are great, great, great ancestors are afraid of,

629
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 are going to have these weird sci-fi twists.

630
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 They're not just going to be, "Oh no, Bigfoot's been around forever, and he's walking around the world."

631
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 This one was built in a lab, an affront to God, a genetically engineered creature,

632
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 just like you would see in a matinee for $2.

633
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 That's where these cryptids come from.

634
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And it'll be interesting because I think going forward as a society, we'll see more and more of these.

635
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 We don't get a lot of new cryptids.

636
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 So whenever we find one that's relatively new and interesting,

637
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I think it's cool because we can see how these stories evolve.

638
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Bigfoot evolved because Westerners were coming into uncharted wildernesses,

639
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and they were seeing something, and they created a legend of Bigfoot.

640
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 What type of cryptids are we going to have in the future?

641
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Holographic cryptids?

642
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 It's funny because if you think about it, AI, the story of these super advanced computer systems taken over the world,

643
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 is basically a cryptid.

644
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 It's basically a monster of our own making, but it's not hiding in the dark shadows of our bedroom,

645
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 it's hiding in our computer or in our internet.

646
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 These mythical monsters really say a lot about where we're at as a society.

647
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's not always about the long claws or the horns on the head or the giant body.

648
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Sometimes it's about what those things say to us.

649
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 A man turned into a beast, or a beast turned into a man in a sci-fi setting right outside your neighborhood.

650
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 I think no matter how far society evolves or where we end up going,

651
00:31:51,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 someday, a thousand years from now, kids on some generation starship flying far past Alpha Centauri

652
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 are going to be saying, "Don't go down into engineering. Don't go down there after 3 a.m."

653
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Why not?

654
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Because that's where the goreboard lives, and he'll get you.

655
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
