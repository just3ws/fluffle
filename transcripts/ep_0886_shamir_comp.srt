00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 When a young boy has memories of another place, you have to wonder is he a kidnapping victim

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,200
 or a child sent from another reality.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:21,960
 And then we travel back in time to the days of King Solomon where we will investigate a

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,600
 relic so powerful the forces of darkness can't even comprehend it.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,960
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,560
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun in this beautiful weather if you're listening to this

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,360
 episode as I'm recording it.

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,720
 Otherwise it might be the end of the world.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,280
 It might be the day after tomorrow and you're out running a cold storm.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,920
 But someone who could always outrun the temperature, give it up for our newest Patreon supporter

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,640
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
 It's Blitz Neo.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
 Wooo yeah!

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 Come on in Blitz Neo.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,160
 Come in to the door it's super cold out there.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,800
 People are like why do you keep referencing a movie that came out 10 years ago.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,360
 Blitz Neo you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,400
 Just help spread the word about the show.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
 That helps out so much.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,240
 Tell your friends, tell your family how much you love listening to.

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,600
 Blitz Neo I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys for the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,520
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:45,360
 We're driving all the way out to a pediatrician's office.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
 Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy's kicking up dust everywhere.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,200
 Blitz Neo's like why are we taking the Dune Buggy to this pediatrician's office.

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,440
 Well you will find out very soon Blitz Neo along with the rest of the listeners here.

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,640
 We're headed out to this pediatrician's office because we're gonna visit a young boy.

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,520
 He's only four years old.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,600
 That's a tiny little guy.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
 Four years old.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 We walk into this pediatrician's office and we see this young man.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,040
 He didn't post his name online.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,200
 We're gonna call him Maxwell.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,960
 We're sitting in this pediatrician's office reading these magazines playing with that weird

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
 wire thing.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,280
 Remember he used to take the wooden blocks.

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,160
 Just kinda push him up and down the wire.

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,720
 You wanna talk about some weird mind control MK Ultra toy.

44
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,440
 It was the point of that toy.

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,560
 It was in every doctor's waiting room.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,200
 They may still be in doctor's waiting rooms but you know what I'm talking about?

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,640
 The metal wire and they're like loopy and you move the toys around.

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
 No one ever owns those outside of a doctor's office.

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,000
 But Maxwell says that this happened quite a few times and he was four years old.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,680
 He said he'd go to the pediatrician's office with his mom.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,880
 And then he would walk down the hallways of a stereotypical doctor's office.

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,360
 We've all been into them.

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,760
 And this doctor's office actually opened up into a wide hanger like an aircraft hanger.

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,360
 And in this aircraft hanger is a table.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,000
 And a little medical table.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,200
 It's not like a card table.

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,960
 It's not like a folding card table.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,120
 He's brought to the table and he gets up on the little bench, the little leaning back

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,120
 medical bench thing, seat, whatever they call it.

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,480
 And he's sitting there and a doctor shows up and gives him an anesthesia.

61
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,760
 Now I don't think it was like a topical one.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,000
 I don't think they gave him like the shot in the arm to numb the arm or shot in the

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,120
 mouth to numb the mouth for dental pain.

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,000
 I think they actually put him under.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,760
 He doesn't specify but he says they gave him an anesthesia.

66
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
 So I think it was that general whole body anesthesia.

67
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,920
 And he said this happened quite a few times throughout his childhood.

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,280
 He remembers this happening all the time.

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,040
 And then one day when he shows up at the doctor's office, he walks through the totally normal

70
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,000
 doctor's office on the outside.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
 He walks down this hallway.

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,680
 He enters the aircraft hanger.

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,120
 He gets up on the table and the doctor tells him this time, Maxwell, this is the last time

74
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,640
 you're going to be visiting me.

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,400
 In fact, this is the last time you're ever going to see me.

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,800
 It's time for you to go.

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,880
 The anesthesia is administered and Maxwell blacks out.

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,840
 The next thing he remembers is sitting in his house.

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,960
 But it's not his house.

80
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,800
 His mom's there.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,120
 It's somebody's house.

82
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
 But not his.

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,640
 Not the house that he had lived in his entire life.

84
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,800
 He looks around and it's different.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,960
 Even at an early age, he can realize this is not the place he grew up in.

86
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,240
 But his mom's here and his mom is acting like this is their house.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,400
 And he asks his mom, "Hey, where am I?"

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,480
 And the mom goes, "You're home, honey.

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,520
 It's kind of a weird question.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
 You're home."

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,680
 Maxwell goes, "This isn't my home.

92
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,120
 Like, I used to live somewhere else."

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,200
 And the mom goes, "No, Maxwell.

94
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,640
 Unless you own your own home, unless you have a mortgage that I don't know about, this is

95
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
 the home you grew up in.

96
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,000
 This is the only house you've ever lived in.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,600
 This is our home."

98
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,720
 The mom just goes about her business.

99
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,200
 Maxwell's sitting there on the couch and he can't figure it out.

100
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,960
 This isn't my home.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,000
 Maxwell ends his post by saying, "The world has behaved differently ever since I last

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,040
 was in that aircraft hangar.

103
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,200
 Things aren't the same as I remember them."

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,400
 Now, he says, "I'm sure you guys think I'm trolling.

105
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,800
 I'm sure you guys think I'm making this up, but I have really no way to prove it to you.

106
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,200
 I am not from here."

107
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,720
 And obviously, people start asking questions about this.

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
 This is a really, really interesting story.

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,000
 People start asking questions about this and they go, "What do you mean how the world behaved

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 differently?"

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,480
 And he goes, "What I remember from being a little kid."

112
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,080
 He's not five when he's posting this.

113
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,120
 This was years ago.

114
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,280
 And this post is actually from the year 2012.

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,440
 He goes, "What I remember of the world was that there was a lot more dirt everywhere.

116
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,160
 Not a wasteland, not an apocalyptic landscape.

117
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
 There's just more dirt.

118
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,960
 I remember there being sand everywhere.

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,000
 The other thing that I noticed that's most obvious outside of all of the sand, cars looked

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
 different.

121
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,200
 They just seemed to be different styles.

122
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,960
 Like when I started looking around, I didn't recognize any of the makes and models of those

123
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,520
 vehicles.

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,040
 And those were the two biggest differences.

125
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,360
 The sand and vehicles appear differently from his memories as a young boy to the day that

126
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,760
 he was in this new house.

127
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,080
 This is a fascinating story.

128
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,960
 I really, really like this story.

129
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,400
 It could totally be made up, right?

130
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
 This is an anonymous post online.

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:31,240
 So what I find interesting is that we have two rational answers and two paranormal answers.

132
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,320
 One, we could easily see this.

133
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,040
 The rational answers is kidnapping, right?

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 His mom could have kidnapped him from another custodial parent or from another country or

135
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,360
 something like that.

136
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,560
 The kid could have been put under general anesthesia.

137
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,840
 I'm assuming the story itself is true.

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,320
 Like the framework to me, he's put under.

139
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,720
 So when his mom loads him up on the plane and flies him from Dubai to America, he's

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
 not freaking out the whole time.

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,240
 He's like, "No, no, I'm being kidnapped.

142
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 My dad's over there."

143
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,080
 That could be a possibility.

144
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,960
 And then his mom, I mean, that would be kind of a bold kidnapping thing where you're gas

145
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
 lighting the kidnapping victim.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,680
 You kidnap someone from their house, take him to your house and you're like, "What?

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
 No, you never lived there."

148
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,680
 And she's like, "I clearly have the keys to a different house.

149
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
 I'm trying my keys in the store.

150
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
 It's not working."

151
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,440
 Like that's a pretty bold kidnapping thing.

152
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,800
 But you know, you're for possibility.

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,560
 The other option is that this kid could have been an immigrant coming from a place that

154
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,360
 had a lot of sand, let's say somewhere in the Middle East or somewhere in Northern Africa.

155
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,560
 And he's coming over and it's such a culture shock to him.

156
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,800
 That's the only way he remembers it.

157
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
 Maybe the framework isn't correct.

158
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,800
 Maybe he wasn't walking in this large aircraft carrier.

159
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,040
 The human memory is faulty, right?

160
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,800
 And he could have been an immigrant from another country and he just has no other way to explain

161
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,280
 it other than this weird fantastical tale.

162
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,680
 Now both of those, like I said, are irrational.

163
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,840
 Obviously, you have to do some sort of bending, some sort of mental gymnastics.

164
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,760
 The cars in Saudi Arabia are the same cars in Detroit.

165
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,560
 But maybe they were just fancier over there in his neighborhood.

166
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,480
 Now he's over in America or wherever he went.

167
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,720
 I'm assuming he's in America, but that's just because I'm from America.

168
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,680
 He's like, oh man, look at all these beaters, look at all these pieces of junk driving around.

169
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,400
 But then we have the paranormal answers, which I just love as well.

170
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,440
 And I think this is probably what a lot of people who were reading this thought and maybe

171
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,680
 even you while you were listening to it.

172
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:43,720
 Time traveler being sent back in time to a world before the sand took over.

173
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,680
 He may say it wasn't an apocalyptic wasteland, but anywhere with sand everywhere, assuming

174
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,840
 again you're not in a sandy region of the world, that doesn't sound like the best.

175
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,160
 It's like a ton of fun.

176
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,840
 You're like, hey mom, I'm home.

177
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,520
 They canceled school because a sandstorm hit.

178
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,700
 It doesn't sound super comforting.

179
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,000
 So maybe he was sent back from the future to join us in a more comfortable time.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,280
 Also alternate realities is another one that you could really hang your hat on because

181
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,200
 of the changes of the vehicles.

182
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,240
 It's interesting because when we look at alternate realities, when we look at timeline changes,

183
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,040
 it's never, I remember, well some people, some people said they've had these events,

184
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,720
 but in general Mandela effect theory, it's not, that's weird.

185
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,280
 I remember Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama and we had four years of Mitt Romney and then

186
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,680
 Hillary Clinton was president.

187
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,000
 It's never these huge timeline shifts.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,960
 It's Bernstein Bears versus Bernstein Bears.

189
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,560
 The easiest changes in the timelines would be choices like that.

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:02,600
 For a huge shift, like who was elected president at what time, that would be so different.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,120
 That would be a parallel reality that wouldn't even be parallel to ours.

192
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,880
 It would veer off wildly in one direction.

193
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,120
 If Hillary Clinton had won instead of Donald Trump, if Abraham Lincoln had not been assassinated

194
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,880
 at the end of the Civil War, these are huge changes.

195
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,200
 They veer off so wildly.

196
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,680
 But whether or not when you have a bunch of eggheads at Ford and they go, "Hey, we're

197
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:36,440
 coming out with a Mustang and here are designs for this new 2022 Mustang convertible."

198
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,400
 And they have five designs and people choose one over the other.

199
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,520
 That's not impacting the world.

200
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,840
 That's just a different style of car.

201
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,760
 When you're looking at who do we cast in this movie?

202
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:53,160
 Do we cast Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds?

203
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,160
 That's not a massive change.

204
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,960
 So little things changing, plots in stories.

205
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,820
 It's not even being published in the first place, you're being published by a different

206
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,920
 author.

207
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,960
 Those are the little changes that would be a parallel universe.

208
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:21,480
 You'd still have Bush Obama, Trump Biden, but a couple cars were designed differently.

209
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,760
 Throughout the timeline, a couple different people got different jobs.

210
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,180
 It's not going to impact your day to day life, what style of car you're driving.

211
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,600
 So that tracks with the parallel universe theory.

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,480
 And that also tracks with what we know of the Mandela effect.

213
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,360
 The Mandela effect, a lot of it is people misremembering things.

214
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,480
 But some of them, Berenstein Bears for example, I know for a fact, was called the Berenstein

215
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,000
 Bears.

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,580
 So he could have come from an alternate reality, he could have been sent over here, which would

217
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,280
 be an interesting trick of the Mandela effect of parallel universes because from what we've

218
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,000
 seen people slide in and out of them accidentally.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,880
 The kind of the going theory of Mandela effect is there was some sort of huge disaster around

220
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
 2001.

221
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,700
 Outside of September 11th, something bad happened.

222
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,140
 Millions of people were sent over to this new reality where there's been slight changes

223
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,280
 in the timeline.

224
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,920
 That's kind of how the Mandela effect started.

225
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,280
 That was the initial theory of what happened.

226
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,360
 But the idea of purposely sending people over to different timelines, that's very intriguing.

227
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,100
 That's a fairly new theory.

228
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,680
 People being sent here from somewhere else.

229
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,880
 Which begs the question if the technology exists to slide into a parallel universe, don't

230
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,320
 steal my idea for television series, have five seasons mapped out.

231
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,200
 If you have people sliding from one parallel universe to the other, if this technology

232
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,920
 exists in other universes, would that mean it's possible, because the variations would

233
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,680
 be very slight between universes, is it possible that that technology exists today?

234
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:06,420
 Could you purposely, not accidentally, could you purposely send people to alternate realities?

235
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,340
 Very very interesting story.

236
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,740
 If this story is true, super fascinating.

237
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,940
 A young boy finding himself in a different house and seeing all these differences and

238
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,820
 he has these faint memories of this old childhood.

239
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,460
 It could also have been a series of dreams, right?

240
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,980
 He could have had a baby stroke.

241
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,860
 He could have messed up his brain.

242
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,360
 But that was a very depressing theory, but that's possible as well.

243
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,960
 But are people not accidentally coming into our universe?

244
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,440
 Are people being sent over here on purpose?

245
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,520
 And for what reason?

246
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 Who knows?

247
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,580
 Is it possible that we are the best timeline?

248
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,280
 That is chaotic?

249
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,640
 As things seem?

250
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,240
 This is the best timeline out of all possible timelines.

251
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,620
 So people are coming here, but we're not sending people to other timelines.

252
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,780
 Fascinating story.

253
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,300
 And we'll never know the truth until we find ourselves standing in a house that's not our

254
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,660
 own and there's sand everywhere.

255
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,620
 You're like, "Ding it, I just cleaned up my house and my own reality.

256
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,100
 Now I'm in this dirty reality.

257
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
 This sucks."

258
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
 Blitz, Neo.

259
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,380
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

260
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,340
 We're leaving behind this sandy reality.

261
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,860
 We gotta kick all the dust out of the carbonar copter.

262
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,480
 We are leaving behind this alternate world.

263
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,520
 We are headed all the way out to Bible time.

264
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,920
 So you didn't know that was a place?

265
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
 You can find it on a map.

266
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,680
 Specifically, obviously when I say Bible times, we're headed out to ancient Israel.

267
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
 This is nuts.

268
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,640
 This is one of those stories that I came across and there's so many questions that you can

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
 ask about this.

270
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,200
 There's two in particular we have to focus on.

271
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,360
 Otherwise, this episode is going to be three hours long.

272
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:59,740
 But recently I came across this thing called Solomon's Chomere.

273
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,940
 Never ever heard about this thing before.

274
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,780
 Absolutely fascinating religious object.

275
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,420
 This thing should be as popular as the Ark of the Covenant.

276
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,660
 This thing, I think, on a Jones should have chased this thing.

277
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,100
 We're back in 900 BC.

278
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,560
 We're back in this era of time, which seems incredibly recent if you think about how long

279
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
 history has been.

280
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,720
 Humans have been around, civilized humans have been around for like 10,000 years.

281
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,640
 Empires rose and fell and were wiped out of the history books by the time we're at King

282
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,080
 David in Israel.

283
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,760
 This is all in the Old Testament.

284
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,080
 You have Lil David before he's king.

285
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 He kills Goliath with his sling.

286
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,700
 He unites the 12 tribes of Israel.

287
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
 He conquers Jerusalem.

288
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:58,780
 He brings the Ark of the Covenant, that holy relic, into the city.

289
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,660
 And he said, "I want to build a temple to house the Ark of the Covenant."

290
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,780
 The Ark of the Covenant is basically a biblical super weapon.

291
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,260
 You would, oh, I mean, it's like right out of the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark.

292
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,620
 Okay, I know Raiders of the Lost Ark was based on the biblical story.

293
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,240
 But it's insane.

294
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,960
 It was this box that had to be carried by four people.

295
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,120
 It had to have all this special lining on it.

296
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,040
 If you opened it up, your face melted, you would open it up and it would devastate cities.

297
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:37,440
 And this was a wonder created by God and given to the Israelites to use against their enemies.

298
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760
 We've covered it a lot on the show.

299
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,960
 I'll find all the cool episodes.

300
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,360
 I'll put them in the show notes.

301
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,080
 The wars are done at this point.

302
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,380
 King David has united all 12 tribes of Israel there in Jerusalem.

303
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,620
 And he goes, "I want to build a temple for this Ark of the Covenant.

304
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,740
 And I want to build it in Jerusalem and I want to have it available for all Jewish people.

305
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,220
 All of these tribes that have been separated, this will be a home for us all.

306
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,980
 This will be the Holy of Holies.

307
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,180
 And in this temple, I want to build a windowless sanctuary where God can visit.

308
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:21,000
 God can come down from heaven to earth and rest.

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,360
 Just chill out for a while.

310
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,760
 He's given us so much.

311
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,800
 We are going to give him this windowless room.

312
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 God says, "Nope.

313
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,880
 Not because I don't want to be in a windowless room.

314
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,120
 I really like your idea of the temple."

315
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,480
 But King David, you have spilled so much blood.

316
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,820
 These wars that I commanded you to do, they're good.

317
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
 You won.

318
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,780
 But you killed too many people.

319
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,500
 You cannot build my temple.

320
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,140
 And that's when we meet Solomon, King David's son.

321
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,020
 Now Solomon eventually becomes King himself and he is allowed to build the temple.

322
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,340
 And King Solomon is a super interesting character because what happens is to build the temple,

323
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:15,120
 he gets a magic ring called the Seal of Solomon.

324
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,800
 This is actually where the Jewish star of David, that symbol that is on the Israeli flag

325
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,120
 and that symbol that is sacred to so many Jewish people around the world, it comes from

326
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,160
 King Solomon's ring.

327
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,200
 This ring, this magical ring is where that symbol is from.

328
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,360
 That's why it is given so much importance.

329
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,720
 This was the ring that King Solomon wore.

330
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:46,080
 And this ring was engraved by God and it gave King Solomon power over demons.

331
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 He goes, "You know what?

332
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,580
 I could build this temple.

333
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,420
 I could have all these people do this stuff, but I'm going to let my Jewish brothers and

334
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,960
 sisters rest on this one.

335
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,960
 I'm going to use this ring to control demons.

336
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,940
 I'm going to call them forth from hell and put them to work.

337
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,480
 I'm going to make them build this temple."

338
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
 And that's what he did.

339
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,560
 He used this ring to call forth these demons and they fell under his control.

340
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,760
 Could you imagine if someone got ahold of that ring today?

341
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,200
 What you would be capable of?

342
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,840
 Hopefully something good.

343
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,400
 Hopefully just building buildings.

344
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,200
 But we're here specifically to look at Solomon's Shamir.

345
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,660
 I've always heard about the stories about the seal of Solomon, the ring, him able to

346
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,660
 control demons.

347
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,100
 I was very familiar with that stuff.

348
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,620
 I've never heard of this before.

349
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,020
 Solomon Shamir is considered one of the ten wonders that God created on the sixth day

350
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 of creation.

351
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,980
 He created these ten things to give to man.

352
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,680
 One of them is a donkey that talks.

353
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,220
 One of them in the Bible, there's a story about a donkey talking and people go, "Well,

354
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,220
 that's impossible.

355
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,940
 This donkey is giving people advice."

356
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,340
 God created that donkey on the sixth day.

357
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,020
 That's one of the ten wonders of God.

358
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:13,080
 One of them, this is so fascinating to me, one of them is a pair of tongs.

359
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,460
 A pair of metal tongs.

360
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,180
 Now all of this stuff has come, I have never seen any of this stuff in the Bible, but a

361
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:28,020
 lot of this stuff came from rabbis and theologians and philosophers as they're interpreting biblical

362
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,180
 works and the Talmud and the Koran.

363
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,860
 As they're looking through all of this stuff, they go, "God must have created the tongs,

364
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:44,900
 the metal tongs that you use to put stuff into a furnace because you cannot create metal

365
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:51,420
 tongs unless you have a pair of metal tongs.

366
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:58,660
 You could not hold the metal over the heat for long enough to be able to forge metal

367
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,740
 unless you already had forged metal to forge this new metal."

368
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,060
 So the belief is so fascinating, the belief that the very first pair of tongs, of metal

369
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:16,380
 tongs to be able to do metalworking, was created on the sixth day by God.

370
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,460
 But again, Solomon's Shamir.

371
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,980
 This Shamir is, in a nutshell, there's a lot of debate over what this is.

372
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,380
 Apparently it was a worm.

373
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:31,020
 There's a lot of references in the text calling it a worm, so a lot of people believe this

374
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,540
 was some sort of living creature.

375
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:40,780
 It was a worm that had the ability to cut gems and diamonds.

376
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:48,300
 You could use this Shamir to basically etch into any surface imaginable.

377
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,580
 According to Talmud, it says, "The Shamir was, without doubt, an extraordinary object

378
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:05,020
 as it possessed the ability to alter stone, iron, and diamond by its mere gaze."

379
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,020
 So again, we're talking about something that a lot of people believe was alive because

380
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,460
 they keep calling it a worm and they keep talking about it being able to see something.

381
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,300
 Now we call it Solomon's Shamir, but it actually originally belonged to Moses.

382
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,260
 So we're going back to like 1300, 1400 BC.

383
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,960
 And Moses got ahold of the Shamir and used it to create the breastplates for the high

384
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,460
 priests of the Israelites.

385
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:40,740
 He'd used the Shamir and it would basically carve in these symbols and sigils and holy

386
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,860
 icons into this metal breastplate.

387
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,980
 Apparently very ornate designs.

388
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,500
 But this thing's dangerous.

389
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,380
 While Moses was using it, it almost scalded him.

390
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:00,060
 He's lucky because a couple people got killed by this thing.

391
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:04,340
 Moses has it in, say, 1300, 1400 BC.

392
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,860
 And when King Solomon is having his temple built, he's watching all these demons build

393
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,540
 stuff, but he's like, "You know, I want stuff to be a little more elaborate.

394
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,460
 I want that Shamir I've heard about."

395
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,620
 King Solomon goes, "I know that Moses used to have this thing called the Shamir.

396
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,780
 I want it."

397
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,260
 And what he does is apparently, there's different versions of this story.

398
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:36,340
 Apparently he contacted the demon, Asmodeus, and demanded that he give him the Shamir.

399
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,020
 Because he has the seal of Solomon.

400
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,380
 Asmodeus, who at some point must have gotten possession of the Shamir, gave it to King

401
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
 Solomon.

402
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,260
 But when King Solomon gets it, it's the size of a barley corn.

403
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,500
 Which I'm assuming is pretty small.

404
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,620
 I don't know if in Israel they grew these giant pieces of corn called barley corn.

405
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,660
 It was this tiny little piece.

406
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,820
 Because when you use the Shamir, it actually reduced in size.

407
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,820
 He takes it.

408
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,740
 He takes it and the little guys will just want it.

409
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
 That'd be bigger.

410
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,260
 And he wanted to use this to do very special carvings in the temple.

411
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,700
 Because he was told, remember his dad wasn't even able to build it because he spilled too

412
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
 much blood.

413
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,980
 He was told that you couldn't have any bloodshed during the building of the temple.

414
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:34,660
 So if you were hammering something or sawing something and you accidentally slit your finger,

415
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,500
 you pretty much had to demolish the place.

416
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,180
 You couldn't spill any blood.

417
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:45,280
 So using the Shamir, they were cutting very intricate cuts into the building blocks.

418
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,420
 Some people say that whole pieces of stone were just set in place.

419
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,180
 And then the Shamir was used to carve it into a usable structure.

420
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,220
 Because a lot of people have debated over what was actually going on.

421
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,060
 But we look at the Shamir being used by King Solomon or King Solomon's people.

422
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,340
 Because this thing was super dangerous.

423
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,100
 Just like the Ark, it had very special precautions.

424
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:15,060
 When it wasn't being used, you needed to wrap it in wool and bran.

425
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,220
 Not bran flakes, but what bran flakes are made out of.

426
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,700
 Some sort of barley.

427
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,100
 And then put into a lead box.

428
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,220
 If you did not do that, any other box would blow up.

429
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,260
 Any other box would totally blow up.

430
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
 And I don't know how they figured that out.

431
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,740
 Maybe he commanded a demon to tell him.

432
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,220
 He was probably putting it in wooden crates and metal boxes and stuff like that.

433
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,140
 He's like, "You know, I'm really trying to get some sleep."

434
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,740
 And everything keeps blowing up.

435
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,620
 You had to wrap it in wool and bran, put it in a lead box.

436
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,140
 And it was used to craft the temple.

437
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,900
 And a couple people got melted by this thing.

438
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,380
 A couple people got disintegrated by the Shamir.

439
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,940
 It's interesting because nowadays there's been ancient alien theorists say that it may

440
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,420
 have been some sort of laser.

441
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:00,580
 It may have been some sort of laser beam that was able to etch into metal and diamonds

442
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,940
 and into the temple stone.

443
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,420
 But if theologians go, it probably was a space laser.

444
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,500
 It probably was a miracle from God.

445
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,620
 And it may have been alive.

446
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,660
 Because in the text, it's constantly referred to as a worm.

447
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,780
 When you look at the Talmud, when you look at the Koran, which also mentions the Shamir.

448
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,940
 As far as we know, it doesn't exist anymore.

449
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,940
 And again, theologians debate over this.

450
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,980
 Some people believe that it was just used up.

451
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,100
 That it kept getting smaller and smaller because each time you use it, it gets a little bit

452
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
 smaller.

453
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,740
 It was just used up and just disappeared.

454
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,860
 The Talmud specifically says, "When the temple was destroyed," meaning the first temple in

455
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,500
 Jerusalem that was destroyed, the Shamir vanished.

456
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,220
 So it was linked to the temple that it was used on.

457
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,100
 And that's why it's more closely connected to Solomon.

458
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,420
 He was the guy who created this giant house for God.

459
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,540
 And he was the last person to use it, Solomon's Shamir.

460
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,740
 So that's just super fascinating, right?

461
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:11,500
 We have, at the very least, I don't know which one's very least, but you have possible alien

462
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,220
 technology in the hands of humans.

463
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,460
 That's the only way you could think of this thing in any sort of rational way, that it

464
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,980
 was some sort of alien technology, that it was a laser beam that was used to cut into

465
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,940
 metal and stone and engrave.

466
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,540
 King Solomon also used this to make mystical sigils on precious gems.

467
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,940
 And he would hand these out to people.

468
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,180
 He would have just walked through the crowd and hand them out, but he would hand them out

469
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,540
 to people who had earned them.

470
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:48,260
 These, could you, here's the thing, if the Shamir doesn't exist anymore, the gems do.

471
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,780
 His ring does.

472
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,780
 Where are these things?

473
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,620
 I said, could you imagine getting your hands on that ring?

474
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,580
 That's a high level object.

475
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:08,100
 Imagine if you just had an emerald the size of the palm of your hand and in it is a magical

476
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,900
 sigil crafted by King Solomon himself using one of the ten wonders that God created on

477
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,140
 the sixth day of creation.

478
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,780
 The power that would exist in that stone is mind boggling.

479
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,100
 They're still out there.

480
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,380
 They're either in someone's private collection, they're in some government's vault, or they're

481
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:42,140
 lost somewhere in the Middle East, or maybe the Crusaders took them and they lost them.

482
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
 But they're somewhere.

483
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:50,020
 The Shamir wore down over time, but emerald the size of the palm of your hand is going

484
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,180
 to last a while.

485
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,540
 Going back to the two options, we have the sci-fi laser, but then we just have the other

486
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:02,180
 option that this really was one of the ten wonders God created and that mankind had for

487
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:10,540
 a moment in time had this wondrous object that let them do things that were impossible.

488
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,700
 Things that we now need tons of technology to do, they have this little worm.

489
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,220
 Fascinating in and of itself, but then let's look at the Quran to wrap this story up because

490
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,020
 it gets even weirder when we take a look at this story.

491
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,140
 This episode is going to go long, I can't help it.

492
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,060
 This is so fascinating to me.

493
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:35,220
 In the Quran, it states that it wasn't demons that built the temple in Jerusalem, it was

494
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,500
 the jinn.

495
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,540
 And there's a lot of, sometimes the jinn and the demons are two separate entities, sometimes

496
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,900
 the term is used interchangeably.

497
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:54,100
 But in this version of the story, the jinn, not demons, are the ones who created the temple.

498
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,860
 Under King Solomon's command.

499
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,140
 This is insane.

500
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:03,340
 So King Solomon has the ring, he's commanding the jinn to build the temple and he watches

501
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,540
 over them as they're building this temple.

502
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,220
 And King Solomon has his staff and he's just kind of standing there watching them labor

503
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,380
 bringing these rocks over.

504
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,060
 They're like, the jinn are working and they look over and King Solomon's just watching

505
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
 them.

506
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
 Oh man, that guy's such a jerk.

507
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,060
 I can't believe he enslaved us.

508
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,340
 They keep building the temple, they look over and King Solomon's standing there watching

509
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,100
 them, demons going about their work and they're building the temple and they look over and

510
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,020
 King Solomon is standing there watching them, just standing there with his staff.

511
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,580
 And this goes on for about a year or so.

512
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:42,020
 And then the jinn who had been building the temple under his command didn't know that

513
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,220
 at some point while they were building the temple, he died.

514
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,140
 King Solomon died and he was actually leaning against his staff.

515
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:53,540
 He was dead for a year just standing there and the jinn could have left the day he died,

516
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,020
 but they thought he was still in command so they continued to build it.

517
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,860
 And the Shamir ate through the bottom of the staff and King Solomon collapsed and that's

518
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,980
 when they realized he was dead.

519
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,740
 This completely boggled the jinn's minds.

520
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,900
 They had no idea what was going on, not that they had been hoodwinked and doing a year's

521
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,540
 worth of work.

522
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:21,580
 What it turns out, this is so insane, has huge implications for the world of the paranormal.

523
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,700
 What it turns out is when the jinn walked up and they saw that King Solomon was dead and

524
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:32,660
 they saw that Shamir kind of crawling around on the ground, they didn't know what it was.

525
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,300
 They had no idea what they were looking at and here's why.

526
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,900
 According to the Quran, the jinn or demons extrapolated out to demons because we know

527
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,100
 that he had power over these creatures, whether or not you're using the term jinn in this

528
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:52,740
 context or demons, these are one and the same in this context.

529
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:00,740
 These creatures from hell under King Solomon's magical command using his ring, they did

530
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,580
 not know what magic was.

531
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,900
 They looked at this little worm just walking around on the ground next to this dead body

532
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,540
 and they go, "What in the world is that?"

533
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:19,100
 Because according to the Quran, this is fascinating, only God knows the secrets of the occult.

534
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,860
 Only God knows the secrets of magic.

535
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,020
 So to the demons watching this, they're like, "When in the world is that?"

536
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,020
 "I've never seen anything like that."

537
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,220
 Because they don't know anything about magic or magical relics or anything.

538
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
 Fascinating.

539
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,980
 And you're going, "Jason, but wait, no, no, no, no, no.

540
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,580
 He's using a magical ring.

541
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,380
 He has these magical sigils.

542
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:48,540
 People call demons up today using these magical rituals."

543
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,500
 This could very well be true.

544
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,140
 Demons, jinn, whatever you want to call them, may not know magic.

545
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,060
 And you go, "Jason, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just,
