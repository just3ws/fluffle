1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
 Quite possibly the worst way to kill yourself.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,720
 And then we take a look at some intriguing stories of near-death experiences.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,840
 But for these people, there is no tunnel of light or loved ones waving at them, no.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,360
 These people, when they died, went to hell.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,600
 You want to know what's funny?

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,520
 You guys know how sick I was the other day when I was recording that episode.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,600
 Well, I was really sick, but a friend of mine had invited me to do something I had never

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 done before.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,160
 And I was sick, and I was having that heart trouble.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,680
 When I did it, I went to a martial arts studio and took a little bit of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,280
 I spent a training session there, rolled around on the ground, trained on how to get up, and

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 I'm going to enroll.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
 I'm going to enroll and I'm going to do some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,800
 Basically, I'm confirming my transformation into Joe Rogan at this point.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,560
 And the reason why I'm sharing this with you, because I may do it for a month and I may

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,640
 just not be for me.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,760
 I'm super sore already, but I really want to do something even more active.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,280
 I already lift weights and I walk, but I want to do something more to lose weight.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
 Lifting weights is just for strength for me.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
 Do something, guys.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,320
 I get any emails from a lot of you guys, and I know that a lot of you guys are just like

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 me.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
 We got to do stuff.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,520
 We got to do stuff.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,720
 Get out of that rut.

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,600
 If you feel like things aren't working out for you, if you feel things are just kind of,

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
 you're just threading through life.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,800
 I don't know if that's even an analogy, but if you feel like you're just kind of doing

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,560
 the paces through life, do something different.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,320
 Do something that you never would have done before, because that got me as sick as I was

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,400
 down to this martial arts studio where I met a bunch of people that I never would have

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
 met otherwise.

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
 I rolled around on the floor.

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,000
 I learned a bunch of stuff, just technique.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,280
 I didn't actually wrestle anybody that day because I wasn't feeling good, but it was

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,080
 a great start to maybe something again I do for a month and then go, "It's not for me.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,560
 It's too much for my body," or maybe something that I do for a year or two years.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,880
 Who knows?

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,600
 But just do stuff.

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
 Just do stuff.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,160
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story here, guys.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
 Join me on this trip to Bolivia here.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
 Grab my hand.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,000
 Grab my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu infused strength hand.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
 Dude, my abs hurts.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,680
 I know I have abs underneath all of the flab, but they hurt.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,360
 I can't see them and they hurt so bad because they were training me on how to fall down.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,000
 You got to be able to get up quickly.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,640
 You got to be able to spin around on your stomach.

55
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
 Not on your stomach.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,640
 Spin around on your back.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
 Do all sorts of stuff.

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
 But first, you got to learn how to not get knocked unconscious when you get knocked down.

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,280
 That was pretty much the whole night was me learning how to fall and get back up.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
 My abs are killing me.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
 Where was I going?

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,280
 Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
 So we're going to Bolivia.

64
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,760
 We're going to Bolivia.

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
 Hold my hand.

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,280
 You're like, "Jason, your grip is so strong."

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
 You've only been training for one day.

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,520
 I was like, "I know, but I can't control my strength anymore."

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,560
 I lift you up to, "Why are we holding hands?"

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,000
 It's not like you were hanging out of the helicopter.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
 I'm just patting you on the back now.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
 You're like, "Oh, you're leaving bruises, Jason.

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
 You're so strong."

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,880
 We get in the helicopter.

75
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
 We're flying away to Bolivia.

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,280
 We're going back to the year 2011.

77
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,640
 This is the month of November near the town of Rosario del Yachta.

78
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,560
 There's this little canoe, this little boat going down the river.

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
 In the canoe is an...

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,360
 Oh, totally forgot.

81
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
 Actually, sorry.

82
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,520
 I totally forgot we have a new Patreon subscriber.

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,600
 This is a dope name, Narlos.

84
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 Narlos.

85
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,040
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,440
 Really, really appreciate it.

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,680
 I appreciate it so much that this unnamed kid in this canoe is now named Narlos.

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,680
 This is a true story.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,600
 Narlos did not actually do this, but in real life, there was an unnamed 18-year-old boy

90
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,080
 in a canoe going down the river.

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,680
 Narlos is sitting there and we're like, "Hey, Narlos, you're not going to do anything stupid.

92
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
 Are you?"

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
 He's like, "Oh, he's super sad."

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
 We're like, "Oh, no.

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,480
 Why did you donate this episode?"

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 He's like, "Oh, no.

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 I'm so sad."

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,440
 And he jumps out of the boat and he splashes around in the water.

99
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,320
 So you're looking at me and you're like, "Are we going to throw a ladder off, like throw

100
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,200
 a ladder out of the Carverner Coptor to save him?"

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,840
 And I'm like, "Well, I'd want to because I enjoy that he supports the show, but then

102
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
 we will interfere with the timeline."

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
 And Narlos is like, "No, interfere with the timeline.

104
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,000
 Interfer the timeline because what happened in real life is a young man was on a rowboat."

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,480
 And he jumps off.

106
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,080
 From what people can gather, he didn't fall off, he wasn't pushed off, he jumped off into

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
 the water.

108
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
 And you're thinking, "Okay, so he jumped into the water to go swimming."

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
 But you said this was like a suicide story, so I'm guessing he jumped into the water to

110
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 drown.

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,480
 He jumped into the water to be eaten to death by piranhas.

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,240
 And this is why they think it's suicide.

113
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,600
 Because everyone knows that this river is infested with piranhas, especially this area.

114
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,880
 Like this kid had been fishing here his whole life.

115
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,040
 So he jumped into the water and immediately piranhas attack him.

116
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,080
 Now that's horrifying.

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
 That might be the worst way to kill yourself.

118
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,880
 I think people who kill themselves like anything involving animals I think is really rough.

119
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,840
 Jumping into a zoo, letting alligators eat you, you know, poking snakes with big old sticks,

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,520
 laughing at monkeys, any of that stuff.

121
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:06,360
 You're basically asking for a brutal death designed by evolution to be vicious.

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
 So he jumps into the water and starts getting eaten by fish.

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,000
 Now almost immediately he regrets this and he gets rescued, but I guess that's a misnomer.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,840
 He doesn't get rescued, his body gets recovered.

125
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,420
 He's still alive and they throw him on a boat and he bleeds the death.

126
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,760
 So what I found out actually was a lot of piranha stuff.

127
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,000
 I found some piranha facts, I'll go over them very briefly.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,440
 Because people know the basic ones.

129
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,680
 They eat the flesh off your bones.

130
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,320
 And then they're a little tight.

131
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,160
 I guess I should start with what they are in case you're like, "What's a piranha?

132
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,840
 I'm from an alien planet."

133
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,440
 A piranha is a little fish dude who goes from like 5 to 15 inches.

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,160
 So pretty big, pretty big fish.

135
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,420
 And they swim in packs and they basically eat your flesh off your bones.

136
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,400
 Your flesh and your muscles and all that stuff.

137
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,200
 So those cartoons are like Bugs Bunny that like stands in the river and then he's like

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 "Ah!"

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,740
 And then I don't know what that actually happened in a Bugs Bunny cartoon.

140
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,300
 But you know cartoons are characters go in the water and then they walk out of the water

141
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,820
 and there's just bones for legs.

142
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,780
 It's a sight gag.

143
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,080
 Basically it's piranhas eating all the flesh and the meat off of them.

144
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 But I didn't know this.

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,220
 So that's basic piranha stuff.

146
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
 Everyone should know this.

147
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,220
 I didn't know this.

148
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,020
 One, they go for the face.

149
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,040
 So what happens is cows and stuff when they're like drinking from the river.

150
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,980
 Walking up to the river taking a big drink, jaguars.

151
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
 Do snakes drink water?

152
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,880
 Like snakes have to drink water.

153
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,760
 How do they drink water?

154
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,380
 Do they do like a cat and stick their tongue in and take little droplets of water?

155
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,380
 That seems inefficient.

156
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,600
 It seems inefficient for cats too.

157
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,220
 Do they gulp water down?

158
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,540
 Every living thing, I believe I'm on other than like those weirdo gross microorganisms

159
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,120
 that live in volcanoes, everything needs water.

160
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,020
 How does a snake drink?

161
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,100
 Like an anaconda up in a tree.

162
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,020
 Does it lift its head up when it rains?

163
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,540
 Does it absorb, actually this might be it.

164
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,060
 I wonder if it absorbs water through its skin.

165
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,020
 Now I know they're not plants.

166
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,820
 I know that they just because they look like a plant and they're green and they're long

167
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
 does not mean they are plants.

168
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,200
 But how, I don't know how to snake drinks water.

169
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,420
 That really has nothing to do with the story, but I do know that parrots eat snakes.

170
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
 Parrots eat jaguars.

171
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
 Parrots eat cows.

172
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,900
 Anything in the water.

173
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,260
 And what happens is when people are drinking, well not necessarily people, but when animals

174
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,380
 are drinking out of the water, the fish will attack their face first and then the creature

175
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,140
 will be like, "Waaaaaah, waaaaaah."

176
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,340
 And then fall in the water and the fish will finish them off.

177
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,900
 So that's pretty gross.

178
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,020
 They go straight for the eyeballs.

179
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,100
 They go straight for the eyeballs to eat you up.

180
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,960
 Now I imagine if I started, if someone started biting me on the face, I think I would back

181
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 up.

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,680
 I don't think I'd be like, "Oh, I don't think I would fall towards their mouths."

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,080
 So if I was drinking out of the river, if I was on all fours drinking out of the river

184
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,640
 and a fish bit me, I would not then go, "Oh no."

185
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
 And then jump into the river.

186
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
 I don't understand.

187
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
 Like, I know cows are stupid, but they're not that stupid.

188
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,000
 But apparently like getting bit on the face, I guess having a 15 inch fish, like 10 of them

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,980
 on your face may make you tumble forward.

190
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,120
 But again, I just don't see the logic in it.

191
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,220
 But apparently regardless of whether or not I see the logic in it, it works.

192
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,500
 These creatures have evolved over millions of years to do this.

193
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,900
 I'm like, "Tutting nature."

194
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,460
 Like, "Oh, that doesn't make sense."

195
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:39,340
 The other thing is that I found out about piranhas is not only do they go for your face, they're

196
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,320
 one of the very few fish, fishes.

197
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,720
 If not the only, there definitely might be another one out there, but they're one of

198
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,080
 the only few fish that make noise.

199
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,280
 They scream while they are eating you.

200
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,120
 They let off this little sonic-like chirp thing that you can hear, you can actively hear

201
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
 as they're attacking you.

202
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,960
 So while you're underwater and they're eating your face and you're trying to scream but

203
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,560
 you're getting mouthfuls of gross river water, or maybe crystal blue river water, I don't

204
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 know.

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,160
 They're biting, because they take little bites, bite off just a piece of your nostril and

206
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,200
 another one takes a bite like right of your iris.

207
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,840
 You're like, "Oh no, I need that.

208
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
 See."

209
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,880
 And then it swims into your eyeball and it starts eating like the inside of your brain.

210
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,560
 While they're doing all of that stuff, you hear them going, "He he he he he he he he

211
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 he he."

212
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,200
 I don't know if that's the exact noise they make, but whatever it is, it's still terrifying

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,400
 that a fish is screaming at you while it's eating your face off.

214
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,160
 And most people don't die from being eaten, they die from bleeding to death.

215
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,640
 So it's a very, very slow death.

216
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,480
 So this poor dude, aka Narlos, sorry that you decided to go this way.

217
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,840
 I'm curious why they think it was a suicide though, like why they didn't think he just

218
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,080
 jumped out of the boat, which makes me think there's some witnesses to it, but this was

219
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,760
 reported in the actual newspaper.

220
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,760
 Let me back up.

221
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,400
 This was reported in the daily mail, which is kind of tabloid-ish over in the UK.

222
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,880
 But that is a creepy way to go.

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
 Now we're going to rescue Narlos, he's just a skeleton sitting in the back of the Carbenter

224
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,240
 copter for the rest of the episode.

225
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,160
 We are flying to a hospital.

226
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,240
 A hospital in any town, USA.

227
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,040
 We land on their helipad on the roof and we're getting out and there's these ambulance helicopters

228
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
 flying around.

229
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,640
 They're like, "Move it, move it, we got these heart transplants."

230
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
 They're like, "What?

231
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,720
 We can't hear you."

232
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,440
 They're throwing hearts at us.

233
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,040
 They're throwing donated hearts at us.

234
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,560
 We go, now we go into the hospital.

235
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
 We're inside the hospital.

236
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,960
 Now this story was inspired by Krispy Bacon.

237
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,640
 Actually, he's also a Patreon subscriber.

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,640
 This episode I was going to do a couple episodes back, but because I almost died, and I didn't

239
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,320
 almost die, but because I had that heart thing and it was just weird and I had to sit in

240
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,920
 a hospital for a long time, I didn't want to do this episode then.

241
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,080
 But we're doing it now.

242
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
 We're doing it.

243
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 So, we're in this hospital.

244
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,240
 Now, we're going to walk around and we're going to go to a doctor.

245
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,640
 He's sitting there, he's filling stuff out and we're like, "Hey, sir, we want to talk

246
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,640
 to you about near-death experiences."

247
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,000
 He turns around and he's like, "That is perfect because most of my patients almost die all

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 the time.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,320
 I'm actually the best doctor if you want to talk about people who die and then come

250
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,520
 back to life.

251
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
 Let's go to my office."

252
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,880
 We're like, "Oh, okay, that's great."

253
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,320
 This is what we learn about near-death experiences.

254
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,440
 And I guess I actually should start with what the common thing is about near-death experiences.

255
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,400
 Near-death experience is where somebody dies and comes back to life.

256
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:51,680
 Now, normally, almost all the time actually, they report a tunnel of light or loved ones

257
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,920
 showing up and gently easing them over to the other side.

258
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,560
 That's a very, very typical near-death experience story.

259
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,040
 I got hit by a car.

260
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,280
 The next thing I know, my great uncle who died 10 years ago, who I really, really loved

261
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,840
 was standing there along with some other people that I didn't recognize.

262
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,080
 And they said, "It's not your time to come."

263
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,480
 And it was this beautiful, peaceful place.

264
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,600
 And then I woke up, I was in the hospital room, and when I told my mom about it, she

265
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,920
 said, "Oh, those people you described, that was my brother who died before you were born."

266
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,800
 I made that story up, but that is very, that you couldn't tell it was made up.

267
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,440
 That's very typical of a near-death experience story.

268
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,920
 But not all of them are good.

269
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,440
 They've done tons of studies on near-death experiences because they happen quite a lot.

270
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
 It's not rare.

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,200
 And it's something that the scientific community, the medical community is interested in finding

272
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
 out.

273
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:59,000
 Ghosts and Bigfoot are, for the most part, considered wacky beliefs that science doesn't

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 really take seriously.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,440
 UFOs would be relegated to that, except for the fact that governments want to know what's

276
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,400
 in their airspace.

277
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,520
 Governments do not care what's in their forest because they know there's not a Bigfoot there

278
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,400
 or a giant monster running around or a mothman.

279
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,840
 And a government agency knows that, for the most part.

280
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,720
 Now when you have a UFO flying around, you want to know what it is.

281
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,880
 Either you want to know that it's totally fake and it's something somebody saw because

282
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,160
 they drink too much moonshine or it is swamp gas or Venus is unusually bright or somebody

283
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,960
 is flying an object in your airspace, you've got to figure out what it is.

284
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,040
 But Pentagon doesn't have a ghost division.

285
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,320
 They don't really care about that.

286
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,040
 What people think about ghosts.

287
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,640
 Like Mary, Queen of Scots is really flowing around downtown 7-Eleven.

288
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,520
 But because near-death experiences happen all the time, the medical community wants to

289
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
 know what they are.

290
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,400
 Now generally, the consensus is that when you die, your body is releasing a bunch of, I'm

291
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,680
 going to use the wrong word here, but basically like chemicals, drugs, whatever you want to

292
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,600
 call it, DMT, whatever.

293
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,840
 It's flooding your brain with this stuff to make the process of dying more peaceful or

294
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,960
 basically to calm you down in your last moments and that chemical rush is what we're seeing

295
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,480
 and that's why there's numerous things like the tunnel of light that carry over.

296
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,440
 Now people who argue that the near-death experience is actually something real go, well then how

297
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
 did I see my uncle show up, blah blah blah blah blah.

298
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,840
 And it's just back and forth thing.

299
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,040
 There's some people who believe that it's 100% a legit crossing over, you're seeing the other

300
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,120
 side.

301
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
 And other people say no, it's just a rush of chemicals.

302
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,320
 And again, there have been tons of studies done and both sides have their own sets of

303
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 studies they use.

304
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
 But that's just kind of an overview for near-death experiences.

305
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,520
 We're going to talk today about the rare ones.

306
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,800
 So you have the good, not near-death experiences.

307
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,960
 And then we have some that are called the void.

308
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,080
 The eternal void is the terminology.

309
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,520
 So there have been a ton, like I said, a ton of papers done on this stuff.

310
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,400
 So all this stuff is basically considered HIPAA, considered they're not releasing the

311
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,800
 person's name for who was involved in this study.

312
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 But people went around and they interviewed people who had near-death experiences and they

313
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,400
 were cataloging good ones and then the void and then what they call hell, hell-death experiences.

314
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,760
 Here's some of the void ones.

315
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,000
 I'm going to read these from the paper.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,200
 A woman in childbirth found herself abruptly flying over the hospital and into deep empty

317
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,960
 space.

318
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,000
 A group of circular entities.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,520
 I wonder if that means they're just like balls, just a bunch of balls floating around you.

320
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,040
 A group of circular entities and this one's actually really creepy.

321
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,520
 This is an interesting one to start off on because this one's pretty creepy.

322
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,160
 A group of circular entities informed her she never existed, that she had been allowed

323
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,480
 to imagine her life but it was a joke.

324
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,600
 She was not real.

325
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,280
 She argued with facts about her life and descriptions of earth.

326
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,360
 "No," they said.

327
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,720
 None of that had ever been real.

328
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,160
 This is all there was.

329
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,960
 She was left alone in space.

330
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
 Now she obviously comes back to life.

331
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,960
 She died during childbirth.

332
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
 She comes back to life.

333
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,440
 That would be a hard thing to come back from.

334
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,960
 If you imagine that you had this, you died.

335
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,720
 And you had this vision that you're just kind of floating there and you're told, "Oh,

336
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,360
 none of it was real."

337
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,020
 It was all fake.

338
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,120
 This is what awaits you, the loneliness of a pitch black void.

339
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,200
 And not only that, you get to know that all of your actions were just your imagination.

340
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,160
 You're a dream of your own making.

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,880
 And now sit in the void forever and think about the fact that everyone you loved never

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
 even existed.

343
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
 Creepy.

344
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,720
 This is going to be the rest of the episode, by the way.

345
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,840
 This is going to be the rest of the episode.

346
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,640
 So if you find that creepy, it's probably only going to get worse from here.

347
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
 Here's another one.

348
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,680
 And this woman, it was interesting.

349
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,320
 This woman actually also died during childbirth.

350
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,680
 Came back to life.

351
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
 Spoiler alert.

352
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,240
 So this woman, when she dies, she starts off, it does start off as a good near-death experience.

353
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
 It starts off very, very peaceful.

354
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
 But then we move to this.

355
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,360
 It was no longer a peaceful feeling.

356
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,520
 It had become pure hell.

357
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,840
 I had become a light out in the heavens and I was screaming, but no sound was going forth.

358
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,600
 It was worse than in a nightmare.

359
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,680
 I was spinning around and I realized that this was eternity.

360
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,320
 This was what forever was going to be.

361
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,320
 I felt the aloneness, the emptiness of space, the vastness of the universe, except for me.

362
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,840
 A mere ball of light screaming.

363
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,920
 I mean, I figure if you're in hell and you're burning, at least like there's other people

364
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,600
 burning, you can share in the misery.

365
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,160
 Maybe ever so often you can get together, have a little meeting.

366
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
 I don't know what you guys are talking about.

367
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,480
 Oh man, I'm so tired of being burned.

368
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:25,760
 But that would be preferable to simply existing for eternity, knowing you exist, but not being

369
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,400
 able to interact with anything, being completely separated from everything.

370
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
 Here's another one.

371
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,920
 This was, oh, and so this next one was a woman who actually attempted suicide.

372
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,040
 One of the things they looked at, they said, "Do people who commit suicide tend to have

373
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
 a bad near-death experience?"

374
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,360
 This is what they figured out.

375
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,080
 This is the stat they did multiple studies on this.

376
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,760
 A bad near-death experience can affect anybody of any religious background.

377
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,920
 You can be a devout Christian, you can be an atheist.

378
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,720
 What your background is does not determine what type of near-death experience you do.

379
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,120
 When they look at people who committed suicide, 55% of all the void experiences, because they're

380
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,920
 rare to begin with, but 55% of all experiences like we're discussing the void, happened with

381
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,840
 people who committed suicide or attempted to commit suicide.

382
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,800
 And then 18% of all hellish experiences came from people who attempted suicide.

383
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,000
 Now hellish experiences, when you look at the full body of work, for near-death experiences,

384
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,120
 only make up about like 1 to 5%.

385
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,440
 Some people say it's as high as 15%, but other people are like, "No, that's too high."

386
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,520
 So 1 to 5% of all near-death experiences involve a hellish experience.

387
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,600
 And out of that, 18% of those are from people who attempted to commit suicide.

388
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,560
 So they do think that people who attempt to commit suicide tend to have darker near-death

389
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,080
 experiences, but people say, "Well, that's explainable, because people who commit suicide

390
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,160
 tend not to be in the best mind state to begin with."

391
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,200
 Sorry guys, this is a super dark episode.

392
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,720
 This we're gonna go back to this woman who attempted to commit suicide.

393
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,800
 Here's her story.

394
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,080
 She tries to kill herself and then she felt herself begin to get sucked into a void.

395
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,760
 And here's her quote.

396
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,200
 "I was being drawn into this dark abyss, or tunnel, or void.

397
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,920
 I was not aware of my body as I know it.

398
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,840
 I was terrified."

399
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,920
 This is an interesting part of this too.

400
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,680
 So this woman expected that when she died, she's most likely an atheist or agnostic,

401
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:37,080
 when she died that she would slip into nothingness, oblivion.

402
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,600
 I obviously believe that when you die, something happens to your soul.

403
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,240
 Heaven or hell or I don't know the specifics, but I believe there's a soul that exists beyond

404
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
 biological death.

405
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,360
 There are a lot of people who don't believe that.

406
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,120
 So she is one of those people, she believes that when she's dying, it'll just go into

407
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
 oblivion.

408
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
 Let's finish her quote here.

409
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,960
 "I had expected nothingness.

410
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,200
 I expected the big sleep.

411
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,440
 I expected oblivion.

412
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,480
 And I found now that I was going to another plane.

413
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 And it frightened me.

414
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,560
 I wanted nothingness.

415
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,080
 But this force was pulling me somewhere I didn't want to go.

416
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,440
 But I never got beyond the fog."

417
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,520
 This one was funny.

418
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,480
 This one, not necessarily super funny, but I just love, again, this all comes out of

419
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
 like medical journals, all this stuff.

420
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
 So this is all the lead in we get for this one.

421
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,840
 A man who was attacked by a hitchhiker felt himself rise out of his body.

422
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,320
 I want to know, I want to know what led up to this.

423
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,400
 Like was he walking down the street and a hitchhiker jumped up, knocked him over the

424
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,200
 head, try stealing his clothes?

425
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,440
 Did he pick up a hitchhiker and get a wrench to the side of the head as he was driving?

426
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,760
 I guess it doesn't matter.

427
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,840
 I just find how often do as much fun as I make fun of hitchhikers and drifters and stuff

428
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
 like that.

429
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,680
 It's very rare that I actually encounter a story where they're attacking people, but

430
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
 I love that.

431
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,000
 So a man who was attacked by a hitchhiker felt himself rise out of his body.

432
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And here's the quote.

433
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,360
 "I suddenly was surrounded by total blackness, floating in nothing but black space, with

434
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,880
 no up, no down, left or right.

435
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,200
 What seemed like an eternity went by.

436
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,120
 I fully lived it in this misery.

437
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,760
 I was only allowed to think and reflect."

438
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:35,760
 So all of these void experiences, the consciousness survives and they're floating in nothingness.

439
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,520
 And floating, I think when you picture floating, you picture like a human, like Dr. Manhattan

440
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,240
 or Superman flying through space, but they don't even have a form.

441
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,120
 It's just a mind separated from everything in this void.

442
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,640
 Which is quite terrifying to me.

443
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,080
 It may not be to you, but I think it's quite terrifying.

444
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,880
 But now, let's get to the bad stuff.

445
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 Let's get...

446
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,640
 Okay, sorry.

447
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,080
 Let's get to the hellish versions here.

448
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,400
 The hellish stories here.

449
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,000
 Now they are considered the most rare of near-death experiences.

450
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,600
 Most people do not suffer from near-death experiences that are this bad.

451
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,320
 And even in this, there's actually a subset of them called judging experiences, which

452
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,280
 are incredibly rare.

453
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:35,040
 And that's where you die and you feel like you're being judged for something and you

454
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
 did something wrong.

455
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,200
 Like there are the life reviews for people who die and they'll look back on their life,

456
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,480
 and a lot of times there have been stories of people who have had near-death experiences

457
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,280
 that they'll see the events of their past lives and they'll live out each event as each...

458
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,600
 Let's say you cheated on your boyfriend and you're dying and you would relive that experience

459
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,880
 and you would be your boyfriend in that experience and you would sense his loss and confusion

460
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,720
 and trying to figure things out.

461
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,200
 And people who have come and they felt kind of like they were being judged, but when they

462
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,040
 came out and they lived through those experiences and came back to life, it gave them a greater

463
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,840
 sense of empathy because they saw all the bad stuff they'd done in their life and they

464
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,200
 were the person that the bad thing had happened to.

465
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,840
 They come out of it, they're feeling great.

466
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,800
 There are ones where they actually feel like they're being judged for every negative thing

467
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,160
 they've done, but in the end the scales they feel are weighed in their favor.

468
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,720
 Like yes, they did bad things, but when the scales are finally weighed, they are a good

469
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 person.

470
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,040
 It's the rarest form of near-death experience and I don't even think I have an example of

471
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
 it.

472
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
 It's that rare.

473
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
 We'll get to them, we'll see.

474
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,200
 But it's being judged and being told you are garbage.

475
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,680
 When we weigh the scales of life, you actually failed.

476
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,800
 They do, those near-death experiences do happen, but it's the single rarest near-death experience.

477
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,200
 Even the ones where they're being judged tend to be positive.

478
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,360
 So let's look at some of these though near-death experiences where people believe they passed

479
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,720
 the void and went into hell.

480
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
 Here's one.

481
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,320
 A man in heart failure felt himself falling into the depths of the earth, and the bottom

482
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:22,920
 was set high, rusty gates, which he perceived as the gates of hell.

483
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,200
 Panic-stricken.

484
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,120
 He managed to scramble back up to the daylight.

485
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,800
 Now what's interesting about some of these?

486
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 Imagine we're in the year 6000 BC, or 10,000 BC, and you could be in Israel, you could

487
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,160
 be in the middle of Bolivia, you could be a Siberian dude, you could be a Native American.

488
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,760
 We're basically just Native because it wasn't America back then.

489
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,440
 If you died and you had a near-death experience like that, and because they're so rare, you

490
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,200
 might be the first human to get knocked off your donkey and you fall down and you hit

491
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:26,200
 your head and you feel your soul go fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

492
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
 the ground.

493
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,840
 This explains why we have the concept of heaven and hell to begin with.

494
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,800
 If this is 100% biological chemicals being pushed into your brain, it would explain why

495
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:42,560
 people believe in things like pearly white gates and your loved ones waiting for you

496
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
 in the afterlife.

497
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,160
 And all of these, I don't want to use the term myths because I believe in them, but

498
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,080
 I'm going to use the word myths, the myths about the afterlife for both heaven and hell.

499
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,280
 These next ones I'm going to read to you too.

500
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,640
 If there was no context for religion and you died and you went to a shaman, they wouldn't

501
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,560
 even be shaman, you died and people go, "Whoa, you fell off that donkey, Mr. Native Man,

502
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,760
 and you got your head bashed in, but you survived.

503
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
 What did you, what happened?"

504
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,360
 And he goes, "Well, I went to the middle of the earth and there was this horrible place."

505
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
 And that's how stories get started.

506
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,800
 You would basically be considered a, they're like, "Okay, we're going to start calling

507
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,960
 you Mr. Shaman now."

508
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,000
 You defied death and you had a vision of what a, this is, this would explain a lot of why

509
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,320
 we have visions of the afterlife because people dying and coming back and telling these stories

510
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,160
 6,000, 10,000 years ago because people were dying and it was a lot more rare back then

511
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,520
 too, because usually you just died back then.

512
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,960
 Some guy hit you on the head with a club, there was no emergency room to take you with,

513
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,800
 your brains just came out.

514
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,800
 So it would explain why we have these visions of what heaven and hell is.

515
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 Let's look at some more of these.

516
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 Here's a woman who died, a woman was being escorted through a frighteningly desolate

517
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,040
 landscape and saw a group of wandering spirits.

518
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:16,160
 They looked lost and in pain, but her guide indicated she was not allowed to help them.

519
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,280
 That's all we have from this woman's story.

520
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,960
 We don't know how it started, but just from the context.

521
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,480
 She's walking through hell.

522
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,280
 She's why, I love that term, frighteningly, I can't say that word right, but frighteningly

523
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,000
 desolate landscape.

524
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,960
 Again the idea of a void, the idea of absence of God.

525
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,120
 It's not like she's looking and she's seeing mountain ranges in the distance.

526
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,480
 There's just nothingness.

527
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,160
 You're walking on a plane of nothingness and she sees a group of people wandering by and

528
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,000
 the guide's like, they're on their own journey now.

529
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,320
 Creepy.

530
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,920
 They're also lost, but again not the loneliness of the void, but definitely good things aren't

531
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,560
 happening here.

532
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,040
 Here's another one.

533
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,560
 An atheistic university professor with an intestinal rupture.

534
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
 This one's funny actually.

535
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,440
 And what's funny is this atheistic university professor actually ended up becoming a minister.

536
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,880
 And we see a lot of people who previously weren't religious, who have these near-death experiences,

537
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,000
 turned to religion afterwards, but not all of them.

538
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,640
 Some of them go, "Ah, that was interesting."

539
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,360
 I think it was a chemical reaction, so I'm not going to put any weight in it.

540
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,600
 I'm not going to change my life because of it.

541
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,800
 Generally, the bad ones, people would tend to reevaluate their life, but even then not

542
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 all the time.

543
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,280
 And a creepy thing is there are times where people have had, died once, had a good near-death

544
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,840
 experience, a little tunnel of light, their loved ones waving at them.

545
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,480
 There was a guy who the next time he almost died, which is just bad luck at that point.

546
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:00,800
 He had an experience that was described as, "He was attacked by gigantic, sinister, threatening,

547
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:09,280
 geometric forms, leaving him with a deep-seated pessimism and terror of dying."

548
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,240
 So just because you have one doesn't mean you can't have the other.

549
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,920
 And you would have to reevaluate your life, like, what had you done differently?

550
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,600
 If you believe that this is some sort of spiritual thing, what would you have to do?

551
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,560
 What did you do differently that caused the good one versus now being attacked by a bunch

552
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
 of pentagrams?

553
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,200
 Anyways, the atheistic university professor, we'll go back to this one, with an intestinal

554
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,160
 rupture, experienced being maliciously pinched.

555
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
 So he's in...

556
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
 That's not all.

557
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
 I'm going to finish it.

558
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,240
 He dies and he just feels these fingers just pinching his skin.

559
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
 Pinch, pinch, pinch.

560
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,280
 The creature does not make the noise, but just being pinched.

561
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
 And you figure at first, you'd be like, "How?

562
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 Stop it.

563
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
 How?

564
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
 Ow!"

565
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,000
 But then each pinch dug deeper into the flesh and began just tearing flesh and muscle tissues

566
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,800
 away and just eventually eviscerated, destroyed, obliterated this man's body.

567
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,000
 And then he comes back to life.

568
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,720
 That freaked him out.

569
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,600
 I think it would anybody.

570
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
 Here's one.

571
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,920
 We got two more I want to cover here.

572
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
 Here's one.

573
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,920
 A woman who committed suicide, attempted to commit suicide.

574
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,280
 Right after she does the deed, it doesn't say how it was.

575
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
 It doesn't really matter.

576
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,440
 But she felt her body just immediately begins to slide into the ocean.

577
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,240
 Now I'm assuming she didn't do it on a boat.

578
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,920
 I'm assuming that it was...

579
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,520
 That's why I think it's a little more important to know what happened here.

580
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,840
 But we can still go on with it.

581
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,880
 I'm assuming that let's just say that she hung herself or shot herself or something

582
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
 like that.

583
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,720
 She immediately feels herself move through our reality into a cold, dark, watery environment.

584
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,520
 That's what the paper uses here.

585
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
 And here's her quote.

586
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,400
 "When I reached the bottom, it resembled the entrance to a cave.

587
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,560
 With what looked like webs hanging, I heard cries, wails, moans, and the gnashing of

588
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
 teeth.

589
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,600
 I saw these beans that resembled humans with the shape of a head and body, but they were

590
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,160
 ugly and grotesque.

591
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,480
 They were frightening and sounded like they were tormented in agony."

592
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,280
 So again, we have a story of someone submerging, going underneath the earth.

593
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,320
 And again, it could be because people think that hell is underground.

594
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,680
 It could be if this is biological, there could be some weird mechanism to it.

595
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:40,560
 It may be the idea that whatever realm, if there is a hell realm or dimension, it is

596
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,400
 quote unquote underneath our reality.

597
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,280
 And the term gnashing of teeth is actually in the Bible.

598
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,280
 So again, you could say, "Well, that's proof that the Bible is right about what hell is."

599
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,360
 Or "Parts of the Bible is right about what hell is," because there's a lot of disagreement

600
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,680
 about what hell actually is even among biblical scholars.

601
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,040
 Or it could be that this is a woman who had heard that phrase before and was expecting

602
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,760
 that in the back of her head.

603
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,940
 So again, near-death experiences are how much of them are our expectations of what happened

604
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:18,060
 after we die versus actual things that exist after we die.

605
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,640
 That the reason why religions believe in them is because people have come back and told

606
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,880
 them these stories.

607
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,040
 But our last story we're going to wrap this up goes all about expectations.

608
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,640
 It goes all about what people expect to be there after we die.

609
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,760
 And I think that is why this one's the creepiest.

610
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,840
 It's because if you're in a-- the one where the woman thought she was just going to disappear

611
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,000
 into the void and it turns out she would fly through just a fog for eternity, that one

612
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 is chilling because again, it went against her expectations.

613
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,360
 If you expect that when you die, you just cease to exist and something happens, that's

614
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
 terrifying.

615
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,920
 You're going to heaven and you end up in hell, terrifying as well.

616
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,640
 If you expect you're going to go to hell and you end up in heaven, pleasant surprise.

617
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,480
 But this is this woman's story from this paper here.

618
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,000
 And the paper is in the show notes.

619
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,360
 A woman who hemorrhaged from a ruptured fallopian tube reported a near-death experience involving,

620
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:17,080
 quote, "horrific beings with gray gelatinous appendages grasping and clawing at me."

621
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:24,400
 So she basically bam, she dies and she's surrounded by ooze, gray ooze monsters, grabbing her

622
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,560
 body, reaching out, feeling her flesh.

623
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,680
 Not-- oh, not a good beginning to your death experience.

624
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:40,000
 Quote, "The sounds of their guttural moaning and the indescribable stench still remain

625
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,680
 41 years later."

626
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:50,960
 There was no benign being of light, no life video, nothing beautiful or pleasant.

627
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,480
 So she expected this vision.

628
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:02,040
 She expected this welcoming into the holy community, this creator, her father, her spiritual

629
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,720
 father, to greet her and say, "Welcome home."

630
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,560
 To see the past life experiences, to see all of the things that had happened to her, both

631
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,600
 good and bad, and to relive those things.

632
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,840
 Instead, she goes from being on an operating table to being grasped and clawed and held

633
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:28,680
 by creatures, again, aliens, with no other word to describe them, gelatinous, gray.

634
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,040
 And it's funny, it says appendages.

635
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,680
 It's not like she's actually seen these things.

636
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,440
 It's almost just things coming out of a void or a reality, attacking her.

637
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,440
 And the fact that this happened and she comes back to life, and 41 years later she can still

638
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:51,320
 remember the smell of them, shows how real that experience was to her, if not just real

639
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,240
 to begin with.

640
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,720
 Nobody knows what happens after you die.

641
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,280
 But these people have died.

642
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,820
 They didn't just fall asleep on a table.

643
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,020
 These people were clinically dead and came back to life.

644
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,360
 And the ones I went over, or we did what, eight, ten of these, are a small sliver of

645
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,280
 a small sliver of near-death experiences.

646
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,120
 Are any of these experiences real?

647
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,140
 I think some of them are.

648
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,040
 So be careful out there.

649
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,520
 Whatever you're doing tonight, be a little more careful behind the wheel of your car.

650
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,040
 Double check that your shower mat is firmly stuck to your bathtub.

651
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,660
 And when you're walking through a dark room to go to the fridge to get something to drink

652
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,420
 late at night, just step a little more carefully.

653
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:47,860
 Because one simple mistake, and you could know for certain, if any of these experiences

654
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,700
 are real.
