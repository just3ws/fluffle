1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A failed revolution forces a man to sit in the hot seat, a female demon that haunts

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,940
 the jungles of Central America and South America comes equipped with a one-of-a-kind superpower,

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,560
 and then we take a look at the political belief known as posadism.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,400
 How far left do you have to be for even Castro to denounce you?

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,400
 Well, saying that you want a nuclear war is a good start today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:42,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,400
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,640
 It's nice and rainy out here.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,760
 I kinda like the rain as long as I'm in sight.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
 But that's it.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,200
 That's all the intro I got, because we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:01,880
 Now the first story I'm gonna talk about is a little grim, but I have this thing that

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,760
 it's seen, I really am starting to think that most of history has been retconned.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,240
 Not like in it, I mean I can think the Battle of the Bulge happened and stuff like that.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,400
 And I think there were key events that happened throughout humanity, but sometimes the stuff

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,400
 that is reported is so ridiculous that you really have to sit back and go "that didn't

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
 happen".

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,600
 Now there are some events that actually we know 100% happen, but for this first story

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,680
 though, I just find absolutely ridiculous.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,720
 So let's hop on the carboner copter.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,120
 First we gotta make a stop off at the Bermuda Triangle because we're going back in time,

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,280
 so *makes a noise* and now we're also magically transported over Transylvania.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,720
 Bermuda, Romania, but back then it had the more badass name Transylvania.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,320
 And we get there just as things are starting to heat up pun intended.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,440
 In 1514, to make a long story short, because I don't want to get into the history of everything,

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,560
 but there was a papal order, there was an order from the Pope to stop the Ottomans from

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,080
 just wrecking all this stuff throughout Eastern Europe.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,440
 And they appointed this dude, I'm assuming I'm pronouncing this wrong, because if I'm

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
 pronouncing this right, this guy does not have a badass name.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,480
 His name is Georgie Doza.

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,880
 Georgie Doza.

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,480
 So anyways, easy Doza.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,200
 Oh, okay, I'm sorry about that.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,480
 Georgie is appointed to raise this army, and he does raise an army, but he doesn't know

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,440
 how to control them, and eventually he has this huge army, and they go "let's fight for

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,880
 our rights, let's take back the land that was ours."

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,960
 And all the gentry are like "oh this isn't good."

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
 They're like "control your army, control your army."

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,880
 He's like "I'm trying to, there's like thousands of these guys, what am I supposed to do?"

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,560
 Maybe if you gave me some of that sweet sweet vampire power you have in Transylvania, and

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,080
 they're like "silence!"

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,000
 And so anyways, this army that was meant to stop the Ottoman Empire, to stop the Turks,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,360
 was just like rampaging, and this went on for a while, and they were basically killing

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,760
 a bunch of noblemen, and the knights were having to show up and beat up the peasants.

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,440
 And the whole time Georgie just cannot control this whole mob.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,640
 It's a mob.

49
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,560
 So anyways, eventually the quote unquote rebellion that wasn't even, that's not even why he started,

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,000
 it was crushed, and they tell Georgie, they go "you want to be king, you want to take

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
 stuff over, we'll make you king."

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,600
 And he's like "I never want it, what do you, I never wanted to be king.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,520
 I was given this order to do this, and it just didn't work out."

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,200
 But anyways, so this is what, that's all, I believe all of that happened.

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,640
 I don't believe that his name is Georgie.

56
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,760
 I think it was probably a little more badass than that.

57
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,800
 But anyways, this is what I don't believe.

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,520
 So this is how they kill Georgie.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,920
 Now I know back in time they were pretty brutal with their tortures, but let me explain it

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,120
 to you and then explain why I don't think it's real.

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,320
 They take Georgie, and they take a throne, and they make it red hot.

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,760
 And then they put him in it, and they're like "you want to be king, right?

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,200
 Get in this throne!" and he's like "Ahhhhhh!"

64
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,240
 And then they make a crown, you know a crown that you put on your head, because I know

65
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,920
 I have trouble pronouncing that word.

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
 They make that red hot, and they go "here's your crown, your highness!"

67
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,520
 And he's like "Ahhhhhh!"

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,200
 And then they go "you know what a king really needs?

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,960
 He needs a scepter.

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
 Go fetch me that hot red scepter please."

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
 They just have a line around.

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,640
 The guy's like "yeah sure, it puts on big mittens.

73
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
 Hands it to Georgie.

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
 Ahhhhhh!"

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:39,120
 Now he's holding a red hot scepter, sitting in a red hot throne, wearing a red hot crown.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,720
 Now this is all supposedly historical.

77
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,920
 And you're like "well that's awful Jason, that's terrible."

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,400
 But then, according to historians, they then were starving nine dudes, they were prisoners

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,560
 of war that Georgie knew, one of them was his brother, and they bring the nine dudes

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,040
 in and they go "Georgie, here's your court.

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,720
 Look at all these people here to serve the new king."

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,760
 And then they chop his brother up, and Georgie's like "Noooooo!"

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,240
 And then the remaining eight guys who are starved to death, they are then told to eat

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,600
 Georgie.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
 So they eat him.

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
 They begin taking bites out of him.

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
 And those that refused got chopped up so the other dudes were like "well I'm either getting

88
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,360
 chopped up or I'm taking a bite out of this guy so they all walked up and ate some of them

89
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
 and they were allowed to leave."

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
 And Georgie died.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,640
 That was the end of that.

92
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,760
 I don't believe that story for a second.

93
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
 And here's why.

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,480
 Let's say that someone has a spear on you and says "go sit in that hot seat, go sit in

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,200
 that red hot seat, what are you gonna do?"

96
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
 You'd be like "no, spear me then dude."

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
 And they would have to like fight you and maybe they were like poking you in the butt and

98
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,080
 you're like "ahhh" and they finally throw you on the throne and you're immediately gonna

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,320
 get up.

100
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,800
 If someone and here's the other thing, so I don't believe that.

101
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,960
 If you are standing around, if you are surrounded by guards, because obviously they would have

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,760
 to guard you otherwise you would keep jumping up.

103
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,600
 There's a bunch of guards around you and they hand you a red hot scepter.

104
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,920
 What's the first thing you're gonna do?

105
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,120
 Drop it, most likely, but if you have any forethought you're gonna begin wielding that

106
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,800
 like a mace and attacking people with a red hot scepter.

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,160
 It's already melted to your hand, you can't do anything to it.

108
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
 It's like someone took a G.I.

109
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
 Joe figure and put it in a microwave.

110
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,240
 It's just one form of mold now, your hand in the scepter.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,440
 Maybe swinging it around and you could argue well Jason maybe they strapped him down to

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,000
 the throne and then made it red hot.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,760
 What strap can you name that won't melt under red hot heat other than a chain and again even

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,120
 if they chained me to a chair and then handed me a red hot scepter, I'm getting somebody.

115
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,040
 The guy who hands it to me is getting hit in the head with it and then getting eaten while

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,280
 you're sitting in a red hot chair.

117
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,480
 Have you ever tried to eat a hamburger out of a frying pan while it's still cooking?

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
 You would melt.

119
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,280
 I mean this story is so ridiculous.

120
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,480
 But apparently this happened.

121
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,160
 I think they probably took a guy and they got a chair, there was red hot and they threw

122
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,600
 it threw him on it and he jumped up and he got like third degree burns and then they just

123
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,960
 stick stuck him to death with spears and then they made the rest up.

124
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
 Not saying that the storyings today are like hey Barry wouldn't this be cool if we'd say

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,520
 that this guy got melted and eaten at the same time.

126
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,120
 But I think it was probably propaganda back then and they were like and then we put a

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,880
 red hot crown on his head and all the revolutionaries were like I don't want to do that.

128
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,000
 That sounds like a terrible thing.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,400
 But I think if you ever tried to recreate that and I don't recommend doing it because

130
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,680
 again you're going to get hit in the head with a red hot scepter but I think what's

131
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,080
 bizarre is that when I read about it no one was like but that's impossible that probably

132
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
 didn't happen.

133
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,680
 A couple different sources are like yeah this happened and I'm like it didn't.

134
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,160
 I can understand getting impaled because you could have a couple guys hold you down and

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,840
 a stick stuck up your butt.

136
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,480
 The amount of people it would take to hold a man down in a red hot chair, those dudes

137
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,000
 are getting burnt and there's a big struggle and they're handing you a weapon that is red

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,080
 hot it's just a bad idea all around.

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,400
 So we're going to go ahead and we're going to leave Romania or hop back in the Carbenter

140
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 copter.

141
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,800
 We have our heat shields on so we're not filling the heat and again I don't think that ever

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,280
 happened so we don't even need the heat shields we just see a man getting stuck with spears

143
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,000
 as we fly away.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,360
 And we have to go forward in time now.

145
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,880
 We're going 100 years in the future.

146
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,720
 That story took place in 1500.

147
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
 We're hopping back in the Carbenter copter.

148
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,760
 Now we're going to the 16th century which actually be the 1700.

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,480
 So we're going a couple years in the future.

150
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,360
 I'm new to this whole time travel device on my helicopter.

151
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,160
 We're going to Columbia.

152
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,760
 And our helicopter is in stealth mode and it's a good thing because what we see going

153
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,000
 on beneath us is not a situation we want to be involved in.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,360
 It was a dark moonless night and a slave ship became overrun by their cargo.

155
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:12,440
 The slaves, not like sugar, the slaves broke out and attacked the shipmen of the boat.

156
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,720
 Through them overboard, stabbed them, one guy tried heating up an iron throne, the whole

157
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,160
 boat caught on fire, but eventually 25 of these slaves bail out on little rowboats or

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,200
 dinghies or whatever they're called and get off the ship and they land in Columbia.

159
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,080
 Now these slaves believe that they are totally free now.

160
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,240
 But their freedom doesn't last long because they end up running into a group of natives

161
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,280
 and very quickly the two groups become hostile towards each other to the point that a battle

162
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,040
 breaks out between the slaves and the natives.

163
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,480
 And this battle is so bloody you have muskets, pfft, reload, reload, reload.

164
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,280
 You have knives, ceremonial daggers coming out of sheaths and just digging in the flesh.

165
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 It blood everywhere, the screams of the dying, the moans of death.

166
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,360
 It is music to the devil's ears and while he is underneath the planet, he hears these

167
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,800
 noises above and it just gets the blood boiling.

168
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,680
 He has to see this magnificent battle so the devil crawls out of the earth, sees these

169
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,920
 two groups fighting each other and realizes he needs a piece of this.

170
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,240
 He then runs into the battle and slaughters both sides.

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,840
 Claws, teeth, tail, swipe, swipe, you get the point.

172
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,560
 The devil just destroys them all.

173
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,920
 Oh and then horn, stick!

174
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,000
 Sticks the last dude with the horn.

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,680
 He had to use all of his weapons.

176
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,120
 But while he's up there, he's like finally cleaning the blood.

177
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
 Oh no, he would love the blood.

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,840
 He's rubbing more blood on him, he's rolling around in it like a pig in a slop pit.

179
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,920
 And he sees a beautiful woman somewhere.

180
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,120
 This is a legend, I'm not making this up, somebody did.

181
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,880
 As he's rolling around in the blood, he sees the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.

182
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,640
 And he sees her, they lock eyes and instantly fall in love with each other.

183
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,320
 Now this is not the start of one of the most bizarre romantic comedies you've ever seen.

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,280
 It's the start of the story of a creature known as "La Tunda".

185
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,080
 You see the devil and this chick bang all the time and she has a ton of kids and one of

186
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
 them is named La Tunda.

187
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,840
 Now because she is the devil's child, she cannot have children herself.

188
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,120
 But she wants them more than anything.

189
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,420
 She wants kids and she wants servants.

190
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,560
 So the legend goes like this.

191
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,080
 That legend went like that.

192
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,480
 And in Colombia and parts of Latin America and South America, they believe that La Tunda

193
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,120
 is this creature, this child of the devil, that if a kid sees her, it appears as a mother,

194
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,840
 it appears as an aunt, it appears as someone who cares about them.

195
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,000
 So if the child's mother was horrible and she had no sisters, the child would see nothing.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,880
 It would just see a predator and visible type shape coming towards them.

197
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,440
 But anyways, if they had a loving mother, it would appear as their mother.

198
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,640
 And to adult men, which was her secondary target, it would just be the most beautiful

199
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,360
 woman they've ever seen.

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,160
 If you're an adult man and it's your mom, you might have some issues.

201
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,720
 But anyway, so unless your mom is the most beautiful person you've ever seen now that

202
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,560
 I think about it, anyways, she captures you.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,720
 Now we did an episode recently on South American cryptids that become women and I think there

204
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,040
 was one in Southeast Asia as well.

205
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
 And we're talking about all that stuff.

206
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,840
 This one I found when I was researching a different topic and this one's absolutely bizarre because

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,360
 even though it fits the criteria of it lives in the wilderness, it's a shapeshifter, it

208
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,360
 can be the most beautiful woman in the ever, the other ones would either kill you or drive

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,920
 you mad.

210
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,520
 This one, this one's absolutely nuts.

211
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,480
 Whoever made this up was stoned out of their mind.

212
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 Absolutely.

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,040
 So Latunda, she wants kids and she wants slaves.

214
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,960
 She wants men to entertain her and she wants kids to raise because she can't have any herself.

215
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,520
 So what she does is she lures you in by being someone who's cared for you if you were a

216
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,800
 child or the most beautiful woman in the world.

217
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,560
 But first off, huge handicap here.

218
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,840
 She is an expert shapeshifter except for one thing.

219
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,200
 Her leg looks like a whisk.

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,560
 Her leg looks like a giant wooden spoon.

221
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,080
 Which basically is the same as saying you don't have camouflage at all.

222
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,000
 If you could morph into any shape but your left arm looked like a blender, technically

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,080
 you can't morph into any shape.

224
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,560
 But apparently she always stands behind bushes so you don't realize that her leg looks like

225
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,840
 a whisk.

226
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,160
 Like an egg beater basically.

227
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,080
 It's like this old fashioned wooden egg beater they use.

228
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,960
 But anyways, so she always has to hide behind a bush which again, she can't chase you and

229
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,320
 that's really not being an expert shapeshifter.

230
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,240
 Secondly, once she has you under her control, we'll get to that in a second, but once she

231
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:01,400
 has you under her control, she feeds you shrimp to keep you under her control.

232
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,680
 When has the mind control abilities of shrimp ever been extolled in any legend ever?

233
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,280
 I've never heard someone once say, you know, if she's not really, you know, giving you

234
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,080
 what you want, try shrimp.

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,480
 Like that is not a phrase that any human has ever uttered ever.

236
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,720
 She uses shrimp to keep you under control.

237
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,520
 But you ask Jason, we know how she kidnaps you by imitating someone you love.

238
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,960
 And we know how she keeps you under her control by feeding a shrimp.

239
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,760
 But how does she get us under her control in the first time?

240
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,840
 This is the best superpower ever.

241
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,320
 You go back to this chicks house, she's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.

242
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,560
 No, no, no, even better.

243
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,960
 You're a little kid and your mom is like, hey, come under the jungle, come in the jungle.

244
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,360
 And you notice she has an odd limp but it's constantly obscured by jungle foliage.

245
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,480
 So you're not really like, you know, like, that's weird.

246
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
 Kind of looks like an egg beater, but you go off in the jungle with this woman.

247
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
 She then gets you back to her layer and farts in your face.

248
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
 And her farts, I'm not making this up.

249
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,200
 Her farts smell so bad, it breaks your mind and you immediately become her slave.

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,720
 How bad smelling does a fart have to be to destroy your consciousness?

251
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,240
 How bad can that be?

252
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,840
 But apparently it works for her.

253
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,520
 You're back at some chicks house, she's the hottest chick you've ever seen.

254
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,240
 You're a little concerned that the chicks house is in a cave in the middle of the jungle

255
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,960
 and she's wearing knee high boots.

256
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,880
 But you're there with her, she's super sexy, she bends over in your face and then you're

257
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
 her slave forever.

258
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
 As long as she keeps feeding you shrimp.

259
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,680
 A lot of people believe that and there may still be people who believe in this creature.

260
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
 But that is flat out ridiculous.

261
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,600
 There's a part in the bible where this missionary is like getting picked on by these teens and

262
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,760
 he prays to God and a bunch of bears come out of the forest and maul the teens to death.

263
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:05,000
 That story is more believable than a farting ghost to feed you shrimp.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,360
 But somebody came up with it.

265
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
 This is my scenario.

266
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:17,080
 A jock somehow tricked his way into becoming a shaman of a village and he was just pulling

267
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,840
 pranks the whole time.

268
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,520
 Basically Van Wilder is the medicine man who came up with this story.

269
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,200
 A farting ghost.

270
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,080
 With farts that smell so bad it destroys your mind.

271
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,120
 I can't imagine a smell that bad but I want to see this cryptid on supernatural.

272
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,600
 They do a lot of one off monster of the week episodes.

273
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,520
 I want to see Sam and Dean fight this thing.

274
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,880
 I want to see Dean falling in love with this hot chick and Sam warning him don't fall for

275
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,040
 it you already banged that werewolf we got in a lot of trouble with that.

276
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,840
 He ends up going back to this girl's flat.

277
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,960
 It's face farted on and then they both just shoot her in the brain because that's pretty

278
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,520
 much how every episode ends and then they spend the last 10 minutes talking about how much

279
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,760
 they love each other.

280
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,160
 I want to see La Tundah on an episode of supernatural.

281
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
 Make it happen.

282
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,360
 I'm Eric Kripke I know you listen to the show.

283
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
 Make it happen.

284
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,160
 Oh wait you don't work for that show anymore.

285
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,000
 Still make it happen.

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,680
 But we're done with farts we're done with the juvenile humor.

287
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,080
 If I edited out a lot of fart noises and there's only like one or two in that consider yourself

288
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,200
 lucky but we're done with that.

289
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,280
 We're done with that part.

290
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,360
 Now we are going we're actually staying in the region because our next story actually

291
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,560
 takes place in Latin America South America things like that.

292
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,320
 So we don't even have to use any fuel on the carbonicopter we're just going to wait here

293
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,120
 for probably about 150 200 years.

294
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:52,640
 We go into our cryogenic chambers and we sleep the restful sleep until it's the year 1962.

295
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,960
 Imagine you're a college student which actually a lot of you are but imagine you're a college

296
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,160
 student in 1962 and you're curious about the world you're looking at different political

297
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,440
 beliefs and things like that you kind of want to broaden your scope.

298
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,200
 I actually had a lot of run-ins with who are those lunatics who follow Lyndon LaRouche.

299
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,040
 I had a buy oh man I got a hundred stories about those actually no I have four.

300
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,880
 I have four stories about dealing with Lyndon LaRouche people at my college.

301
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,440
 These guys are nuts.

302
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,960
 But anyways but again you just kind of want to broaden your horizon you want to look into

303
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,160
 different political beliefs.

304
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:31,200
 So a friend invites you to go to a seminar he says there's just new political party they

305
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,880
 broke off from the Trotsky's.

306
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,880
 They are socialists to a degree that they see the future of humanity.

307
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,720
 And you're like well you know Trotsky's okay but I'll go check it out.

308
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,280
 I'll go check it out just to see what they have.

309
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,680
 You go into a large auditorium not a lot of people in there maybe like 30 or 40 but everyone

310
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,640
 in there you can tell the energy level is high.

311
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,640
 They cannot wait to hear what their speaker is about to say and to be honest you get a

312
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 bit of a cult feeling something seems off but you put those feelings inside and say

313
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,600
 you know what I'm going to keep an open mind.

314
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,800
 A speaker comes to the stage gets his papers ready and begins speaking.

315
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,480
 We are preparing ourselves for a stage in which before the atomic war we shall struggle for

316
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,160
 power.

317
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,880
 During the atomic war we shall struggle for power and we shall be in power.

318
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,680
 After destruction commences the masses are going to emerge in all countries.

319
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:38,840
 In a short time and a few hours capitalism cannot defend itself in an atomic war except

320
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,340
 by putting itself in caves and attempting to destroy all that it can.

321
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,840
 The masses in contrast are going to come out will have to come out because it is the only

322
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,160
 way to survive.

323
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,120
 The apparatus of capitalism police army will not be able to resist.

324
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,680
 It will be necessary to organize the workers power immediately.

325
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,720
 Nuclear war equals revolutionary war.

326
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
 It will damage humanity but it will not.

327
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,760
 It cannot destroy the level of consciousness reached by it.

328
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,960
 Humanity will pass quickly through a nuclear war into a new human society.

329
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
 Socialism.

330
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:23,520
 That's not just a guy breathing heavily in your ear the crowd goes wild at this speech.

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,480
 And you quickly say goodbye to your friend and you sneak out of that auditorium and you

332
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,040
 basically run home.

333
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,120
 What you've just heard is a speech from Jay Posadas.

334
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,160
 Jay Posadas is the founder of a belief known as Posadism.

335
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,320
 Now this story was recommended to me on YouTube from Adi Naton.

336
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 Adi Naton.

337
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,640
 And I appreciate it.

338
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,320
 Thank you for the recommendation.

339
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,560
 Posadism was a political group in the 1960s.

340
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,400
 It's still around today.

341
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,880
 And they were so nutty that Castro himself kicked him out of Cuba.

342
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,720
 After the Cuban revolution Jay Posadas said "Wait, why do the Americans still have a

343
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
 Guantanamo Bay?

344
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,520
 Let's mar-" and which I've always thought was weird too.

345
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,320
 I never knew Guantanamo Bay existed and I mean it was common knowledge but I didn't

346
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,600
 know it existed until after 9/11.

347
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,160
 But the fact that we had all these problems with Russia and Cuba and all that stuff but

348
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,560
 we had a military base on the island I always thought was weird.

349
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,920
 But Posadas said was basically saying Castro's not doing enough because there's still US

350
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,800
 troops on the island and Castro's like "Listen, it's not worth it."

351
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,200
 And Posadas actually started to get groups of people from the cities to march on the

352
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,280
 base and Castro's like "Listen, no, this is the deal we have set up" and he kicked Posadas

353
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,840
 out of Cuba.

354
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,640
 He was too much of a revolutionary for Castro.

355
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,080
 He ends up going to South America and Latin America and he starts all these little cells.

356
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,240
 Originally he was part of Trotsky groups but he didn't feel they were going far enough.

357
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,400
 So he started forming this new political belief named after himself called Posadism.

358
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,480
 His beliefs were that nuclear war was not only inevitable but good.

359
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,640
 The Soviet Union and China should strike first.

360
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:20,160
 The only way to defeat capitalism is through a global thermonuclear war.

361
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,800
 Now his followers thought that was great but his followers were never given the chance

362
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,720
 to rebut him.

363
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,440
 All the meetings were, he would go to the town hall meetings and if he wasn't there

364
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,600
 personally all the meetings were a group of people sitting around listening to tape recordings

365
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 of his speeches.

366
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,960
 His political newspapers were mostly transcripts of his speeches.

367
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,920
 And people would just sit around and talk about what they learned.

368
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,360
 There was no leader but him.

369
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,120
 So it was basically a cult.

370
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,100
 A doomsday cult really.

371
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,880
 He wanted nuclear war and had these visions of nuclear war and within hours of the nukes

372
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,480
 falling all the workers would rise up and kill all the cops and stuff like that.

373
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,880
 Fairly short-sighted because while that may happen in the short term, even if you win

374
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,400
 the world is in nuclear ruins.

375
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:18,280
 So he gained a lot of followers from that but he lost a lot of connections in the political

376
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
 world.

377
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,880
 Other groups didn't want to deal with him because he was too nutty.

378
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
 That was only the beginning so you had groups already severing ties with this group but

379
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,360
 in Latin America and South America it was fairly popular.

380
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,840
 I mean in compare, I mean it's fairly popular compared to other offshoot communist socialist

381
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 groups.

382
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,440
 He wasn't like top of the pops.

383
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,520
 It wasn't this huge thing.

384
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,360
 But it had a good amount of membership.

385
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,880
 But anyway so the nuclear thing they kept preaching and they really do, they're not around as

386
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,040
 much today but that's still part of their belief system that nuclear war is revolutionary

387
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
 war.

388
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,360
 It is the final step.

389
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,680
 But around 1968, Posadas has another vision.

390
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,400
 He realizes that they actually have an ally that is an untapped resource.

391
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,160
 They actually have now looked around the globe and said if we can get these people to take

392
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,440
 our side we will win.

393
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,280
 There will be no defeating us.

394
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,440
 They didn't really look around the world.

395
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,800
 They looked up.

396
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:26,280
 In 1968, Jay Posadas wrote a pamphlet called Flying Saucers, The Process of Matter and

397
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,520
 Energy, Science, the Revolutionary and Working Class Struggle and the Socialist Future of

398
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,200
 Mankind.

399
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,280
 It made four points.

400
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:41,320
 One, UFOs are evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations too.

401
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,600
 Since advances in society come from advances in technology, extraterrestrials must come

402
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,840
 from a more advanced society than Earth, like socialism.

403
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,320
 He had this belief that the reason why science wasn't as advanced as it should be is because

404
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,480
 capitalism used science to kill, socialism would use science to heal.

405
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,800
 He envisioned this world where everyone could talk to any animal.

406
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,520
 People could reproduce like amoebas asexually, but I just love to imagine a person splitting

407
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,720
 in two and then having two of them come around.

408
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,840
 He believed that women should give birth in space.

409
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,960
 He believed in this idea called "Russian Cosmicism" that once we left the planet we would be these

410
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,120
 immortal people with no worries.

411
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,000
 And he believed that the aliens had already reached this level and the only way they could

412
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,800
 have reached this level is because they were already socialists.

413
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,000
 He believed the reason why aliens, this was point three, the reason why aliens aren't

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,960
 interacting with us is because we are a primitive, i.e. capitalist society and as long as we

415
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,720
 were a capitalist society, worldwide, there were obviously huge communists and socialist

416
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,720
 strongholds.

417
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:00,760
 But worldwide you had this huge thing of capitalism in the Europe and in Western Europe and America,

418
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,440
 as long as we're there the aliens weren't going to interact with us because we were

419
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,040
 seen as primitive.

420
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:13,760
 So four, and this was kind of the main point, posatists had to contact the aliens to get

421
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,720
 them to align with the socialists and destroy capitalism on the planet.

422
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,280
 Now what's funny is this, the nuclear war thing always struck a lot of other socialists

423
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,960
 as kind of weird, but they said "Yeah, I get where you're coming from."

424
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,960
 Like yes, if there was a huge nuclear war or a limited nuclear war or whatever it would

425
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,840
 destroy capitalism because capitalism needs material goods to sell and buy.

426
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,000
 You need groups of people to buy and sell those items, you need labor to make the items

427
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,840
 to sell and to buy and all that stuff.

428
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,400
 So yes, yes, you are right that if a nuclear war happened it would impact capitalism more

429
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
 than it would impact communism or socialism.

430
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
 Yes, you're correct.

431
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,240
 However, it would involve the deaths of hundreds of millions of people and tons of land that

432
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,080
 wouldn't be able to be used, it would be a tragedy on a global scale, literally.

433
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,960
 It would be absolutely terrible.

434
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,400
 So yes, I see your point but I don't think that's the path, I think we can do these other

435
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 things.

436
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
 When he came out with this UFO thing, everybody laughed at him.

437
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,680
 To the point that like immediately they were classified as a UFO cult, they became a huge

438
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,400
 joke in political circles.

439
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,800
 Other people, other socialists started referring to them not as Posadist or Fourth International,

440
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,280
 they just started calling the members extraterrestrials.

441
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,120
 Whenever they referred to this dude, Jay Posadist or anyone in his group, they would call him

442
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,920
 "Hey look at the ETs over there."

443
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,560
 Completely destroyed their credibility, 100%.

444
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,960
 Posadist then realized that he'd probably overstepped his bounds.

445
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,280
 He ended up getting exiled from South America at this point, he's in Europe now, where

446
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,440
 he eventually died in 1981.

447
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,640
 But they started talking less and less about weirds.

448
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,320
 And the weird thing too is that when they're reading this article they said, "You would

449
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,200
 be reading the Fourth International Posadist newspaper and it would have an article about

450
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,920
 like a worker strike in Britain and then next to it it would say, "When man talks to dolphins,

451
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
 world will be better."

452
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,760
 It was like all intermixed with like real events and then this super fringe science

453
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,920
 stuff.

454
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:22,080
 And his followers still believed in it, but it rapidly started having drop off because

455
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,280
 people did not want to be connected with a UFO cult.

456
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,080
 They wanted to be socialists and they kind of believed this guy, but once they were basically

457
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,040
 getting mocked from their own side, you started to have membership drop off.

458
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 To this day they're remembered as a wacky UFO doomsday offshoot, far far left of socialism.

459
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,480
 And up until around 2011 they were still producing material, their website's down now, but they

460
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,240
 stopped talking about UFOs.

461
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
 It was just completely damaged their brand.

462
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,520
 Nobody wanted to join, they were big laughing stock, so they really backed away from that.

463
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,680
 But they still talked about, "Yeah, nuclear war is good."

464
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:06,920
 Because that again, I can, that idea is logically, it's stupid, but you can see the logic in

465
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,080
 it.

466
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,920
 What's interesting about this conspiracy theory?

467
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,160
 Like you have a guy, he has a ton of members, he has all these groups around the world.

468
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,360
 He had some in Europe too, but it was mostly located in South America, Central America.

469
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:26,160
 You have all of this power and he ends up making the mistake of talking about aliens

470
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,480
 in 1968 and becomes a big joke.

471
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,920
 And it's funny because nowadays you have cults, religious stuff, we'll talk about UFOs, it's

472
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,880
 a little more accepted now.

473
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,680
 But in 1968 that was his big misstep.

474
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,520
 But the thing is.

475
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,800
 He broke off from the Trotsky groups to start this sect, to start this political belief

476
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
 system.

477
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:55,480
 It's just as likely that he could have kept those views hidden, not have argued, towed

478
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,680
 the party line, moved up through the ranks, get to the top or near the top and begin to

479
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,920
 whisper those beliefs into somebody's ear.

480
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,240
 That's how you play the long game.

481
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,640
 You may be a weirdo in real life, you may have some bizarre political beliefs, but by

482
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,040
 starting your cult or your offshoot group you're actually handicapping yourself.

483
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,960
 It's much more beneficial to these fringe beliefs, to work their way up through the system

484
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
 legitimately.

485
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,720
 And some people do.

486
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,040
 And what happens is over the years and over the decades as they move up these groups, their

487
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,000
 own fringe theories start to get dulled and they start to become a little more mainstream,

488
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,400
 a little more palatable, you get older, you have more experience, you're talking to people

489
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,480
 with different ideas and you go maybe the nuclear war thing is not a great idea.

490
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,680
 But to a hardcore believer, you're holding onto those beliefs the whole time you're

491
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,360
 working your way up that ladder.

492
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,040
 How many people are out there who believe the only way to win their ideological war

493
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,760
 is through nuclear war?

494
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:11,240
 You could have someone out there who believes that the path to the future means the nuking

495
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:18,640
 of a religious city, that the path to a glorious new future is biological weapon use across

496
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,280
 vast continents.

497
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:26,760
 You may have people out there like Posadas who believe that only a full-blown nuclear

498
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:34,120
 war can lead to the perfect world for the humans that are left.

499
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:42,440
 Jay Posadas died in 1981, but people with that type of mentality still live.

500
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,160
 And how many of them do you think are whispering in the general's ear on a daily basis?

501
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,880
 How many of them are generals themselves?

502
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:16,480
 How many of them are just waiting for the day to make their dream our reality?

503
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,480
