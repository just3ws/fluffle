1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 A group of Japanese baseball fans in a flurry of excitement because their team won a sporting event, a baseball game,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,600
 unleash the curse of Colonel Sanders.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,600
 And then, travel back in time with me as I talk about my days as a journalist, student at a community college.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,600
 And it's not all about proofreading and editing.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:32,000
 No, this humble journalist was involved in not just one, but two real life conspiracies today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,800
 [music]

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
 Some really quick notes before we get started.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,600
 Yesterday I had my Zari China Hole story and I said Corpse Glitch recommended that. He did. Definitely did.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,400
 But so did the real guy, the best guy. He recommended it as well and I didn't have it on my notes.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,000
 So I want to make sure I made that correction. The podcast itself has been corrected, but the YouTube videos just stay as it is.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I can't correct that, but I want to make sure people get credit for what they recommend.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,200
 And also let me say very briefly, there won't be a Monday episode. This will be the last time there won't be a Monday episode.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,600
 I'm still in Sacramento. Next week will be a short week. The week after that we'll be back to normal.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 And that's it. That's all of our notes. We got a lot of stuff recovered today. So let's go ahead and get started.

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,600
 Yesterday we talked about Colonel Sanders, the Colonel Sanders, King of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,200
 But I teased you. I tickled your little conspiracy bone or paranormal bone in this case.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,800
 It's all the same. It's just one bone located right beneath your elbow. I tickled it. I went, "Hehehe."

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,200
 And you went, "Oh, stop it." And I told you that there was a curse related to this.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,600
 So now we're going to talk about the curse of Colonel Sanders.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,600
 Now to put this in context, I think this is kind of a why no one fact. Maybe not everyone knows it, but it feels like it's why no one.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 Actually, it's actually not the thing about it. It's probably quite obscure.

24
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
 In Japan, for Christmas, they eat Kentucky Fried Chicken.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,800
 Back in the 70s or the 60s or whatever, some marketing exec at Kentucky Fried Chicken said,

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
 "They don't have turkeys in Japan, but they want to have a Western style celebration.

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,600
 Let's make KFC the celebration for Japan for Christmas."

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,000
 Or Thanksgiving, one of the two. "Oh, they don't celebrate Thanksgiving." Never mind.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,800
 For Christmas, they're like, "Yeah, I'm glad the Indians fed all those white people.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,600
 They don't celebrate Thanksgiving over there." Christmas, Christmas.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,000
 So they wanted to celebrate Christmas. And you know there's a conspiracy theory that after Jesus died and then came back to life,

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,200
 he went to Japan. I should cover that at some point.

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,800
 Because apparently all this evidence that Jesus was walking around Japan for a while, like long, long time ago,

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,200
 like three days after he flew up into the sky.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,800
 So anyways, they celebrate Christmas with KFC to the point that that is like the day that most stores make all of their profit.

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,800
 People from like corporate KFC office have to go down to local KFCs and serve food because they're completely slammed.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,400
 And you have to call in your order like weeks before. You're like, "I want some big old box of chicken.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,800
 What are they, the barrel of chicken? I want the big barrel of chicken and some gravy, please."

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,000
 And then you go down there and pick it up. It's super huge over there. KFC is huge during Christmas time.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,600
 So they have a ton of KFCs, Kentucky Fried Chickens, in Japan.

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,200
 So that's the setup. That's the setup for the story.

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,400
 Otherwise you'd be like, "Why do these things exist? Why do these things exist?"

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 We're in Japan. We're in the city of Kansai. The year is 1985.

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,800
 And right now, the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers, they win the Japan Championship Series.

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,400
 Now that particular year, they had an American player on their team, a white guy named Randy Bass.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,400
 So Randy Bass is playing for the Hanshin Tigers that year.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,000
 Now there's a huge celebration. They have this huge celebration. They won the Japanese World Series, basically.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,400
 They have this huge celebration at a place called Ibusu Bridge. Ibusu? Ibusu Bridge.

49
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,600
 And they came up with this thing that people would yell out the name of a player.

50
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,000
 And someone who looked like that player would jump off the bridge into the canal.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,400
 So they're like, "So and so." And some guys are like, "Hey, that looks like me."

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000
 They go like, "So and so." And someone goes like, "Yeah, that looks like me."

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,800
 But then when they yelled, "Randy Bass!" Everyone's like, "Ugh."

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,000
 There's no white people. It was all Japanese people there. Nobody looked like Randy Bass.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,500
 But someone goes, "Hey, I know who looks like Randy Bass. I know who's white around here."

56
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,300
 And there was a statue of Colonel Sanders standing outside a KFC.

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,600
 And people went and they ripped the statue, because in the KFC, they have...

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,800
 It's so famous they have statues of Colonel Sanders outside their KFCs.

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,400
 They run, they grab the statue, they use their Herculean strength.

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
 [Growl]

61
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 Break it off. Throw it into the canal.

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,400
 "Yay! Everyone cheers! Super! Everyone's laughing!"

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,000
 They thought it was a great idea. It was the only person within 100 miles who looked like Randy Bass.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,700
 "Well, I can't wait to do this again next year," the crowd said.

65
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,600
 The Hanschen Tigers for 18 years, losing streak.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,200
 They were the last or next to last in the league.

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,600
 Twice though, they won like their pinnets. But even then, everyone's like, "There's no way they're going to go any further than this."

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
 Like, this was a fluke. This was an absolute fluke.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800
 We are cursed by the curse of Colonel Sanders.

70
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,000
 Our patron saint of Christmas. We threw him into the murky, murky river.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,400
 And there he lies in the watery depths. We need to get him back.

72
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,700
 They were tried searching for this guy for two decades.

73
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,300
 Now, they knew where they threw him off at, but they couldn't find him in the water.

74
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,400
 And the people, the Hanschen Tiger fans were convinced that this was the reason why their team was losing.

75
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,900
 They were cursed by Colonel Sanders.

76
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,300
 In 2009, in 2009, they're building a boardwalk in that area.

77
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,200
 And they find it. But it's cut in two pieces.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,400
 And oddly enough, it's missing its glasses, which I don't know how the glasses would come.

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
 I don't really know how anything would break off a statue, especially the glasses.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,600
 Although I imagine they were just like, drawn on.

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,500
 But anyways, the statue is missing its glasses and its left hand.

82
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,500
 And since then, the Hanschen Tiger still aren't doing exceptionally well.

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,400
 But people feel that the curse is close to getting lifted.

84
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,100
 If they can find that hand, they say if they can find the hand, the curse will be lifted.

85
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,700
 The glasses are really, really a long shot.

86
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,800
 I find it weird that no one could find a statue in the murky depths of the river.

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,700
 It's actually a canal. Is that the same thing?

88
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,600
 Is a canal man made in a river is naturally formed.

89
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 Anyways, I find it odd they couldn't find it and people were really, really searching for this thing.

90
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
 Send in and dive teams and stuff like that.

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,900
 Because after the fourth year of coming in last place, you would assume that you're cursed.

92
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:58,100
 The statue that has been removed from the canal is now in the KFC headquarters in Yokohama.

93
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,400
 And I love this quote. I love this quote.

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,200
 This is from an article I was reading about this.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:10,600
 "It is not viewable by the public. Only employees and special guests are permitted to gaze into the rescued colonel's eyes."

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,300
 It's definitely like a reverent figure over there.

97
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,800
 He would be the equivalent of a Santa Claus, except instead of bringing you a new bike, he brings you some buttermilk biscuits.

98
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,500
 I find sports curse... I don't watch sports at all.

99
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,000
 I used to watch NASCAR, used to have more time and I'd watch NASCAR.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
 I've gone to basketball games and football games and stuff like that.

101
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,900
 I'm not a huge sports guy, but I find the idea of sports curses fascinating.

102
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,500
 And I find the idea of sports superstitions even more fascinating.

103
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,900
 Because really at the core, sports is by its very nature, a competitive game.

104
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:54,200
 If every player has their own superstition and every fan has their own superstition, but you're competing against another whole group of superstitions and rituals you have to do each day,

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:02,300
 it's basically the modern equivalent of, like, I don't want to say magical warfare, but like, thought, psychological, or psychic warfare.

106
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:09,400
 Let's say you have 5,000 people on one side who want one thing, and 5,000 people on the other side that want another thing.

107
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,300
 It's not like everyone has their own agenda.

108
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
 You have teams and fans of those teams.

109
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
 The mental power pushing between those two things must be amazing.

110
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:25,300
 I wonder if anyone's ever tried taking like one of those like, I don't know, made up devices, like, not an e-meter, but like, well, that was their made up too.

111
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:35,600
 But a, like a psychotron white box, facilitator, whatever, and measured the psychic energy between the two groups.

112
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,400
 I find it fascinating.

113
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,200
 I remember once I was at a basketball game and I've been at maybe three basketball games in my life.

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:52,800
 And I remember a friend of mine who took me to the game had to explain to me the idea of home field advantage and I was like, is it because like, they know the terrain and he's like, it's a basketball court dude.

115
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,900
 The terrain is the same everywhere.

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
 Some aren't more hilly than others.

117
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,300
 He goes, no, it's because the fans are cheering for you when you make a point.

118
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,500
 But if you're at an opposing teams arena and you make a shot, people boo.

119
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,900
 You get the ball, people boo.

120
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,300
 And it decreases your energy as a player.

121
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,900
 Fascinating.

122
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,400
 Fascinating.

123
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,800
 And I didn't think about that.

124
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:24,700
 But yeah, I just find it fascinating that you basically have two sets of psychic energy pushing against each other and then just this ball bouncing in the middle of it and both sides wishing for the ball to go in a different area.

125
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,600
 I mean, that's the most basic explanation of sports.

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,400
 But yeah, sports curses, sports superstitions, I just find fascinating.

127
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,200
 Imagine coming in last or second to last for 18 years and then having to go play another baseball game the next day.

128
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,300
 It's hilarious.

129
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
 But that OK, so we're done with that story.

130
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,500
 We have wrapped up the Colonel Sanders duology and I want to talk to you.

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,200
 It's Friday.

132
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,500
 Fridays are kind of off the cuff a lot of the time.

133
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
 We are leaving Japan.

134
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:56,100
 We are traveling back in time to the late 90s Sacramento, California.

135
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,800
 We got on our baggy pants.

136
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,100
 They're backwards.

137
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,100
 We're wearing our crust color shirt with a big African medallion chain and we are walking.

138
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,300
 I didn't really dress like that.

139
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:16,300
 But we're dressing like that now because it's the late 1990s and we are walking across the campus of American River College, a little community college tucked away in Sacramento.

140
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
 It's where I went for like seven years.

141
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
 I totally just like chilled there forever.

142
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:31,300
 I took tons of different classes, made lots of friends, hung out, got into, you know, getting on the fights on weekends, coming back one day all bruised up.

143
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,800
 Teachers like, what are you doing?

144
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,300
 But at the core of all of that party experience, because that's the best thing really about colleges hanging out.

145
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,300
 But at the core of all that was also my journalism classes, which was my passion.

146
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,300
 And really this podcast is what I see as a continuation of that journalistic career.

147
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,800
 Because it's really about researching and then telling things to people, which is all news writing is.

148
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
 Okay, so that was a long winded thing.

149
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,300
 And we'll see how much of that survives the editing process.

150
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,800
 But let's talk about my conspiracies that I ran into.

151
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 So the first one I want to talk about was probably my second or third semester in the journalism class, writing for the American River Current, the newspaper there.

152
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 This was old school.

153
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 We didn't have Photoshop.

154
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 We didn't have PageMaker.

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 We had to lay everything out.

156
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 We had to cut the articles out with a little X-Acto knife and lay it on a big board and then send it off to a printer.

157
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 I was in high school.

158
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
 We were type using typewriters.

159
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 That's how old I am.

160
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,800
 So anyways, I remember once, my journalism instructor was Bruce Paddy.

161
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
 He's a great guy, great person to learn from.

162
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,300
 And I remember once, we would get mail and CDs and stuff from people because we were a newspaper.

163
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:47,300
 So we got Chumba Wamba's first CD and we're like, "Who are these guys? Never heard of them before."

164
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
 I don't know why that's notable.

165
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
 That's not a conspiracy.

166
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
 But one day we get a huge packet.

167
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
 It was just addressed to American River Current.

168
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
 So I got into it.

169
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:03,800
 And it was this, it was probably about 10 pages of handwritten notes with a couple of drawings on it.

170
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 And it was just before you even read the first word, you looked at it and you thought, "A madman wrote this."

171
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,800
 You could just tell by the way the handwriting was that a lunatic had written this.

172
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 I don't know how you're able to do that, but there's just something about it.

173
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 You go, "Asane."

174
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 This is not the ramblings of a sane person and I haven't even seen the first letter on the page.

175
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 And so what this document talked about, it was the story of a man who lived in a mental hospital a couple blocks away from American River College.

176
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,300
 There was like a mental, it wasn't necessarily like a lockdown hospital, although I'm sure they had that facility.

177
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
 It was a, it was on Auburn Boulevard.

178
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
 It's like an unmarked building.

179
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 Looks like an office park, but it's actually where they send people who are mentally disturbed.

180
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,300
 I had a friend of mine who went there.

181
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,300
 Her mom has entered there and she's like, "Mom, I'm fine."

182
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
 But her mom was having trouble with her through in there for the weekend.

183
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,800
 That sucks.

184
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 That's one thing that sucks about being a kid.

185
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,300
 So I get this letter and it's this rambling diatribe and he said, "I have been put in that mental hospital."

186
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,800
 Now, now, now, that's a great way to start off your letter.

187
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,800
 I was a former resident of a mental hospital and this is what I saw on, I hope this conspiracy is not real.

188
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,300
 Otherwise they're going to come after me.

189
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
 This is what I saw in this mental hospital.

190
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,300
 There's a two ton crane on the top of the building.

191
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,300
 Why would a mental hospital need a two ton crane?

192
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,800
 The two ton crane shows up throughout his letter.

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,800
 We'll keep referring to the two ton crane and what he's talking about is,

194
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,300
 on the top of the building there actually was installed a giant crane that was used to lift stuff up to the roof.

195
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:45,800
 Now, whether or not it was a permanent fixture, whether or not it was there to lift up air conditioning units and then eventually the crane would disappear.

196
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
 Who knows?

197
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
 Who knows?

198
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,300
 I'm sure you could go there today and see if the crane's still up there.

199
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
 Hey, I'm in Sacramento, I don't have a car.

200
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,800
 I'd be like, "Hey mom, drive me by this mental hospital where we can find out whether or not this conspiracy is real."

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 But he goes on to say, "Why would a hospital, why would a mental hospital need a two ton crane?"

202
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 And he had the answer to it.

203
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,300
 He said that the crane was used to lift up giant barrels that would then be put into the air conditioning unit.

204
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:19,800
 And these barrels were full of a toxic substance he called cramp gas.

205
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,300
 And he said that he would be sitting in his, well, he wouldn't be sitting, he would be laying down in his bed at night.

206
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,800
 And he could hear the people in the other rooms screaming in pain.

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,300
 He couldn't figure out what it was.

208
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:40,800
 And then he said that his legs started to cramp up immensely, like the worst possible Charlie horses you could get from your toes to your hips.

209
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 And he begins just writhing in pain, flipping out.

210
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:51,300
 And he goes on to say that he believes it was a gas coming through the vents and causing his legs to seize up.

211
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:59,300
 This letter goes on and on and on about how they're either testing this on the inmates that this is a weapon they're going to use.

212
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,800
 It's a way to break the spirit, not inmates, but it's a way to break the spirit of the people who are residing in the mental home.

213
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,300
 Could be a torture technique.

214
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
 He wasn't for sure.

215
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 He went on and on, but he wasn't for sure.

216
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 The only thing he was sure of, there was a two ton crane on the building.

217
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,300
 Cramp gas was getting pumped into the building every night, and him and the others were suffering because of it.

218
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,800
 And he was sending this packet out to all local journalists so they could cover this story.

219
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,300
 Now, I was already weighing the conspiracy theories before I got this letter.

220
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,300
 I remember when I got this letter, I was having a ball.

221
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
 I thought it was the greatest piece of mail I could have ever gotten that day.

222
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
 I was like, "Oh my god, real life conspiracy?"

223
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
 And it's literally like three blocks from here.

224
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,800
 "Come on guys, we gotta check it out!"

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 Hopping the mystery machine.

226
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,300
 And I remember just reading it and laughing so hard and thinking it was the greatest thing I'd ever read.

227
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,800
 And the journalism instructor Bruce came out and he's like, "What's so funny, dude?"

228
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,300
 And I was like, "Oh my god, I got this letter from this maniac down the street.

229
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,800
 I want to do a story on this."

230
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
 We've given a lot of free reign on the type of stories we covered.

231
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,300
 I said, "You know, it's like within the distance of the school, it's interesting, and maybe it's true."

232
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,800
 And Bruce goes, "Listen, man, you're gonna be a journalist and that's cool."

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 He's like, "Good luck."

234
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 "You lose there, but no."

235
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 He goes, "You're training to be a journalist."

236
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,800
 He goes, "One thing you're gonna have to deal with is this stuff."

237
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 He goes, "You're gonna get letters like this all the time."

238
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,800
 And you can, he goes, "Feel free to go investigate this thing.

239
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,300
 Feel free to go down to the mental health place and see if there's a crane on the roof and whatever."

240
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,300
 He goes, "But, but, you're gonna get letters like this all the time,

241
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,800
 and you have to make a decision whether or not you're gonna be quote-unquote that journalist.

242
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,300
 You're gonna be the guy chasing down all the conspiracy theories."

243
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,300
 Now, I thought to myself, "I want to be that journalist.

244
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,300
 I want to be the guy who's researching this stuff all the time.

245
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
 That would be awesome."

246
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
 And eventually, I did become that guy.

247
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,300
 And you're saying, "Yeah, Jason, so you wanted to do the story.

248
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,800
 You had the lead. It was only a couple of blocks away.

249
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,300
 Did you go find out whether or not there was cramp gas in the building?"

250
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
 No. No, I didn't.

251
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,800
 Because I was scared.

252
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
 I was too scared that the ramblings of a madman were actually true.

253
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,300
 I remember driving by the building.

254
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
 I drove by the building all the time.

255
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,300
 I remember discussing it with my friends about how we could infiltrate the building.

256
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,800
 Maybe one of them could turn me in.

257
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,300
 I'm glad we didn't go with that plan.

258
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,800
 Turn me in as a lunatic and I could go undercover and I'm like,

259
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,300
 "No, my legs are totally fine. I meet bananas the whole time."

260
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,800
 Like, totally fine.

261
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 Like, no.

262
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,300
 But, see, and that's the thing.

263
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,300
 One thing about doing this show is a lot of times, like, I'll be looking into conspiracy theory.

264
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,300
 And in the back of my mind, I know it's not true.

265
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
 I just know logically that it's not true.

266
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,800
 I pretend that it's true while I'm researching it, so I can kind of look at every angle and then when I present it,

267
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
 that's when I'll start saying, "Now, this isn't true."

268
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,300
 This is the reason why this stuff isn't true.

269
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,800
 But in the back, there's always that thought where I'm like,

270
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 "What if this is the one that's true?"

271
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,300
 I've recorded episodes and released them and then got, like, worried afterwards.

272
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,800
 I mean, like, what if that's true?

273
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 What if something happens now?

274
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 And they're like, "You shouldn't have talked about Mormon big foot."

275
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,300
 You know what I mean? Like, every show often I'll record an episode and it's always the weird ones, too.

276
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
 It's always the ones you wouldn't expect.

277
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 I didn't get nervous about, like, golf--

278
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
 I was a little nervous with the golf rumors episode,

279
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,300
 but sometimes there's episodes that I'll record and I'll be like,

280
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,800
 "Probably shouldn't have said--probably shouldn't have talked about that."

281
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 And so there is a sense of, like, scariness and danger with these topics.

282
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,300
 Because if it's true, I'm getting cramp-gassed for the rest of my life.

283
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,800
 I'm getting thrown in a mental hospital.

284
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 They're gonna 50-150 me and every night I'm gonna be like,

285
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 "Where's my banana? Where's my banana--?"

286
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 [Groans]

287
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
 And all my legs cramp.

288
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 Although, to be fair, I'd have a great ass.

289
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,300
 Like, if every night you're just lower body cramped all night long,

290
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,800
 when did that just work your muscles out?

291
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
 You would just be stronger when you ran away.

292
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 You'd have great leg muscles.

293
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,300
 So that was one conspiracy that happened during my time at the American River Current.

294
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
 But there's another one that I was actively involved in.

295
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,800
 This one was a criminal conspiracy.

296
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 Well, it was a crime that was covered up by the school district.

297
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,300
 And it's so bizarre, and this one's gonna blow your mind, guys.

298
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
 Because I can guarantee you that this is a problem at every single university in every single town.

299
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
 And it has been covered up for years.

300
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,300
 When I started American River College, when I was actually coming up with--

301
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
 I was taking, like, intro to journalism, there was a group project.

302
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,800
 And for intro for journalism, we all had to write an article about crime on campus.

303
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 Some people talked about, like, break-ins, 'cause we had a lot of break-ins at Sacramento.

304
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
 People talk about this, people talk about that.

305
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,300
 I was hanging out with these two other girls who were writing this article.

306
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 And I happened to be going to the school library.

307
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,300
 And there was school police officers walking around, walking around the library.

308
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
 I had a friend who was a librarian, and I go, "Hey, what's up? Why are these--

309
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,800
 Why are these-- Why are these officers here?"

310
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,300
 And she goes, "Oh, dude, you just missed it, Jason."

311
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,800
 Some guy was just jacking off upstairs, and he, like, came all over the desk next to this girl,

312
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 and then he ran away.

313
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
 And I was, like, first off, didn't miss that.

314
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 Don't want to see that. I'm totally fine.

315
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 Secondly, are you kidding me? And she's, like, "No.

316
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
 No, we have a problem here with that."

317
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 I'm, like, "Really?"

318
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
 And at that point, the two officers come walking out of the--

319
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 they walked up and down the stairs. They're, like, "We lost them.

320
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 We can't find them anywhere." And I was, like, "What?"

321
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,300
 And she's, like, "Yeah, dude, I told you, man."

322
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,800
 And then she's, like, "Shh, it's library. You're supposed to whisper."

323
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 So I go bingo, like, I have to write an article about Crownland Campus.

324
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,800
 I'm going to write an article about this guy jacking off in the library.

325
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 But it wasn't a one-off thing. It wasn't a-- It wasn't a one-shot thing.

326
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 Apparently, through the course of my investigation,

327
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 I found out that American River College had an ongoing issue with men masturbating in the library,

328
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,300
 because the library was mostly, like, a library of steady haul,

329
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,800
 so you have these little cubby holes that you'd sit at,

330
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,800
 and a guy would see a cute girl-- really, it didn't matter-- any girl sitting down.

331
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 He'd sit down next to her, open the book up, pretend like he's reading,

332
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 but really be masturbating. And then sometimes he'd ejaculate on his book.

333
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
 That would be a good solution.

334
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 Well, actually, not doing it at all would be the best solution,

335
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,300
 but sometimes he would ejaculate on the woman, which is, like, ten times grosser.

336
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,800
 And then he'd run away. The cops would get called. They'd check out the library.

337
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
 They could never find the guy. And that was that.

338
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,300
 But it wasn't one guy.

339
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,300
 It was at least six guys that semester doing it multiple times,

340
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
 and the school was keeping it under wraps.

341
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
 They were not making this known.

342
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,300
 The women were getting sexually assaulted at a library.

343
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,300
 There was never any warning, never any announcement that this was going on.

344
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,300
 And I remember thinking-- oh, I know where the guy's hiding, not because I'm him,

345
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,800
 but I'm saying you got to get in the mind of a sicko.

346
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 If you're a man who's masturbating in public and the cops are looking for you,

347
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,300
 I remember the cops going, "We checked every male restroom. There's no one there."

348
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,800
 And I go, "Because he's in the women's restroom. He's a pervert, dude!"

349
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,300
 If you're a per-- it's not going to be like if you're ejaculating on random strangers,

350
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,800
 you're not going to be like, "Oh, I have too much dignity to go in a women's restroom."

351
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,300
 If you know they're only checking the male restrooms, you go into the girl's restroom,

352
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,800
 and then just come on out.

353
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,300
 There had multiple people doing this over the course of one semester,

354
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
 and this had been going on for years.

355
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,300
 And as I'm investigating it, because I would have to-- this was before Twitter,

356
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,300
 you'd have to walk up to people, ask them questions, call up people,

357
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
 had to have all these face-to-face meetings with people,

358
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,800
 I uncover that this is a common problem in every library.

359
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,800
 Almost every library has a problem with men ejaculating on women.

360
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,300
 I had a friend who went to UC Davis, his wife was a librarian.

361
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:51,300
 He said it's so common at UC Davis, they actually have terms for different jack-off people.

362
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,300
 Like, they'll be like, "Oh, we got a growler on level three,"

363
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,300
 which means he makes noises while he's masturbating, or we got like a sneak creep.

364
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,800
 He's the one who just like shoots through the bookcase,

365
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,300
 like you're reading a book on one side and it comes over you.

366
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,300
 He says, "There are so many people who do it, and there are so many different techniques.

367
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,300
 They have a security force, their only job is to catch people with their dick out running around.

368
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:18,300
 And there's so many different types-- not just different people, but different classes of people

369
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 who do this, they have code words for them.

370
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,800
 It is such a common thing and nobody knows about it.

371
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 I can almost guarantee if you go to your library or if you know someone at your local library, you ask them.

372
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,300
 Now, if you're living in the middle of Idaho, they may go,

373
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,300
 "Yeah, back in '08, someone jacked off on Lil Miss Suzy. She was getting ready for the bake sale."

374
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,800
 But if you live in any place that has any sort of population,

375
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,300
 I'm sure they'll say like, "Yeah, once a month we have to chase somebody out."

376
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,300
 If not more, because at AR it was more than once a month.

377
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300
 So I uncovered this big-- it wasn't just the crime being committed,

378
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,300
 it's the fact that the school was covering it up.

379
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,800
 The school was covering it up.

380
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 I was not popular with the administration at the school because we ran a big--

381
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,300
 I still have that newspaper, have a big headline, "Sexual Assaults on Campus in the Library."

382
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,300
 I don't remember the headline. It's at home. I have to copy the newspaper at home.

383
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,300
 So my first byline as a college journalist and it blew open this huge thing.

384
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,300
 The college was covering up sex crimes on campus. Absolutely amazing.

385
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,300
 And the school police stymied all of our investigations.

386
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,800
 They would ask for police reports and they would let-- it was like out of a movie.

387
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 They would give us a police report and every possible thing was blacked out.

388
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 So it was basically just a report full of black lines.

389
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 It had no information we could use off of it.

390
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 I remember once-- probably shouldn't tell this story--

391
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
 my editor at the newspaper was this girl named Heather.

392
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,800
 Now Heather is-- I haven't talked to her in probably 20 years,

393
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 but at the time she released this amazing woman who was super mean to me.

394
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 She was absolutely beautiful. She was super mean to me.

395
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 I used to make a lot of spelling errors. Really bad at spelling.

396
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 And when I would-- she was my editor when I'd give her an article,

397
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 she would then read to the entire newspaper staff my article and pronounce my spelling errors.

398
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 And everyone would just laugh and laugh and laugh and I'd be like, "Oh."

399
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 But it taught me to be a more careful speller.

400
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 And we ended up becoming friends. We hung out and stuff like that.

401
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 She asked me to drive her to pick up her car because it was at the Mechanics.

402
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,800
 And I was like, "Yeah, sure." So I go over to her place and we're watching Jim Carrey--

403
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 it was at Ace Ventura 2. We're watching Ace Ventura 2.

404
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 And we just put it in. I used to hate Ace Ventura.

405
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 I used to absolutely hate those movies.

406
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 And I remember sitting there and I'm like, "Out of all the movies I gotta watch with this girl, it's Ace Ventura 2."

407
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 I was not happy. She was really-- she came from this really rich family.

408
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
 We're sitting in this really nice house.

409
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 And we're sitting there and she gets a call and she goes, "Oh, the Mechanics said my car's not gonna be ready for tomorrow,

410
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,800
 so I don't need a ride." But you just want to still hang out and watch Ace Ventura 2.

411
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 And I said, "Nope." And I just laughed. I just got in my car and bounced, dude.

412
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 As much as I enjoyed hanging out with her because she was a really cool kid,

413
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,800
 there was no way I was watching Ace Ventura 2. And I still haven't seen that movie.

414
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 Anyways, so the reason why I'm saying that is because one time I got to leave a lot of details out of the story,

415
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 but I came into possession into-- in an area around an unredacted police report regarding one of these incidents.

416
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 I can't say how I got it or anything like that.

417
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,800
 I'm sure the statute of limitations is long, far over, because it was like 20 years ago, but still.

418
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 I come into possession of an unredacted police report, which is still public record.

419
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
 I have my camera on me, and these are the old film cameras, these old Peter Parker cameras,

420
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 and I know I can't leave with the report because it'll be noticed, but I begin taking pictures of the report,

421
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 and I'm like, "This is gold! I have all this information! Parker, you're a genius!" Click, click, click.

422
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 And then I remove myself from the location of said report, which we did get later with details redacted.

423
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 And I go to Heather, and I go, "Heather, you won't believe it!" I told her the story that I'm not going to tell you guys.

424
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:31,800
 I go because I don't want to get in trouble. I go and I got photos of the police report on this camera.

425
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 We finally can actually have some official explanation of what's going on, and Heather's like, "Really?"

426
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 And I was like, "Yes!" On this camera, she's like, "Oh my God, Jason, that's so awesome. Here, give me the camera."

427
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,800
 And I go, "Okay." And I give her the camera, and she opens it up and pulls out the spool of film.

428
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,800
 He's posing it to the light, and she goes, "You're an idiot, and don't ever, ever do anything like that again."

429
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 It's funny because she's totally right. The police report is public record, but you still just can't go around taking photographs of a police report,

430
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,800
 plus someone would have asked, "Hey, where'd you get those photographs?" She was much smarter than I was.

431
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 And she probably still is. She's still in journalism. Almost everyone from that American River College class is still in journalism in one form or another.

432
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 One went to go on and be one of the first person who started at saccb.com.

433
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 One of them's a huge sports writer, a crime writer in Fresno, stocked in one of them.

434
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 And Heather runs some women's websites somewhere, some women's journalists at magazine websites or something like that.

435
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 And I am doing Dead Rabor Radio.

436
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:45,800
 The reason why I wanted to talk about that is because I think it shows that conspiracy theories are all around us.

437
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:55,800
 All around us. We always look towards the Pizza Gate or the 9/11. We look at the big stuff or the flat earth, but they're really all around us.

438
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 And I find the ones that are down to earth, the ones that are more compelling.

439
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 I'm sure you guys have picked up on it. I don't cover a lot of global conspiracy theories on this show.

440
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 I like the ones that happen in your backyard, in your library, in your classroom.

441
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:22,800
 Because not only are those the ones that we can prove whether or not they exist more easily, they're the ones that actually affect you more.

442
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 If Hillary Clinton eats babies, that only affects her and the babies.

443
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 As cruel as that sounds, and you can say, "Well, yeah, but dude, the power structure, the powers that be." I get that. I get that.

444
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 But we don't know if any of that's true. And there will really no way to prove it unless we see her pulling a bib out of her mouth.

445
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 But the idea that your own local township can be corrupt, that your university could be covering up a crime, that a mental health ward nearby could be pumping cramp gas into people.

446
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 Those are not only more provable whether or not they're true. They not only affect you more, but they're actually more terrifying.

447
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 I could go on and on and on about Pizza Gate all day long on this podcast. I don't, and none of you guys want to hear that.

448
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 But I could do that. And the chances of Hillary Clinton's hint men coming after me, psssh, taking me out, laying in front of my computer, two shots to the back of the head, incredibly small.

449
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 Incredibly small. But the chances of me uncovering a crime, proving a local rumor to be true, discovering that something is being hidden on purpose by not the powers that be, but your local authorities, those are the ones that can actually get you killed.

450
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,800
 Those are the ones that can actually get you disappeared.
