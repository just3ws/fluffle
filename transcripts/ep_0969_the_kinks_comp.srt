1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 What would you do if you drove out to a bridge in the middle of the night?

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,220
 And there was a baby there.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,160
 A baby who wanted you as his new mom.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,940
 And then we travel back to the year 1982 to meet a legendary rocker on tour in America.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,980
 Everything was going according to plan until the aliens froze his genitals.

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,980
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,380
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,440
 It's a countdown to Halloween.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,040
 Unless you're not listening to what the day came out, for all I know it's March 2032.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,160
 But either way, either way, I hope you're getting ready for Halloween.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,640
 But someone who's always ready for Halloween, no matter what month it is, walking into Dead

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
 Rabbit Command is our newest Patreon supporter.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,920
 Dressed up as a giant bumblebee, everyone give it up for Gertie Gwynnorn.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
 Woohoo!

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
 Yeah, come on in, she's shaking her little behead.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
 It was that close.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,960
 Gertie Gwynnorn.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,460
 Is her name?

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,400
 I believe, I believe she sent me the correct pronunciation and hopefully I said it right.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,760
 Gertie, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,640
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon, that's fine too.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,200
 Just help spread the word about this show.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,120
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,320
 Gertie, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,040
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,720
 Fly us on out with your little bee body to Delaware.

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,960
 For all I know she's allergic to bees, she's like, that's the last thing I would dress

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
 up as.

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,280
 But flying out there, flying out there, apparently if you dress up in the costume, you are the

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,240
 costume, you got six arms and you're super tiny, you're flying us out to Delaware.

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,080
 Now we're going to take a look at some very interesting ghost stories in Delaware.

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,640
 I hope you guys like this ghost story a day for the month of October because I'm never

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,920
 doing it again.

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,680
 We've covered a lot of really good ghost stories, but man, we fly all the way out to Delaware

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,320
 and it's late at night.

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,760
 It's about 2, 3 in the morning and we're out in the outskirts of Smyrna, Delaware.

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,400
 There's this little stone bridge there, not like cobblestone, not like old timey.

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,880
 It's concrete, I guess probably a better way to describe it, a more accurate way.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,800
 There's this concrete bridge out there.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,840
 It's not spooky looking.

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,920
 I imagine when I read this story, I imagine it was going to be like wooden with a couple

44
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,800
 beams missing a couple ruined cars in the lake below.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,360
 I actually don't even know if there's running water under here.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,760
 I might just cross a canyon.

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,560
 Like Jason should be the one doing all this research so you can accurately tell the story.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,760
 Well yeah, probably, probably, but anyways, there's this concrete bridge here and it's

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,120
 known as Cry Baby Bridge.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,240
 Now Cry Baby Bridge, these stories are everywhere, almost every city.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,000
 I won't say every city in the world, but in a lot of especially rural locations, there

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,560
 are Cry Baby Bridges and the phenomenon is this.

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:26,440
 You go out to this bridge late at night, you hear a baby crying underneath the bridge.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,840
 Which would be alarming.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,400
 I would say this, as a ghost hunter, if you find yourself going to a place called Cry

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,240
 Baby Bridge late at night and you do hear a baby crying anywhere around you, under the

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,160
 bridge and the bushes or whatever, don't assume it's a ghost.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,560
 Don't just assume it's a ghost.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,680
 It might be a live baby.

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,840
 I wonder how many people want to get rid of their kids and they go, "Oh man, I really

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,280
 don't like this kid anymore, but I can't go to prison for murdering it."

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,840
 This episode got dark real quick.

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,360
 What if I took my baby and dropped him off at that Cry Baby Bridge everybody's talking

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
 about?

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,160
 Then the baby would cry in the darkness all night long and no one would discover him.

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,240
 Anyone died due to the elements, man.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
 This got really dark.

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,000
 I don't think that's ever happened.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
 I don't think anyone has wanted to get rid of their baby and then also driven to a remote

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
 location of an urban legend to do it.

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
 But who knows?

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 Who knows?

73
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
 It's possible, right?

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,840
 In an infinite timeline in multiple universes, I'm sure on one of them that scenario has

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,880
 happened, but Cry Baby Bridges are super common.

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,400
 So when we look at Dellawares or Smyrna Dellawares version of the Cry Baby Bridge, you think,

77
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,000
 "Oh, we're standing out on this concrete bridge it's late at night and you hear this

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,960
 baby crying."

79
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,800
 And after a good two, three hour long search party as you're like, "Jason, trust me, that's

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 not a real baby.

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 It's a ghost baby."

82
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,520
 And it's like, "But we have to be sure.

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
 Infinite timelines."

84
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,120
 After we're all done searching for this baby.

85
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
 There's no baby.

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 There's no baby.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
 It's actually a ghost baby.

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
 We go, "Well, you know, this is typical of the Cry Baby Bridge phenomenon.

89
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,000
 We have these babies crying in the middle of nowhere."

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,280
 What's interesting is this one also has some of the hallmarks that we see of Cry Baby

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,960
 Bridges where if you park your car in the middle of the bridge and put it in neutral,

92
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
 it'll roll backwards.

93
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
 It's supposed to be ghosts.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,800
 It's not because the bridge is angled or anything like that.

95
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
 It's supposed to be ghosts pushing it.

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 We see that a lot.

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,640
 That happens a lot in these Cry Baby Bridges things.

98
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,920
 Sometimes they'll put a baby powder on the back of the car to taunt the baby.

99
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
 You'll never have this.

100
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
 You'll never have baby powder.

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,640
 You put baby powder on the back of your car.

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,000
 Sometimes these bridges aren't necessarily baby related.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,640
 There are a bunch of kids have died.

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,600
 This show is so dark.

105
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,720
 This show is, I never meant for it to be so disturbing.

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,000
 But all of these stories involve dead children.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,160
 All of these ghost stories involve dead children.

108
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,080
 You put baby powder on the back of a car and they say that your car will roll in a certain

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,680
 direction and you'll see a little hand prints of all the kids who had died on the bridge

110
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,200
 because a train hit them or something like that.

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,560
 And now they're trying to push your car out.

112
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,520
 They're pushing your car into the train.

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,240
 You're like, "No, no, stop it.

114
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,200
 Two more payments and it's mine."

115
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,160
 These are very common phenomenon in these areas.

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,760
 The reason why we're at Smyrna Delaware though is that this one has some unique characteristics.

117
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,240
 This story goes like this.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,960
 At Smyrna Delaware, a long time ago, a teenage mother gave birth to a little baby boy.

119
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
 "Ugh, uh, get out of there.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
 Uh."

121
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,800
 And it comes out and she's like, apparently she did this in like a wood shack or something

122
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 like that.

123
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
 There was no doctors around.

124
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,080
 She gives birth to her own baby and she goes, "Oh, baby, my favorite baby, my only baby.

125
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,560
 I'm gonna call you my wood shack baby."

126
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:10,240
 And she goes to hug it and then she realizes that her baby is super deformed.

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,640
 So she takes her baby out to...

128
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,080
 It wasn't called the crybaby bridge before this.

129
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,960
 It was just called like bridge 81 or whatever.

130
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,160
 Country road bridge.

131
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,600
 She takes her baby out to this remote bridge and she's like, "See you later."

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,200
 And she chucks the baby off the bridge.

133
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
 That would be the birth of...

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,640
 Or if there's bad choice of words, that would be the start of any crybaby bridge legend.

135
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,560
 Usually a baby has to die for the crying to be heard.

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,520
 But the reason why she chucked this baby off a bridge was its deformity.

137
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,580
 And its deformity was he had huge legs.

138
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,880
 So regular baby head, regular baby body, but these massive legs, these big meaty thighs

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:01,280
 and calves that any bodybuilder would die for, she chucks it off the bridge, she goes home.

140
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,880
 And so at the crybaby bridge in Smyrna, this deformed baby's ghost still roams this area.

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,840
 And sure it'll cry.

142
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,640
 It'll cry in the darkness for you.

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,980
 And sure your car will roll, put your car in neutral, which I've never...

144
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,620
 Every car will roll in neutral, but anyways, roll uphill.

145
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,420
 This baby wants a new mom.

146
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,420
 This baby grew up in a canyon.

147
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
 But didn't grow up.

148
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
 He died.

149
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
 He died pretty quickly.

150
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,460
 He was checked into a canyon, but this baby wants a mom.

151
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:44,400
 And this baby has some powers to ensure that you may be its next mother.

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,680
 Now I've never seen this before in a crybaby bridge story.

153
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,440
 What happens is if you go to the crybaby bridge late at night, you'll find...

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,240
 This actually sounds quite terrifying.

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
 I can't imagine a scenario where this would be any good.

156
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,200
 Your doors all lock.

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
 All the car doors lock.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
 Click, click, click, click.

159
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 What?

160
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 We can't get out.

161
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,440
 Well, why would we want to get out?

162
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,660
 There's a ghost baby running around and it locked their doors magically.

163
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
 Good.

164
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
 We'll just stay in the car.

165
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:19,140
 Then this ghost baby will roll your windows down.

166
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,780
 That's such a bad combination, right?

167
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,460
 Being locked in a car with your windows rolled down.

168
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,700
 Now you're just vulnerable.

169
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,220
 You can't get out, but something can get in.

170
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,720
 Right?

171
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
 Something baby-sized.

172
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 Right?

173
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,200
 If it was a full-sized man outside my car.

174
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,600
 Not being able to roll my windows sucked.

175
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,920
 I remember once I picked a fight with a guy and I was driving a convertible Mustang and

176
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,320
 I kept cutting this guy off.

177
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
 I think he cut me off once, so then I kept cutting him off on purpose.

178
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,920
 I was being a jerk to put it lightly, right?

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,960
 And I was like laughing and I kept cutting him off and I'm like, "This is like on a city

180
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
 street too."

181
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,640
 Which wouldn't have been any better if it was in the middle of the country.

182
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,040
 Suddenly he cut me off, the light turned red, and he jumped out of his car with a crowbar.

183
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,680
 And I don't have a roof on my car.

184
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,120
 I don't have any way to protect myself and I'm like, "Uh-oh."

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,760
 I figured something like this might happen, but I guess I should have known what's going

186
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
 to happen.

187
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
 My brains are going to get bashed in.

188
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,440
 I'm in a car stuck in traffic with no roof.

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,480
 A guy just jumps out with his crowbar.

190
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,800
 I almost became a ghost that day.

191
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,200
 His girlfriend jumps out and is trying to drag him back to his car.

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 I'm sorry, bro.

193
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 I'm so sorry, dude.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
 I didn't even see you there.

195
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 I'm sorry.

196
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,600
 Then he got back in his car and I cut him off.

197
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,560
 The light turned green.

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,960
 I slid right in front of him.

199
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,360
 Almost caused a big car accident because I just slid right in front of him.

200
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,040
 I sped off and laughed and I made sure he knew I was laughing.

201
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
 I was waving at him and stuff like that.

202
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
 So I know what it's like.

203
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,200
 I know what it's like to be a Dennis the Menace type character in an automobile.

204
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,560
 I know what it's like to be trapped in an automobile even though I had no roof.

205
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,520
 My options are really limited.

206
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,640
 So when those roll down, you're locked in the car.

207
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
 There's a baby.

208
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,800
 There's a baby out there.

209
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,640
 A ghost baby.

210
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,760
 And then, because this guy has such massive legs, what he does is he kicks over trees

211
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,680
 and he makes trees fall down on the bridge and then you definitely can't get away.

212
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,560
 And then he goes, "Mama?

213
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,680
 Mama feet, baby.

214
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 Mama."

215
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,120
 And he starts walking towards the car all slow and creepy.

216
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,040
 I guess he could totally walk with a strut like he owns the place.

217
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 It's terrifying.

218
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
 It doesn't matter how he's walking.

219
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,440
 It's a ghost baby with massive legs who just kicked down a bunch of trees and blocked your

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,400
 escape.

221
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,480
 What's interesting is, so here we have this story on the one hand.

222
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,840
 We have so many tales of the Crybaby bridges that it's just a no one phenomenon.

223
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,160
 All over the world you can find a Crybaby bridge.

224
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,760
 What makes this one interesting is the deformed baby kicking over trees.

225
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,840
 At this point you have to go, "How much of it is true?"

226
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,080
 Like, "Jesus, probably none of it.

227
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,480
 Probably none of it.

228
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,440
 It involves a super strong baby kicking over trees."

229
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 But it says that this baby is always looking for his mom and people are always going out

230
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
 here.

231
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,800
 Like, I just randomly found a group of ghost hunters.

232
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,600
 These two ghost hunters who were driving out there trying to hear the baby.

233
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 They didn't hear anything.

234
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,920
 And then they said, "As we were out there another car pulled up so we left but we figured

235
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,880
 they were also just some kids out there trying to find a ghost baby."

236
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,400
 Like, a lot of people are going out here.

237
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,160
 You have to wonder, "How many people have gone missing?

238
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,720
 How many trees have been kicked over?"

239
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
 Probably none.

240
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 Right?

241
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,480
 But it's an interesting story because it's such a bizarre, it's such a specifically

242
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,560
 bizarre ghost story.

243
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,760
 A mutant baby kicking over trees.

244
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,880
 I wonder if they have had, like, one time back in the 1950s, a tree just happened to

245
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,440
 fall over and they connect.

246
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,960
 They then back, then they made up the story about how did that tree fall over?

247
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 "Oh, the baby wants to kick it over."

248
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
 They're like, "You're an idiot."

249
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,240
 Do you think that's a reasonable explanation?

250
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,640
 It might have been that hurricane that was going on.

251
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,920
 I don't know where the mutated baby came in.

252
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,080
 Obviously, I couldn't find any proof of this.

253
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,080
 There were no news reports of a teenage mother throwing her baby off the bridge and then

254
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
 getting arrested and stuff like that.

255
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,480
 And as she's being dragged off to the jail, she's like, "You should have seen his legs.

256
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
 You should have seen his legs.

257
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
 You would have done it too.

258
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,000
 You would have thrown him off the bridge."

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 None of that.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 None of that.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,960
 So I don't know how we went from a cry baby, a very standard cry baby bridge story, to

262
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 a mutant baby with big old calves.

263
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,800
 But an interesting story nonetheless.

264
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,720
 And the next story we're going to see also in Delaware kind of makes you think that

265
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,880
 Delaware hates children.

266
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,240
 That's kind of what I'm thinking here.

267
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,440
 Because on the other side of Smyrna, we're still in Smyrna, "Gertie, let's go ahead

268
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,160
 and have you drive the Jayson Jalopy around town.

269
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,320
 We're headed out to the Vila House."

270
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,160
 The Vila House is another ghost story that I really tried to find some proof that had

271
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,360
 happened.

272
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,280
 And it's one of those stories that I'm glad I didn't find anything.

273
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,480
 Because this one's absolutely horrifying.

274
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,440
 We walk into the Vila House and people are like, "What are you guys doing here?

275
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,680
 We're like, "Albert Ghost Hunters, don't worry about it."

276
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,440
 We're sitting in the living room and we see a little boy standing in the corner of the

277
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,500
 room.

278
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,480
 That kid actually is dead.

279
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,600
 That's a ghost you're looking at.

280
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,160
 And at that point you notice that the boy is holding a funnel.

281
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
 He's just holding a funnel.

282
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,400
 And you'll see him kind of walk around the living room holding this funnel.

283
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,440
 We're trying to throw ping pong balls in it.

284
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
 That's a whole ghost story.

285
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,080
 There's a little boy who walks around with a funnel in this house.

286
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,480
 But you go with, "Why?

287
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,680
 Why is this kid walking around with this funnel?"

288
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,960
 Apparently, again I wasn't able to find any proof of this and I'm very, very thankful

289
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,720
 I wasn't able to.

290
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,080
 Apparently at this house, some people say this happened before the house was even built

291
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
 there.

292
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,440
 That this house was built on his grave.

293
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,400
 Other versions of the story said this happened in the villa house.

294
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,360
 But this young boy had a horrible father, horrible, horrible dad.

295
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,080
 And one day the dad was like, "I'm super crazy today."

296
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:39,280
 And he tied up his son, stuck a funnel in his mouth, and poured gasoline down the boy's

297
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,600
 throat.

298
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,560
 And then, you guys kind of know where this is going unfortunately, right?

299
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,840
 No one's like, "Oh, I'm done.

300
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
 You're full of gasoline."

301
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,120
 He poured gasoline down this kid's throat, poured gasoline all over this kid's face,

302
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,600
 and he lit the boy on fire.

303
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 Burned him up.

304
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,920
 And so that's why he's standing there holding the funnel in this house.

305
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,640
 Other people say that at this house sometimes when you're in the bathroom, of course, I

306
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,360
 hate bathroom, ghost is the scariest.

307
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,080
 When you're in the bathroom, you know when you shut the light off and there is that moment

308
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,880
 where you hit the switch and it goes from light to dark.

309
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
 There's like a brief moment in between that it's never instantaneous.

310
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,200
 In the moment as the light is going off, but before full darkness has enveloped you, you'll

311
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,240
 see the boy standing behind you in the mirror.

312
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,200
 I would rather be walking around the house the whole time than that.

313
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 That's just terrifying.

314
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,320
 I guess if he was walking around when I was taking a shower, that's the worst of both worlds.

315
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,080
 But funnel or no funnel, this boy may have died in this house.

316
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,280
 Again, I couldn't find any proof that this horrible crime actually happened.

317
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,840
 One of the reasons why I wanted to highlight that one, and we'll move on to the next story

318
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,280
 in a second, but I want to highlight that one because we'll see this from time to time.

319
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,880
 We'll see ghosts holding their instrument of destruction, the way that they died, they

320
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,040
 will continue to have it in the afterlife.

321
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,640
 It's not super common, but I wonder why that is.

322
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,840
 Because not everyone who gets their head chopped off walks around with an axe, not everyone

323
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,960
 who gets hung walks around with a noose, but every show often we'll see ghosts like this,

324
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,520
 where they are holding something that killed them.

325
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,000
 I have another story coming up that also has that characteristic of it.

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,080
 It's fairly rare.

327
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,440
 The boy walking around holding a funnel for the rest of his life.

328
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,080
 For all I know, he loved funnels.

329
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,760
 It was his favorite activity, and his dad just got tired of it and put a funnel in his

330
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,760
 mouth one day.

331
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,960
 I don't know.

332
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,920
 I don't know why some ghosts have this.

333
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,680
 I also don't know why some ghosts have gory, bloody heads chopped off.

334
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,120
 And then there are people who died in the Civil War who were like walking around their home

335
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,320
 in a crisp uniform, even though they got gangrene and their leg was sawed off on some table

336
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
 in the middle of Charlottesville.

337
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,720
 I don't know why some ghosts appear whole and some don't.

338
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,800
 Why some ghosts hold the way or carry the way that they've died into the afterlife.

339
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,280
 But just a fascinating story.

340
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,120
 Gertie, Gwyn Inor, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carpenter

341
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,800
 copter we are leaving behind Delaware.

342
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:19,760
 We are headed all the way out to Richmond, Virginia.

343
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,240
 The year is 1982.

344
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
 We're in Richmond, Virginia.

345
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
 We're at a Sheraton hotel.

346
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 Actually we're working there.

347
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,760
 We all got jobs as bell hops and maids and I'm the manager.

348
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 I'm Mr. Moseby.

349
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,960
 Oh, second Cody, you stop it.

350
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,560
 We're all working at the Sheraton hotel.

351
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,520
 And I was like, you guys better keep those rooms spick and span because the band The

352
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,720
 Kinks is coming here soon.

353
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,800
 And you're like, yes, sir.

354
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,640
 And you're like marching around and you're cleaning stuff up and brushing things.

355
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,680
 And I'm sitting there and I'm like, my favorite band, The Kinks.

356
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,920
 They're the ones who have that song.

357
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,560
 You really like me now.

358
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,960
 Or what is it called?

359
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,760
 Yeah, you really like me now.

360
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,240
 And I'm like sitting there and I'm humming it to myself and you're just like, oh man,

361
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 what a lousy boss.

362
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,120
 That's not even the name of the song.

363
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,440
 Did he not write down the name of The Kinks number one song?

364
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,880
 I'm just sitting there and listening to The Kinks on my record player and I was like,

365
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
 dude, I can't believe The Kinks are coming to this hotel.

366
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,560
 And then I hear a bunch of girls outside the hotel screaming.

367
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,920
 And I was like, oh, that must be The Kinks.

368
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,840
 And sure enough, I walk outside the office.

369
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,480
 We're all standing in line like we have like basically when the emperor was on the Death

370
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
 Star where all standing in these lines.

371
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,000
 And The Kinks are walking in the Sheraton hotel.

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,200
 You got some guys that didn't write down their names, but the one we're going to look at is

373
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 Dave Davies.

374
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,600
 This 35 year old dude, he's the member of The Kinks.

375
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,720
 And I'm like, Dave Davies, you're my favorite one.

376
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,840
 The reason why I only wrote your name down and they're like, what?

377
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,480
 I'm like, The Kinks, you're so good.

378
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
 I love all your music.

379
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,920
 I love that one song especially.

380
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,120
 And I'm shaking their hands and we're all like shaking the hands of all these.

381
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
 How many people are in The Kinks?

382
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
 I don't know.

383
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,320
 But Dave Davies, he's like, oh, Bollocks, another hotel in the old colonies.

384
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
 Yes.

385
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,840
 I'm used to playing music over here because I'm in The Kinks, but something's wrong.

386
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,440
 And we see him kind of wander off.

387
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
 So we're like, we don't care about the other members of The Kinks.

388
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
 So we're kind of following Dave Davies.

389
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,200
 He's walking through the hotel and he's like, why does my body feel so weird?

390
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,800
 And he walks into his room and he lays down on his bed and we're hanging out.

391
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,680
 We're just standing over him as he's laying in bed.

392
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,360
 He's like, oh, my body.

393
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,800
 Why do I not feel like me old self?

394
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:49,640
 And then, beamed into his nose are the strongest smells he's ever smelled.

395
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,960
 He sits up straight and goes, ah, lie me.

396
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,480
 That is pure frankincense.

397
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,040
 Oh, is that a bit of rose vinegar?

398
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 Ah, yes.

399
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,240
 Lilex in the spring.

400
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,720
 So why am I smelling all of these smells?

401
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,360
 Why are they, he described these things as being so fragrant.

402
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,800
 It was like you could scoop them up with a spoon.

403
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,880
 He smells all of these smells just obliterating his nostrils in a good way.

404
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,920
 It's that good kind of obliteration.

405
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:32,280
 And what he comes to realize is he is being contacted by five mystical beings.

406
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:39,760
 Is not just from another world, but from another reality, another dimension.

407
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:52,240
 A place so unlike what we know as reality, they have truly ascended over all reality.

408
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,840
 He says that these smells are actually the way that these five mystical beings are talking

409
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,600
 to him.

410
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:06,360
 He's able to decipher the smells to receive these messages from the ascended ones.

411
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,760
 Now I know what you're thinking.

412
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,160
 He's having a stroke, right?

413
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:20,440
 He's having some sort of serious medical complication that's causing him to hallucinate these smells.

414
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,680
 Now I've mentioned before on this show when I get really, really, really stressed out,

415
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,800
 I will hallucinate smells.

416
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,560
 That's when I know that I need some rest.

417
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,640
 I'll actually start to smell raw sewage.

418
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,520
 It's not because I'm walking by a Taco Bell.

419
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,160
 It's not because I'm walking by a Taco Bell dumpster.

420
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,280
 I can smell raw sewage wherever I go.

421
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,120
 And that's when I know I'm too stressed out.

422
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,240
 That's when I kind of got to take a step back.

423
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,360
 So I mean you would think maybe this guy's having a stroke.

424
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,600
 Maybe this guy's under a bunch of stress.

425
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,520
 But no, he's not having a stroke.

426
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,400
 He's actually smelling these smells that don't exist.

427
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,960
 He's actually able to decipher what they're telling him.

428
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,080
 Then, while he's on tour in America, all of this stuff is going on, he feels himself float

429
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,360
 outside of his own body.

430
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,240
 The thing that is truly Dave Davies has now left his physical form.

431
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,400
 He's floating around the hotel room.

432
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,840
 He's like, "Oh, this is kind of weird."

433
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,280
 But I'm not having a stroke.

434
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
 This is totally fine.

435
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,840
 This is totally fine.

436
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,880
 Remember the kinks.

437
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,720
 He continues to smell the smells.

438
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,120
 He continues to feel like he's outside of his body.

439
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:49,480
 And as this tour is going on, at one point he feels like a bow constrictor.

440
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,520
 A unseen bow constrictor begins to wrap around his forehead and starts to squeeze tighter.

441
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,120
 And tighter.

442
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,400
 And tighter.

443
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,240
 He can feel the immense pressure inside his brain.

444
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,480
 He feels like his head's going to crack open.

445
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,440
 My Jesus, this guy's clearly having some sort of medical emergency.

446
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,200
 All this stuff is happening in a matter of days.

447
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,920
 I think it happens over the course of a month or two.

448
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,800
 And he's hallucinating smells.

449
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
 He's floating outside of his body.

450
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,800
 That's never a really good thing if you do it accidentally.

451
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,280
 He feels like his head's about to pop open.

452
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,520
 Well, luckily it's not a medical event.

453
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,480
 Luckily, because the voice is in his head, starts to tell him, "Hey, no, no, no, it's

454
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
 cool.

455
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,040
 We were tickling your nose with descents.

456
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,600
 We were communicating with you that way."

457
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,720
 And now are these voices in your head.

458
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,960
 So we can talk to you directly.

459
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:58,240
 But, be careful what you say about us.

460
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,040
 Be careful what you say about us.

461
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,320
 Don't reveal everything we're going to tell you.

462
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,400
 Now he was at the time dating a woman named Nancy Evans.

463
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,760
 And he started telling her what was going on, but only certain parts because the five

464
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,760
 ascended ones were telling him, "We're going to say this, but don't tell Nancy.

465
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,280
 Don't tell Nancy this part."

466
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,760
 Now that is super typical with schizophrenia.

467
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,480
 That is super typical with hearing voices, right?

468
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,680
 The voices may actually, they know that these outside people exist in your life, these family

469
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,160
 and these friends and these loved ones, and they will try to get you to deceive them.

470
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,360
 Oh no, everything's fine, everything's fine, they'll tell you not to tell them they exist

471
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
 or they'll tell you certain things and they'll say, "But don't tell Nancy I said that."

472
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,560
 Again, it sounds like a serious medical event.

473
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,280
 All of these things, if you went to a doctor, you would get diagnosed with some, you'd

474
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,400
 probably be hospitalized.

475
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,360
 Now I've been using the term the ascended masters.

476
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,320
 He uses the term the intelligences.

477
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,200
 That's what he calls these five mystical beings that are communicating with him and they begin

478
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,640
 to reveal truths to him.

479
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:22,040
 They say humans exist in a sea of energy.

480
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,000
 What we see as reality is not truly the reality.

481
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,400
 We're actually just swimming in this wide open ocean of nothing but pure energy, much

482
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,040
 like fish, right?

483
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,360
 When you say you're swimming in energy, he compares the intelligences and pair us to

484
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:43,080
 mental fish swimming unaware through the ocean.

485
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:50,560
 It is also revealed by the intelligences that nearby Earth there is a massive spaceship

486
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:58,520
 that has computers on it and in these computers there is information about every man, woman

487
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,720
 and child who have ever lived on the planet Earth.

488
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:10,120
 I don't know if that includes mutant babies and Delaware, but every single person who has

489
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,920
 ever lived on Earth, their information is stored in these computers.

490
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,960
 These aliens or these intelligences also tell him that they want to help him evolve to a

491
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,920
 higher vibrational level.

492
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,360
 They want to help him ascend.

493
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,440
 And the way to do that is to stop having sex.

494
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
 He's a rock and roller.

495
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,800
 He was with a band called the Kinks, right?

496
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,040
 They got to live up to their name, but he is told no more sex.

497
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,760
 And almost like they could tell he wouldn't be able to stick to that one, the aliens numbed

498
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,760
 his entire genital region, actually his entire pelvis.

499
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,360
 And he goes, "Listen, I could walk totally normal.

500
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,000
 I could walk, I could do a little dance, I could play the guitar and put my leg up on

501
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 one of the speakers.

502
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,480
 Wano, no, no, no, no, you got me going."

503
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,640
 But I couldn't feel my junk.

504
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,800
 It was completely numb.

505
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 Now listen, when I was reading this I go, "This guy's clearly had a stroke.

506
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,680
 If not a stroke, an aneurysm, or some sort of medical condition.

507
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:35,520
 These all could be explained away by underlying mental illness finally coming to the surface,

508
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,200
 a physical illness coming to the surface, leaving your body feeling parts of your body

509
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,080
 being numb, very least a really bad pinched nerve, but also a stroke like he can't feel

510
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,560
 parts of his body."

511
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,960
 But it's funny because when I read the story, that's what I was thinking.

512
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,960
 I read a bunch of different sources on this because Dave Davies is really, really open

513
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
 about this.

514
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,000
 And I think that's fascinating too.

515
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,920
 He ended up writing a book called "Living on a Thin Line," which I guess is the name

516
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,840
 of one of his songs or a line from one of their songs.

517
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,520
 He's written two autobiographies and in his second autobiography he talks about the story

518
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,080
 and he goes, "Yeah, I was going through all this stuff.

519
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,280
 These intelligences were communicating with me."

520
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,200
 And at the time in 1982, when they're on tour, he's giving press interviews.

521
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,960
 He's talking to radio DJs.

522
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
 He's talking to newspaper.

523
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,440
 You know, as you're coming into towns, the local media does a story on them to talk

524
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,680
 about, "Hey, the kinks are coming here.

525
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,200
 The kinks sell more tickets to their concerts because people are going to go see them because

526
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,920
 they're writing about the newspaper, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

 Dave Davies was able to take a look at these amazing messages

745
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,320
 he was getting from the intelligences

746
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,320
 and compare it to the day to day life,

747
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
 the day to day reality we all live.

748
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,320
 He was able to look at those two and tell the difference

749
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,320
 between the madness and the sanity.

750
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,320

751
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,320
 who couldn't tell that difference

752
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,320
 and truly innocent people

753
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,320
 ended up losing their lives.
