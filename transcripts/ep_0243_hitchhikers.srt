1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 An alien reptilian creature is spotted on the side of a road and it stirred up some interesting emotions in me.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a look at some haunted hitchhiking roads in California.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Yes, yes, it's an interactive adventure. Yes, yes, it's from Backpackerverse, but some of these stories creepily enough are true today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover so we're just gonna go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Or two, this is our second episode of Alien Week. I said in the last episode I know each episode will have a story that since chills down your spine and then I talk about Trump saying aliens don't exist.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And I was like, I didn't really think that one out. This one doesn't send chills down your spine. It had a very curious effect on me though, very curious effect on me.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So in 2015, the year 2015, on December 6th, a 63 year old man, I've never been jealous of a 63 year old man before, but a 63 year old man is driving through the back streets or like around Oklahoma City.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It's 430 in the morning, he's driving around. Now if you want to go here, you may know the area because I want to go here.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 He's driving down Southwest 29th Street and he's driving through 430 in the morning and he's on his way to work.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And he sees a bean, some sort of figure, jump up on the side of the road, out of like a culvert.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So there's like a little ditch that has water that goes through a little tunnel under a road. I had to look up what a culvert was.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So I'm telling you, if you don't know, I had to look it up. Anyways, he jumps up out of a culvert, or she, or it, we're going to say she,

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 she jumps up out of a culvert and she stands there for about 60 seconds looking at this man as he's driving his car.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 And he's freaking out because he sees this thing. This is how he describes it.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 It had large eyes and small pointed ears. Its eyes were orange with no glow when the headlights hit them.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It had a small mouth with a nose similar to a cat. It had three toes curled over the edge of the curb with heels like a human.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Extremely large thighs that matched the base of its tail. Its tail was extremely long with the huge base tapering down to no bigger than a matchstick.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 He said it was about three feet tall and its skin, it was a reptilian looking, even though that sounds fairly feline.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 He got the idea that it was a reptilian looking because it had like scales, had like lizard skin, but it was like a creamy white, almost iridescent skin,

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 pearl you could say. And it's looking at him and he takes all this in in a brief moment.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And he said it looks like he was trying to figure out if it could cross the road before I hit it with my car. And all of a sudden it darted off and jumped into the other side of the road.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 He said that this thing appeared to be very intelligent, very intelligent creature.

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Now you're thinking, okay Jason, reptilian maybe, you know, kangaroo escaped from the zoo that also has scales and stuff like that.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 But reptilian, reptilian creature, you're not a huge fan of reptilians. You're always poo pooing over all the humanoid reptilian.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 That's true. That's true. Until I saw a picture of this thing.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Now before you get excited, it's not a photograph, but he drew, somebody drew, a drawing of what he saw.

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I fell in love. I fell in love with a reptile.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 This thing, it's a girl. It's a girl, creamy white skin, iridescent scales that shine underneath the headlights.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Thick thighs. These thighs are three times thicker than the rest of its body.

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Let's get it on. Let's get it on, reptilian girl, because okay, here's the thing.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I don't like reptilians. I don't even really like reptiles, but this thing man has a little cat face, little like pearl colored scales.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And before you think I'm into like some creepy stuff, he said it was intelligent, so that means it can consent.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's not bestiality. This thing is like smart and why can't it talk and figure out whether or not it can cross it.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 That's not true. Dogs get hit by cars all the time. This thing, he said, seemed extremely intelligent.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 You would never say that about an animal, so you know you can have a conversation with her to go out to dinner, you know, talk to her for a bit.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 This thing, I am now coining the term kilf. Cryptid I'd like to have sexual relations with. It's a kilf.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 This thing is hot dude. You know me man, I like thick thighs dude. I like you know, and like it's all fit.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It's like can run across the, it's like thick, but it can like run across streets before cars hit it.

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Dude, and I know you're thinking Jason, you're just doing a bit. I want you to go, I know you're like Jason, listen to me podcasting my car.

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I can't keep clicking on links. When you're at home, by yourself, you have some private time.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Click on the link below. Look at the photo of this kilf and tell me you don't want to cuddle up next to it.

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Now I have to admit, three feet is way too short. That's not something that I'm into other than the height thing, which I can overlook because everything else is so, I mean, if it was a dude, I guess that's a deal breaker too.

44
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But even the way it's drawn looks like a chick. So creamy reptilian woman, hop on over to Hood River. I'll show you a good time.

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I'll take you to my leader. So anyways, let's go ahead and move on. That's our alien story for today. So that didn't send chills down your spine. It sent chills up mine.

46
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Okay, so now you're thinking Jason, your alien week is not off to your good start. Trust me, I like those stories, but if you're looking for spooky alien stories, next three days are quite chilling.

47
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 You're like Jason, you already said that yesterday, and you talked about Trump and UFOs. And now you're talking about banging an alien that might not even be an alien. It could be an escaped kangaroo.

48
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Anyways, it's intelligent. It can consent, right? Extremely intelligent. Extremely intelligent. Anyways, let's go ahead and move fast my kilf story. Let's move on to Backpackerverse.

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Now, Backpackerverse, quick introduction, is a website that is notorious for just making stuff up out of whole cloth, which is quite entertaining in and of itself.

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And the comments are always hilarious because people go, "That place is haunted." I don't even know why they have comments on their page because people are always like disputing the fact that places are haunted.

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 But I had such a good time covering them. And this one, some of the stories are actually true. Shocking, aren't they? Shocking. And we'll cover those as well.

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But first, I want you to pick a number between one and five. Okay, you got it? Okay, remember that number.

53
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Now, we're going to go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy. We're going to go for a ride. Now, as far as the story is concerned, I'm simply, I'm the AI. I'm the kit. I'm the little whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

54
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 That's a dated reference. And it, kit, I'm not going to explain who kit is. I'm a talking car. I'm the Jason Jalopy because I'm not picking a number. I'm not getting trapped in any of these hellish experiences.

55
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So, first off, we're going to Proctor Valley in San Diego County. So, you're driving me, this is going to get weird. I'm the car, you're driving me around. It's 1 AM. The moon is out and everything's spooky.

56
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Fog drifting across the road. A coyote in the distance. That's a wolf. Wait, no, it's a coyote. Coyote's a wolf, right? Kind of, their dog.

57
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Anyways, there's, you hear, you hear a canine type howling out in the field. And you see a young woman walking down the street holding her thumb out.

58
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 A couple of pornoes started off like this. Quite a few horror movies as well. Pick your poison. So, you don't know. It's 50/50, really. Actually, it's like 90/10. 90% you're going to get murdered.

59
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 You pull over and you pick up this young woman and she gets into your car. If you pick up a hitchhiker, you put them in the back seat. I picked up hitchhikers. Well, technically, they weren't hitchhikers.

60
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 There was this mother and her son or his grandma and her son whose car broke down and I gave them a ride to a grocery store. And when I say son, the dude was in his 20s.

61
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 I think the mom said in the front seat, but yeah, I don't know the hitchhiker etiquette. Once I was driving down the road, I used to look like such a, like, I had a big, puffy beard and totally wild hair.

62
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And I was driving around my, I think it was the Ford Mustang and I was full of garbage. I'm driving down Rio Linda, out in Rio Linda, out by Sacramento.

63
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I was driving down the road and I looked like just like a serial killer and no joke. I was driving down Rio Linda, through Rio Linda and I see a hitchhiker on the road in front of me and he has his thumb out.

64
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And he sees me driving and when he gets going to look at me, he puts his hands in his pocket. I was too scuzzy looking for a hitchhiker to get in my car.

65
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 But anyway, so, where were we going? Oh yeah, so you picked this woman up. You're like Jason, just tell the damn ghost stories. You pick this woman up, she gets into your, let's say your front seat, because she's an attractive young woman.

66
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And she turns to you and she goes, "Thank you for the ride." And you're like, "Hey, no problem. Where are you headed?" And she goes, "That depends."

67
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 "Did you pick number five?" And you go, "Yeah, I picked number five."

68
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So, according to Backpackerverse, the legend of Proctor Valley Road is this, that one day there were these two college boys, they were driving down Proctor Valley Road, and they see the hitchhiker of a young woman and they pick her up.

69
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And they go missing. They go missing for four days.

70
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Friends, family, police are searching the area, can't find them. On the fifth day, one of the college boys appears on the side of the road and he was bawling his eyes out.

71
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And when the authorities get there, they go, "What happened? What happened?" And he said, "It wasn't me who did it. It wasn't me who did it. It wasn't me who did it."

72
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Just catatonic, crazy. The other friend was never found. And the legend goes that a young woman was raped and murdered on this road, and her spirit is now hunting other men who drive down Proctor Valley Road.

73
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Which would make sense why he's saying like this, the implication is that they were obviously taking some sort of hellscape universe, and she was punishing them for her own rape and murder, and he's like, "I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it."

74
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Now, there's no proof of any of that happening. I did look up Proctor Valley Road, though, and it is known to be haunted. It's known to be plagued by something. This is what I don't understand about Backpackerverse.

75
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So that story, it's a creepy ghost story, like giving credit. That's a creepy ghost story you would tell your babysitter before you left her alone with your kids.

76
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Proctor Valley does have this thing known as the Proctor Valley Monster, and it is actually like, some people have compared it to Bigfoot, some people have compared it to a deranged cow.

77
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It's a fairly well-known monster in the area, but there's no story of this hitchhiking ghost. However, if you pick number five, you disappear. No one ever finds you again, and you are forever tormented in a hellish dark dimension by a hitchhiker who believes all men are responsible for her crime.

78
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 That got a little topical there real quick. But anyways, let's navigate, let's go away from that subject.

79
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And let's go on to Hicks Road in San Jose. Now, Hicks Road in San Jose, it's 2 a.m. It's dark and foreboding. You don't know what you're doing out this late. You don't know why you're driving a car that sounds exactly like a podcast host that you listen to.

80
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And you're trying to figure out why he keeps trying to drive to Oklahoma City. You're like, "Dude, why do you keep changing the GPS cord in this Oklahoma City?" But you're driving down Hicks Road.

81
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And you see on the side of the road a very disturbing thing in the middle of the night. You see a young boy holding a baby. Has his thumb out.

82
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Now, all three of those things are creepy. Little boy in the middle of the night, little boy holding a baby, little boy hitchhiker. Those are all creepy things to see in the middle of the night.

83
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Which you're driving by. And you're not an idiot. Like, maybe you do want to stop and pick this kid up with a baby. It would be questionable either way. I threw you a band and a kid.

84
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And you're just a jerk or you let a possible serial killer possess spirit into your car. I guess really, that should kind of show you how I look at life.

85
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 If I'm driving down the road and see a kid and a baby, I'm going to assume it's some sort of spirit rather than like people who have just escaped a canapper or trying to flag down help because their parents are having heart attacks at their campsite.

86
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Anyways, you're driving and you see the little boy holding his thumb up and then he holds up his fingers to hold up the number three. You're like, "Oh, that's the number I picked. I picked number three. What a coincidence."

87
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 So this comes from a story, according to Backpackerverse, where a young woman, I have to put that in here. Some of them are true.

88
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 This woman was driving down Hicks Road and she saw the little boy holding the baby. Now she doesn't stop for him. She decides to keep driving. And she sees in her rearview mirror standing by the side of the road, the boy still holding his thumb up, but now he's glaring at her.

89
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 She's like, "That's kind of weird. Why is that kid so pissed off? I didn't pick him up in the middle of the night."

90
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But then the little boy, you'll understand why I'm doing this story, then the little boy is no longer on the side of the road. He's in her backseat of her car and the baby is screaming at an ear piercing level. And he says to her, "He shouldn't have done that."

91
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And the boy and the baby vanish. But for the next two weeks, the woman heard the baby's piercing scream in her ear, no matter where she went, no matter what she did, and eventually she shot herself in the head.

92
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Now, don't feel bad that none of that happened. A woman did not actually kill herself because of that. Although I do have to say that would be something that I think would be easy to trigger someone to kill themselves.

93
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Like, if you had a baby screaming in your head, I don't moms do, but eventually, you know, moms or parents and stuff like that can like, swat the baby to sleep, swaddle the baby to sleep, rock it to sleep, whatever. I don't have a baby.

94
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 This would be a constant baby screaming in your ear would drive you mad. But again, it didn't happen so don't feel bad.

95
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 But if you pick number three, you drive past that kid and you hear that piercing "weeeeeee" in your ear as you see the little boy in your back seat going, "You shouldn't have done that number three."

96
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 You can't avoid the sound. You can't avoid the sound that's driving you mad. But to be fair, number three, I'll give you the out. You can actually pick up the kid.

97
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Let's say that because you might not be as heartless as me and this fictional woman. You pick up the kid and he goes, "Thanks."

98
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And he gets in the back seat of your car and now you've just adopted a ghost kid and a ghost baby.

99
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So the kid isn't crying all the time in your ear, but you do have to pick up extra hours at your job to pay for them to go to ghost school.

100
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So, you know, pick your poison. One of them you're driven insane by the sound of a piercing baby.

101
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The other one you have a 10-year-old and a baby that never age and exist forever and you have to take care of them.

102
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 They're playing Ghost Nintendo. Ghosts and Goblins is their favorite game. Ghostbusters gives them nightmares and they listen to the song "Ghost Town" on repeat every day.

103
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 So then you just end up killing yourself because of that.

104
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So let's go ahead and now we move on to San Diego Freeway. And this is an alcohol or near alcohol.

105
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 You're driving down San Diego Freeway, it's three in the morning, and you see a hitchhiker on the side of the road.

106
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 You're like, "That sounds familiar. Just tell us there's a hitchhiker. You don't have to build a scene each time."

107
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 You're driving down the freeway. You see a hitchhiker by the side of the road.

108
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It's a teenager with sunken eyes, hollow cheekbones, and moles on his face.

109
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You're like, "Oh, it's kind of weird. Kind of a weird combination."

110
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So anyways, you stop and you pull over to pick them up.

111
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Because you've learned that that's probably better than having a baby scream in your ear.

112
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 You pull over, you pick them up, and he's like, "Thank you. You want to play Magic the Gathering with me?"

113
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And you're like, "Oh great. He's one of those teenagers. One of those cool teenagers."

114
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And you're like, "Happy that you picked up a fellow Magic player."

115
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Anyways, you guys talk about Modern Horizons for a while as you're driving home.

116
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And then you realize that where he wants to go is only a few blocks from your house.

117
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 You're like, "That's kind of a creepy coincidence."

118
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 He gets out of the car, and then as he's walking away, he turns to you and he goes,

119
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 "Hey, what number did you pick?"

120
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And you go, "Pick number one."

121
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 That's what I thought, man. You look like a number one.

122
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 But it's not me. He just walks away.

123
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And the next day, you wake up and your pet is killed. Whatever pet it is.

124
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Even if you have like a pet, Instructable Rhino, it's killed.

125
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And written in blood next to your pet, it says, "I'm done for now."

126
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Now to be fair, that's fairly tame. You didn't get sucked into a hellish landscape.

127
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 You're not tormented by a baby or have to raise two ghost kids that aren't your own.

128
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But this was the story that was told by Backpackerverse, that a woman picked up this creepy kid

129
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 that he was dropped off... His house was a few streets over from her house,

130
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 and the next day her cat was cut open.

131
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Now, this story does actually have some truth behind it.

132
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Not the ghost part. The real part, which is actually far more terrifying.

133
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 On San Diego Freeway, in El Cajon, near El Cajon, 1958, it's November,

134
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 there's a guy driving home, his name is... This is 100% true.

135
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 This guy's driving home, his name is Thomas Pindergast.

136
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 He sees a teenage boy walking down the freeway.

137
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 This is what's so funny. This story is far more terrifying than, "I woke up and my cat was killed."

138
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Anyways, he picks up the teenager. The teenager's name was Carl Alfred Eater.

139
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So again, whenever there's three names, serial killer.

140
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 He takes the kid home and feels bad for the kid, talking to him for a bit,

141
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 feels bad about his circumstances, and says, "You can stay with my family for a while."

142
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 One month later, Thomas comes home from work, and his family of five, wife, four kids, murdered.

143
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Carl gets caught a couple days later, and he says, "What happened was the first murder was on accident."

144
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 As will happen, the first murder, this kid was making too much noise.

145
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 He was crying. That's weird. I didn't make that connection before.

146
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 The first one was an accident, it was a little kid who was crying too much.

147
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 He ended up killing him on accident, he says.

148
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Then the mom says, "Call the doctor, call the doctor."

149
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Then he turns around and shoots the mom.

150
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Then he cut the throats of two of the kids, and then two of the older kids are at school,

151
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 and he waited at the house for them to come home.

152
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 When they walked through the door, he slit their throats as well, and then ran, and they caught him two days later.

153
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 He ended up going to prison. He was found guilty for multiple murders.

154
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And because it was in California, and the story took place in the 50s and the 60s,

155
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 they put him in a minimum security prison, and one day he just walked away.

156
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And they've never seen him since.

157
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 So, sleep tight, residents of El Cajon.

158
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 They think the guy is still out there, he would be in about his 70s, and that's where this ghost story comes from.

159
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 That is far more to--oh, your cat's chopped up. Come on, man.

160
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Really? You just had a guy get sucked into a rape dimension.

161
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 If you're not gonna make stuff up, just make stuff up.

162
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Cat. Come on.

163
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 This is based on a real thing, and that's the best you could come up with.

164
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 A woman wakes up, or a cat's dead.

165
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So, we've had the ghost of a murdered rape victim.

166
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Then we have the two-for-one ghost of the boy and his little baby.

167
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I wonder if it was his baby. That's actually quite terrifying.

168
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And then we just had a ghost based on the true story of Carl Alfred Eater.

169
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So what's next for us, Jason? What's next?

170
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So, here we go. We're driving down Highway 101 in Prune, Dale.

171
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And as we're driving down the road, it's four in the morning, we see a billboard that says, "Are you scared yet?"

172
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 "You will be bobsboards.com."

173
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And you're like, "What's that? That's weird."

174
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And that is something we're gonna talk about tomorrow, because it is a definitely weird story.

175
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And I found it when I was researching whether or not these roads are actually haunted.

176
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So, it's a little teaser for tomorrow, bobsboards.com.

177
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 But, we passed the board, we passed the teaser for tomorrow's episode.

178
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 We're driving down the road.

179
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Now, it says here that I'm gonna read this quote exactly from...

180
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 from Backpackerverse. I'm gonna read this quote.

181
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 This is from a website. It's like 10 hitchhikers, 10 haunted hitchhikers in California.

182
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I'm obviously cutting out a bunch of them, but this one was just bizarre.

183
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Think about what we've dealt with before.

184
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Now we have, here's this quote.

185
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 "Highway 101 has been a hotspot for accidents for several years now."

186
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 While some attribute these...

187
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Well, while some attribute these to reckless drivers, several...

188
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Several claim a...

189
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 We've dealt with murdered rape ghosts and these hellish freaks and serial killers.

190
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 This one says...

191
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Just a black dude. Not a shadow person. Not a...

192
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Not a phantom, phantom with a hat. Just a black dude.

193
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Just a black dude is their villain in this story.

194
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Just a random black guy.

195
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Several claim a black man caused them to lose control of their vehicles.

196
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Like, what is up with... Okay, so anyways.

197
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 So, this one actually is kind of hard because the story itself is so funny

198
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 that it's hard to slot you into it, but I'll have to do it.

199
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I'll have to do it somehow, because I want to tell Backpacker vs. Actual Version of these events.

200
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 In 2009, a woman, so in this one if you pick this number you're a woman,

201
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 in 2009 a woman was driving down Highway 101 and she saw a black man hitchhiking

202
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 and she doesn't pick him up. She ignores him.

203
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 One mile down, she sees what's described as the body of a "large man" hanging from a tree.

204
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Now, what's funny is Backpacker vs. does never specifically say

205
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 if the black dude who's hitchhiking is the same black guy hanging from the tree.

206
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 They never describe the black guy as large, and they never describe the large man as black.

207
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I feel like the implication is it's the same guy, but I don't think they want to go that far with their made-up story.

208
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I don't want them... I don't think they want to, like, remind us of horrible lynchings to have this stupid website.

209
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 So, I don't even know why they're even going this far.

210
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 There was... I looked it up. I couldn't find any proof of this.

211
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 People do say they do have that Bob's board on there and we'll get to that in another episode,

212
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 but I think it's so funny because they want to build up this legend, but they never specifically want to say

213
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 she saw a black man hanging from a tree because they look... that's just so gruesome.

214
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 So, she sees a, quote, "a large man hanging from a tree." We don't know what his ethnicity is.

215
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 She gets out of the car when she sees the body hanging from the tree.

216
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Now, I wouldn't... I've already passed up a kid and a baby.

217
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 If I saw a man hanging from a tree, I'm going to assume it's too late to do anything.

218
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I would just drive to the nearest town or I forgot.

219
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 In 2019, I'll pull out my cell phone and call the police. I'm not going to get out. He's hanging.

220
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Anyways, she gets out of the car and the rope snaps and the body falls to the ground.

221
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 The large body falls to the ground and she runs over but she sees no body there. It doesn't exist.

222
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 At that point, she turns around and she sees the black man standing behind her and she says...

223
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 She sees the same black man as in "The Hitchhiker." Not the large man.

224
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 She sees the same black man with red eyes shining bright and a wicked smile on his mouth.

225
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And he says, "Miss, I need a ride." And the story just ends.

226
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 What happens after that? The woman obviously escaped the scenario because she's able to tell it.

227
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Did she go to the cops and she goes, "Yeah." And then I turn around and the black guy and they're like,

228
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 "Wait, wait, wait. The cops are like, "Wait, was the black guy the same guy hanging from the tree?"

229
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 The woman's like, "Listen, I really don't want to get into the details of it."

230
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But I turn around and the black guy said, "Miss, I need a ride."

231
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 The cops are looking at her and they're like, "And then what happened?" And she goes,

232
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "Well, I mean, that's the end of the story." And they're like, "Yeah, but I mean, did he disappear?

233
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Did he turn into a puff of smoke?" She's like, "No, that's just how the story ends."

234
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 You got back in your car, right? You came here right, yeah.

235
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Well, then what happened after he said, "Miss, I need a ride." And you getting into your car?

236
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 What happened? It's just nothing. Like, I don't understand how the story just ends like that.

237
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 But you might. Because if you picked number two, you picked number two, you turn around

238
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 and the man looks at you and goes, "Miss and/or, mister, I need a ride."

239
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And then you just give him a ride. You just give him a ride to a local town.

240
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 He gets out. He goes to a jazz festival. Has a good time.

241
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 So I guess that's probably your best bet is if you picked this dude up.

242
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 They come to the jazz festival. It's all good. You guys have a good time together.

243
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 That's probably the best ending you're going to get because now we're going to Old Stage Road.

244
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 We're going to wrap it up with Old Stage Road. This is in Salinas. It's five in the morning.

245
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Sun is starting to crest. It's not as dark as all the other creepy stories.

246
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 But in this story, you have a family. So I don't know if you have a family real life,

247
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 but in this story, you do. But you're a single person.

248
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 So you get you and your three kids. You're driving through Old Stage Road.

249
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And you see a man smoke a cigarette on the side of the road hitchhiking.

250
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 They're like, "Oh, pick him up. Pick him up."

251
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 I mean, this is another weird one. So you don't have a choice.

252
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 You've got to pick this person up. Oh, and you're number four, by the way,

253
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 because that's the only number left. So sorry.

254
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 You pick number four and you have no control over the rest of the story.

255
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 You're driving. You pick up a smoking hitchhiker to put into your car with your kids.

256
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 You're driving down the road and you're having a conversation.

257
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 You're like, "Hey, man, what's up? Have you played Magic the Other End?"

258
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And the guy's like, "No, that's for nerds, dude."

259
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 You're like, "Oh, sorry. You're putting away your commander deck."

260
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 You were hoping to play a game in the car. The car's swarming everywhere.

261
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 He looks at you now. He's like, "What a nerd."

262
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And so your kids are coughing. Your kids are like, "Coughing from the smoke."

263
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And you're like, "Hey, man, can you roll down your window?"

264
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Sure, and he rolls down his window, but just more he's smoking.

265
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Now he's smoking even more aggressively because all of the smoke's gone out of the car.

266
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 He likes to hotbox himself. Smoking even harder.

267
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Kids are like, "Dad or mom, please."

268
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 At that point, you're confused because you don't know if you're a dad or a mom.

269
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 This is a really weird dimensional portal you've fallen into.

270
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 But your kids are complaining. This guy's smoking a ton of cigarettes in your car.

271
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And eventually you're like, "Hey, dude, can you get out of my car?

272
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Look at my kids are complaining about all the cigarette smoke."

273
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And the dude doesn't get out of the car.

274
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Now, if you think this sounds really random, this is supposedly a story that happened

275
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 to a woman who had a bunch of kids in the car. She picked up a smoking hitchhiker.

276
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 So if it seems like I'm just making up random stuff, this supposedly actually happened.

277
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 But anyways, eventually you are able to convince the smoker to get out of your car.

278
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Which the whole thing is, is why would you pick up a smoking hitchhiker with a bunch of kids?

279
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 With a bunch of-- Why would you pick up a hitchhiker with your kids in your car?

280
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 I'm thinking when I'm reading it, she was hoping-- Like, back before Tinder,

281
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 she was hoping to get some strange. Like, she was hoping that she was going to pick up this handsome--

282
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 I don't know if he was handsome, she could have been desperate.

283
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 She was hoping to pick up this dude and he wanted to smoke so much

284
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 they would have went home and had sex while the kids were playing, I don't know, Rubik's Cube or whatever.

285
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 So, but that's not what happened. And that's not what's going to happen with you either.

286
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 You kick out the dude and then you're like, "Wasn't that rude?"

287
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And the kids are like, "It was rude you picked up a smoking hitchhiker in the first place, they're all mad at you."

288
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 "They're close, smell like smoke now, they're not going to have a good day."

289
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But you take them home and everyone goes to bed.

290
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And you're laying in bed and you're like, "Hmm, I wonder what it would have felt like to be with a hitchhiker for just one night."

291
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 "Wonder what his smoked filled kisses would have tasted like."

292
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And as you start to drift off to sleep, you hear your fire alarm go off

293
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 and you wake up and there's huge fire in the house

294
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 and only you and your youngest kids survive, the other two, die in the fire.

295
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Which is, that's quite grim. Much better than just being told I need a ride to a jazz festival.

296
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 So if you pick number four, you've lost two members of your fictional family that never existed.

297
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 You're like, "But in this reality they did, I'm so confused."

298
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Anyways, the story goes that the next day the firefighters were like, "We found what caused the source of the fire."

299
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And they hold, they show the woman, they show you a cigarette butt.

300
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And the implication is the guy like, "Showed up at your house."

301
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 That's not even really a ghost story. That's just a dude that you piss off, kicking out of your car,

302
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 going to your house and flicking a cigarette into your house and killing everybody.

303
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But I think the implication was he was some sort of ghost and it was a ghost cigarette, I'm not for sure.

304
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 But if you pick number four, I will send wreaths for your fictional kids who died these fictional deaths on this very real road.

305
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And what's funny is that this road actually is known to be haunted to the point that Zach Baggins and the ghost adventurers crew

306
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 went to Old Stage Road and did like an investigation there.

307
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 But let's wrap it up with this. I think it's kind of no one not to pick up hitchhikers.

308
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 I think it's kind of no one not to hitchhike.

309
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 It's probably one of the most dangerous things you can do on the road other than drink and a driving.

310
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I have no statistics to back that up, but it sounds awfully dangerous.

311
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 We know it's dangerous because how dangerous humans can be towards each other.

312
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 But when you add in the paranormal, when you add in a world of demons and vengeful spirits and malicious poltergeists

313
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 also populating the side of the road, also looking for a ride,

314
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 you have to ask yourself, how daring do you want to be?

315
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 How trusting do you want to be?

316
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Because you never know if you're picking up a person or a thing.

317
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And you never know if you're giving them a ride to their home or to yours.

318
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
