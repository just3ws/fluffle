1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
 If you find yourself traveling down an unmarked gravel road in Alaska, you may find yourself

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,000
 witnessing a terrifying and bloody sight.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,920
 And they would travel to Texas to visit the New London School District.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,860
 While the students were learning and the teachers were teaching, little did anyone know that

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:30,860
 a tragedy was about to strike that would change the world today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:42,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
 I'm your host Jason Carmoner.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,420
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,800
 I am having a great day but I'm sick and currently sick.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,460
 I don't know how much of my illness is spraying out of my mouth right now onto my microphone

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,380
 and I don't know what it is.

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,060
 Nowadays whenever anyone is even slightly under the weather, people go, "Is it COVID?"

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,060
 I don't know.

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,820
 It very well might be at this point.

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,660
 I've just been getting kind of sicker and sicker.

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,980
 I have some tests, COVID tests coming in tomorrow through Amazon.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,500
 So we'll find out but I mean again, like if I do have it, I'm hoping that it's just,

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
 you know, nothing.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,520
 But I guess we'll see how much I sweat out while I'm in this closet while I'm recording

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
 this episode.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
 Maybe it'll make me feel better.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
 Probably won't.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,400
 I'll probably get progressively more and more sick as the episode goes.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,600
 My morning, I didn't even go to work today which people who know me, it's like pulling

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,920
 teeth to get me to not show up to work.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,440
 I spent about four hours watching Dragon's Den on YouTube.

28
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,800
 That's pretty much been my entire morning and I said, "Okay, let's at least be slightly

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,880
 productive here.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
 Let's get some work done."

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,420
 So here I am recording another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio and someone who is joining

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,160
 us this episode, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
 supporters.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,780
 Everyone give it up for Super Fine, Volpine.

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
 Woohoo!

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,020
 Yeah, come on in Super Fine, Volpine.

37
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,860
 Welcome back to Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,360
 Super Fine, you're gonna be our Captain Art pilot this episode.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,460
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,560
 Trust me, I do.

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,980
 Just help spread the word about the show.

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,220
 You have no idea how much that helps out.

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,880
 Super Fine, I'd probably say that's ten feet away from me for this episode but I'm gonna

44
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
 toss you the keys.

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,040
 So the Jason Jalopy, go ahead and catch him in your little furry foxy hands.

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,280
 Let's all get on board, drive us all the way out.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 Two.

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,720
 Everyone hop on board, let's head all the way out.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
 Two.

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
 Alaska.

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,440
 Pup, pup, pup, pup, pup, pup, pup, pup.

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,600
 Driving on up to beautiful Alaska, the snows falling, catching snowflakes on our tongue.

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 Doing all that stuff.

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,180
 Maybe you should shut your mouth if you're in a car full of people.

55
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,600
 Well, anyways, you guys tie me up in the trunk.

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,460
 We finally get to Alaska, specifically we're headed to Chugyak, Alaska.

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,960
 Chugyak, Alaska.

58
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,600
 Now, Chugyak is an unincorporated area in Alaska.

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,220
 You can find it on a map but it's not technically a city, it's just like a town that's sitting

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
 there.

61
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,700
 Now a days, it's a modern town, right?

62
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,140
 The buildings, they have walls, they have things like that.

63
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,400
 But back in the day, we're headed all the way back in time to like when this town was

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,520
 first being set up, right?

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,960
 You had to build your own house.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,200
 You had to go out to the woods and like chop down trees and then put them in order.

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,620
 I've played with Lincoln Longs, I know how it's done.

68
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,360
 But we're going to meet this family that's in this area and we have a father.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,280
 We're going to go ahead and call him Joey and then his daughter, we'll call her Madeline

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,720
 and then there's a wife and a son and they're not really in the store so they don't even

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 get names.

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,140
 So you have a wife and a son, little baby boy, they're back at home and Joey and Madeline

73
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,740
 are out chopping down firewood for their fireplace because it's Alaska and it's super duper cold.

74
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,860
 Now Madeline always loved to help her papa, right?

75
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,940
 She was always like, "Dad, can I help you chop down those trees?"

76
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,180
 And he's like, "No, of course not.

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,780
 You're a little girl.

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,780
 You can't do that."

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,260
 And then she'd be like, "Dad, can I help you hunt bears?"

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,180
 And he's like, "Absolutely not.

81
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,180
 They'll eat you."

82
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,080
 Although I could use you as bait.

83
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,940
 But he loved his daughter, right?

84
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,080
 So he wouldn't just, it was not the fact that she was constantly trying to help him out

85
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,240
 that was annoying him.

86
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,740
 He did love his daughter.

87
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,600
 They went on these little adventures together.

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
 On this particular day, he was chopping up firewood.

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
 He was getting firewood, right?

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,000
 This was back in the day when we don't actually have a date for this story.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,920
 This is one of those stories that just took place sometime before the 1990s.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,720
 Chopping down trees to make firewood.

93
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,460
 So he's chopping down trees out in Alaska in the Chugyak area.

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,020
 He's chopping down trees and then chopping up the trees to make it little logs, little

95
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
 pieces of wood.

96
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,940
 Cords of wood, I think is what they're going.

97
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,380
 So him and his daughter can huff him back to the cabin and everyone could stay warm.

98
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,260
 But as he's cutting all this wood down, making all these little pieces of wood, he, obviously

99
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,580
 he needs to take a break because muscles are getting sore and stuff like that.

100
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,220
 So he knows that he needs to rest.

101
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,320
 He knows that he's a biological human and he needs to take a break every once in a while.

102
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,000
 However, he's also smart enough and I'm sure experience has taught him that Madeline, his

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 five year old daughter, he needs to be aware that her eagerness to help out is sometimes

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,240
 dumb, right?

105
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,040
 Obviously with the bear example.

106
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,600
 So as he's chopping down the trees and chopping down the wood and then he decides to take

107
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,760
 a break, he takes his mighty axe and he cleaves it into a nearby tree.

108
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,180
 A thunk!

109
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,500
 And he did that specifically because he is thinking, okay, if I leave the axe on the

110
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,420
 ground, Madeline's going to pick it up or she's going to trip on a rock and fall on

111
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,900
 top of the axe or she'll slip in the snow, fall right on the blade.

112
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,700
 Like she's just a clumsy kid.

113
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,100
 I need to put this axe away.

114
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,420
 I don't have a toolkit.

115
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,700
 So he wedges it into the tree as hard as he can.

116
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,760
 And then he leaves, not like he didn't go back home and leave her there, but he kind

117
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,040
 of like turns his back to the tree and starts to walk away so he can sit down and enjoy

118
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,960
 a break.

119
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:24,560
 Well he's just turned his back for a few moments when he hears a sickening thud behind him.

120
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,040
 The cold Alaskan air whips around him.

121
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,940
 A squirrel is shaking his head.

122
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,460
 Here's the sound of a squirrel going, oh no.

123
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,740
 Is he shaking his head?

124
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:51,380
 Joey turns around and sees his daughter laying face down in the snow.

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:58,540
 The axe that he had wedged into the tree is laying next to her body.

126
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,200
 And though Lily White Snow is quickly melting as warm human blood covers it.

127
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,680
 Madeline, Madeline, he yells as he runs over there and he flips his daughter over and her

128
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,640
 head has been cracked in two.

129
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,760
 What had happened was Madeline did a Madeline thing and she saw the axe in the tree and

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,840
 she goes, oh you know I know Papa needs to take a break.

131
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
 I want to help.

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,860
 I don't understand anything about human strength but I'm sure I can wield this axe and chop

133
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,380
 down a couple trees.

134
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,460
 And she grabbed the axe and he didn't let it in as much as he thought he had and she

135
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,060
 grabs the axe and she actually pulled it down and it split her head open.

136
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,100
 And when he flipped over his daughter her face is completely covered in blood.

137
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,260
 It's still squirting out.

138
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,660
 He's like, oh my new shirt, oh no my new shirt.

139
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,880
 He picks up the body of his daughter.

140
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,320
 I gotta get the jokes in when I can't because trust me this is the most lighthearted story

141
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
 in this episode.

142
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,400
 He picks up the lifeless body of his 5 year old daughter and begins sobbing, sobbing openly

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,000
 over his little girl.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,520
 All she wanted to do was help out.

145
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,880
 She cleaved her head in two and killed her instantly too.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
 There was no hope for this girl.

147
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,200
 It wasn't like maybe I can get her to the doctor.

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,600
 She was clearly dead immediately.

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,780
 Apparently, according to the story, he sat there and held the body of his daughter and

150
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,300
 never moved from that spot.

151
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:43,260
 He mourned and wailed and sobbed for days and days and days until he finally succumbed

152
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,260
 to hypothermia and died in the middle of the forest.

153
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,580
 His daughter still cradled in his arms.

154
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,160
 They say to this day, if you head out to this area, they say there is an unmarked road called

155
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
 the Darker Road.

156
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,680
 It's not on any map, but it's a gravel road and it's located in the Chugiaq area.

157
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,360
 It's actually off of South Bertwood Road if you're in the area.

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,640
 They say that to this day, if you drive out to this area after 3.30am, you may see the

159
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,840
 ghostly image of this father still cradling his daughter.

160
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,740
 Her face still dripping with blood.

161
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,340
 Her lifeless corpse just kind of hanging their limp.

162
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,940
 But the father's ghost is still wailing in the night, mourning the loss of his 5 year

163
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,220
 old girl.

164
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,540
 This is a really interesting ghost story for me because this is a story that, I mean again,

165
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,040
 I got it on theshadowlands.net.

166
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,620
 We don't know how much is urban legend, how much is real, what are the verified sightings

167
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,700
 of this ghost.

168
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,040
 But let's take a look at it as a ghost story.

169
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,000
 You'll find this in other places other than theshadowlands.net.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,320
 But you know, did it actually happen?

171
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,440
 Is it urban legend?

172
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,800
 But let's assume that, let's assume for the sake of the argument that this is a ghostly

173
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
 encounter that people do have.

174
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,680
 Very, very fascinating story.

175
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,280
 I think this would be, when I was reading this I thought, okay, I had to go back and

176
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
 check a couple of times.

177
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:20,680
 I was like, okay, I could see definitely any parent losing a loved one, losing a child

178
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,080
 and not leaving the spot.

179
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,540
 Like they just die of a broken heart.

180
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,940
 Well he didn't die of a broken heart, he died due to exposure.

181
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,580
 But I had to keep checking.

182
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,500
 I was like, but he had a family at home, right?

183
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,180
 Like he had a wife and a son at home.

184
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,860
 And I thought, I go, I'm sure he was broken up about it.

185
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,220
 I'm sure that he openly mourned for the loss of his oldest daughter for the rest of his

186
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,220
 life, right?

187
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,260
 It's something you really never get over.

188
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,620
 But I'm sure he also knew that he had a wife and son at home and they needed the firewood.

189
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
 Remember he's out there cutting firewood.

190
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
 They're in Alaska.

191
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,760
 I'm sure at a certain point he would have gone home, right?

192
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,800
 Obviously would have went home and told his wife what happened and their lives would have

193
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,760
 went on.

194
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,680
 I don't believe that he sat there for days and days and days and days and died of hypothermia.

195
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,400
 I don't even think it would take days and days and days and days to die of hypothermia

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,920
 in Alaska.

197
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:16,440
 But what I think this is, is this is a classic case of psychic energy recording an event

198
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,320
 and playing it over and over again.

199
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,020
 I believe the little girl soul has moved on and his soul has moved on.

200
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:32,820
 What we're seeing is this moment in time frozen because of this raw psychic pain leaving its

201
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,580
 mark on the universe.

202
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,860
 If you went out to this area and saw this aberration, I don't believe you could interact

203
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
 with it.

204
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,500
 I don't believe you could talk to it or move it.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,140
 You're not taking selfies behind it.

206
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,220
 You're like giving him bunny ears.

207
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,620
 I don't think any of that could happen.

208
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,320
 Even though he may be moving, even though his chest may be heaving and tears streaming

209
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,320
 down his face, I don't think that you could interact with it in any sort of way.

210
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,320
 I don't think it's a ghost in that sense.

211
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,960
 And that can confuse a lot of people.

212
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,680
 So if somebody came out here and saw the bloodied girl, you'd go, "Well, obviously she died

213
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
 here."

214
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,720
 And you're seeing the ghost of a man holding the body.

215
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,280
 Now he could have died in Nebraska.

216
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,200
 You know, him and his family could have been like, "You know what?

217
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
 Let's go somewhere else."

218
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,180
 They go down to California and find a bunch of gold.

219
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,980
 They could have went anywhere else.

220
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,420
 But what we're seeing is not his ghost and her ghost.

221
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,580
 It's just a recording.

222
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,860
 We are ghost aficionados.

223
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,820
 If you're listening to Dead Rabbit Radio, you're not just a casual -- you just don't

224
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,460
 have a casual interest in the paranormal.

225
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,140
 People who listen to this podcast really know their stuff.

226
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,100
 And that's why you listen to this podcast.

227
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,060
 So I think that we know that there are different types of ghosts and there are recordings and

228
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,000
 there are actual spirits and there are demons disguised as ghosts.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,920
 And they're just like mental illness or mistakes, right?

230
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,400
 That there's not really a ghost.

231
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,040
 But we can see -- I think what happened was people were seeing the separation in the area

232
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,960
 and they made up the last part of the story.

233
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,160
 They made up the part saying, "Oh, and then he died there, too."

234
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,080
 Because that would be a way to explain why his ghost is there.

235
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,640
 But it's not his spirit.

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,800
 There's no one's spirit there.

237
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,900
 It's just this image.

238
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,340
 But to a casual person who doesn't have a lot of interest in ghosts, someone who's just

239
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,900
 driving on this road late at night and saw that, they would go, "Well, she must have died

240
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,700
 there because she's bloody.

241
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,700
 She looks like she's dead.

242
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,660
 And then he must have died there, too, because his ghost is there."

243
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,540
 That's not how ghosts work.

244
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,620
 Assuming this story is true, right?

245
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,220
 This story could be complete urban legend.

246
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,660
 I can get 100 emails after this episode's recorded saying as such.

247
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,160
 But I think if the story is true, it's a perfect example of that psychic recording.

248
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,920
 Because we talk about them from time to time on this show in general.

249
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,400
 But also in general, they're quite boring.

250
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,840
 A lot of times it's just a ghost -- there's no dead kids.

251
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
 There's no bloody kids.

252
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
 I'm like, "Boring!"

253
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,200
 A lot of times it's just a ghost walking on a hallway or something like that or footsteps

254
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
 down the stairs.

255
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,120
 That's a recording of an event.

256
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,160
 That doesn't really make for a good audio podcast.

257
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,260
 But when a kid's been cleaved with an axe, you have such a dynamic scene, a man in the

258
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,020
 snow cradling his kid.

259
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,180
 Just for the record, and considering what I'm going to talk about on the next segment,

260
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,940
 I'm not pro kids dying.

261
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,060
 I just feel like I have to put that out here, out there.

262
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,780
 But this is such a dynamic scene.

263
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,180
 And it is a perfect example.

264
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,340
 I don't believe -- I think both of their spirits have moved on.

265
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,940
 But this left an indelible fingerprint in the landscape there.

266
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,720
 So a creepy story coming out of Chugyak, Alaska.

267
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,960
 If you do happen to see it, I don't think you could interact with it.

268
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,400
 However, I would not put that to the test.

269
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,440
 Don't go out there and go, "Jason said this is harmless and start kicking him in the head."

270
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,480
 You figure your foot's just going to pass through him and then he gets mad and he starts

271
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,760
 using his daughter as a club, trying to knock you down.

272
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 Don't put it to the test.

273
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,720
 Don't put it to the test that Jason said it's harmless.

274
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,240
 But I think it might be.

275
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,880
 But again, I wouldn't bet money on it either.

276
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,140
 I wouldn't go out there and start goofing over them either.

277
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,220
 Superfine, Volpine, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carbenter

278
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,500
 copter we are leaving behind.

279
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,060
 Chugyak, Alaska.

280
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,660
 Take us all the way out to New London, Texas.

281
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,020
 [imitates car engine]

282
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,740
 This is a story -- really, this episode isn't what I talked about last week that I thought

283
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,140
 was too depressing to have on a Friday.

284
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,040
 I really don't know what happened on a Thursday makes it any less depressing.

285
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,480
 We're headed back to March 18, 1937.

286
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,840
 And we see a, as of the time, back in 1937, a state-of-the-art school.

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:46,120
 This was -- New London was one of the richest school districts in the United States.

288
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,320
 And the reason why was they had oil money.

289
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,920
 So you had all these oil barons and all these oil pumps and all these oil workers and everyone

290
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,260
 had a bunch of cash in their pocket.

291
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,700
 So we're gonna build the best school we possibly could.

292
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,420
 So they built the New London School.

293
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,140
 Now, New London School was built back in 1932, and at the time it cost them a million dollars

294
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
 to put together.

295
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,820
 I don't even think a modern high school cost a million dollars.

296
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:20,100
 And back then, that was equivalent to 19 million bucks to build one school.

297
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,760
 Now the way it was built, this is a story that there's so many mistakes made.

298
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,040
 And then we get to this huge cataclysm.

299
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
 We get to this horrible event.

300
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,040
 And you think any one of these things could have changed, and none of this would have happened.

301
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,720
 But this is an interesting story because had this not happened, what could have happened?

302
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,120
 What could have played out?

303
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,820
 The New London School was built on a slope.

304
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,900
 So what that meant was you had the school built.

305
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,780
 It wasn't like a teeter-totter school.

306
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,260
 You're like, "Oh, it's time to go to science class."

307
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,700
 Everyone rolls to the other end.

308
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,300
 It was built on a slope, so you had this giant gap of airspace beneath it.

309
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,980
 It wasn't like a basement.

310
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
 It wasn't any...

311
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,740
 I mean, the building was built around.

312
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,780
 You couldn't go skateboarding underneath it, but you had just like this giant empty space

313
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,700
 between the ground and the school because it was built on the slope.

314
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,400
 And this is oil town, baby.

315
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,960
 You got oil, you got natural gas, you got all this stuff.

316
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
 So when they were built in the school, they said, "You know what?

317
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
 Hey, I got a good plan.

318
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,880
 I got a good plan."

319
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
 What if...

320
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,640
 What about instead of building the building so we need to bring gas into the school?

321
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
 So like our heaters need to have gas pipes going in and our ovens.

322
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 I don't know what else you would have in a school that would need all this natural gas.

323
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,740
 But they go, "What if we just tapped into an existing natural gas line?"

324
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
 Because we got them all around.

325
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,140
 We're right in the middle of oil and natural gas fields.

326
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,340
 Why don't we just have...

327
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,140
 Why don't we just literally tap into one of these natural gas pipelines?

328
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
 This is so insane.

329
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,420
 Why don't we just tap into one of these natural gas pipelines so we're getting pure, unfiltered

330
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,940
 natural gas into our school?

331
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
 We'll save a ton of money.

332
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,360
 We spent a lot of money building it.

333
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,880
 And they say, "Yeah, it's a great idea.

334
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
 That is a great idea.

335
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,040
 We'll just use the resources we have around us, all this natural gas, to heat the building."

336
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,160
 The thing is, is that prior to this event, and this event is the reason why we do this,

337
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
 natural gas had no smell.

338
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,400
 The store I'm about to tell you is the reason why when there is a gas leak you can smell

339
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 it.

340
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,140
 Because naturally, natural gas is completely undetectable.

341
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
 It's tasteless.

342
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,140
 It has no smell.

343
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,140
 Basically, you're walking around the canary and when the canary dies you leave.

344
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,620
 That was the way you detected it.

345
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,080
 Nowadays, they've added an ingredient into it so you can smell it and you can go, "Uh-oh.

346
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,820
 There's too much natural gas in this area, which in most places is any, right?

347
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,820
 You don't want any natural gas just floating around."

348
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,440
 Because of what happened at New London School is the reason why you can smell natural gas.

349
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
 It's odorless.

350
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
 It's colorless.

351
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
 You can't taste it.

352
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,240
 But it does affect the human body, right?

353
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,600
 It can kill you if you get too much of it in.

354
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,640
 Now New London School, it was weird.

355
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,400
 It went from K through 12th grade.

356
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,760
 It was all of the possible age groups you could have in there, which I imagine the Boolean

357
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
 would be hilarious.

358
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,180
 You'd have seniors pranking second graders.

359
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,660
 They're like, "Why are you picking on me?

360
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,860
 Because you're younger throwing them in the toilet and stuff like that."

361
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
 You also had a huge...

362
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,940
 I don't know if they actually had a huge Boolean problem.

363
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,140
 That's what I would have done.

364
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:52,300
 But they also had a weird outbreak of headaches.

365
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,100
 Students were constantly complaining that their heads hurt.

366
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,860
 Now to the administrators, they probably figured, "Oh, you know, maybe it's flu season.

367
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
 Is March?

368
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,120
 No one to be a flu season in Texas?"

369
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,280
 It's weird that people keep complaining of these headaches.

370
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,720
 It also seems kind of weird that the shorter they are, the closer they are to the ground,

371
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
 the headaches are worse.

372
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,000
 But I don't know what could it possibly be.

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,360
 Couldn't be that we have this massive crawl space that's 253 feet by 56 feet underneath

374
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,520
 our school that no one ever goes to.

375
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,680
 It can't have anything to do with that.

376
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,480
 Or the fact that we're sitting on a bunch of natural gas or that we've tapped into said

377
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,420
 natural gas to heat our wonderful school.

378
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,760
 It would have nothing to do with that.

379
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,700
 So kids are constantly walking around holding their heads.

380
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,140
 And the administrators are like, "I don't know why you're complaining."

381
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,260
 They're looking at these kids that are so short to the ground.

382
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,820
 They're like, "What does my head hurt?"

383
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,220
 And the six foot tall adults, I don't know.

384
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,340
 Anyways, the epidemic of headaches continues for a while and nobody really knows what it

385
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
 is.

386
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,120
 No one thinks for a second.

387
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,600
 It could possibly be the fact that these kids are inhaling natural gas all day long at school.

388
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:14,180
 Well, on March 18th, 1937, it was 3.17 p.m.

389
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,500
 Now the way the school was set up was that you had it divided, and most American schools

390
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,600
 are like this, you had it divided into a set of different buildings, right?

391
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,500
 You have a gymnasium, then you're going to have these buildings over here for administration

392
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,080
 and these buildings here for certain grade levels and so on and so forth.

393
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:38,120
 At 3.17 p.m., most of the school had been dismissed already from classes.

394
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,880
 So K through 4th is gone at this point.

395
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,440
 They've gone home.

396
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,480
 However, you still had 5th through 11th grade, which I don't know if the school just went

397
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 to 11th grade.

398
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 That's weird too.

399
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,120
 There's just had a senior ditch day this day.

400
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,300
 But 5th through 11th grade was still in classes.

401
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:06,620
 So we're talking about between 500 to 650 students are still in school.

402
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,340
 And there's also 40 teachers there as well.

403
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,580
 Now it's interesting to think, how do they not know how many students were there on that

404
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,580
 day?

405
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,620
 That's a pretty big gap in numbers, 500 to 650 students.

406
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,960
 The reason why they don't have a clear number is because this was oiled field territory.

407
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,800
 You had a bunch of traveling people who would work different jobs and they'd move their

408
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,840
 families out to this oiled field.

409
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,060
 They'd work there for a while and then they'd move on.

410
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,520
 So we don't know for a fact because people would show up, take their kids to school,

411
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,680
 go about their job for three months and then move on.

412
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,000
 We don't know how many students were actually in this building.

413
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,440
 There may be people who were victims of this event that were literally wiped out of the

414
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,180
 history books.

415
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,860
 Just completely vanished.

416
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,940
 No one knows their names.

417
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,560
 No one knows where they came from.

418
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,820
 Between 500 and 650 students and 40 teachers are here at New London School, still attending

419
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,060
 class about 100 feet away from the main buildings.

420
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,660
 There's a gymnasium.

421
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,500
 And in this gymnasium there's a PTA meeting going on.

422
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,540
 So you have a bunch of parents and teachers here attending this.

423
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,480
 Right a few students still in classes with their teachers.

424
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,800
 And in the shop class, in the wood shop class, Lemmy Butler, the shop teacher, turns on

425
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:37,240
 an electric sander.

426
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,320
 People outside the school, because this is right in the middle of a residential area,

427
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 right?

428
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 People who are outside the school.

429
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:49,100
 What they see is, you have this main school building where all these hundreds of students

430
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,640
 are in and these 40 teachers, you have this main school building.

431
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,140
 What they see is the walls bulge out.

432
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,480
 You're looking at a building and you don't really hear anything at first.

433
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,740
 You just see the walls bulge out of the building.

434
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:17,180
 And then they bulged out in such a way that the roof fell completely into the building.

435
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,540
 And then you watch the walls crumble in as well.

436
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,400
 What happened was when Lemmy turned on that electric, this is what we assume, right?

437
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
 This is kind of what they put together.

438
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,900
 When Lemmy turned on that sander, it started an electric spark that ignited the natural

439
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,860
 gas that at this point had completely filled up that massive crawl space.

440
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:46,420
 And when he turned on that sander and that gas ignited, it was such a violent explosion

441
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,840
 there was no flame.

442
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,600
 The building just bulged out, the roof came down and then the walls collapsed in on it.

443
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,020
 And people saw no fires.

444
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:04,820
 There was no idea of what could possibly have happened, but this explosion, the sound of

445
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,440
 it was so loud people could hear it 12 miles away.

446
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,960
 People who did hear this, right?

447
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,620
 People who heard this explosion began to head out to the area.

448
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,660
 What in the world was that?

449
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,780
 What could have made such a huge boom?

450
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,340
 And as people start coming into the area, they see people running out of their houses

451
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,580
 towards New London School.

452
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,820
 As they're continuing to drive their car down the road, they see parents who would run out

453
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,160
 of the gymnasium after this explosion, they're already digging through the rubble with their

454
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,420
 bare hands.

455
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,220
 You had calls go out to all of the oil fields in the area.

456
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,060
 Grab your gear and get to the school.

457
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,380
 And it was such a local event too, right?

458
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,260
 This is a local school and the people who are trying to get the rubble out of the way

459
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,980
 they're trying to save lives also knew the people in the rubble.

460
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,780
 You had the story of a bus driver, Lonnie Barber, who was driving his bus just dropping

461
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
 kids off.

462
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,920
 It's another normal day when the explosion happens.

463
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,340
 He continued his route, even knowing that he had four of his own children in that building

464
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,060
 when it blew up.

465
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,540
 He needed to get these kids home.

466
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,540
 That was his job.

467
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,220
 That was his duty, right?

468
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,060
 And he goes along the route dropping off these kids until finally he gets to the school where

469
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,860
 he is able to help in the rescue effort as well.

470
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:48,580
 Out of the four, three of them were totally fine, but he did lose his son in the explosion.

471
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,180
 You begin to have people come from outside the immediate area because at this point

472
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,780
 it's become statewide news.

473
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,780
 Pretty soon this is going to be international news.

474
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:04,700
 At the time this was one of the worst catastrophes in American, if not in world history, because

475
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:15,460
 what we're looking at is possibly 650 kids and 40 teachers blown up in an instant.

476
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,820
 You had rescue crews coming from all over the state.

477
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:24,060
 You had everyone from the Texas National Guard to Boy Scout troops headed out there, removing

478
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:31,220
 rubble, rescuing people, and pulling out dead bodies.

479
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,900
 This explosion was so violent, there was one kid the only way they were able to identify

480
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,180
 he was in the building.

481
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,220
 Obviously the parents were looking for him.

482
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,220
 They never found his body.

483
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,060
 They found a piece of his clothing that he was wearing that day.

484
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,780
 That was all that was left of him.

485
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:54,100
 And his parents remember him leaving in those pants.

486
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,220
 He was completely vaporized.

487
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,180
 Because this is such a huge story, eventually the reporters show up and when reporters show

488
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,860
 up to start reporting their instantly given orders start digging.

489
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:12,180
 Put down your microphone and start digging.

490
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,500
 Walter Cronkite, world famous journalist who went on to cover World War II, which was

491
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,340
 really right around the corner, this is 1937.

492
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,460
 Walter Cronkite who covered World War II and the Nuremberg Trials.

493
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,500
 Later in life said, "I did nothing in my studies nor in my life to prepare me for a

494
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,300
 story of the magnitude of that New London tragedy, nor has any story since that awful

495
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,300
 day equaled it."

496
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:54,140
 You're walking around grieving parents, removing rubble, looking for their child.

497
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,340
 I mean, it boggles the mind, right?

498
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,620
 It boggles the mind.

499
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:10,060
 And you're hoping that they're alive, but each hour that passed that hope grew dimmer

500
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,740
 and dimmer and dimmer.

501
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,300
 Again, we don't know how many students were at the school.

502
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,780
 The number goes from 500 to 650.

503
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:26,380
 What we do know is 294 students were killed in the explosion.

504
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:35,940
 And then another 112, 115 suffered serious injuries and 130 escaped serious injuries.

505
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,660
 You had people trying to sue the school district, but those lawsuits really didn't go anywhere.

506
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,780
 It's something that we can look at now and go, "Well, if they had done these things,

507
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,940
 it could have been preventable."

508
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,900
 But at the time, you know, it's been hard to sue corporations back then, companies back

509
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,340
 then, but none of the lawsuits went anywhere.

510
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,300
 The superintendent, you know, he was held ultimately responsible.

511
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,060
 He had to quit because he was told if he didn't quit, he was going to be killed.

512
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,980
 The mob, the people were just going to do mob justice.

513
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,020
 Which you may figure, yeah, you know, he's in charge.

514
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,420
 He's the one ultimately in charge, so he's the one you're going to hold responsible for

515
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
 this incident.

516
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:21,140
 And I can see that it's also tragic that he lost his own son, a niece and a nephew in

517
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,900
 the explosion.

518
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,700
 So this wasn't some guy sitting on the edge of town in a high-rise being like, "Ah, another

519
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,780
 day, another dollar."

520
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:34,100
 Like, he lost people here too, but he was the one who was deemed ultimately responsible

521
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,120
 and he should have made better decisions and he was forced to step down.

522
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,820
 But this event, this event shocked the world.

523
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,980
 This is the reason now why natural gas has a scent added to it.

524
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,500
 That's why.

525
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,060
 Because it filled up this school for so long and filled up this crawl space for so long

526
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,820
 and people could not detect it.

527
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:07,060
 And 294 children were blown to pieces that they've now added this element.

528
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,940
 So this is one of those stories that it's an absolute tragedy.

529
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,060
 And I got a couple things to say about this and then we'll wrap it up.

530
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,180
 I know it's kind of depressing, but it's an absolute tragedy, obviously.

531
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,340
 You have to think like, "How did this not happen?"

532
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:27,220
 We wouldn't have added the scent agent into the natural gas or at least not have been

533
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,380
 doing it that early.

534
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:35,260
 So you wonder, by this school blowing up, did it prevent even greater catastrophes

535
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
 down the road?

536
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,580
 I mean, I'm never, I'm not saying that that means it's good.

537
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,860
 But you know what I mean?

538
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,860
 Like, detecting, being able to smell.

539
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,860
 Imagine this.

540
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,660
 Imagine if every so often a single house blew up.

541
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,180
 Or maybe not even that dramatic.

542
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,180
 Imagine if every so often a single house, a single household died because of a natural

543
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,260
 gas leak and they couldn't smell it and they couldn't taste it and they couldn't see it.

544
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,700
 If you had 200 households over the course of, say, maybe four years spread across the

545
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:12,420
 country and they had these natural gas leaks and they just died, you would still have companies

546
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,780
 going, "Well, how are we going to fix it?

547
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:20,900
 You should just be responsible for that odorless smell you have in your house."

548
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,020
 But if you had 200 households and each household had four people in it, that's 800 people

549
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,180
 dead from the same thing.

550
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,940
 It's the dynamic nature, right?

551
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,900
 It's the dynamic nature of this tragedy, the instant death of all of these people that

552
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,980
 make people go, "Wow, that's unsafe.

553
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,300
 Let's fix that."

554
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,540
 You had people dying in car accidents for years and years and years and years and years

555
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,020
 and years and people were like, "I don't know what we're supposed to do about it."

556
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,540
 It wasn't until I remember as I was a kid, they were like, "Maybe wear your seatbelt."

557
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,300
 There was like a Sesame Street or there were like commercials for kids to start wearing

558
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,540
 their seatbelt and then eventually it became a law.

559
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,340
 But there was never like a thousand people died in a single moment because they weren't

560
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,740
 wearing their seatbelt type of thing.

561
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,640
 That would have mandated it right away.

562
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
 So we have that.

563
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,180
 And this idea, one, it's just a crazy story about like just little things that can go

564
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,380
 wrong and they weren't even knowing they were wrong.

565
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,580
 They only have a story that really saves lives.

566
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,740
 In the long run, I think more people have been saved because they can smell gas, right?

567
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
 Natural gas.

568
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,460
 But then the other interesting thing about this story is it's pretty much completely

569
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,020
 forgotten.

570
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,100
 The fact that Adolf Hitler, Chancellor of Germany at the time, sent a letter of condolence,

571
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,860
 a telegram of condolence to the United States to be like, "Hey, I'm sorry, that school blew

572
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,520
 up."

573
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,760
 This was an international tragedy.

574
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,840
 People around the world were looking at this and being like, "I can't believe like those

575
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,080
 poor families, those poor kids, what a horrible tragedy."

576
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,160
 But no one remembers it.

577
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
 I had never heard about this.

578
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,960
 I had never heard about this.

579
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,800
 I had always heard that we put a smell into natural gas.

580
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,840
 Like that is not a natural thing.

581
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,320
 That's something that humans add so we can detect it.

582
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,700
 But I didn't know it was because a school blew up.

583
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:19,100
 And you have this national, really international tragedy that was on everyone's mind.

584
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,700
 And now here we are less than 100 years later and it's just completely forgotten.

585
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,780
 Or maybe it isn't.

586
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,980
 Maybe everyone's like, "Jason, yeah, everyone knows about this."

587
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
 I didn't.

588
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,820
 Now I'd be surprised if it was common knowledge.

589
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,900
 Just completely forgotten all these deaths.

590
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,480
 We remember that this additive was added because we encounter it quite often.

591
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,720
 Hopefully not a lot because that means you're exposed to a lot of natural gas.

592
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,560
 This horrible tragedy that everyone wept around the world is now just a lost memory.

593
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,680
 A Wikipedia page, right?

594
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,360
 Just like that story of that man in the forest with his daughter may have been the talk of

595
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,800
 the town for a while after it happened and eventually just fades away.

596
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,140
 This becomes an obscure ghost story you find mentioned a couple of times online.

597
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:12,020
 All of this human tragedy has been reduced to a whisper of a memory.

598
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,940
 Fascinating stuff.

599
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,420
 And I wanted to end this episode not with my traditional Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com,

600
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,740
 all that stuff.

601
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:28,220
 I wanted to play a clip from a newsreel.

602
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,840
 Not to depress you even more, I just kind of an oddity.

603
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,040
 I wanted to end it with this.

604
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:41,400
 This newscaster might be one of the most callous newscasters that I've come across.

605
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,680
 He is talking about these kids.

606
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,600
 I think he uses the term "blown to bits" at least once.

607
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 At least once.

608
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
 It's fascinating.

609
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:56,200
 And again, this was a huge story at the time that changed the world in the way that we

610
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,780
 interact with natural gas.

611
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,420
 It's saved countless lives, but in the end it's been forgotten.

612
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,220
 But let me play this news clip for you and it's just weird.

613
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,740
 I just want to play this news clip for you.

614
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,660
 I can't imagine a modern broadcaster talking like this.

615
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,060
 But yeah, it's just weird.

616
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:22,300
 Let's go ahead and roll that.

617
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,920
 It is with deep regret that we bring you these graphic appalling scenes of one of the greatest

618
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,520
 tragedies in American history.

619
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,200
 Hundreds of school children and their teachers killed and mangled some of them literally

620
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,920
 blown to bits, others crushed by falling masonry.

621
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,040
 When their new consolidated grade and high school in the center of the rich East Texas

622
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,280
 oil field was shattered by a terrific gas explosion.

623
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,680
 Had the blast occurred ten minutes later, school would have been dismissed.

624
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,060
 Even the death toll small, perhaps.

625
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,420
 But it struck when only the lower grades and a few others had left, catching almost the

626
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,660
 entire student body in an inferno of flying debris and falling walls.

627
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,460
 There was no warning.

628
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,980
 Before the eyes of persons in the vicinity, including scores of parents assembled for

629
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,680
 a meeting in a nearby building, the schoolhouse, one of the finest rural structures in the

630
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,380
 country, suddenly burst asunder and collapsed.

631
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,560
 There's scarcely a home in the entire school district untouched by the disaster.

632
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:32,800
 A disaster caused it is believed by gas pockets which had collected in the school's sub-basement.

633
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,920
 In the long list of American catastrophes, this is one of the worst.

634
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,880
 The entire nation bows in grief.
