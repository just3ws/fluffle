1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Did a talking mongoose haunt a family in the 1930s?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,600
 And today I talk about personal experiences I had at the historically haunted Stanley Hotel today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:23,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,960
 Both my best friends forgot my birthday.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 One, I could understand both.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,640
 So if you detect that my voice is a little monotone than normal or you

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
 hear the sound of my soul being ripped from my body, that's why.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,560
 I actually didn't plan on recording an episode today, not just because of that, because I had got called into work tomorrow

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 and I had a long day today, but

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,560
 yeah, what are you gonna do?

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,680
 Let's go ahead and go on to our first story.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,400
 So our first story is the story of Jeff the Talking Mongoose.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,640
 Now his name is Jeff, but it's spelled G-E-F.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
 He's a little...

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,960
 Well, he's a talking mongoose. I think that kind of is obvious, but

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:15,040
 it's a little more than that. It was almost a... He looks like a mongoose, but nobody really ever saw him.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,200
 He acts like a talking animal would if you think animals can talk, but

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,640
 he also has qualities of like a poultry geist. It was a curious case back then.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,080
 Well, I guess it's a curious case now, but you know... Man, this is going to be a hard episode to record.

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,760
 Okay, let me get centered here. So anyways,

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,040
 Jeff the Talking Mongoose. So this story took place back in the 1930s. It was in the Isle of Man, which is somewhere in Europe.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,440
 Maybe it's off of England? I don't know.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,160
 Let's just see if we can get through on this episode.

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,760
 So Isle of Man is somewhere on the planet Earth. I believe it's in England.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,520
 And so anyways, there's this family living out there.

26
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,400
 They're called

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
 the

28
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,040
 Irvings.

29
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,160
 And it's a mother and a father and a little 12 year old girl.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,480
 And they start to hear little voices. No, no, no, no. Let me back up here. So the dad's name

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,440
 is James. This is going to be a rough one, guys. Just just get through with this.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,520
 We can get through this together. So the dad's name is James and they start hearing like these weird noises in their walls

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,760
 of this house in the 1930s. So it's not the most well put together house.

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,880
 And he keeps hearing these like noises and for whatever reason he decides like I'm going to start talking to these noises and figure out what they are.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,200
 And he realizes that the noises change.

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,800
 So he begins like growling at the at one point there's like a growling come from the wall.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,360
 He growls back and then it seems like the creature responds to him. So he's like, oh, that's interesting.

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
 So he's talking to the wall. He's talking to the wall for a while.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,160
 You know, over the course of weeks and stuff like that.

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,040
 And like he would,

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,360
 if he growled the creature on the other side of the wall would make a similar growl. So then he's like started making other animal noises.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,440
 And eventually he could name an animal and it would like if he goes chicken, it would go back back back back.

43
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
 And he goes every so often it sounded like it was a gurgling.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,280
 Like it was trying to learn English. And and here's your this is where I say and you I'm sure you're saying as well.

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,720
 How do you how do you make gurgling? How do you equate that with having to learn English? Here's the thing. This story is so

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,880
 inconsistent.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,720
 Because yeah, if you heard first off if you heard anything coming from your walls, you're taking a sledgehammer to it and strangling anything.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,840
 On the other side, especially if it's making a bunch of animal noises. Eventually it does start talking though and introduces itself as Jeff.

49
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,240
 And I don't know it's spelled a g-e-f. I don't know if that's normal

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,320
 for Isle of Man or if the the mongoose is like spell it with a g and leave off an f.

51
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,040
 But anyways, so James Irving is like, oh, I got this hyper intelligent

52
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,280
 mongoose. Even he said he was a mongoose from New Delhi.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,400
 And he's like Jeff's like, hey, I'm a mongoose

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
 from New Delhi. And so James begins talking to it.

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,760
 And it gets to the point. There's a bunch of weird stuff that goes on in the story. So anyways,

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,880
 the mother doesn't like Jeff and the Jeff.

57
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,880
 Or the mother doesn't like Jeff and Jeff doesn't like the mother so they don't interact much. But the young girl, she's 13. Her name is Vori.

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
 That's a bizarre name. So

59
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
 the the mongoose

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,640
 talks to Vori, talks to James and talks to Vori and Vori actually like

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,760
 Jeff will show himself to Vori.

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,960
 James only just he catches like fleeting glimpses of it.

63
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,160
 And he's basically like a total dick. Like he's and that's where he has the qualities of a poltergeist where he'd like throw stuff and be mean

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:11,040
 and he'd say like jacked up stuff to these people one time he called James Irving like a big fat potato head or something like that. And yeah, so

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
 at one point he Jeff is like

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,520
 really really like getting on

67
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:26,000
 Vori's nerves like in a creepy way in like a stalker way and and Vori's like i'm tired of Jeff. I'm tired of Jeff running around

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,320
 this house, you know, and i'm i'm seeing them and stuff and he's just being a dick to me.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,640
 So the parents are like okay, well, let's see if we can figure out another room you can stay in.

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,360
 And Jeff doesn't like that.

71
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,360
 Okay, he didn't call him. Let me back up here.

72
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,480
 Because he didn't call him a big fat potato head. What he called him. So James was reading the newspaper very slowly.

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:58,080
 And Jeff wanted him to read it quickly for whatever reason. He said read it out. You f-

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,720
 Fat headed gnome.

75
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,600
 So i mean i well maybe fat, fat potato, fat potato head was funny. I don't know. But anyways

76
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,960
 Fat headed gnome is what he called James once. Anyways, Vori got sick and tired of him like

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
 dicking around with her. So the parents get together and they're like let's have a meeting

78
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,880
 and figure out what room to put you in that we can, you know, so you don't have to interact with Jeff much because you couldn't find him.

79
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,320
 And then like as they're having this meeting Jeff says i'll follow her wherever you put her.

80
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,760
 Which is creepy. Here's a little thing. So

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,000
 James at one point they're like

82
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,080
 We'll put you

83
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
 Vori you can sleep in your bedroom and we will barricade you

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,800
 In you like you can barricade yourself into your room. So when you sleep you don't have to like hear like

85
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
 Creepy mongoose noises while you're trying to sleep and here's a quote

86
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,720
 Soon we saw the top of the door bulging in as though some terrific force were thrusting against it. That's that's some um

87
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
 50 shades of gray shit right there

88
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,840
 Soon we saw the top of the door bulging in as though some terrific force were thrusting against it

89
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,480
 But the door held

90
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,120
 Then Jeff's queer

91
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,600
 Uh, yeah, this is probably good. I'm doing this episode then Jeff's queer

92
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:30,560
 Then and I know the word means weird, but then Jeff's queer high voice said i'm coming in

93
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
 a few seconds later a heavy pot of

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:42,240
 A few seconds later a heavy pot of ointment kept in the room crashed against the bedstead

95
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,120
 It should be bedstand, but whatever bedstead that might be a real thing in the isle of man

96
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,640
 But so he basically like when they were like stay out of our daughter's room

97
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,280
 He's like thrusting against the door and breaks his way in the door bulges and he has a queer high voice. So anyways

98
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,760
 He busted now, of course

99
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,640
 Vory ends up like kind of getting over her fear of

100
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,200
 Jeff and they kind of start living with it, but

101
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,040
 What happens is word gets out that there's this little

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:18,480
 Little mongoose guy running around this house talking mongoose and so of course paranormal investigators start showing up at the house and

103
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,600
 You know the neighboring town knew of it people in the area knew of Jeff the talking mongoose

104
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,200
 and

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
 And then these psychic investigators show up

106
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,120
 See what's up, and this should be your first clue something's going sideways with this story

107
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,840
 Nothing happens. They don't hear them

108
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,360
 They don't see them

109
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,680
 Nothing happens now

110
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
 Family would be like hey jeff say something

111
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
 say something

112
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,400
 nothing

113
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,840
 Now other psychic investigators would come out and they would hear jeff being like get him out of here

114
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,440
 He doesn't believe in spirits. I don't like him that knucklehead

115
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
 And they'd be like oh my god psychic investors like oh my god. I totally heard that

116
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:11,040
 At one point actually this was interesting so at one point like so there's this theory that poltergeist activity

117
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,080
 Is caused not by the spirit like poltergeist activity that between that and it goes is poltergeist is when stuff moves around your house

118
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
 like doors being open and stuff sliding around

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,320
 And there's a strong thrusting against your bedroom door that's generally classified as a poltergeist and there is a

120
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
 Scientist who came up with the theory

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,920
 That poltergeist activity is actually not

122
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,840
 Ghosts it is caused by mental anguish. It's basically more like psychokinesis than anything else like than that

123
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,960
 Than like a spooky spirit. It's more like

124
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,160
 Your mental your your basically your mental is leaving

125
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,920
 Like your mental anguish can't be contained in your body or in your brain. So it has to find another outlet. His name was

126
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,400
 Nam dude, that's a dope name. Sounds like the lord of the rings villain

127
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,160
 nandor

128
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,520
 Fodor maybe not a villain. He could actually be like anyone that could be the most normal guy in

129
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,720
 Lord of the Rings where does that take place middle earth?

130
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,960
 Nandor Fodor could like be the guy who delivers your mail, but in any other

131
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,400
 Universe he'd be the bad guy. So anyways, he came out

132
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:28,320
 And he had a couple interesting theories, but the main one was first he was like, uh, it's kind of kind of poltergeisty kind of not

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,800
 He ended up thinking that it was not generally poltergeist activity is caused by young kids going through adolescence

134
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
 And they're go have all this energy and it's like being expelled psychically

135
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,240
 His thing was I think it's the father. I think he had like all these great dreams and desires as a kid

136
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
 and now he's like locked in he got a woman pregnant. He's

137
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,000
 Just the husband and has a kid and all this stuff and he's just letting all the psychic energy out and so on and so forth

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,080
 Now a couple psychic investigators, like I said, didn't hear anything and some of them did some of them brought reporters and witnesses as witnesses nothing

139
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,600
 They couldn't hear anything. Now words started to spread

140
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
 That it was a hoax

141
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
 That it wasn't true

142
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,880
 At one point one of the psychic investigators was walking and he heard the voice

143
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,320
 He's like, oh my god, he heard the voice now. He's walking in the the father

144
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,560
 James is next to him and vori standing behind him and here's the voice being like he doesn't believe in the spirits

145
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,920
 and a psychic investigators like

146
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,080
 Uh, that voice came from right behind me where the little girl is who's following us and the father's like no, no, no, no

147
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,440
 It wasn't it wasn't it was it was the the little mongoose it ran into the walls

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,480
 And so that kind of really soured people on jeff because this fabled psychic investigator was like

149
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
 Yeah, I heard it. It was the little girl

150
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,640
 Eventually the family moved the Irving's moved and jeff didn't follow them

151
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,760
 They had no other reported

152
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,800
 dealings with jeff the james passed away and the the mom and the vori had to move away

153
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,760
 They actually had to sell the farm at a discount because the word in town that was that it was haunted

154
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,960
 No one wanted to buy this house at this haunted house

155
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,880
 Which I wouldn't have a problem with it, especially if he was kind of like a dope little

156
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,120
 Mongoose running around the new owner ended up buying the property

157
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:28,960
 The new owner ended up buying the property and maybe like a couple months a year or whatever later ended up shooting this giant

158
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,560
 mongoose

159
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,280
 This giant creature that was running around because there were mongooses in the area or mongies

160
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,960
 Some guy imported them. I could just just sit that in the beginning

161
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,360
 Some guy imported them to help

162
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
 Coal the rabbit population

163
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
 Anyways, the new owner of the house

164
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,360
 Shot a mongoose and he's like I killed jeff and vori now an adult was like that's not what he looked like and now the house is

165
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 Burned down. There's been no jeff sightings

166
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,160
 Even in her old age vori

167
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,840
 Was like no it was totally true and I didn't like him and I wish he just left us alone

168
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,960
 So again, it's kind of weird. I can understand her saying no it is true

169
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,280
 And it was a whimsical fantasy of me hanging out with this talking mongoose or

170
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,000
 No, it was all fake and it sucked because it ended up ruining my life

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,040
 But she's stating that no it is real and it ruined my life like she basically

172
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,480
 She became no one as the fraud. I guess that would be a reason to

173
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,280
 Keep up keep it up if you didn't want to be considered more of a fraud. I don't know

174
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,760
 Do you think I remember my very first episode on this podcast all those months ago was about talking critters little talking animals

175
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
 And obviously not like jeff. They were about how

176
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
 animals communicate with each other, but

177
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,080
 I think for an animal to be oh and it could speak hebrouw and knew all these languages

178
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,280
 It was just such a it's such a weird if it's fake

179
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,080
 It seems like they made it overly complicated. They could have just said there's a creature in my walls

180
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,320
 That throw stuff or that even that's complicated. There's a creature in my wall that talks or makes noises or whatever

181
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
 Or it would if you're gonna fake it just say there's a ghost in your house

182
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,360
 But it wasn't just a talking animal. It was a talking mongoose

183
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,240
 Who came from new deli?

184
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
 and could throw things

185
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,000
 and could hear whispers like they were normal conversations and

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,880
 spoke several different languages it seems

187
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 If it was a hoax, it seems like it was an elaborate hoax

188
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,600
 It's possible that they were the victims of the hoax

189
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,280
 But other people have said you know it went on for so long

190
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,560
 Either the entire family was in on it from the beginning

191
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,480
 Because they go the way that the house it's kind of cramped up

192
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,080
 That one person wouldn't be able to hoax the other people

193
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,040
 They did also say the way because you know the creeks on the wall

194
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
 I was saying the built the house wasn't built really well

195
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,640
 You could be on one floor talking to the wall and you would hear the sound somewhere else

196
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,920
 But the investigators who came out said everyone was in the same room

197
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,640
 But again actually now that I say that those are the times nobody heard it

198
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,000
 It's probably a hoax

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,840
 But no, there's no but to that. It very most likely is a hoax. However

200
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,360
 It would be awesome if it wasn't. It would be awesome if there was a little

201
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,880
 Like rap scallion mongoose who was running around your house being like listen to me fat head of gnome

202
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,600
 And like bulging your door open

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Maybe not the second part

204
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,800
 But yeah, jeff the talking mongoose

205
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:36,560
 Hoover the talking seal I found out about because I was researching jeff. This was the story and I should say this too

206
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,320
 jeff the talking mongoose was recommended to me by through email from a listener named antonio

207
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
 So thank you for that

208
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,360
 He I had heard about jeff a while back and kind of passed on the story because I was like, uh, and then I ended up

209
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,040
 But I said, you know, he sent this to me. I'll do some more research on it and

210
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
 There's a ton of stuff on jeff

211
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,360
 And they found like hair samples and there's like photos and stuff like that

212
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,880
 But again, they sent they like we found hair from jeff and they send it out to a lab and they go yeah, it's from

213
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 a dog

214
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 Or a cat or rat or whatever

215
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,480
 Same thing a little paw prints and there were mongooses in the area as well

216
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,960
 There's drawings of them if you find a drawing very convincing. It's not really evidence, but

217
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,040
 Jeff the talking mongoose. I wish you existed, but I think you are completely fake

218
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,000
 Let's move on to the next story here. So

219
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
 the next story

220
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,400
 is

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
 I'm going to talk about

222
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,560
 Some personal experiences I had

223
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,640
 at the Stanley hotel. It's a historically haunted hotel

224
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,400
 The story is that the Stephen King stayed there on the off season

225
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,120
 So his family were the only ones there and he had a nightmare about his son being chased down the

226
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
 hallway by a hose or something like that

227
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,960
 Then he's like i'm gonna write a book about that. I'm not a huge Stephen King fan

228
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,280
 I think his short stories are amazing, but his novels are just pretty wandery

229
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,920
 Go on and on and on but

230
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,720
 So anyways, there's you know, a lot of ghost hunter shows have gone there and it's just no one locally and

231
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,840
 nationally and internationally as this haunted location so

232
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,360
 At the time my mother was doing

233
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,240
 She worked for the national guard

234
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:24,480
 Helping veterans come when they're they're coming from Iraq or Afghanistan or really anywhere

235
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
 But generally it was coming from the hot zones

236
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,320
 So my mom was she worked for the national guard. That was her job

237
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,720
 So veterans would come back and she would help she ran these programs to help get them back into

238
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 The groove of things so it was a lot of like family retreats and things like that to just kind of

239
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 automate them to civilian life

240
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:53,180
 They're still they're still soldiers, but you know what I mean like now they're back to like having to pay bills and go to the movies and things like that

241
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,780
 And they do these big seminars. So one year they were having the seminar at the Stanley hotel

242
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,580
 And my mom I was in the area my mom said hey, do you want to go up to the Stanley hotel?

243
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,740
 We're going to be there for the weekend. We're going to be running like these workshops, but you can just run around the hotel

244
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,300
 I was like hell. Yeah, dude. You know, it's pretty dope

245
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,860
 So we go to the Stanley hotel

246
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,220
 And the first night I just decided to we were there for like

247
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,900
 Two days three nights or whatever the first night. I was like, you know what? I'm here. It's cold. There's snow everywhere

248
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,340
 I hate the snow

249
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,140
 And I was like, I'm just gonna like chill. I go tomorrow night

250
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,380
 I'll probably like walk around and look for ghosts and stuff like that

251
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,620
 But tonight we're just gonna chill and so I ended up watching for the very first time eastbound and down and I was laughing so hard

252
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,700
 That shows hilarious never heard of it before and I watched like six episodes

253
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,340
 They're doing like some marathon and showtime

254
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,980
 The next day I get up. I'm just kind of again walking around eating croissants, you know stuff

255
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,460
 You do normally hotels. I went for a walk around the hotel. It's just very normal place

256
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,460
 One thing I've noticed is that it's beautiful hotel was built like in 1907

257
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,580
 It's beautiful

258
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
 Like old school antique

259
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,980
 Really rich person hotel

260
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
 Just hardwood everywhere

261
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,340
 It's just it looks like you're walking around a giant mansion

262
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,180
 and

263
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,460
 In the middle of this like turn of the century built

264
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,380
 hotel

265
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,140
 There are these math. I mean massive like the size of a baby's head

266
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,700
 water mains like fire

267
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,700
 What are those things called

268
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,420
 Not necessarily like what are those fire sprinkler things was this? I mean like you be walking through this

269
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,940
 like

270
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:46,140
 Million dollar hotel and right above your head. There were these huge metal pipes running all it totally looked

271
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,700
 like half of it was

272
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,940
 Trump tower and then you look up slightly and you're like in the steerage section of titanic

273
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,780
 And you're like what it was weird because it was totally throwing off this vibe

274
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,740
 I'm thinking oh, you know, they probably just have to have like this world-class sprinkler system for

275
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,300
 You know because it's a fancy hotel. They don't it's maybe it's for insurance reasons

276
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,620
 I'd never been in a fancy hotel before I'd been in like

277
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,340
 I don't know

278
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,460
 I always thought holiday in was nice. So

279
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,420
 The next day I'm just kind of walking around exploring stuff walking but not like super exploring stuff like I said I was eating croissants

280
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,860
 And that night I said, you know what so now it's the second night

281
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,580
 I was like I'm gonna like just walk around and the place was

282
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,420
 packed

283
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
 Because it was winners for people were up skiing

284
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:39,980
 They had all the national guard people there not all of them obviously, but you know a bunch of national guard people there and their families

285
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,260
 Oh, oh, oh, so so this is when it started to get weird. So the whole thing is

286
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,220
 Ghost based around ghost tours and stuff like that

287
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,540
 Which is really not what I'd want to hear if I just came back from Iraq

288
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,500
 Being here about these tortured soul. They're like this person died a horrible death

289
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,900
 And now he's doomed to walk the planet and you're like

290
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,380
 I just watched a Hummer get blown up in front of me like three weeks ago

291
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,700
 I don't want to hear about this stuff and there were complaints about that afterwards people were like

292
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,220
 Don't ever have another seminar here all they ever talk about at the hotel

293
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,340
 Like all the tours are based around like people dying

294
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,900
 But he was so I go on the ghost tour

295
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,260
 During the day and they're like the tour guides this very attractive young woman and she's like

296
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,220
 Oh, this is the ballroom where sometimes you'll see like a ghost at 3 a.m

297
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,580
 Dancing around that I'm like, uh, and they're like this is this hallway and this is the door. This is room 237

298
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,620
 This is where Stephen King stayed or 217 or whatever

299
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,540
 This is where Stephen King stayed and this is from the movie and everyone's like, oh

300
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,260
 Then we go to this one room

301
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,740
 And she's like this room is haunted because inside this walk-in closet

302
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,980
 There's a ghost of a randy old man

303
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,420
 And if women walk in there, he'll feel you up

304
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,740
 He'll like grab your you know, he'll like tickle you or grab your butt or whatever

305
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,620
 And I'm like, uh, and she goes any volunteers that go in

306
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:12,460
 And this 13 year old girl goes all go in and the tour guides demeanor totally changes

307
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,940
 Before you know, she's dressed up in like this old school like colonial costume or 1900s costume, whatever

308
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,340
 And she's like been super bright and vibrant and she's talking about like this creepy pervert ghost in this closet

309
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,140
 Who grabs women and the little girl goes all go in and the tour guides demeanor completely changes

310
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,020
 She goes you have to be over 18 to enter the closet

311
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,900
 So I remember thinking okay

312
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,540
 What like if this is totally fake

313
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,460
 Why would it matter how old the person was because whoever goes in there?

314
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,780
 It's the power of suggestion. They're gonna go in there and they're gonna be come out and be like he touched my butt

315
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,740
 But if if there really is a perverted old man living in that closet

316
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,140
 You don't want to send a minor into that room

317
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,180
 I remember thinking they totally changed the color of the whole tour because before it was like

318
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,940
 You want to hear some campfire ghost stories and then after that it was like

319
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,100
 Stay away from the men to stay away from the old man with the candy. I was like, what?

320
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,220
 And I was like that's that's a weird thing you think I mean, maybe you don't want a 13 year old girl going in there

321
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,860
 And then coming out being like mommy mommy he touched me like even the power suggestion works

322
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,980
 But it's kind of I was like well, that's a weird reaction and that was just the beginning

323
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:42,940
 So that night I'm walking around the hotel by myself and it's probably around 10 o'clock at night

324
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,940
 And I wasn't like a big nerd and have my camera or my infrared scope or anything like that

325
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,220
 I might have had my I don't think I had a smartphone back then but you know, I wasn't like I'm gonna find me some ghost

326
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,580
 I'm gonna prove

327
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,100
 These exist. I just kind of wanted to walk around late at night in this creepy hotel because it is admittedly quite creepy

328
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,460
 And I get I'm walking down the hallways and I see

329
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,020
 Here talk about taking the boob hill guys. I see these four coeds

330
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,060
 Sitting kind of hanging outside their hotel room kind of chatting it up and I walk by and there's some guys

331
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,580
 They're like, hey, baby. What's up? Not to me to the girls

332
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,540
 So that would be a totally different story

333
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,740
 So I kind of walk around the hotel. I come back maybe 30 40 minutes later and they're still out there

334
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,180
 And I walk up to him. I'm like, hey, what's up? And they're like, oh nothing

335
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,820
 And they go, what are you doing? I was like, oh, you know, I'm just kind of exploring the hotel and stuff like that

336
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,500
 Of course, we started talking about ghosts because that's really why people come there

337
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,300
 So I just sit down there and I'm we're kind of just sitting on the floor outside their hotel room

338
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,020
 Two of the girls are kind of coming in and out and then the other two girls are staying out there the whole time

339
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,460
 We're just talking and stuff like that and one of the girl goes, you know, it's weird

340
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,940
 Before you showed up we kept hearing this noise in this door down

341
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,380
 The way like we can hear the alarm clock going off really loudly

342
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,380
 I'm like, well, that's not that weird and and she goes. Yeah, but what's weird is that?

343
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,020
 Why isn't anyone

344
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,900
 Acknowledging it like you think if the person in the room was asleep

345
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,140
 They shut off the alarm

346
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,580
 But at the very least the people in the neighboring rooms should be complaining because it's really really loud

347
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,740
 and I was like

348
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,660
 That's interesting. Yeah, let's go check that out and they're like, yeah, really? I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah

349
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,740
 Let's go. You know, I used to hunt ghosts and something. Yeah

350
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,620
 So we get up and we go down the hallway

351
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,180
 And I you can clearly hear this loud ass eat

352
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:39,180
 Eat the most annoying noise in the world is an alarm clock. You can't shut off

353
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,980
 Eat eat eat and it's very clear when you're standing outside the door

354
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,140
 And again, I'm thinking well, it could just be that the alarm clock's going off

355
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,020
 And I'm talking to the girls and I was like, it could just be the alarm clock's going off and

356
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,020
 Nobody knows that it's on and that the the walls are fairly thick

357
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,740
 at this point one of the girls

358
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,300
 kind of leans to the door

359
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,380
 and I think she went to test the handle or something like that and

360
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,060
 She it doesn't open

361
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:14,300
 She let's go the handle and we're talking there for a bit more and then the handle turns on its own

362
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,420
 Like someone's trying to get out

363
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,700
 So at that point we realized that either one of two things have happened

364
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,540
 There was either somebody in there and they thought someone was turning the knob to get in

365
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:29,660
 Or there wasn't someone in there and something was turning the knob to get out

366
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,180
 So we kind of like did a Scooby-Doo run

367
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,780
 Back down to where their room was and I was like, oh my god, that's totally terrifying

368
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,980
 But again, I'm thinking, you know, completely

369
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,300
 understandable

370
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:48,540
 Then we got in our brain to break into a janitor's closet. It was so bizarre

371
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,340
 That okay, that's standard Jason stuff

372
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,180
 And I remember there's this janitor closet. Oh the light was on in the janitor closet. That's why and again now

373
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,980
 We're like at midnight and I go that's weird the the lights on the janitor's. I don't know why I thought it was weird

374
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,820
 I think I was just saying stuff to impress chicks

375
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,820
 But I was like, you know, the janitor's lights on I wonder if there's something spooky in there

376
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,340
 And they go, oh, yeah, let's check it out. So we go now we're back on their floor

377
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,020
 I actually the whole thing the doorknob down the way also took place on their floor and the alarms clock did stop

378
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,540
 Going off after a certain point, but again alarm clocks electricity stuff turns on and off doorknobs

379
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,860
 Maybe when she turned the doorknob and let go and then we were talking maybe she tightened it and then undid itself

380
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,260
 There's rational explanations for a lot of this not all of it

381
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,900
 I remember I was thinking. Oh, you know, we should break into this janitor's closet

382
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,060
 I used to be a real hooligan back in the day. I didn't have a problem with like breaking into stuff

383
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,220
 So and I remember I want to impress these girls and I thought you know what I should do

384
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,580
 I should pull out like my credit card and like try to jimmy the door thing

385
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,780
 And it's not going to work. It never works because the way that the lock is it's

386
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:01,660
 The smooth part is on the other side on the your main part on the outside part. It's like the rectangle and on the inside

387
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,260
 It's the little

388
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
 Half moon shape thing

389
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,580
 And I thought but you know, I'm gonna try it'll be kind of cool

390
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,780
 Like to look make it look like I'm a burglar or something

391
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,100
 That wasn't far from the truth at the time

392
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:19,420
 But and I pulled out my credit card and I remember I stuck it in knowing full well it wouldn't work

393
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,460
 And it worked

394
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,580
 And I so I'm like in front of these girls and as a care I got this

395
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,820
 Pulling out my credit card knowing that I was just going to jiggle it around for a bit and then be like

396
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,060
 I must be one of the special lugs

397
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,660
 I pulled my credit card out

398
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,500
 I slide it against the lock and it goes click click and I was like holy shit now. Maybe that's not paranormal

399
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,580
 Maybe that's just me being a pimp

400
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,980
 But again, I or a badly designed door, but I thought that was really weird. It shouldn't happen

401
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,420
 The the janitor's closet was not haunted by the way

402
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,860
 But as the night progress you're like Jason you're just

403
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,020
 This random stuff. This is the creepy thing. So I'm sitting there with the girls and now we're probably around

404
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:04,060
 I don't know midnight one o'clock and I say, you know the scariest stuff supposedly happens at 3 a.m

405
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,580
 The witch's hour and they're like, oh really? Oh and I asked them. Why are you ladies here?

406
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,980
 Why are you it's spring break? That's okay. Yeah, I remember now was happening during spring break

407
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,140
 But there was snow everywhere. I guess it was in colorado. So there's always snow everywhere, but

408
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:23,420
 I go so why are you guys here? Like, why aren't you guys like on a beach and spring break? Oh, I should add if they were all

409
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,580
 really really hot

410
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,020
 I go, why are you guys here and not like at a beach somewhere and they go?

411
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,540
 Oh, we just wanted to go and see a bunch of ghosts and I'm thinking I said

412
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:38,380
 That's how horror movies start like going four hot girls going together

413
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,900
 To like a haunted like a purposely haunted location. You know how many horror movies start like that and they're like, oh

414
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,340
 They didn't make ghost noises, but I mean, you know because they were hot and I'm telling them are hot, but anyways

415
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,300
 So we're sitting there and I said let's stay up till

416
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,380
 I don't know how many people are still listening to this episode, but

417
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,340
 We're sitting there

418
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,980
 It's and I said let's stay up until 3 a.m. Now at this point two of the girls were like, you know what?

419
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,100
 We're tired. We're gonna go to bed but the other two girls were and at this point

420
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,380
 We're just chatting about all sorts of stuff their room was right on the corner

421
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,860
 So it was right next to us the staircase one of many staircases in the building

422
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,980
 And we're sitting there and we're talking and the girl who's sitting closest to the stairs goes

423
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,020
 Did you hear that?

424
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,300
 I see her kind of look over the awning and she goes

425
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:31,100
 Did you hear that me and the other girl are like, what did you hear and she goes?

426
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,780
 someone she was just walking up those stairs, but

427
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,580
 Like they stopped halfway and there's no one down there and I'm like what?

428
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,020
 The other girl would kind of look over that ledge and there's nobody down there

429
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,820
 It's like three or four flights of stairs and there's more stairs going up

430
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,820
 So maybe about an hour later

431
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,860
 We're all sitting there. We're talking

432
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,660
 And we all hear

433
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:01,420
 Someone walking up the stairs and you could hear like the

434
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:14,700
 Going up and the stairs don't seem to make that much noise when people normally walk on them

435
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,100
 But you can hear like the creak of each stair getting closer and closer

436
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,740
 And we're like what what was that?

437
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,940
 And then I think about an hour

438
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,660
 It happened again, maybe a half hour later. We hear the

439
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,940
 But now it's the flight

440
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:45,980
 Like so there's a flight of stairs a landing and then another flight of stairs and a landing a flight of stairs and a landing

441
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,860
 It's on the landing that we should be able if it's on the landing directly below us

442
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,860
 So it's like let's say 10 steps up

443
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,940
 Landing then 10 steps up that second 10 steps up is where we're at

444
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,900
 We hear a go

445
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,980
 Like slowly though, I'm not going to prolong it again and it goes up the landing we hear a

446
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:15,500
 Very clearly

447
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,380
 Like we're dead silent. We heard the walking earlier

448
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:25,820
 From floor to the floor underneath us and now we're hearing it at our landing basically

449
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,620
 Like below us

450
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,340
 And we're looking and there's nothing there. We clearly hear someone breathing

451
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,420
 And I remember thinking it had gone an hour long intervals

452
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,860
 So I think it was midnight the first time we heard it at the bottom of the stairs and then it was one

453
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,260
 And now it was two and we heard it on that landing and I thought it's happening. I told him I go it's happening every hour

454
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,100
 So whatever is doing this it's taking its time, but I said that means at 3 a.m

455
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,380
 It will be where we're at

456
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,620
 And I was like do you guys want to stay up till 3 a.m. And they're like hell yeah, dude

457
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,340
 We're almost there and we're sitting we're talking

458
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,620
 and then um having a good old time and sure enough

459
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,420
 I

460
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,380
 Walking up the stairs

461
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,460
 And then we don't hear anything

462
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,820
 It's not breathing in front of us. There's no jump scare. No big ghost

463
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:32,460
 And then we're like, okay, we're going to bed like whatever had whatever was walking had gotten to our floor

464
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,260
 Was where we would have been

465
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
 We didn't hear it walking past us

466
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,020
 We didn't look in the mirror and it say help me or anything creepy. It was just this weird

467
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,500
 Exhaired audio experience that we had

468
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,260
 And so we're like, okay, that was weird again. You don't know what's gonna happen

469
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,820
 We didn't know if we were all gonna get like taken to some hell dimension or something like that. Obviously it didn't happen

470
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,220
 Unless the hell dimension is where your friends forget it's your birthday

471
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,940
 however

472
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,540
 I said au revoir to the beautiful young women and went back to my room the next day though

473
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,180
 I was walking around the

474
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:16,540
 Hotel getting more croissants and there was a starbucks in there too. Oh, no, no, it wasn't a starbucks

475
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,780
 It was a normal coffee shop. So it sucked and

476
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,420
 I was talking to the guy

477
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,380
 We had the counter just like a you know a dude working a job

478
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,340
 I said, hey, what is it with all of these big pipes? I go you got this such a nice hotel

479
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,660
 The wire these giant water like water pipes. They totally ruins the vibe

480
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,700
 He looks at me and he goes

481
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,380
 Happy birthday jay. I was joking. He looks at me and he says

482
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:47,420
 You know how many fires get started in this place? He goes nobody knows why he goes there's fires everywhere in this place

483
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,620
 And so we have to have a state-of-the-art

484
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,500
 fire suppression system to stop it

485
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,580
 Everyone so the Stanley hotel sits above a town

486
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:05,260
 And I go, you know is do you think it's ghosts causing these fires and he looks at me and he says everyone in the town

487
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,380
 Has either been injured or know someone who's been injured at this hotel

488
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:16,780
 The people who live in town wouldn't care if this entire place burned down someday

489
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,300
 And then we my coffee

490
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,780
 I think that's an interesting button on that story because we hear like oh the spooky legends of this place

491
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
 But if you lived in the shadow

492
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,700
 Of a building that if it is truly haunted and it's the main source of your economy

493
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,460
 You would have people go. Hey, I'm gonna go get a job at

494
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,460
 Stanley. Yeah, I finally got my job and people would be like don't work there, honey

495
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:48,060
 Don't work there. You know what happened to your uncle. You know what happened to bruce. You know what happened to tina

496
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,140
 But that's really the only job in town

497
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,780
 It almost is like this shining-esque prison for the people there

498
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,700
 They have these mysterious fires and these

499
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:08,780
 Hauntings and these accidents and these injuries that don't see that's one thing you can sell people on come stay at our hotel

500
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,860
 It's spooky. You can't sell people on come stay at our hotel

501
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:18,380
 The people who work here get injured very very often you wouldn't have that

502
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,980
 You wouldn't put that in your brochure. So if people were like working on something like working on a ladder

503
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,500
 And the ladder gets knocked out from underneath them and they fall down and break their arm

504
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,780
 They're gonna quit because there'll be like there's I was the only one in that hallway

505
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,100
 Or some if a maid's cleaning a room and she turns around and a dresser's on fire

506
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,220
 She's going to be like i'm out of here. You're not going to put that stuff in your brochure

507
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,900
 You're going to talk about the spooky ghosts that float around in the ballroom

508
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,940
 Or the room that steven king wrote his

509
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,740
 Stories in but if the guy who worked there if he you know wasn't pulling my leg

510
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,900
 And I don't necessarily think he he he was because I was it was such an odd quack

511
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,180
 I asked him about the water mains and he just was like oh, this is why

512
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,700
 Rather than just being a barista and being like I don't know

513
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:09,980
 Other than the tour guides and the people being part of the hotel everyone else to them

514
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,420
 It was just a job. It wasn't this spooky adventure. They were on

515
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,620
 It was just them showing up to work. So when they're just like

516
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,540
 This place is cursed. It's not fun haunted

517
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:27,020
 People get injured here and the people in town wish this place would just be destroyed. That's different than

518
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:32,620
 You know wearing a colonial costume telling people to go into the closet full of the creepy pervert man

519
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,140
 I wouldn't go back there

520
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,700
 I got that sense of

521
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,740
 Negative energy from that place

522
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,540
 I've went there once

523
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,620
 I would not spend another night at the stanley hotel. That's my personal read on it

524
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,460
 I do think that I think I think it's you're very likely to get injured there

525
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,740
 And very likely for it. You're that world class fire suppression system to kick in

526
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:05,580
 I don't think it's a fun haunted place like say the winchester mystery house

527
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:11,740
 I think it's something much more sinister than that if you get the opportunity to go you you might want to take it but

528
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
 You know

529
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,020
 You might want to sleep with your eyes open and not go into your closet

530
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:27,020
