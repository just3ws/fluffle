00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 On February 24th, 2022, Russia invaded the Ukraine.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,420
 And did they accidentally set off the long-prophesized dimensional merge?

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:22,960
 And then we take a look at conspiracies involving nuclear missiles.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,800
 We know that UFOs and aliens have long been curious about the world's nuclear missiles.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,560
 Are they also currently being monitored by the forces of hell today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:47,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm just gonna say this right now.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,840
 I'm recording this episode on Sunday, February 27th. I don't know how things are in the future.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
 What things are going on Wednesday when this episode actually gets released?

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,640
 Hopefully the world is still in one piece. I don't think there's gonna be any widespread nuclear bombs.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,520
 I don't know how I really specified that. Nuclear landmines maybe. Local nuclear bombs maybe.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,480
 I'm hoping not, right? But as of the time I'm recording this in my haunted closet,

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,560
 nothing horrible like nuclear has happened. So that's good, right?

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,400
 Sure, listen to this podcast in the future from your MP3 player as the battery's slowly dying

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
 and the fallout is coming towards you. Like Jason, why'd you pick this stuff to talk about?

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,400
 And you recorded it so far in the future. Someone who always joins me when I'm hanging out in the

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,920
 future coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our Thanksgiving live stream supporters.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,320
 Give it up for the entire export. Woo! Come on in, come on in from the radio after fallout. Hurry up,

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:04,000
 hurry up, shut the door. Dead Rabbit Command is protected from all sorts of attacks. Again,

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,640
 these jokes are all completely insensitive if a nuclear strike has actually happened.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
 But I don't think it's gonna. The entire export, you're gonna be our captain or probably this

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
 episode. If you guys can't afford the show financially, I totally get it. Just help spread

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,360
 the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot. It really helps the show grow,

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,760
 which is also very exceptional. The entire export, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,880
 Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna float all the way out

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:41,520
 to the Ukraine. Export, go ahead and fly this Durgible over the Ukraine. We're definitely not

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,560
 gonna walk around. We're just gonna be up in this Durgible the entire time. February 24th, 2022

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:58,000
 was the day that Russia invaded the Ukraine. And that is also, I'm just gonna get to the chase right

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,160
 here, February 24th, 2022 is the birthday of Kris Chan, aka Christine Chandler. That name means

31
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,840
 nothing to you. You are a well-adjusted adult and shut off the podcast to never listen to me again

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
 and go on with your day. Don't know about the matters I'm about to talk about. We did an entire

33
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,200
 episode on Kris Chan a while ago. Kris Chan believes that eventually the fictional world will merge

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,640
 with the real world. So Gotham is gonna appear somewhere like where Chicago is and New York is

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
 gonna be replaced by Metropolis and regular New York's from all these other fictional universes,

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,800
 all fictional universes. Collide with Earth, you'll finally be able to challenge Sonic to a race,

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,400
 arm wrestle Popeye, and go hang gliding with Powerpuff Girls or whatever the world they do.

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,320
 The point is, is that it's all gonna collide, but it's also gonna be like super violent and

39
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:01,200
 destructive. So his birthday is the same day that Russia invades the Ukraine. He's 40 years old,

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,200
 I didn't know he was that old. He's 40 years old, this invasion starts. But what's even weirder

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,840
 is, what's even weirder than the fictional world colliding with our own, is for the first time

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:24,320
 we are able to see behind the curtain, visa v propaganda war. This is really really interesting.

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,080
 I got an email from Kris K, another longtime supporter of the show, actual founder of the

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,040
 Golden Rabbit Brigade, he's the guy who made me set up the Patreon in the first place.

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
 And he sent me this stuff, and I haven't been following the news, but he sent me this stuff

46
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,840
 about the ghost of Kiev and what this is. It's an unknown fighter pilot flying an older plane,

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:57,040
 a MiG-29 fulcrum, and on the very first day of the invasion shot down five Russian jets,

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
 plus a helicopter, that's kind of being a bully, right? What's a helicopter going to do to a jet?

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,280
 So anyway, shoots down five jets, worthy opponents, the helicopter was just a bonus target.

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,720
 I blew it up, and I remember seeing this on Twitter and it said this is the first combat

51
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,640
 ace in the past 52 years, no one's racked up this many jet kills in a day, and I was like,

52
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,760
 oh that's interesting, that's fascinating, footage started coming out of this jet.

53
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,720
 I was researching this story as it was going on by February 26th, so two days after the invasion,

54
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,200
 he'd already racked up another six jet kills, so he's sending out 11 kills right now,

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,880
 and you might be worried right now if you're a Russian pilot and you're like,

56
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,160
 oh no I didn't know about this guy, they don't let us look at the Twitter, he's fake, he doesn't exist.

57
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
 This is so fascinating to me, this is so interesting.

58
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
 We are seeing for the first time, I'm going to keep it brief because I know no one really

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,200
 wants to hear about this, right? You guys are like, you want to get to the nuclear weapon

60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 stuff, just the same reason I didn't talk a lot about coronavirus, right, when that was happening,

61
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,560
 because we hear about it all the time, but the Ghost of Kiev is something different.

62
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,160
 It was video game footage from the game War Thunder coupled with some unsourced tweets

63
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:24,160
 and people needing hope that created the Ghost of Kiev. Even the former president of the Ukraine

64
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,320
 tweeted, oh no no no, because people started going, oh it's fake, it's from this video game,

65
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,160
 we totally know it because the clouds, the clouds had a little turtle with a fishing

66
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,360
 pole in it, it's obviously a video game. The former president of the Ukraine goes, oh no no no,

67
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,720
 yeah I know that was, I know that was fake, but he's real, and here's a photo of him, here's a photo

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,360
 of the Ghost of Kiev sitting in his jet and that photo was from 2019. That was an old photo from

69
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,000
 some Chinese website, it's so weird and they're creating these fictional, I don't know who's doing

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,640
 this, the Ghost of Kiev was a joke, but it spun out of control and people started believing it,

71
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,240
 and then Newsweek had to start running articles being like, we don't know if the Ghost of Kiev is

72
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,000
 real or not, but we know that this video footage is fake, but maybe there is a Ghost of Kiev out

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,480
 there, then they, I started seeing stuff about this guy called the Ukrainian maniac, no I'm sorry

74
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,320
 the Ukrainian Reaper, the maniac's copyright, that's another guy, the Ukrainian Reaper, I saw an

75
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:29,520
 article on him, 20 confirmed kills of Russians on the first day, right, and so he, that guy's

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,920
 going around, it's like move out of the way, move out of the way, fake propaganda thing that no one

77
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,680
 believes in anymore, this time it's the Ukrainian Reaper, and by now there was one, some guy started

78
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,760
 the Odessa Aspandant, and that was this guy had had a confirmed 20 butt rapes of Russian soldiers,

79
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,880
 and that's obviously fake, right, but the point is, now all the jokes are coming out about it,

80
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,120
 we don't know what's real, that guy's not real, don't worry about your butt, if you're Russian,

81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,320
 don't worry about the Odessa Aspandant, but we don't know what's real, and this started so quickly

82
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,840
 that when I'm sitting here at home and I'm reading reports, reading news articles and

83
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,680
 we're talking about this amount of troops have been killed and this is going on and they have

84
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:24,160
 this but they, I don't know, I don't know what's real, fascinating, fascinating, I don't know what to

85
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,440
 believe, Putin's troops have been stopped at this city, Orange Glow, seen over Kiev was a new

86
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,480
 detonated, talks are gonna happen on this border, I don't know, I don't know if any of that's real,

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,520
 at all, fascinating and really alarming, isn't it, I have a conspiracy theory, America

88
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,960
 has never gone to war with an English speaking enemy since the civil war, and I think there's

89
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,120
 a reason for that, I think if you could sit there and watch the world leaders and you could understand

90
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
 what they're saying, you could be like, I don't know, Saddam Hussein's making pretty good points,

91
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,200
 maybe he should be torturing all those people, I don't know, I thought torture was bad, but he's

92
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,960
 a really good speaker, America does not fight people who speak English and I think there's a

93
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,800
 reason for that, I think it's because they don't want us to know what they're fighting and it's not,

94
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,120
 it's not a racial thing either, because they walked all over the world, they walked all over

95
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,760
 Europe, stepping on people, right, fought the Germans, fought the Italians, fought the Spanish,

96
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,720
 and had nothing to do with race, they don't fight people who speak English as a first language

97
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,920
 since the civil war, and I think it's a propaganda reason, I do think that's a conspiracy theory

98
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,720
 I have, I think that they don't pick that fight, because if we went to war with England and we

99
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
 could listen to what they were saying, I have to depend on the government's telling me these guys

100
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
 are the bad guys, I mean yeah, when you fly a couple planes into the World Trade Center,

101
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,120
 that you're a bad guy, but I remember there was that speed, I remember there was, there's like,

102
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,520
 we found video footage of Osama bin Laden bragging about the 9/11 attacks, it was all over the news,

103
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,360
 and then it later came out like a month later, like that's not what he was saying,

104
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
 these independent translators are like, that's not what he said, but I don't know, do I believe the

105
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,120
 independent translators, do I believe the guy, very rarely believe the government, but do I believe

106
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,840
 the independent translators, do I believe these translators, do I believe these troop movements

107
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,720
 in the Ukraine, do I believe these troop movements in the Ukraine, I don't know what's going on,

108
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,200
 and I'm reading a bunch of stuff, and I've come to the conclusion that I think everything that you

109
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,280
 know, this is including me, if you took the total sum of your knowledge, 10% of it is factually

110
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,400
 incorrect, I'm not talking about political opinions, I'm not talking about religious opinions,

111
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,960
 I'm talking about 10% of what a normal person actually believes to be true is probably false,

112
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,160
 and now we have this war that's going on, that we don't know what's going on, I can watch camera

113
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,160
 footage, I can watch like streaming camera footage of Kiev and these other cities in the Ukraine,

114
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,520
 you must be really bored if you're sitting watching this camera footage, beautiful cities,

115
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,480
 right, I'm just seeing cars drive down the road and stuff like that, I don't know what I was

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,400
 expecting, like call of duty cutscenes with a bunch of helicopters and mortars,

117
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,560
 well again, I'm recording this episode on Sunday, that stuff may have happened by the time you

118
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,160
 hear it on Wednesday, and I obviously know there's a war going on over there, I'm not saying that

119
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,520
 it's not real, but I don't know what's true, I'm hearing all this stuff that Russia's getting

120
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,320
 stymied here and stymied here and he can't move the troops and da da da da, and for all I know,

121
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
 two days from now the entire country could be taken over by Russia, and everyone's like,

122
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,800
 wait, I thought you said that the Odessa Aspen did was protecting the country, I thought you said

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
 that he had been stopped on all these things, and then the people who told us those propaganda

124
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,640
 stories are like, they don't even, people don't even apologize anymore for telling you the wrong

125
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,520
 thing, fascinating, like I've never seen, I lived through the first Iraq war and the second Iraq

126
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,120
 war and all this stuff, and I remember hearing about Iraqi soldiers going in and taking babies

127
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,440
 right out of the incubators when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, the first before they secured any

128
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,000
 strategic targets, they went to local hospital and pulled babies out of the incubators, I remember

129
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,720
 hearing that, there is an Iraqi woman testifying before Congress saying this happened, never happened,

130
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,360
 never happened, that story about soldiers taking babies out of incubators is an old story,

131
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,240
 it's been, it's happened in a couple different wars, so what's real, fascinating story, the ghost

132
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,360
 of Kiev, people are saying the footage isn't real, but he's real and now I think people have kind of

133
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,520
 moved on because he's not, and people are making up brand new characters, they're like the juggernaut

134
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,240
 of Kiev, he gets plus two defense if he fights more than five Russians at a time, and that stuff's

135
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,160
 obviously favorite, those are jokes, but at the same time real propaganda is being put at, and I'm

136
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,920
 watching history unfold in real time and I don't know what's true, and you can go Jason, well you

137
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,080
 gotta go to Lewis, this website, this website has all the true information, are you sure?

138
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:19,840
 Are you sure? Like you don't know, I mean you could be sitting in the Ukraine right now, you're

139
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,680
 like yeah I know, here's a photo of what's going on, but fascinating, it's fascinating to see this

140
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:35,280
 propaganda war play out in real time, and Christian's birthday, does this have enough, is this part

141
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,880
 of this dimensional merge, because what we're having is we're having fictional event, you didn't

142
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,520
 think I was gonna get back to that, you thought that was clickbait, we're having a real event

143
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,880
 with fictional characters in the real event, and people are believing the fictional characters,

144
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:56,880
 does it become a tolpa at a certain point? Could we see a ghost of Kiev, a person flying this older

145
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,560
 jet? Chris Kaye had the suggestion, maybe it's a ghost, maybe it's a literal ghost, that's why it's

146
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,640
 in such an old jet, and connected it to my episode about George Washington fighting his ghost, fighting

147
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,160
 during the Battle of Gettysburg, I'll put that episode in the show notes, but yeah, it feels like

148
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 the real world and the fake world are colliding, and I know there's always been, see here's the

149
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
 difference, you go Jason there's always been propaganda during war, there's always been these

150
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,680
 type of characters, we don't see them, because they don't exist, but with the footage you can

151
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,280
 actually show footage that in a tweet in the little low res tweet box, looks like a jet flying

152
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:45,120
 overhead, right? I was fooled, I was fooled, so before you would have, and also these stories

153
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,760
 would be local to the combat, you'd be like oh and you won't believe it, this guy he took on 10

154
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,080
 soldiers at once, he had an AK-47 in each hand and perfect aim and just every bullet landed a

155
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,520
 headshot, it was amazing and that would inspire people locally to walk around with two AK-47s,

156
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,280
 if he can do what I can do it, it was local stuff in the battlefield and now you can have footage of it.

157
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:14,560
 Fascinating, absolutely fascinating, we are taking the real and making it fake, we are taking

158
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,800
 the fake and making it real, and in front of all of it is the looming shadow of chris-chan,

159
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,040
 leaves their big old stamp on it, weird story, the real is fake, the fake is real, I don't know

160
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:35,360
 what to believe, anything could happen and even after the dust is settled, will we know the truth?

161
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,080
 Who knows, who knows? The entire export, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carboner

162
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:50,880
 copter, we're leaving behind Kiev, we are headed all the way out to Johnson County, Missouri,

163
00:15:50,880 --> 00:16:20,880
 DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADAD

164
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,880
 his team, his job was to provide security for the nukes there, so I mean that would be so boring

165
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
 if you think about it, you just be sitting there all day long, who's going to break in and steal a

166
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,560
 nuke, bring up a flatbed truck, I guess you could just put up some camera, you're like,

167
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,960
 they're not worried about someone stealing an entire nuclear missile, it's so people don't go

168
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,000
 in and sabotage it or copy it, some guy comes in with a piece of paper and traces it and then takes

169
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,200
 it back to russian, this is what their missiles look like, give me a million dollars, I got you

170
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,960
 some intel, it just sounds boring, at least if you were like, if I was a security guard, if you

171
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:05,680
 said you can guard this nuclear missile or you can guard this, you can guard this jewel that the

172
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,560
 penguin is trying to steal, I'd much rather do that, I guess then I'd probably get gassed in the face

173
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,400
 or kicked in the nuts by a penguin, but still it'd be more exciting, anyways he's walking around,

174
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,760
 he's working for the military, the military is 99% just boring, he's sitting there and he's doing

175
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,520
 his job one night and this night they're actually getting ready to move some warheads around,

176
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,920
 they're shuffling them up, they're like only one of these warheads are real, can you guess which one

177
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,480
 and they're putting them on different missiles, he goes, I remember I'm sitting there, we're moving

178
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:48,000
 these warheads around and I see up in the night sky a glowing ball high up there and he's like,

179
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
 hmm it's really high, there might be a satellite right, I heard those things are pretty high up,

180
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,760
 but it's look, it's hovering there for a long time and once the transport team shows up to

181
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,840
 officially move the warhead, he said it just kind of bounced a bit and then shot up directly into

182
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,160
 the sky, disappeared, never saw a satellite do that before, however to be fair it'll sit outside

183
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,960
 and watch satellites all day long, here's the thing, it's pretty common to have UFOs over nuclear

184
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,360
 power plants, we have a lot of stories about that stuff and I think most of those are terrestrial

185
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,400
 spy planes, so when you were moving the warheads around, so of course the Russians or the Chinese

186
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,680
 or France or Egypt or Israel or Australia or any of these other countries that wants to know what's

187
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,640
 going on, they want to know what we're doing, they're trying to guess which warhead's the real

188
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,200
 warhead, but we have a lot of stories about UFOs flown overhead, what makes this more interesting

189
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,880
 is we're in the year of 2006 and it's summertime, this dude Adrian's at his workspace and he's in

190
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
 a restricted area, I mean technically the entire military base is restricted, I'm not allowed to

191
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,640
 go there with an ice cream cone and start taking pictures, but he's in an extra restricted area,

192
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,320
 so he's alone in this area, the rest of his team is working on a trainer bomb, it's like a

193
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,040
 fisher price bomb, all the pieces are huge and plastic, he's sitting there in this restricted

194
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,200
 area and he hears the sound of footsteps walking down the hall and he immediately realized something

195
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,520
 was off because one, he knew he was the only person there, but two, everyone in the military wears

196
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:37,280
 boots, but these were not boot footsteps, these were the footsteps, this dude totally has a

197
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,840
 foot fetish, I never would have been able to pick this out, only someone who's heard feet,

198
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,240
 like watches YouTube videos of nothing but feet walking, ASMR, he goes these were not allegedly,

199
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,800
 don't sue me if you don't really have a foot fetish Adrian, but he goes I did not hear the

200
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,440
 sound of boots walking down the hallways, I heard the sound of bare feet walking down the hallways,

201
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:08,400
 short tiny, short tiny delicate feet with a little wisp of a long afternoon playing tennis,

202
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:17,120
 I added that was not his description, he hears the sound of bare feet in the hallways and he looks

203
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,440
 up and he doesn't see anything and the sound goes away, so he just goes back to work which is probably

204
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,440
 playing with his phone, a couple minutes later the sound comes back, he's on YouTube looking up

205
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,080
 feet noises and he's like what where is that sound coming from, oh well I also put my headphones back

206
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,280
 in and keep watching feet, a couple minutes later he hears more feet walking around behind him and

207
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,680
 this time he can tell the sound is moving away from the area that he's at, so he gets up and he

208
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:55,840
 gets up in turns just in time to see a blurry figure walk around the corner, he said this figure

209
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,920
 was about six feet tall and it was blurry, it was completely indistinct figure, he says it reminded

210
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,440
 him of if you took a black mass, a black swirling mass and compressed it into the shape of a human

211
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,400
 walking through the hallway, now remember this is a restricted area, he's supposed to be the only one

212
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,960
 in this area plus he also wants to see this dude's feet, so he gets up, I don't know I feel so bad for

213
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,120
 this guy, all of a sudden he's defining trade, he loves feet, he gets up and he begins running down

214
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,040
 the hallway and he wants to catch this guy, he wants to know what it is right, so he goes down

215
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,320
 the hallway and he turns and he looks down this long hallway, nothing, he begins searching all

216
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,120
 over the area, he goes into the offices, he goes into the break room, he gets on all fours and he's

217
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,280
 sniffing, sniffing around, now I know the sense of feet but where is this one gone,

218
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:00,160
 nothing, he can't find it anywhere, he goes this is a secure base, this is a military base, how did

219
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,960
 anyone get in here, all the doors are secured, no alarms went off and so he just goes back to his

220
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:15,680
 workstation, he walks back, takes his shoes off, takes his shoes off and walks through the hallway,

221
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:24,720
 his bare feet touching the cold linoleum floor, you'll expect his workstation all depressed,

222
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,400
 tears himself up, I take in a quick whiff of his own socks and goes, you know what, I'm not going

223
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,080
 to report this because I'll just be considered a lunatic, I'll be considered a foot-smelling lunatic,

224
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,920
 you know he goes, I don't know why I've made it, this is his defining trait but it's all part of

225
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,960
 the propaganda, it's all part of the propaganda machine, he goes I'm not going to report this

226
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,920
 because people will think I'm crazy, and that's true, if you went to your boss at work, because I

227
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,360
 do this at every workplace, every workplace I've ever worked has been haunted, I don't think Wells

228
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,800
 Fargo was haunted, that was like this call center, they're not around anymore but all my other jobs,

229
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,440
 I've been like this place haunted, there's a ghost here, that's why I wasn't able to come

230
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,720
 to work sir, because a ghost was in my desk and it was super spooky so I stayed home for three days,

231
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,680
 I've worked at a lot of haunted places, I worked at a haunted pizza parlor, technically I brought

232
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,560
 the ghost to the pizza parlor, the pizza parlor wasn't haunted, I did an episode on that, and then

233
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,400
 I just worked a lot of haunted places, but I dare you to do this, where you work, go to your boss

234
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,080
 and say hey you know I like working here and all, but every so often there's a swirling black mass

235
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:45,360
 in the shape of a human that walks around and doesn't wear any shoes, tell your boss that

236
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,680
 and watch how quickly your hours get reduced, they will think you're a lunatic, they'll be like

237
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,920
 wait a second, unless you work in Shadowman or us and he's like well I'm glad you saw that,

238
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,720
 I'm glad you reported that to me, because that means we have more inventory, usually people,

239
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,720
 and they may not actually reduce your hours or fire you or anything like that, but like what?

240
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,200
 But what's in, so we have this report right now, this is a Shadowman, and Shadowman kind of fallen

241
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,560
 to the realm of the paranormal, not necessarily alien, and this report is not alone, outside of

242
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,680
 Las Vegas, Nevada, we all know about area 51, but what a lot of people forget is that's area 51,

243
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,760
 there's 50 more of these areas scattered around the United States, area two is outside of Las

244
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,760
 Vegas, Nevada, and we have a report from Chris Cabera, former Air Force Security Officer, he

245
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,040
 said he was on this base and he sees this black mass, very similar to what Adrian saw, walking

246
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:53,600
 around the facility, but he said this one didn't have a head, this one just had like its shoulders

247
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,960
 and its arms and it was walking around, and there are other reports of shadow people on this base

248
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,960
 as well. So we have the UFO encounters, we have a ton of those, couldn't even tell you all of them,

249
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,160
 there's so many encounters of aliens, or UFOs at least, over nuclear bases, but here we have

250
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:22,560
 shadow people, which tend to be more in the realm of ghosts and demons than aliens, so why are the

251
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,280
 shadow people here, what I think is interesting is first off, let's put on our skeptic hat,

252
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,720
 which is nothing because we don't believe in hats, skeptics don't believe in anything,

253
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,160
 technically my go-to, let's say these stories are true, right, you're like Jason is skeptic,

254
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,280
 wouldn't even give me that much, but let's say that these stories are true, my first go-to is,

255
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,680
 these aren't shadow people, this is camouflage technology, these are actual humans walking

256
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,800
 around, and this is good as it gets, they're like "hey can I have a suit that makes me invisible?"

257
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,480
 and the scientist goes "well I can make a suit that makes you less visible, how would you like

258
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,240
 to be a swirling black mass?" and they're like "what, that actually makes me more visible,

259
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,720
 I'm trying not to cause any commotion at all." They're like "listen," the scientist goes "I can't

260
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,440
 make you invisible, what do you think this is Harry Potter?" but what I can do is make it so if

261
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,000
 somebody looked and saw you, you would look like a ghost, scientist comes out with a white sheet

262
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,120
 with holes in it, he's like "here you go, that'll be $50 million please, I can make you look like a

263
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,040
 shadow person." But there's two limits to the technology, one you can't wear suits with it,

264
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:41,120
 for whatever reason, we can turn everything into a shadow but your shoes, your Nike Air Force

265
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,840
 ones have to remain at base, but they'll be able to see you, but if they look at you, no one's going

266
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,440
 to tell anyone that there's a shadow person walking around and you go "Jason that's actually quite

267
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,160
 fascinating, that's the reason why I listen to your podcast." However, what about the dude with no

268
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,400
 head? They send in a spy with no head, I got an answer for that too, no, they send in a spy with

269
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,520
 the head because that's kind of integral to being a spy, but he was probably like looking down,

270
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,840
 like eating an ice cream cone, I actually don't have a reason for why he wouldn't have it, I figure

271
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,400
 maybe if he was looking down, but even if I looked down, was eating an ice cream cone, first off,

272
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,200
 first rule of being a spy, 20 ice cream cones on your mission, but maybe he was like trying to

273
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,840
 fix a zipper or something like that, or maybe he was looking down at his beautiful feet, I don't know,

274
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,320
 but anyways if you looked down enough, you would just see shoulders and you wouldn't see the top

275
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,080
 of your head or that you had a head, and he could be doing that, he could have been a double-jointed

276
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,880
 freak who also had a camouflage technology, that would be my first guess, right? Because I believe

277
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,240
 a lot of the UFOs we see over nuclear plants are terrestrial in nature, and this could be,

278
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,480
 same thing, this could be a spy from another country who has this camouflage technology

279
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,920
 and is walking around, and then I started thinking, "Wow, I wonder how many shadow people actually

280
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:05,360
 are spies?" But then I remember most of the shadow people that I've personally seen were in my grandma's

281
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,960
 backyard, and I don't think the CIA was going to my grandma's backyard because she was growing weed

282
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,520
 or whatever, she was growing weed, but I don't think the CIA was there for that, I think, I think,

283
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,600
 I've seen shadow people and they definitely weren't agents of the federal government, I've

284
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,800
 stuck my hand inside of them, I'll put that episode in the show notes, it was a really good

285
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:34,720
 episode, but it would be an easy way to be less noticeable, right, to basically be unbelievable

286
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:42,320
 you'd be unbelievable in that moment. Then there's the option these are actual shadow people,

287
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,200
 and the thing with shadow people is we don't know what this phenomenon is, they're not demons,

288
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,880
 they're not ghosts, this is something that really the best way to describe them is alien.

289
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,400
 I think one of the best explanations I heard, it's definitely most evocative, is that the

290
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:09,360
 shadow people were the original inhabitants of hell, when the big giant war happened in heaven

291
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,680
 and God threw down one third of the angels into hell, there's much shadow people there already

292
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,880
 and they're like, ah, and because they seem so aloof when I've encountered shadow people, it's,

293
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,800
 I, it makes you feel like an ant, it makes you feel like a pet, it's super weird, like when you see

294
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:37,440
 these things, they, the same way you don't really care if there's a potato bug in your bushes outside

295
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,880
 your house is the way it feels when you encounter a shadow person, you're not terrified of them,

296
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,640
 they don't care that you exist, you can do nothing to them, you're less than an ant, because even an

297
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,320
 ant you're like, oh dude get out of here, I love ants, so I feed ants, but most people would be

298
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,880
 like dude get out of here, go away ant, they don't even care, they're so, they know we exist,

299
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,920
 but they just don't care, there's nothing we can do for them, so it's such an aloofness that makes

300
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,480
 it weird, like a ghost may try to deliver you a message, a demon may try to scare you or trick

301
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,520
 you, the shadow person wants to do neither, they just, it's not even that they want to be left

302
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:28,320
 alone or they want to exist, it's, they're so aloof, you can't even put a, like an intention

303
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,240
 on them, it's very, very weird, I've interacted with ghosts and I've interacted with demons and I've

304
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,480
 interacted with shadow people and out of the three, the shadow people are the most, I won't say the

305
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,880
 most upsetting because that's the demons, but there's just, you feel insignificant to them,

306
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,680
 like you're not even part of their daily structure, demons want to cause a downfall of man,

307
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,360
 ghosts are just floating around and stuff, but it's so, I can't even, there's nothing I can

308
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,760
 compare it to, because at least like a pet we take care of, I can't, but anyway so it's super weird

309
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,920
 to be around these things that have no feeling for you up or down, they know you exist, they don't

310
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,520
 really care, fascinating, why are they at these nuclear facilities, if these shadow people, these

311
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:28,400
 are legitimate shadow people sightings, what are they doing at these facilities? We don't know,

312
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,760
 that's the thing, they are so aloof, I can't even come up with a theory. Now I have a follow-up

313
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,040
 story, I didn't have time to talk about today because I do have an encounter, it's not necessarily

314
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:47,120
 nuclear, but it's along the same lines, of a monster being sighted at a NASA facility,

315
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,160
 I ran out of time, I ran out of time, I spent so much time telling feet jokes,

316
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,080
 there was another story I want to cover, I'm gonna have to save it for another episode, but

317
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:05,680
 we talked about shadow people at these facilities, what if I told you that there's another story,

318
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,160
 it's about a monster at a NASA facility, there's multiple sightings of this giant monster,

319
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,640
 it doesn't say whether or not it wears shoes at a NASA facility, but we will save that,

320
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,280
 that's a little teaser for a future episode, I do think that demons would have, just like aliens,

321
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,920
 an interest in our technology, but the interesting thing is aliens, I believe, would want to stop us

322
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,760
 from nuking ourselves, the forces of darkness would love to do nothing but encourage it,

323
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,080
 so if the original inhabitants of hell are walking around our nuclear bases,

324
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,000
 maybe they are just passing through, right, or maybe they're not as uninterested as they seem,

325
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,760
 maybe they're just uninterested in me, because they make me feel insignificant,

326
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,640
 maybe this is the first scouting mission for their infernal neighbors,

327
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,880
 because if you think a madman with a nuclear arsenal is dangerous, imagine a demon without much power,

328
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:18,000
 imagine a dark prince of hell with the ability to press a single button, and start nuclear armageddon,

329
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:29,040
 truly a frightening thought, as nukes rain down on the planet, and vaporize human life,

330
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:37,360
 it sends countless souls into the clutches of satan, while also turning god's greatest creation

331
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:49,200
 into a charred landscape, choked with fire and smoke, spinning forever alone through a silent cosmos.
