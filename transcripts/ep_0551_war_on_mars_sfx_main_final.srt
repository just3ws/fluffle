1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, fellow citizens, for too long we have let the red menace invade our homes.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 They have enslaved our men, mated with our women to create monstrous hybrids.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 They have kidnapped our children, they have mutilated our livestock, but no more.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 While our leaders may have sold us out to this hostile invading force we will no longer stand for.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We know now that it is up to us to save the future.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 These creatures try to overtake us with weapons of war, with plagues, but no war.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Tonight we take the fight to them, and what a fight it will be.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 There will not be a moment of rest, there will be no mercy.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We will fight them on the red dusty plains.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 We will fight them in the canals.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We will fight them on the tip of Olympus Mons and reduce it to rubble.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We have chosen us to be the generation to take the war to them.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 We will show them that we are the kings of this solar system.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We are the lords of this galaxy.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We alone are the masters of the universe.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Tonight everything changes.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Tonight we unite with one cry.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Earth first, now and forever.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Earth first.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Earth first, now and forever.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Prepare my starship.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We're headed to Mars.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 No, I did not just spend two hours recording, two and a half minutes of audio.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 No, I did not just walk around my apartment yelling out "Earth first!"

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Over and over and over again to try to save.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 That was an actual crowd that showed up.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Can you believe it?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And they're here because we have an action-filled episode.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 But first off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 We have Adam Dunn.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Everyone give Adam Dunn a round of applause.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Earth first, Earth first as he's walking out.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I totally blew my throat out yelling that.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But it was worth it.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But Adam is ready to go. He already has a space suit on.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I hope you brought one.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I hope you dropped half a million dollars for your own space suit.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Because we are getting ready to head up to the red planet known as Mars.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Adam is sitting at the controls of the dead rabbit rocket we're all strapped in and...

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 [Exhales]

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 We're headed off to that crimson ball in the sky.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So we're taking the rocket up to the red planet.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I'm gonna see how many different ways I can say Mars, because I'm gonna be saying it a lot.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 The crimson globe.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 That's it.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 That was nearly two, I think I already said those ones anyways.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The burgundy ball.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Adam lands us in the middle of Mars.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 It's just vast wasteland as far as the eye can see.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Now there's been a lot of rumors about Mars.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 There's obviously like scientific stuff we know like...

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 That it exists? That it's there? That it's real?

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 There's water on the caps and stuff like that.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 There's long been stories about aliens on Mars.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Recently a man known as Captain K appeared on the reputable mainstream news website.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 ExoNewsTV.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Whose tagline is for news that's out of this world.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 That's when you know you're on a legit news website when you actually have a tagline like that.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 ExoNewsTV was recently interviewing this Captain, Captain K, who served on Mars.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I bet you didn't know that, right?

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 But you didn't know that we actually have military men on Mars right now.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He did 20 years on Mars.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 His job was to protect the Martian colony there from two indigenous alien races.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 So we're ready to fight. We got all of our guns loaded up to plasma rifles.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 We're headed in with first wave.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Just means more Martians for us to kill.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 We're walking through the desert.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Now supposedly there is an insectoid, an indigenous insectoid race on the planet.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 You're looking around, you're waiting to see an insect.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It's just me eating a wetchamacallit, throwing the wrapper on the ground.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 You're like, "Hey dude, you're on the alien planet. Maybe you shouldn't litter.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Maybe we shouldn't repeat the problems we had before."

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 But wetchamacallits are so good. It's worth littering.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You're like, "How did you even eat a wetchamacallit? You're wearing a space helmet."

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yeah, you know.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Where there's a will, there's a way.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 I'm sticking it into the oxygen vent and just breathing it in.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 He also says that there's an indigenous race of reptilians.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 I'm looking around. I don't know what I could eat that would make that noise.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He did 20 years on Mars protecting the Martian Colony Corporation from these races.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Now he said as long as you didn't go into their territory, they didn't really attack you.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So there was kind of a peace going on for a long time.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 But for whatever reason, probably just human greed and/or curiosity, or both,

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 they decided to steal the Mars Colony Corporation thought,

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 "Hmm, we know there's this ancient alien artifact out in the middle of nowhere.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Anyplace on Mars. Let's go get it."

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So Captain K and over a thousand other soldiers, they got their weapons ready.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 They set off to find this alien relic.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Hopefully it was an insectoid relic.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I don't think insectoids get enough love.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 I think insectoid aliens are really cool.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I wish they would show up in more stories.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But we're approaching this cave where the human insectoid,

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 we're going to say it's an insectoid.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He didn't specify what alien race in the article said.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 The human insectoid battle for the relic took place.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Raiders of the Lost Blark? I don't know.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Doesn't work. Maybe aliens use the word "blark."

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We walk into this cave.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Crunch, crunch, crunch.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's me walking and eating a bunch of a collet at the same time.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And we see a US-issued blaster rifle, an F97400,

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 collecting dust on the ground.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's kind of unsettling.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 You think that the humans should have picked up after themselves

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and not be killed in the first place.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And as we're continuing our way into this cave,

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 we see yet another blaster rifle.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 A laser pistol.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 A tectonic grenade.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 We're walking over the debris of a sci-fi battle

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 and we see a valley inside the cave.

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It is littered with the corpses of 1,000 of our fellow earthlings.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Now there's a lot of insectoid corpses as well.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 But we see often the distance a glimmering relic.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 It's a little statue. It's a little statue of an insectoid.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 It was not taken by the Mars Colony Corporation.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 According to Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in this battle.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Himself and 28 others made it back to base.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 They didn't get the relic.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And he got a promotion actually.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 They're like, "Congratulations, here you go."

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 He ended up being removed from Mars.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 He did 17 years on Mars in the remaining three years.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 They taught him how to fly spaceships.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 They're like, "You're obviously not that good of a combat veteran.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 You couldn't still statue from a bunch of insectoids."

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So here, we're going to teach you how to fly spaceships.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 He flew spaceships between Earth and Mars on the moon for about three years.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And now he's on ExoNews television telling you all about it.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Nothing says top secret government operation

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 than being able to reveal it with your face on ExoNews TV or just anywhere, right?

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 You would assume this really was a real secret operation.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They'd be like, "Here's your medal!"

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And as they go to pin the medal on you, they go, "Oops!"

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And they drop it on the ground.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And then military procedure is, if someone drops your medal, you have to pick it up.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And so as he's leaning down to pick up the medal,

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 BOOM!

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Blaster shot to the base of the skull.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's pretty grim, right?

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They could have just put a pillow over his head.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But I would find it hard to believe that they would just be like,

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 "Oh, you served all this time and you fought these aliens and all the secret stuff.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So here you go. Here's your retirement and also here's a Wi-Fi connection for you.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It's ultra-fast so you can communicate with ExoNews TV."

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But that is Captain K's story.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 We are walking out of this cave.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We say goodbye to our fallen Earthmen.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 We're walking back to the Mars colony.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Now, the Mars colony, this is what I find very fascinating about all of this stuff,

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 is you have all of these conflicting stories about what's going on.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 According to Captain K, it's just a colony.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 There's just so much people up there and they're sitting around and they're trying to figure out

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 what they can steal, how they can irritate the indigenous alien races.

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 But the more common alien conspiracy theory, one that's gaining a lot of traction now,

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 is the slave colony on Mars.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Adam Dunn, call in that Jason Jalopy.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 It's been modified for Martian use.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It just has a bubble. It just has a bubble over the roof now.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Everything else is the same. It still works like an old Jalopy.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Adam's driving us across the desert of Mars and we see a glimmering little domed city

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 off in the distance. You can't see what else goes.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 So don't try looking.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 But we can see it where we're at.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Car is driving across the orange oval known as Mars.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 We stop outside of the domed city.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Door opens up. Just an empty hallway in front of us.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Keep your guns ready.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 You might have succeeded in stealing something.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 The insectoids may have raided this base.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 We're walking through this colony.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Lights flickering.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 There's a creepy rocking chair in the corner rocking by itself.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Ring around the rosy.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 What did you hear that? What's going on?

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Walking through this abandoned base.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 But it's not really abandoned. I don't know why you say it's abandoned.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It's not abandoned.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I'm trying to build a mood that it's creepy.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Here's the conspiracy theory.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 There's two twins standing in the corner.

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Here's the conspiracy theory. This is a very common one, but I think I have a new spin on it.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Back in 2017, there was a man known as Robert Steele.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 He says that he's a former CIA operative.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 He was actually on the Alex Jones show.

190
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Now, there's no video of this anymore. It might be on one of like Bitshoot or something like that,

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 but it's not on YouTube. It's completely gone.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But we have a lot of quotes because this was very well covered in the mainstream media.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Robert Steele goes on the Alex Jones show and he says that - let me read you this quote here -

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 "We actually believe there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children who were kidnapped and sent into space on a 20-year ride."

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Save your questions. Save your questions for the end, because I know obviously you're like, "Wait, what?"

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 "We actually believe that there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children who were kidnapped and sent into space on a 20-year ride."

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 "So that once they get to Mars, they have no alternative but to be slaves to the Mars colony."

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 He then goes on to weave this story that - and this is why it's popping back up in conspiracy theory -

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 that these kids are being taken to Mars to be harvested for their Adrenochrome.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And then just to kind of be like, have their organs sold as well.

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Again, save your questions till the end.

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 So Alex Jones says, "Yeah, he doesn't actually say I've heard that story, but he has said I've heard that 90% of all NASA missions are secret."

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 "That we don't know what payloads are going up and things like that."

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Anyways, this is the story. So the reason why it's back into conspiracy theory, because it's tied into the whole Adrenochrome thing,

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 there's a couple big issues with this one.

206
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 First off, why would you send a child to Mars to harvest his organs?

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Because here's the thing. Then you got to send them back.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Unless there's a huge need for human organs on Mars, which there may be.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I don't know. I've never been there. Maybe you go there, immediately you land, your liver explodes,

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 and you're like, "Oh, does anyone have a spare liver?" And they're like, "Come this way, sir."

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 There's a creepy rocking chair in the corner you got to sit in.

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 You want to make sense to take someone on a 20-year journey just to harvest their organs and then be like,

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 "Oh, great, we got to send these back. Hope you don't die for 20 years.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 It's going to take a long time to get these lungs back to you."

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 The Adrenochrome thing we've discussed many times before.

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 But again, that wouldn't make any more sense either.

217
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It's like growing grapes in France versus growing grapes in Michigan. The grapes grow better in France.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Adrenochrome grows better in Mars. I don't know. But it wouldn't make any sense.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And then there's another big problem with this. Let's do a math question here.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's a very basic math question.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 If you can nap a kid on Earth, and then you fly him for 20 years and drop him off on a planet,

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 is he really a kid? Is he still a child at that point?

223
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You kidnap the 12-year-old kid, and then he's a 32-year-old man on the planet Mars,

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 and you're like, "Yes, I've waited all this time to torture a kid."

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And this big strapping dude comes running off the ship, starts beating you up.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 It doesn't make sense.

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Also, even by today's basic technology standards, it doesn't take 20 years to get to Mars.

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 It's like a six-month journey. What are they doing? Taking the scenic route?

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 They're like, "Duh-duh-duh-duh." Kids are like, "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 He's like, "I'm gonna pull over and harvest your Adrenochrome right now if you don't shut up."

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Kids are like, "Are we there yet?" They're just getting stronger.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 They're doing push-ups for 20 years. It doesn't make sense.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I mean, just that one sentence doesn't make sense.

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 But, I mean, none of it does. None of it does. But especially...

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Anyway, so that's kind of what we're dealing with here.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Now, the reason why this became mainstream news was that this was done on the Alex Jones show,

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 and there's a lot of crazy stuff said on a lot of conspiracy shows.

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 What triggered this was NASA actually responded to this.

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 NASA said, "No." That was their response. No.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 There's not a colony on Mars, and there's definitely no kids on Mars.

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And none of it's true. At a certain point, they're like,

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "We could go point-by-point disputing this, but I think we beat it on the first point.

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 There's no colony on Mars." So you had all of these mainstream websites cover it.

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Mainstream newspapers, space.com, all of this stuff covered it.

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And the reason why, and it's funny because on the conspiracy theory level,

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 you think, "Oh, they're all covering it because they're all part of the cover-up."

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 See? That's why they're making a huge push against it.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 The reason why they're all covering it because it generates links.

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 For 99% of the conspiracies out there, human greed is the motivating factor.

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And if this isn't a conspiracy theory, I mean, you could say all they're all pushing against it at the same time.

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It's because people were clicking on the links, because it's such a bizarre headline for the register to have shock.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 NASA denies secret child sex slave cannibal colony on Mars.

253
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I guess I left out the sex slave in the cannibal part, but people are going to click on that.

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 People are going to click on that. So you're going to have these claims put out there.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Now, I have another conspiracy for this whole thing.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I don't actually believe that there's a colony on Mars where this stuff is taking place,

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 but I have another conspiracy theory that you may actually say is a bit darker, because it's far more realistic.

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 The idea of a slave colony on Mars is actually fairly old.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I found an example that we're going to cover in a minute from the year 2015.

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But it was 2017 when it became mainstream news.

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Yeah, the Alex Jones guest, and then everyone started talking about the slave colony on Mars.

262
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 What's really fascinating about this is when I decided to look into this topic, I typed in "Mars slave,"

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 and I was going to type in "colony," and it auto-populated to "labor."

264
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Mars slave labor. I was like, "Oh, that's weird." Click on it.

265
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Now, it did bring up a bunch of articles about what we're talking about, but it also brought up another set of articles.

266
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 There's accusations made that the leading chocolate bar companies are, for lack of a better term, supporting slave labor.

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 They're not funneling money. They're not sitting there with a giant cigar being like, "Oh, yes, more slaves, please."

268
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But because of their industry, is cocoa, and 70% of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa,

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 which has a horrible track record when it comes to slavery.

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 There are people who believe that the chocolate companies are actually enabling, would probably be a better term for it than supporting,

271
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 but enabling the slave trade. The chocolate companies say, "Listen, we do our best.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 We try to buy as much as we can from farms. South America provides a lot of cocoa, and it doesn't have a slave labor problem."

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 They go, "We do our best to buy from reputable dealers."

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 However, so much of it is needed, and there's such a high demand for it, that we can't guarantee on any level that none of it comes from slaves.

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 There's a real chilling, right? So these chocolate companies are being dogged with these accusations,

276
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 and again, they will say, "We're trying to do our best," and people are trying to end it, say,

277
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 "Chocolate companies need to put on their labels this was made by slave labor.

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 They need to have a system in place so that people know that when you go to buy that bag of M&Ms,

279
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 or that whatchamacallit bar, or that Hershey's, whatever it is, that there will be a warning on it saying,

280
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "By buying this, you are supporting slave labor." I don't know if it's that blunt, but it would be something to that extent.

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 The chocolate companies have said, "We provide all that information on our website,

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 and if you want to find out, you can go, we do keep track in all of our progress that we're doing to work towards this, we keep it on our website."

283
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Just in June of this year, the chocolate companies won a lawsuit in Massachusetts, saying that because we put it on our website,

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 we don't have to put it on our packaging. This is an ongoing issue, but what I thought was really interesting was,

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 in May 2017, Mars, the chocolate company, released a detailed statement about how they are trying to eliminate the slave labor in their supply chain.

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And two months later, Mars and slave is no longer closely tied to a real-life tragedy.

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's tied to a wacky conspiracy theory. That's actually not a bad idea if you think about it.

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 If you have a company that is under investigation or has some rumors about it, or truth, or truth, right?

289
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 To find a way to hide your story within conspiracy theories. Because you can try to mess with the algorithm and the SEO and stuff like that,

290
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 but if you can actually create a viral story that you know will live on for years,

291
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 because conspiracy is very rarely dying unless there's a date assigned to them. They just keep going and going and going.

292
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 You can find a way to attach your real-life controversy into a conspiracy theory, and it goes viral.

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Anyone looking for the real-life issue will only find the conspiracy theory.

294
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I'm not saying that Mars company did this, but it would be a smart idea if they did.

295
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Think about it, you could have companies have conspiracy theorists on payrolls to the point that the conspiracy theorists may not even know they're working for this massive conglomerate.

296
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And they get delivered a document about Mars slave colonies.

297
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And they're reading it, and they're like, "Oh, this is great. I can't wait to spread this lunacy across the planet."

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And then there's a boardroom off in the distance. Just a boardroom. There's no building. It's just a table in the middle of nowhere.

299
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And a bunch of fat cat CEOs. Everyone at the table is a CEO. It's a weird company.

300
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And they're like, "Yes, that plan worked." Good thing I listened to Dead Rabbit Radio to hear that plan.

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Adam Dunn calling that carbonicopter. We're leaving behind this table in the middle of nowhere.

302
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 We're headed back to Mars. We left to do the Mars story, to do the story about the Mars Mars.

303
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 We're leaving behind Earth. Once again, we're taking that carbonicopter. It's been specially outfitted for outer space travel.

304
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 We're headed back to Mars.

305
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And it's a long journey, so I have a movie for us to watch. That movie is called "Spell."

306
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 This Halloween, prepare yourself for the terrifying suspense thriller, "Spell."

307
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Starring Omari Hardwick from the TV show "Power" and Loretta Devine.

308
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Marquis, played by Omari Hardwick, awakens from a plane crash,

309
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and prisoned by a mysterious woman practicing hoodoo magic.

310
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 He desperately tries to break free to save his family from the sinister rituals that await.

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "Spell" is premiering at home on all digital platforms October 30th, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 [imitates carpenters]

313
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Carbonicopter is clearing the void between the bright blue ball known as Earth

314
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 and the dusty magenta circle known as Mars.

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 [imitates carpenters]

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 We're landing back at an other Martian slave colony. It may be the same place. I don't know.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I don't know how many there are, but this is a different person.

318
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Because as we land here, this one doesn't have a spooky rocking chair.

319
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 This one doesn't have two little twins in the corner singing lullabies.

320
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 No. This one has...

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 [imitates carpenters]

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 ...doors open up, and majestically standing in front of us is Corey Good.

323
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Now, long time Dead Rabbit Radio listeners will recognize that name.

324
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 He was in episode 47, and Corey Good told the story about how the fighting men and women of the US military

325
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 would go to Antarctica and beat up reptiles and rescue kids.

326
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I can't... why are you kidnapping kids and taking them to Antarctica?

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I guess really the question is, why are you kidnapping kids?

328
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 It's not gonna be like, "Oh, you're only taking them across the street? That's fine."

329
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 The whole thing's bizarre, but it's even more weird that you would transport them for six months

330
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 across the ocean, or however long it is, two months.

331
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 It doesn't matter how many months. I don't know why. He's stuck on the details.

332
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Why are you kidnapping kids? Why are you taking them to Antarctica?

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 It's the same. They were eating them. The reptilians were eating them over there.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But he talked about that. We covered him in episode 47. He's back.

335
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Because little did you know, he's like, "Well, I have another story to make up."

336
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Everyone's like, "What? Oh, we are bored of the Antarctica story."

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 He's like, "I know, I know. I wasn't getting a bunch of hits on my website."

338
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So luckily, I just remembered, his eyes are shifting side to side,

339
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I just remembered I also go to Mars, and everyone's like,

340
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 "Oh, we want to pay attention to you again." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 My plan worked. As he's getting a free lifetime supply of Mars chocolate,

342
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 he's like, "Oh, both my plans worked." He went to Mars, guys.

343
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 So that's why we're on this base. We're meeting him there.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And there we're gonna meet Corey Good, Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez,

345
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 not his full name, never gives his full name. Also, just the Lieutenant Colonel.

346
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 It's a little unimpressive. I mean, maybe, I don't know, I would expect to see like a general or something.

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Like, I don't know, I'm not in the military, maybe Lieutenant Colonel's super high up in the ranks,

348
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 but like, if someone goes, "Hi, Jason, I'm Lieutenant Colonel."

349
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 I'll start rolling my eyes in the middle of the sentence.

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 No, I'm sure it's pretty high up there. Is it higher than a Colonel? Doesn't matter.

351
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I guess you're on Mars. You could be a private on Mars.

352
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 That would be impressive if it was real. But Corey Good, he did 20 years.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 There's always 20 years with these guys. He did 20 years in the secret space program Alliance.

354
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 One day, Corey Good, I don't know why I'm jumping to the end of the story,

355
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 one day Corey Good is sitting at home and this blue ball floats into his house.

356
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Just another afternoon for Corey Good, right?

357
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 He's checking his website. "Oh man, I'm not getting any hits."

358
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 "I probably should come up with another story." All of a sudden, blue ball.

359
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 He's like, "This is it! This will be the new thing I'm gonna sell."

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I mean tell. He jumps into the blue ball and the blue ball takes him to lunar operations command.

361
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 That's a base on the moon. That's where he meets Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales.

362
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And Corey Good's like, "Could I meet like a general or something?"

363
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is like, "No, I'm the highest ranking person in this story."

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 They then each team up with two intuitive empaths.

365
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 So there's these two dudes and then apparently two others.

366
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 So there's a total of six people. They're taking out, there'll be a math quiz.

367
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And they hang out with these intuitive empaths and they just are able to tell when people are angry.

368
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Here I'll give you a tip. It's when the alien's pointing a rifle at you.

369
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 You're like, "Oh, you probably could have told me that earlier, intuitive empath."

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 But so they leave behind the moon and they go to Mars and it takes them a 30 minutes.

371
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The article is very clear to state. They usually takes two or three minutes to get from the moon to Mars.

372
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 But this time it took them 30 minutes because Mars was on the other side of the sun this time.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Who cares? The story is made up to begin with.

374
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 I don't understand what... This is Exo News as well. I don't understand...

375
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 There's a whole paragraph explaining that. They're like, you know, "Normally this journey only takes..."

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Who cares? It's made up. It's made of... Don't tell me real life stuff.

377
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Because you're making up... Anyway, so apparently just if you ever need to travel to Mars from the moon

378
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and you're trying to figure out when you should eat lunch, if it's on the other side of the sun, it's going to take 30 minutes.

379
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 There you go. Now you know that. Like I said, it's going to be a math episode.

380
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 They go to Mars. They get to the base and they meet the base commander and he goes, "Hey guys, listen.

381
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Welcome from secret space, whatever name you made up. Welcome. Welcome to this Mars colony."

382
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Now I know there's been a lot of accusations of us having slaves here. That's not true.

383
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 That's misspelled actually. We have a bunch of slides here and they see all these kids going down in slides.

384
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Cory gets like, "Oh, that's kind of cool." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, it's a translation error."

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 We don't have slaves here. We do have a bunch of people here though.

386
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 We have a ton of humans here, but don't tell them you're from Earth.

387
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Cory goes like, "What? I'm human, right? Where else am I supposed to tell them I'm coming from?"

388
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Base commander goes, "As far as everyone on this base knows, Earth was destroyed in a massive calamity."

389
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 So don't tell them that's not true. They've been here for decades.

390
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 They're having families and their families are going to have families and so on and so forth.

391
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 This is a multi-generational base, but you can't tell them you're from Earth.

392
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So Cory, good listen man. This guy's done 20 years in the Solar Warden program.

393
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 There's over 900 alien species this man has knowledge of.

394
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 He's met some of these aliens face to, "Man, what are you talking about, dude?"

395
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 This guy's not going to say nothing.

396
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 So Cory, good, Lieutenant Gonzalez and their little group are walking around this base.

397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 They run into a group of people and within about three minutes, Cory, good, tells the dude he's from Texas

398
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 and a riot breaks out.

399
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Eventually, a subway shows up. Troops quell this riot and was like, "What? Texas is real? I thought that was destroyed.

400
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Oh man, I threw away all of my Texas stuff. I'm a big Texas fan, apparently.

401
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I'm the only one on Mars because no one else believes me."

402
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Riot breaks out because Cory, good, who has not won but two certificates you can view online

403
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 showing that he has certified classes in mass casualty events and the psychology of terrorism.

404
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 He can't earn those by attending some sort of seminar or taking a class. No.

405
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Well, probably, but he has those. How could he have accidentally told this guy he was from Texas?

406
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Come on, Cory. So what do you think is going to happen now?

407
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 He has broken the one rule he was given.

408
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 He's taken to base commander.

409
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Base commander's like, "Over here. Let's go to a PowerPoint presentation."

410
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 He shouldn't sew nothing to happen. It's Cory Good and his group go to a PowerPoint presentation

411
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 where they're showing about the 900 different intergalactic civilizations that humanity is currently interacting with

412
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 and how they are using alien tech to merge with human technology.

413
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Cory Good's sitting back. He's super bored. He pulls out a laser pointer.

414
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 He's like putting it on the screen. They're like, "Cory, that's a real laser."

415
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It's all, "Bzzz."

416
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 It's a hole through the wall. Everyone can't breathe.

417
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Anyways, this article that I'm getting off exonews.com, it's about a power graph telling us about this PowerPoint presentation.

418
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 It's about as interesting as a PowerPoint presentation.

419
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 The PowerPoint presentation doesn't become any more interesting if it's on Mars or not.

420
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 It's still a slideshow.

421
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 But then after the PowerPoint presentation, the base commander tells Cory and Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez,

422
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 "Guess what, guys? Look under your seat. Look under your seat."

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 They're like, "What? What's under my seat?"

424
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 There's a little piece of paper. There's a number on it.

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 They're like, "You guys just won your own family."

426
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 What? What is going on?

427
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Anyways, so they're told, actually, there's not an Oprah Prize.

428
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 You get a family and you get a family.

429
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 But they are told by the base commander, "You guys have now been assigned a family to take with you."

430
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 So anyways, they go and they find like this pod that has the same number as the piece of paper.

431
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Again, it's a made-up detail. I don't know why I'm repeating such a made-up detail.

432
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Anyways, they go to the pod and inside the pod is a man and his wife, their two kids,

433
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 boy and a girl, the teenagers, and the family has all their bags packed.

434
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez is looking at these people and then he goes,

435
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 "Where's the other member of your family? He's British now."

436
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And they go, "We don't know what you're talking about. It's only the four of us."

437
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez says, "That's not what my empath tells me."

438
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 He says that you are hiding a member of your family from us.

439
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 We want all of you.

440
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Now, I know you're thinking the same thing I'm thinking when I was reading the story.

441
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I thought, wait, I thought Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez was a good guy.

442
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Now he's like, "Oh, yeah. I know there's five of you. Where are you?"

443
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He's all sneaking around, getting all creepy.

444
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 I was like, "Dude, what? What are you doing?"

445
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And the family starts freaking out because apparently now telepathy exists in this world.

446
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 So again, that total stranger is asking for your hidden child that they start freaking out.

447
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Base Commander shows up and he's like, "What? Why are you harassing our slaves?

448
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I mean, our totally normal people who are petrified of all authority."

449
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And so he throws Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez and Corey Good and all the empaths in a jail cell,

450
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 despite the fact we have alien technology and the ability to exist on Mars,

451
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 you still have rooms with bars on them, right?

452
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Why don't you just shoot them, really? Because apparently they're already talking about Texas.

453
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 You're already talking about Texas. You're revealing all these secrets.

454
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 They throw them in a jail cell. There's like a key.

455
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 There's like a Don Knotts guy with a big ring, a key's on his key chain and a sleeping dog.

456
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Big old sleeping bulldog in the corner with a space helmet on.

457
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Corey Good says as he's being led into the jail as well,

458
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 he sees all these other cells and everyone looked really sad in them.

459
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 That's the same on Earth or Mars. I think that doesn't matter.

460
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 So apparently there are bars on these cells, or maybe little windows,

461
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 but still, like, why isn't a space cell? Why aren't they being thrown into the Phantom Zone or something like that?

462
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 So they're all trapped in this jail cell. They're on Mars.

463
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Lieutenant Colonel Gonzalez is like, "Oh, you know, we're in a lot of trouble now."

464
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 One, because my accent changed. And two, because the base commander is like a total totalitarian.

465
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 He's nuts. To be fair, if I was Corey Good, I would say this, to be fair,

466
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 you shouldn't have been so insistent on finding the fifth hidden member of the family.

467
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 "Ah, I just wanted to complete my collection. I didn't want to know there was one other one out there."

468
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 What? What are you talking about, Lieutenant Colonel?

469
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Interrupting Corey Good's sentence, a blue orb flies into the jail cell.

470
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 [Makes weird noise]

471
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Let me read you this actual quote.

472
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 "It wasn't a minute later that we saw our blue indigo orb friends,"

473
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 that's the best sentence ever, "our blue indigo orb friends zipping through the walls of the cell,

474
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 one for each of us. They danced around for a couple seconds,

475
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 and the other SSP personnel who had never traveled this way backed against the wall."

476
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 How big is this cell? It's as big as your imagination, because it's totally made up.

477
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 You have six people in a cell. Now you have six human-sized orbs in the cell, and they're dancing.

478
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 They're like, "Nee-er, they're doing a little break dance. They break out some holographic cardboard.

479
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 They're all spinning around." They're like, "Ah, that's why they're backing up against the wall."

480
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It's not because they're like, "What's this amazing technology?"

481
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 It's because they're doing B-Boy moves and stuff.

482
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Go Orbeez, go Orbeez, go, go, go Orbeez. They're having this dance party.

483
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Everyone else in the cells are just looking out at these B-Boy blue orbs are dancing.

484
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Everyone's clapping. Everyone in the cells clapping. All the other people are like, "I just want bread."

485
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 So Corey Goode and Team hop in their own individual blue orbs, and they fly to the moon.

486
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Just like Frank Sinatra predicted would happen in his great song, "Slave Colony on Mars."

487
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And then the article ends with saying, "Listen, guys, we know that there's a problem with slavery on Mars,

488
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 and the space company, whatever this group is called, the SSP, the secret space program,

489
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 will stop and nothing to defeat these slavers."

490
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Now, this article was written in the year 2015, and nothing's been done.

491
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 You had that article in 2017 about slaves on Mars.

492
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 So, yeah, sure, you may have a fleet of spaceships and all this stuff,

493
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 but if you can't rescue these dudes on Mars, you already know it's a problem.

494
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 You now know that they were slaves, not slides.

495
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 You now know that they're giving out families to people who show up to a PowerPoint presentation.

496
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 So what are you guys waiting for, huh?

497
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Shouldn't we already be freeing those people slaves on Mars?

498
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 The official explanation, the official imaginary explanation,

499
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 that the imaginary base commander gave to the imaginary lunar operations command,

500
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 that we do not have slaves.

501
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 This is just a social experiment, bro.

502
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 It's just a prank. It's just a prank.

503
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 We want to see what happens to people when you tell them their planet has been destroyed,

504
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and we take them to another planet.

505
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And Cory Good showed up. He almost brought the whole colony come crashing down

506
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 when he told a duty was from Texas.

507
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 So, shame on you, secret space program.

508
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 We are just trying to figure out what happens when you mentally torture people.

509
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 We're not slavers. We're mentally enslavers.

510
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Adding that word in front of it makes it less horrible.

511
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 My question is why, if this place exists, why aren't they doing anything about it?

512
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Why aren't their imaginary starfighters leaving right now to launch

513
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Make Believe Missiles to destroy buildings that exist nothing but in the realms of dreams?

514
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I don't know, but I do know this.

515
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 If you want to fight, you can buy a t-shirt.

516
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 This isn't an ad-read for one of my t-shirts.

517
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 No, no, no, no, no. I'm not that tacky. I'll do that in another episode.

518
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 When I was looking for more information about Cory Good and the reptilian resistance,

519
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 I found a shirt on Amazon that you can buy today

520
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 that will signal to the world you're on the right side against the Martian slave colonies.

521
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 This shirt is a picture of a gray alien head.

522
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Yeah, I know, it should be a reptilian head, but that's the least of the problems with this shirt.

523
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 It has a gray reptilian head, and across it it says, "Fight for glory. Pride and honor.

524
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Keep struggle for freedom fight."

525
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 I don't know, that's probably speaking alien speak.

526
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 That's because in case an alien sees it, they're like, "Oh, yes. Keep struggle for freedom fight.

527
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Totally understand. Yes, you're on the good guy's side."

528
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And then underneath it, it says, "The three greatest words any human can say,

529
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 'Protect the Earth.'"

530
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 I don't mean that in some environmentalist way.

531
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 No, I mean that in laser guns, spaceships, and two knives with brass knuckle hilts.

532
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Now, out of those three, that'd be the least effective weapon against aliens.

533
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 But those are the weapons that are chosen to be poorly photoshopped onto this shirt.

534
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 So if you ever want to take on an army of reptilian gray aliens,

535
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 if you want to keep struggle for freedom fight,

536
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 but all you're bringing into the fight is two brass knuckles with knives attached to them,

537
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 buy this shirt, protect the Earth, and remember,

538
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Earth First, Now, and Forever.
