1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 The world of UFO-ologists goes head to head with an army of 9 year olds.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:15,040
 And then we travel back to my own personal ghost hunting days. Did I really meet a civil war ghost?

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,400
 What happened when the dark shadow rushed towards my car?

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:29,600
 And more importantly, was I possessed the day I picked up a pair of burnt

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,240
 pants today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:43,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,560
 Carbner. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,160
 having a ton of fun coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. One of our livestream contributors.

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,960
 It's Spiced. Everyone give a round of applause to Spiced walking into Dead Rabbit Command. Spiced,

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
 you're going to be our captain or pilot of this episode. You guys can't support the show

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,200
 financially. I totally understand. Just spread the word about the show really, really helps out a

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,000
 lot. By the way, so I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed on out to Sweden.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,400
 So the reason why we're headed out to Sweden is we're going to meet a young entrepreneur.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,320
 That's how you pronounce it in Sweden. That I'm sure all of you guys are familiar with PewDiePie.

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,600
 PewDiePie, the number one solo YouTube channel, has millions and millions of followers. He's a

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,080
 gamer and he does a lot of reaction videos. Recently, I saw in the export that PewDiePie has

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,440
 decided to try his hand at debunking UFOs. This is a really exciting time for UFOologists because,

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,200
 well, technically it's always an exciting time for UFOologists because you can get abducted in

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,120
 any moment. It's always super exciting if you believe in aliens, but because that government

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,160
 report is coming out in July. There's a government report the US government is going to release

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,400
 saying basically stating all the information they know about UFOs and I imagine it's not going to be

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,520
 groundbreaking. It would be cool if it was right. It would be cool if it was like the first first

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,640
 page is a picture of Joe Biden and the Grey Alien like leaning back to back like the Twins movie

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,800
 poster. But is it going to? No. Are they going to reveal the existence of the Pleiadians or the

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
 Reptilians? Do they declare war on Great Britain against the Great Lizard Queen? No. We're already

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,840
 getting a little bit of leaks from the report and basically it's they're saying some of the stuff

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
 could be Russian, some of the stuff could be Chinese, some of the stuff we don't know. And that's

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
 pretty much what that report's going to say. It hasn't officially come out. There could be a change,

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,880
 but if we did have access to this alien technology or if we had access to the aliens themselves,

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,160
 a law written by US lawmakers isn't going to change anything. The Great Reptilian Congress of

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,360
 Mark R. 9 isn't going to be like, "Our plans have been stomped due to three senators! We must

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,880
 reveal our secrets." Now, you know, they would just bury it. If it was really close to the truth,

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,080
 these senators never would have been able to pass the bill in the first place. Like,

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,240
 it is fun that we're taking it this seriously. I think it's a huge step forward for UFOology,

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,280
 but I don't really suspect anything big is going to come out of the paper. Because UFOs are so in

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,200
 the news and because people are finally taking this subject seriously, and I do think it needs to

38
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,840
 be taken seriously, you're having other people who normally want to talk about UFOs talk about UFOs,

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,080
 and it's great because we're getting all these different voices. Inter-Puty Pie. He did a awesome

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,640
 dismissal. And this might not be what you guys want to hear and listen to with paranormal podcasts,

41
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,920
 but you gotta be open to everything. He did an awesome debunking of two huge UFO videos that,

42
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
 the most recent one that came out of thing in 20, off the top of my head, I think it was 2019,

43
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,240
 that's been going around online. And then he debunked the Tic Tac video. The very famous Tic Tac

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,480
 video shot over, I think it was the Pacific Ocean, and they had that battle fleet. Usually,

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,600
 like Tic Tac video right now has been used the most. Like they're like, "How can you dispute this?

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,560
 Like this is recorded with military technology and all these pilots." And everyone can have their

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,160
 opinion. But PewDiePie did a great, it was, it's super interesting because he seems to be along

48
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,280
 the lines like, "Yeah, aliens would be cool and everything like that, but you have to,

49
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,480
 I don't think these videos are real. I do not think these videos are real." And using like his

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,800
 flashlight on his cell phone camera, and he, he's looking at this stuff and he goes, "This is how

51
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
 this doesn't make sense. This doesn't work." And not saying it doesn't make sense by like,

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
 how fast it's going and stuff like that. Like there's no way a vehicle could go 10 Gs. No, no,

53
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,040
 no. He's saying like, "The way the camera is working, that isn't what they think it is."

54
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,360
 He goes, "It is weird. It is weird." He goes, "The camera's picking up something, but it's not

55
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,520
 doing the things that the UFO community thinks that it's doing. It didn't go under water. It

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
 simply stopped giving off heat." He doesn't go on it. He doesn't go, "Oh, it must just be a flock

57
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
 of birds or it must be a hot air balloon." He doesn't give an alternative solution, which is totally

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,280
 fine. So when you debunk something, you don't necessarily have to prove what it is. You can

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,960
 just go, "It's not what they're saying it is. I don't know what it is. It's something weird."

60
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,520
 I recommend watching the video. I'm going to put it into the show notes. It's like 15 minutes long.

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,160
 It's not too long. And at one point that I thought PewDiePie made, which was really interesting,

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,400
 was he goes, "A new video comes out and it's easily debunked." And then someone goes, "Well,

63
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,320
 what about these other 10 sightings? What about these other 20 sightings? What about all these

64
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,480
 other videos?" And he goes, "Yeah, but those were fake too, but those were fake so long ago."

65
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,200
 People debunked them back then, but the debunking story doesn't stick around. I'm paraphrasing,

66
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,240
 but the video sticks around. And people keep watching stuff and they keep looking at fake

67
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,560
 video footage. Stuff that is not necessarily faked on purpose, but stuff that's easily explained.

68
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,120
 And you start to have this huge catalog of footage that is taken out of context,

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,560
 and this is your worldwide phenomenon. Now, does it explain every single UFO sighting? No.

70
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,400
 Does it explain ones where the aliens actually come down? No. But when we talk about stuff like

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,840
 the Tic Tac video, there are explanations for what that could be. So I find it really,

72
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,680
 really fascinating that that is also going mainstream. I don't think PewDiePie is some sort

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,840
 of CIA asset, and he's trying to be the lone voice. It's really interesting because I think it goes

74
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,920
 counter to what his audience would want anyways. If you put out pro UFO content, you will have

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,040
 way more hits than you'll have if you put out anti UFO content. And because I'm not a total party

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,720
 pooper, also in the show notes, I have someone who has made a YouTube channel that has 500

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,520
 videos of UFOs. I mean, I just was like, "Oh, they're probably all fake." Still, if you want to go

78
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,160
 through like vintage UFO videos, some of them are short, some of them are a bit longer. A guy

79
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,920
 named Alexander Gottfriedsson. I wonder if he's sweetest too, not even looking at his name. He

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:15,120
 put together five, he collected 500 videos of UFOs. So that's cool too. You can fish around on that.

81
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,600
 Spiced. I'm going to toss you the keys of the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Sweden

82
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,760
 with these brand new chairs, these brand new PewDiePie chairs. We are headed out to Dyer Lane,

83
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:34,480
 California. First off, I want to give a shout out to three long time Dead Rabbit radio listeners,

84
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:41,280
 Lancaster, Barfiman362 and Chris K. Because they all recommended, I talk about the burnt pants,

85
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,440
 and I know they're all looking at each other right now. They're like, "What?" Yes. Over the course

86
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,840
 of about two years, you three reached out to me and said, "Tell the story about the burnt pants."

87
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,480
 I had mentioned it on a past episode. I recorded an entire segment about the burnt pants, and I

88
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,520
 remember recording it, and I remember just thinking in my head, "This isn't... I'm not doing the story

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,320
 justice. I'm not doing the story justice. I don't like the way I was telling it." And I mentioned it.

90
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,200
 I think the episode came out late or something like that. Like it was a huge... I recorded like a 30,

91
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,040
 40 minute segment. It's a long story. I'm going to try to keep it short in this time as you'll

92
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,480
 get your watch. Like great. And I said I recorded it, but I didn't release it. And those three people

93
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,640
 over time were like, "Dude, we really want to hear the burnt pants story." So here you go, because

94
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,240
 yesterday's Patreon was Steve Dainwood, close personal friend of mine. And I told him, I was like,

95
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,120
 "Hey dude, I didn't know you listened to the show, and I go, I've mentioned you a couple times on the

96
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,040
 show." And he's like, "Really?" And he goes, "Did you tell the story about the burnt pants?" And I was like,

97
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,880
 "Now I have to." Like that one, we've had so many adventures together. And when I said I told a couple

98
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,400
 stories about us, and that was the first thing, did you tell him the story about the burnt pants?

99
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,520
 So I got to tell you the stories about the burnt pants. So thanks Steve for this saga.

100
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,760
 Spiced, go ahead and land this carbon helicopter at Dyer Lane. Dyer Lane, if you look at it,

101
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,160
 it's actually in the Urban Dictionary online. You can find a couple of rumors about it online,

102
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,080
 but living in this area, everyone knew about Dyer Lane. It's a rural road.

103
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,880
 Scooby-Doo didn't come into the studio. You know, like a country road. In Sacramento, in the

104
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,280
 suburb, subdivision, no one is Alberta, kind of near Antelope Sacramento.

105
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:29,120
 There is a road off of what avenue called Dyer Lane. And I always called it Dyer's Lane,

106
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
 so I'll probably move back and forth between the two pronunciations, the correct one and then mine.

107
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,520
 But Dyer Lane was this old country road. Incredibly dangerous. I remember because I grew up in

108
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,600
 Citrus Heights. I actually grew up all over California, but I found my way back to Citrus

109
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,240
 Heights when I was 17, 16, 17 years old. Citrus Heights, Orangevale is where I hung out. Antelope

110
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,920
 is basically the other side of the planet, because it's farther away. It's not right next to me.

111
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,560
 And that's where my boy Josh hung out. We had Josh and Nick and Jason Campbell,

112
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,640
 and you know, like Liz and Cara and all that stuff, Jackie, Joanne, all of them. They all went to

113
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,280
 like Center High. They were all in that area. I was in Cassarobal in Orangevale. So this is

114
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,680
 far about, there's like high school days for me. So we're talking like 1994. So Dyer Lane

115
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,520
 is this road right off of what? Now, what is one of the most traveled roads in Sacramento? Don't

116
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,000
 look that up. There's no stat for it. It just felt like it when you were driving down it. But you

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,520
 kept going, I think it was North on or even West or East. Just look it up. Just look, don't follow

118
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,520
 my directions. But if you keep going down, what eventually becomes less and less populated,

119
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,920
 you drive past the Godfather's Pizza. We've talked about that in past episodes. And we get to Dyer

120
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,040
 Lane. You make a left. I don't remember that. You make, well, I guess it depends on your direction

121
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
 you're going to. Otherwise you're crashed. Just look it up. But anyways, you turn onto Dyer Lane,

122
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,480
 it feels like you're turning into another part of the world. It's bizarre. I mean, almost like all

123
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,880
 the traffic sounds disappear. You are driving down this country road. There's just trees and

124
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,720
 broken down houses. Now, some of these stories I'm going to tell you I may have already told. The

125
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,960
 burnt pants I haven't, but I want to give a little more flavor. And I don't know what episodes to

126
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,560
 link to because these personal stories are hard to keep track of. But when I worked at Godfather's

127
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,160
 Pizza, I had to deliver a pizza to Dyer Lane. And everyone kind of laughed. Everyone kind of laughed.

128
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,720
 And they're like, "Ha ha ha, you're going to die." I met Godfather's Pizza. I'm working with my boy

129
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,080
 Josh, my boy Nick. Jason Campbell works there. Jason Anderson. It was a really good group of guys.

130
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,640
 They all went to center high school. I went to Casa Robles, much cooler high school. They went to

131
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,880
 some bust it all night school. We're working at Godfather's Pizza. So they knew all the legends.

132
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,200
 They knew about Dyer Lane and these dudes because I was from the other side of Sacramento. Like,

133
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,000
 Orangevale was about as far away from Antelope as you could get. And they all knew the stories

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,920
 about Dyer Lane. And so I'm like this new delivery guy and I'm like, "Oh boy, my first delivery.

135
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,520
 My first delivery actually almost got mugged in Rialinda." But I still kept working there. I was

136
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,040
 like, "Oh, I got a delivery to Dyer Lane." And they're like, "Oh man." Now at this point I had already

137
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,480
 heard some of the stories about Dyer's Lane because people know I'm a ghost nerd. So whenever I'm like

138
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,760
 "We're sure this is I love ghosts." I have a tattoo that says, "I love ghosts even more than my shirt

139
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,240
 would suggest." And so people would always share ghost stories with me or like stuff that would

140
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,080
 spook me out. And I'm like hiding under their blankets. They're like, "Jason, go home please."

141
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,040
 But you told me a scary story. They all told me about Dyer Lane and there's different versions

142
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,360
 of this legend. One, and some of this stuff may be true. One of this part probably true.

143
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,680
 Back in the 1930s apparently it was a meeting ground for the Ku Klux Klan. Because it is in the

144
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,840
 middle of nowhere but it's super, super easy access. The second you turn on to Dyer Lane,

145
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,480
 you can get away with anything. So what it'd be, and it's a lot of fields, at least back when I was

146
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,160
 there, is just a lot of fields and the road goes straight for a while. Like Jason Mose wrote.

147
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,120
 Let's do that. Go straight for a while. There's a 90 degree turn. There's no lights out there.

148
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,040
 Then it goes straight again for quite a while. Then a 90 degree turn. Then it keeps going straight

149
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,240
 and then 90 degree turn. And then you're back into civilization. There were a few houses here and there

150
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,080
 but it felt wrong. It did feel different. Now some of that obviously suggestible. I mean the

151
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,800
 Ku Klux Klan, if they were hanging out there, it's not the most lively of spots. I actually don't

152
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,880
 know if they were ever there but actually that does lead me to another story. I remember once

153
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,520
 this dude was harassing my boy Nick and he was trying to fight Nick and I'm washing my car. I'm

154
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,800
 just trying to wash my car and I hear Nick inside. This is Josh's house. He's yelling on the phone

155
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,400
 and I'm like, "What is going on?" So I walk in there. I'm like, "Hey Josh, what's going on?"

156
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,320
 And Nick said, "Guys, someone wants to beat Nick up because he was sleeping with his girlfriend

157
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,560
 or something like that." And I was like, "Dude, give me the phone. Give me the phone." I take the phone

158
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,040
 and I just go, "Dyre's Lane, 3 AM." And the dude's like, "What?" I go, "Dyre's Lane." I go, "You got a problem.

159
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,600
 Like this, we're talking all day long. Like this is petty. Like let's settle it. Dyre's Lane,

160
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,680
 3 AM. Let's go. I'll go out there with Nick." And then the dude's like, "I am not into that

161
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,720
 clan stuff." I go, "Me neither, dude, but we can do what we need to do out there. No cops

162
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,680
 gonna show up. It's just going to be us and you. Who you want to bring? We're gonna bring who we bring.

163
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,400
 Dyre's Lane, 3 AM." And I just hung the phone up and I go, "Can I finish washing my car and

164
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 beats now?" And sure enough, we had a party that night. We were supposed to have a party that night.

165
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,000
 We did. And at about 2, 15 AM, we drove out there and sat out in Dyre's Lane,

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,520
 waiting for these dudes to show up. They never showed up. But that was the reputation that

167
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,840
 place had that was a clan meeting area. So in the 1930s, was there a clan meeting there?

168
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,640
 Probably. It was Sacramento in the 1930s. The clan meetings of the Capitol building.

169
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,600
 But that stayed. And then there were stories of like serial killers in the area that you could

170
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,240
 find etchings of bodies on the ground, stuff like that. My per... I had a lot of stories

171
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,480
 involving Dyre Lane. One of my personal stories was, I was a pizza delivery driver for Godfather's.

172
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,000
 I was trying to remember where I left off. Pizza delivery driver got a delivery to Dyre Lane.

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,440
 I mentioned this before on the podcast. Pull up to this house. And the house wasn't like old

174
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,800
 Texas Chainsaw Massacre house. It wasn't falling down. It wasn't a bunch of garbage.

175
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,000
 It wasn't... It wasn't a great house either. Somewhere in between, if I remember correctly.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,160
 And there's this young kid coming out. I'm trying to remember the exact wording that happened. But

177
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,320
 this young kid comes out to buy the pizza. And I remember we were just chit-chatting. I think

178
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,200
 we were talking about like how nice the weather had been. Or I don't remember what the context was.

179
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,160
 Because everything else gets drowned out by his response, right? I remember I'm talking to him.

180
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000
 And the guy agrees with me. Everything is going nice. And he goes, "Yeah,

181
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,440
 Satan's been good to us this year." He hands me the money, takes his pizza and leave.

182
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,040
 And I remember just standing there. And realizing I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'm on Dyre Lane.

183
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,760
 I'm in the students' front yard. It's just a weird comment to make. And he didn't say it with a

184
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,840
 chuckle. He didn't say it because, "Oh, I know the legend students son. I was just joshing." Yeah.

185
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,520
 Just a weird comment. Actually, it might have been the only time I ever delivered a pizza to

186
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 Dyre Lane as well. I keep saying like it's isolated. There were houses there. But there

187
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,360
 are those houses that were farther back off the road. So you could drive down Dyre Lane and not

188
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,960
 really see them. Dyre Lane is also where I had a car. I had a Renault station wagon that was

189
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,800
 all-wheel drive, which I thought meant four-wheel drive. This is a true story. So I took it off

190
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,160
 roading. I took my station wagon off roading. A round-dyres lane almost drove into a creek.

191
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,800
 The real-life whore, the real-life whore of the Ku Klux Klan, we never had any proof of that. But

192
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,000
 then you have the rumors of the serial killers and then the ghost stuff as well. People said that

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,240
 you could see specters on the side of the road. People said you could see specters hanging from

194
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,160
 the trees. Again, hearkening back to that Ku Klux Klan history. I had been down Dyre Lane a lot

195
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,960
 day and night and we never saw anything specter-wise. But I actually spent a lot of time there because

196
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,840
 that was the most haunted place that I had. The most verifiably, quote-unquote, verifiably haunted

197
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:15,360
 place. There were legends going back decades that I had easy access to. Now, ghost, maybe.

198
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:24,080
 Ku Klux Klan, most definitely in the past. Drug spot? 100%. Like when I threatened that dude,

199
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,040
 the fight thing. You could fight all day long out. You could be doing like a three-day-long

200
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,480
 marathon boxing match. No one's gonna find you. It's a perfect place to set up. Perfect place

201
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,240
 to do deals. I remember once myself, who was in the passenger suit, might have been my boy, how,

202
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,320
 me, how, and Jackie was in the back seat. We were driving down Dyre Lane in the middle of the night

203
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,840
 and I had a machete in my back seat. We're driving down. We're all alone. We take that first 90 degree

204
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,760
 turn and then there's another car coming towards us. Which was weird enough because no one was ever

205
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,000
 on that road. But you think probably just another group of ghost hunters, right? And this other car

206
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,760
 is, it actually doesn't have its headlights on at this time. Which was what made me think this was

207
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,400
 like a drug meat, right? So I'm coming down the road and we're driving pretty slow because that

208
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,080
 first 90 degree turn is super tight. Take that 90 degree turn driving slow. We see another car

209
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,000
 sitting in the darkness slowly rolling towards us. No headlights on. And then the headlights kick on.

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,520
 It's a Sacramento Sheriff's car. And I just am staring straight ahead. And I tell Jackie,

211
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,600
 I go, "Hey, cover up that machete in the back seat." Because here's the thing. I don't know how

212
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,360
 the law is everywhere. First off, you shouldn't have a machete in your car. But secondly,

213
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,480
 when a police officer looks in your car, what they see can be used against you. Obviously,

214
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
 right? You have a bunch of like dead bodies back there. They're gonna arrest you for murder. But

215
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,520
 if they don't see it, they have to get a warrant for it. So if they see a locked box down there

216
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
 and they suspect it has drugs, they're gonna have to get a warrant. That's why they'll bring out the

217
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,480
 drug sniffing dog and the dog smells on it. Then they can have probable cause to open the box. But

218
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,360
 if they're just looking back there, they don't have probable cause to just open your car. Now,

219
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,080
 also according to law, police officers aren't able to drive around without their headlights on.

220
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,520
 You can't do that. Super, super dangerous. Even when a cop is waiting to check for speeders when

221
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,920
 they're at like a parking lot or kind of, they have to have the parking lights on the little

222
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,160
 yellow lights so you're not in danger. They're supposed to. And especially in the middle of,

223
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,640
 what was this guy doing? Was he setting up a speed trap? I think the dude was making a drug drop.

224
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,200
 That dude was doing something dirty because he's out there waiting for someone and he thought that

225
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,800
 was us. And we just both drive by each other. I'm just looking straight ahead. I don't even look at

226
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,680
 him. I don't want to know what you look like. We're just driving super slow. We drive past each

227
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,200
 other. Now, see, he can't pull us over because all of a sudden now he has to fill out a police

228
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,320
 report. He has to run the plates. He has to say he's out there. And I don't want to get pulled

229
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,120
 over on Dyer Lane from some cop that's sitting there with all of his lights off. Not his parking

230
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,800
 lights, nothing. His car was a ghost. So we just keep driving. We do the normal drive. The second

231
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,960
 I hit that other 90 degree turn, dude, I'm flying down the road. I want to get off Dyer Lane as

232
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,240
 quick as possible. And then when we get back to civilization, I turn around and Jackie covered

233
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,560
 up the machete to the handle. So now instead of the machete, I go, Jackie, let me explain something

234
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,400
 to you. The reason why I wanted you to cover that up so the police officer wouldn't know I had a

235
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,840
 machete now. Not only do I clearly have a machete, you see the handle sticking out from underneath

236
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,000
 this towel. It looks like you're trying to hide it. Like that's worse. If you're not trying to hide

237
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,440
 the machete, you can just go, that's farm equipment. I didn't even think I would hide it

238
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
 anymore than I would think to hide a hoe or a rake. Anyways, that's a little tip to you guys who

239
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,720
 carry machetes in your car. Dyer Lane was full of a bunch of weird stuff. Manmade stuff, like drug

240
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,240
 drops, and then ghost stuff and legends and things like that. So where did the burnt pants factor

241
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,280
 into all of this? I didn't go to center high school. I didn't hang out with Josh and Jason and Nick

242
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,000
 and all them stuff back in the day. I went to Casa Roblo across town and that's where I hung out

243
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,120
 with my boy Steve Daymwood and my boy Mauricio. We'd go ghost hunting on our adventures that one

244
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,600
 time we saw a Civil War ghost. I told the story previously on the episode I'll do a quick recap.

245
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,200
 Me, Steve Mauricio, were driving out off PFE, which was oddly close to Dyer Lane. We didn't know

246
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,120
 Dyer Lane existed at this time. We saw a Civil War ghost. We saw an old man dressed in all gray

247
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,120
 clothing walking by the side of the road. We drove by and were screaming, "Ah, ah, it was a full body

248
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,640
 apparition. You know how rare these things are?" We turned around. We couldn't believe our eyes. We

249
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,000
 drove past it again. It's like three in the morning. We're screaming, "Ah, ah, it's ghosts, ghosts!"

250
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,960
 Turned around one more time. We drove even slower. And that's when we realized we were driving next

251
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,440
 to an industrial park. He was an elderly security guard dressed up in a gray security guard uniform.

252
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,960
 Who we thought was a Southern or who we thought was a member of the Confederacy,

253
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,720
 who somehow died in California, even though there was no Confederacy there. And he was haunting this

254
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,960
 place. He was actually an elderly man who was probably getting more and more terrified because

255
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,960
 we kept driving by and screaming and pointing at him. It was also with Steve Mauricio and my brother.

256
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,480
 We were driving through Folsom one day. I believe I told this story as well, but I'll cover it again.

257
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,600
 We were driving through Folsom after a long night of ghosts. Steve was one of the guys that was

258
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,240
 there the night they... I almost got in a fight with a bunch of kids. And then I went around the

259
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,440
 corner to go pee because nothing makes you want to urinate. Like after having to shut down a bunch

260
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,280
 of dorks and they thought I was getting attacked. They heard my voice playing as they screaming

261
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,880
 for help. They came around the corner because it was outdoors. They were just peeing against

262
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,760
 someone's business. They came around the corner and I was like, "Yo, bro, what's going on? I turn

263
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,720
 on pee and all over them." They go, "We thought you were getting attacked." And this was in a known

264
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,560
 haunted spot as well. So this was something that imitated my voice. Steve was there. I'll put that

265
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,200
 in the show notes. That happened. There was a time in Folsom. We were driving through an old,

266
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,840
 reportedly haunted cemetery in Folsom. You never mess around in Folsom. The Folsom police officers

267
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,480
 pull you over if you're light blinked out of rhythm. The Folsom police department, I never

268
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,960
 messed around in Folsom. I never messed around in Roseville because their police were just

269
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,320
 on point. I just was like, "No, I'm good. Too many machetes in my car to get pulled over."

270
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
 Never messed around. But anyways, we were driving around Folsom and there was this old cemetery and

271
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,440
 we drove by it real slowly. And I remember this. I remember this distinctly. I think my brother was

272
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,280
 in the front seat trying to remember the layout and sitting behind him was Mauricio. And both of

273
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,480
 them don't really believe in ghosts. My brother doesn't believe in ghosts at all. And then behind

274
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,320
 me was Steve. And it's so interesting because I'm looking and I see a shadowy figure standing in the

275
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,880
 graveyard. It's really early in the morning. It's like 4 a.m. We've had a whole night of ghosts

276
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,680
 standing. See this shadowy figure, this blob kind of standing in the graveyard. Trick of the light?

277
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,960
 Absolutely. Could it be my mind's playing trick on me? I'm up at 4 a.m. Up. It's 4 a.m. Who knows?

278
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,680
 But I'm looking at it and I remember Steve. He was also going, "Yeah, I can kind of see something

279
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,360
 out there." And then it rushed. It just like did this weird thing where it's kind of standing in

280
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,360
 the graveyard. And then in a super fast motion, it ran as fast as it could. It didn't run. It just

281
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,680
 moved as fast as it could to the old wrought iron gate that's surrounding this graveyard.

282
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,480
 And it hits the gate and then just dissipates. Trick of the light? Bird. Giant bird. Those

283
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,160
 giant birds that love to dissipate. It could have been imagination. Again, it's 4 a.m. The reason why

284
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,320
 that was so fascinating to me is both my brother and Mauricio couldn't see anything. They're like,

285
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,880
 "I don't know what you're looking at." And when that thing ran and hit the fence, I didn't say,

286
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,600
 because it happened so quickly. I wasn't like, "It's coming. Oh no, one, two." I wasn't saying it

287
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,960
 happened so quickly. It moved. When that thing hit the fence, both my brother and Mauricio flinched.

288
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,120
 They didn't see it. They don't know why they did it. I'm looking at them because I'm in the driver's

289
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,280
 seat and they're closer to the fence than I am. See? I guess I left that little detail out.

290
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,760
 The way we're parked, the way we're sitting there is the passenger side is where the fence is. And

291
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,880
 when that thing hits the fence, they both flinch. I saw their reaction to it. And we started driving

292
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
 away and I go, "Dude, did you see that?" And Steve's like, "Oh dude, that was nuts." And they were like,

293
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,240
 "Oh, I didn't see anything. I go, 'Why'd you guys flinch?'" And they had no reason to. We didn't

294
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,640
 scream or anything. It happened so fast, even though they didn't register it, even though they

295
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,840
 couldn't see it, their body reacted to it. Creepy stuff. I'll put that episode on the show notes

296
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,600
 about the thing imitating my voice. It's a really, really terrifying encounter as well. But let's get

297
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,960
 to the roasted meat of the matter. Let's get to the burnt pants. Like I said, I used to go to

298
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,960
 Diarlane a lot with myself and with other people. Sometimes we take two or three car loads down.

299
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,960
 Sometimes it just beat me. I remember one day I was out there and I went to that first 90 degree

300
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
 turn and I got out of the car and I was kind of looking around for whatever, who knows, right?

301
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,240
 Found a pair of burnt pants.

302
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:44,800
 I found a pair of burnt jeans. They were the jeans of a probably a young woman.

303
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,600
 Took them to a forensic lab. I need DNA on these pants, please. They're like, "Sir, how did you get

304
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,760
 in here?" If I remember correctly, they were the pants of a young woman. They weren't like a little

305
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,800
 kid's pants. They weren't like my husky pants from Walmart. They're like tight jeans. They were burned.

306
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,000
 Severely burned. They were tattered and burned. You could tell that these things were in a fire.

307
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,040
 And I remember the day. I remember the day. Like I remember how the sun was in the sky.

308
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,720
 It was one of those days when the sun was in the sky. Just everything was crisp

309
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,920
 clouds in the sky. I remember it. I remember kind of digging and I found these burnt pants. Now,

310
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 there was other garbage around. People would throw out recliners and stuff like that. It wasn't

311
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,960
 unheard of to find garbage. There's a lot of signs up saying don't litter and those signs were riddled

312
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,360
 with bullets. I picked up these burnt pants and I go, "This is something. I don't know what it is yet,

313
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,440
 but these burnt pants, this is something. A clue? Am I possibly going to solve a murder?

314
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,640
 Is there a poor woman walking around with a burnt shirt and burnt socks that she can't find her

315
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,000
 burnt pants?" I don't know. But I took these burnt pants and threw them in my car. I'm driving around

316
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,520
 town with my burnt pants. And I would tell people, "Guys, you won't believe what I found on Dyer Lane."

317
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:11,200
 They're like, "What?" "Hold up. Hold up a pair of burnt women's pants. Jeans." And they're like,

318
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,560
 "What? Why do you have burnt jeans on you?" And I was like, "Cause dude, this is weird, man.

319
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,360
 Like when's the last time you ever saw burnt clothes?" They're like, "Never, because I'm not a caveman."

320
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,320
 And I don't dig around and other people's trash. I go, "But yeah, dude, like what if some woman was

321
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,080
 murdered and they were like burning the pants to get rid of the evidence?" And then you have evidence

322
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,880
 of a murderer that's not... It doesn't matter. Just get rid of them. I wouldn't. These burnt pants,

323
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:48,240
 there's something about these burnt pants. It's a mystery. I was also like playing video games

324
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
 and getting drunk and stuff like that. The burnt pants are sitting there. I was like, "Don't worry,

325
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,480
 I'll solve your crime after this second doobie." But I don't actually think I was smoking weed back

326
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,800
 then. I'm trying to make this story even more bizarre. The point is, is like even if I was trying

327
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,680
 to solve this murder, I took my time doing it. But I always had these burnt pants in my car. Now,

328
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,520
 at the same time, I was still ghost hunting with my buddies. At this time, I had had a side job.

329
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,000
 And this goes into the episode about the thing imitating my voice. I had a side job where I

330
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,720
 installed signs on the side of the road for housing developments. And every Friday, I had to put the

331
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,240
 signs up. And every Saturday evening, I had to take the signs back down. So I had a bunch of tools

332
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,840
 in there. So I had this sledgehammer. I had these pointy things of wood, these stakes of wood,

333
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,960
 lots of twine and duct tape. And that's just for my job. That was just for my job. And then I also

334
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,000
 had my personal machete. I had like a boat ore in my trunk for beating things up for fighting

335
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,960
 swamp thing when I'm in a boat. I had my machete. I had a bunch of knives and stuff like that. My car

336
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,800
 was not, was not the most inviting thing to ride in. But somehow people were always getting in my

337
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:05,520
 car. And it was a vehicle built for war and putting signs up. I had these burnt pants. Drive around

338
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,360
 with these burnt pants all the time. And I go on ghost hunting adventures. And I wanted more people

339
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,240
 to come to Dyer's Lane with me. I wanted to solve the mystery of the burnt pants, dude. Hey Steve,

340
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,680
 dude, what are you guys doing this weekend? Maricio, hey, let's go to Dyer Lane, dude. Let's solve the

341
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:29,440
 mystery of the burnt pants once and for all. I don't know. I don't know. Jason, maybe not. Okay, fine.

342
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,600
 Go to a party. Hey Steve, what's going on man? Hey, long time, long time no burn. Long time no

343
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,920
 burn. You ready to go out to Dyer Lane and solve the mystery of the burnt pants? Oh no, dude, it's

344
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,320
 I got like finals. I'm not going to school anymore. We graduated. Yeah, but I finally have decided I

345
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,560
 don't want to go to Dyer Lane. Aw man, you're such a kidder. I'll call you next week.

346
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,400
 Hey dude, what's going on? What's going on? Let me guess, you want to go to Dyer Lane? Yeah,

347
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:04,640
 dude, let's go to Dyer Lane, man. Let's hang out. Just you mean Maricio. Let's hang out at Dyer Lane

348
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:13,520
 and we'll solve this mystery of the burnt pants once and for all. Now apparently, Steve and Maricio

349
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:21,440
 were worried about me. And more importantly, more importantly, they were worried about themselves.

350
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,120
 Apparently it was acting really weird. I didn't know. I don't know. I thought it was acting just

351
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,520
 fine. One day, Steve, I was so insistent on Steve and Maricio coming out to Dyer's Lane

352
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:41,760
 to investigate the burnt pants. I did not know this until years later. I laughed so hard when

353
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,160
 I heard this story. Steve goes, "Remember that time you kept trying us to get us to go out and

354
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:52,880
 investigate burnt pants with you?" I was like, "Yeah, totally. Aw." And I pulled out my sketchbook of

355
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,520
 all the drawings of the pants I drew. I look at my scrapbook of all my photos. I go, "Yeah, yeah,

356
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,760
 the burnt pants. Yeah, I don't know what happened to those." And Steve basically has sigh of relief.

357
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,120
 He goes, "You were so insistent on us coming out there that at one point, Steve called up Maricio

358
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,880
 and said, 'Hey, did Jason call you about going out to investigate the burnt pants?' And Maricio

359
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,480
 was like, 'Yeah.' And then there was kind of like a bit of dead air." And Steve goes, "I think Jason's

360
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,480
 going to try to murder us." And Maricio basically goes, "I thought I was the only one who thought that.

361
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,080
 I thought Jason has been trying to murder us. I thought Jason is trying to get us out there.

362
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,520
 It's a murderous for a while. I thought it was just me." And Steve's like, "No, I'm pretty sure Jason

363
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,240
 is going to murder us if we go out to Dyer's Lane with him." So they started having this conversation

364
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,920
 behind my back. Whenever I would call up and be like, "Hey, when are we going to Dyer's Lane?"

365
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,680
 Because these are my ghost hunting bros, dude. When are we going to solve this mission? Oh man,

366
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,840
 maybe next week. They thought I was trying to set up their execution. I was going to bring them both

367
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,640
 a pair of pants. I'm like, "I got us all a pair of pants." They're like, "Jason, you're just wearing

368
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,440
 your normal pants. Why did you buy us women's skinny jeans? Just put them on." They thought I

369
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,880
 was going to murder them on Dyer Lane. Steve goes, "Listen, dude, you got so weird for a while.

370
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,800
 Like, we started to think that those pants might have possessed you." And I'm laughing.

371
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,000
 Saying that he feared for his life. I was laughing so hard. It's like, you really thought it's going

372
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,640
 to murder. Yes, both of us thought you were going to murder us over these pants. You wanted to take

373
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,680
 us out there. Maybe the pants had possessed you or something like that, but they go, "Dude, you're

374
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:45,600
 acting so weird. You're acting so spooky." And then I go, "You guys really thought that, right?"

375
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,720
 And they're like, "Yeah, yeah. We really thought you were going to murder us." And then I go,

376
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:57,680
 "But Steve, you guys did eventually go out there with me. Eventually, Stephen Mauricio got in my car

377
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,480
 and let me drive him out to Dyer's Lane to investigate the burnt pants. I go, "If you thought I was

378
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,400
 going to murder you, why did you get in my car and drive out there?" And he goes, "Because we thought

379
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,000
 you were going to murder us anyways. We thought if we didn't go, you would definitely murder us."

380
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,440
 And he said he got in that car with Mauricio and the entire time they were terrified. They thought

381
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,800
 I was going to murder them in the middle of the night on Dyer Lane. Now, I have no idea

382
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,200
 what they're thinking about. I'm driving out, making jokes. I'm singing along to letters to

383
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,240
 Clay O, which probably isn't helping, right? I'm like, "Dude, this is the best night ever, isn't it?"

384
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,880
 "What's your guys' favorite restaurant?" "I treat all treats you guys out to your favorite restaurant."

385
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,080
 "You deserve it." They're like, "Oh." They thought they got in my car and they honestly thought I was

386
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,120
 going to murder them, but they thought I definitely wouldn't murder them if they didn't go. And so

387
00:34:53,120 --> 00:35:03,200
 they got in my car driving around after midnight to the spookiest part of Sacramento, thinking

388
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,560
 they're going to get murdered by their friends. And then I don't even know that. I don't even know

389
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,080
 that. We drive out there and I think we get along with flashlights. We're walking around with flashlights.

390
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,760
 I'm like, "Hey Mauricio, hand me my machete. I got to cut these weeds down, please." We look around.

391
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,600
 The investigation for the burnt pants—I'm not a police officer, so basically when I want to

392
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,680
 investigate the burnt pants, I would just go back to where I found the burnt pants and look for more

393
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,520
 evidence. I want a whole outfit before I go to the police. But we hung out, dire lane for a bit,

394
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,520
 saw nothing super spooky. I was the spooky one that night, right? They legit thought they were

395
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,920
 going to have to try to fight me off, and I hate to break this to them. They wouldn't have won.

396
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,200
 They wouldn't have won. If I had turned around at some point and I had put the burnt pants,

397
00:35:51,200 --> 00:36:01,040
 I'm wearing them like a mask. Even with obstructed vision—sorry, Steve, sorry Mauricio—we all know

398
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,920
 I have more fight experience, but maybe if I had pants on my head, I wouldn't have been able to see

399
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,200
 them. But I didn't kill them. This isn't a veiled confession. I didn't fake Steve as my newest

400
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,920
 Patreon supporter, so I could get this off my chest. I never murdered them. We all got back in the

401
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,960
 car and drove back, and we probably went to Keros or Denny's, and I probably laughed, talking with

402
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,880
 a mouthful of Bacon Burger about some nonsense. And they probably must have felt this total sense

403
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,400
 of relief that their friend from high school hadn't actually been possessed by a pair of pants and

404
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,240
 murdered them. But can you imagine that, Terry? Like, they honestly were having conversations

405
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,120
 leading up to this saying, "I think Jason's going to murder us," and they felt they still

406
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,880
 had to get in that car. Could you imagine that level of terror? The burnt pants show up in one

407
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,520
 other story, and it's almost like if I get my comeuppance on this one. I'm gonna leave a lot

408
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,800
 of details out of this story, but I do have to say this. The police were looking for me for something

409
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,200
 I did not do. The police were looking for me. I did not do this crime. It's actually a super minor

410
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,440
 crime, but it involves like this stuff. It wasn't even a big thing, but the police were like, "Jason,

411
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,520
 the police don't look for you for a minor thing." They do! Police look for you for all sorts of

412
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,200
 stuff. Anyways, it wasn't the super serious thing, but it involves a friend of mine, and I don't want

413
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,440
 to blow their spot up, and I was thinking about a way to tell the story without really involving

414
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,960
 them, and it just got too messy. So, but I was totally innocent. I committed no crime. I wasn't

415
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,160
 even arrested. However, the cops were looking for me, and I was driving through Sacramento

416
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,600
 late at night all by myself. There's a cop car behind me. This was off. This was over by American

417
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,080
 River College. I'm driving. It's probably one or two in the morning. I just enjoy driving around.

418
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,200
 I don't have a car anymore, and it's probably good because I get more work than a cop behind me.

419
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,040
 Now, no one likes cops behind them. Not even other cops like cops behind them.

420
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,640
 We're at a stoplight. Now, the cops won't ever turn their lights on while you're at the stoplight,

421
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,440
 because it gives you a chance to think. They wait till your car is in motion,

422
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,200
 then flick the lights on. They really don't even flick them on when you're in the intersection,

423
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,840
 when you have all these different options. They wait till you're on straight away.

424
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,280
 They flick their lights on, but there's a cop behind me. I'm like, okay, whatever. It's not the

425
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,680
 most pleasant experience, but whatever. So, the light turns green. I start to drive. The cop is

426
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,160
 turning with me. Still, he has a one in four chance. There's four directions he can go in. It

427
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,840
 makes sense. I'm not super paranoid at this point. I drive a block up, and there's another cop, and

428
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,680
 I go, these cops are 100% here for me. The second I saw two in the area, I was like 100%

429
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,360
 there here for me. And they light me up at the exact same time. And I just pull into this restaurant.

430
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,000
 It's just restaurant right off the I-80 off ramp. It's over by the A&W in that area. It wasn't at

431
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,480
 the A&W. There was like a denny's or something there that I pulled into that parking lot.

432
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,880
 And it was just very calm. You know, I get pulled over by the police. I've been mouthy to police

433
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,080
 before, but I don't recommend it. I pull into this crowded parking lot, which is where you want to

434
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,920
 be because you want a bunch of witnesses on your site as well. Pull in this parking lot. The police

435
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,560
 pull in, and they box me in. So, I'm at a parking spot, and they actually come in behind me so I

436
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,200
 can't move. Police officer walks up to me and starts asking me questions. And I immediately know

437
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,480
 what they're here for. And I immediately know I didn't do anything wrong. I immediately know

438
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,240
 this is a complete misunderstanding. I don't want to blow up my friend's spot and get them involved

439
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,320
 in the story. But the police start asking me these questions about this person, and I was like,

440
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,040
 "No officer. No officer. No officer. And I'm saying all this stuff." And no matter what I answer,

441
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,840
 the information is slightly different than what it should be. It was super, oh, so aggravating.

442
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:42,560
 It was so aggravating. But anyways, again, I was 100% innocent of what I was being accused of doing.

443
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,200
 The cops would walk up, put the light in my face, ask me a couple questions. No, sir, no, sir, no, sir.

444
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,440
 He'd go back, verify it. He'd come back to me and go, "Well, this piece of information was wrong."

445
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,520
 I was like, "Listen, just start making the phone calls, dude. You know who to call. Like,

446
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,040
 it's not me. I didn't do nothing." And this goes on for an hour. It was the middle of the night.

447
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,400
 No one's picking up their phone. And I'm sitting there in that car. And the other car, there's

448
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,600
 two cop cars. Like I said, the other car, while the one officer is interviewing me,

449
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,960
 the other dude is shining his flashlight in my back seat, and he's looking. He's looking in my back

450
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,880
 seat. And I remember sitting there. The two cops, they walk away. They were just walking back and

451
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,680
 forth. I'm sitting there and I go. Now, remember, I was working for this job where I was putting

452
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,800
 signs up on the side of the rope. I did have weapons in my car, but you couldn't see those,

453
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,800
 right? They're underneath the floorboard. I had to, I think the machete was in the trunk at this

454
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,720
 point, but this is what you could see. Someone could walk up in my car and they could obviously

455
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:54,960
 see this. Sledge hammer, rope, duct tape, and a pair of burnt pants. Clearly visible. Clearly,

456
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,040
 clearly visible. And I remember sitting in my car. I was fuming. I was fuming because I knew

457
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,760
 that what these cops were saying wasn't true and it wasn't true. Someone was running their mouth

458
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,440
 and that situation got taken care of. I'm sitting there and I remember this thought when the second

459
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
 cop is looking at my back seat. We went back to the car. I remember, I remember sitting there and

460
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,880
 I go, "I'm not going to jail tonight for what I'm being accused of, but I'm probably going to jail

461
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,360
 tonight." Because there is no way, there is no way a law enforcement officer is going to look in

462
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:36,000
 the back seat and see a sledgehammer, rope, duct tape, and a pair of burnt pants and let me drive

463
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,600
 away. I was there for an hour. All the necessary phone calls were made. Everything was dropped

464
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,840
 as I knew it would be because I didn't do nothing wrong. Again, I don't want to blow up people's

465
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,520
 spot. It was a super minor ridiculous story and I'm almost making it sound more serious than it was.

466
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,000
 It wasn't, but these cops, they pulled me over and they didn't arrest me. Despite the fact I had

467
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,400
 what's normally known as a serial killer kit in the back seat of my car. Now, it could have been

468
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,520
 because I was super polite to those officers, despite the fact that I was clearly a serial killer.

469
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,800
 But I like to think the burnt pants. I like to think the burnt pants. Maybe there was the spirit

470
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,240
 of the burnt pants. You know what, Jason? You rescued me from just laying on the side of dire

471
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,200
 lane until I turned into nothing but fibers and birds used me to make nests, which actually,

472
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,360
 that sounds kind of cool. You should have left me there. But you have treated me so nicely and

473
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,840
 you've shown me off to all your friends. Some of them thought you were going to murder them.

474
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,560
 That I am going to magically use my burnt pant powers to make these police not take you to jail.

475
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,800
 Because again, what I was being accused of was nothing. It was actually a nothing thing and I

476
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,920
 didn't do it and it was all sorted out. I'm super minor. But I figured I was still going to go to

477
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,520
 jail because obviously it looked like I had done something far more serious than I had been accused

478
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:11,280
 of doing. So that was all settled. So that's the end of the burnt pants story. The little pair of

479
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,720
 jeans found on the side of a haunted road on a whirlwind adventure. The question is, was I really

480
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:27,120
 acting weird during that time period? Was I possessed by the burnt jeans? Now obviously I wasn't so

481
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:33,440
 possessed that I was murdering people. But what if I was just, what if I was just a little possessed?

482
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:40,320
 It would be an interesting thing because I felt totally normal the whole time. I didn't feel like

483
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,480
 I was doing anything different than I would normally do. A lot of my friends I was hanging out

484
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,120
 with didn't notice anything, but Steve and Mauricio actually thought the pants may have possessed me

485
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:58,720
 or driven me crazy or I just finally unlocked some lunatic personality of mine. Is that what

486
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,800
 being possessed is like? Do you not know a difference? Do you not know you're acting weird?

487
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,840
 You think everything's just fine? You think life is totally normal until

488
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:18,080
 you realize you're covered in the blood of your loved ones? Because if that's the case,

489
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,760
 if that's what, I'm not saying I was possessed, but if that's what possession does feel like,

490
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,960
 you would never know to seek help. You would never know something was wrong.

491
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,680
 And that's terrifying. Imagine you'd be scared and in horror because something has

492
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,280
 possessed you, something's controlling your body, but what if you didn't even know anything was wrong

493
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,120
 until it was too late? You wouldn't even know to pick up the phone and call the exorcist,

494
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,640
 or to go to your spiritual leader, or to even just seek mental health counseling.

495
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:00,880
 You would just live your life until your life had changed irreparably. You never once

496
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,240
 questioned that you may be possessed, but after that one unforgivable act,

497
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:15,520
 you spend the rest of your life wondering, "Why did I do that? Why did I do that? Why did I do that?"

498
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:26,160
 There's a road like dire lane in almost every city around the world. Are you brave enough to

499
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:34,400
 explore it? Are you brave enough to find your own burnt pants? Will they lead you down a funny

500
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,880
 adventure where your friends think they're going to murder them? Or will you be the one that actually

501
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:49,280
 gets possessed? That dark and lonely road outside of your town may be the key to an adventure,

502
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,400
 or to a lifetime of pain.

503
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,120
 Are you brave enough to explore it?
