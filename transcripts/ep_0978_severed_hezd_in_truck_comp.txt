 Is it possible for a ghost to be so powerful they can make you cease to exist?
 Then we hop aboard a school bus to take a look at a bizarre experience of a seventh grader.
 One day while riding home on the school bus they looked out the window and saw something
 that defies explanation. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason
 Carpenter, and I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got
 a ton of stuff to cover, so we gotta get started right away. First off, walking into Dead Rabbit
 Man is one of our legacy Patreon supporters. Everyone get on your feet and give a big round

 First off, this is the end of season 19. This week is the end of season 19. After this,
 I'm going to take a break until December 1st. However, I invite all of you guys to join
 me on November 24th, that is a Thanksgiving November 24th at 12pm Pacific Standard Time
 for the annual Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving livestream. Meet us over on YouTube. This
 is the reason why I stopped posting on YouTube, because they were getting ready to take the
 channel down, because they hate the podcast, but I wanted to be able to keep doing these
 livestreams and the YouTube shorts and all that stuff. And so I really would appreciate
 if you guys came out here and spent, you know, with your family, spent it with us. Now I'm
 putting it early enough in the day that I think most people could join us. And if not,
 it really is just, you know, I know how lonely the holidays gets. So I thought it would be
 really cool for us to hang out together. If you can't make it, that's totally fine.
 But check us out on the YouTube channel. I'll put the link, the YouTube link in the show
 notes November 24th, 2022. Cholpia Pacific Standard Time, Dead Rabbit Radio Thanksgiving
 livestream special. If you guys can't be there, totally understand you'll be there in spirit.
 Whether you want to or not, I'm going to reach through the astral world and suck your souls
 into this livestream. Your relatives are like, Hey, why are you so quiet? Why are you just
 standing around in the corner of the room? It's Thanksgiving. Come and have a seat. You
 can't. Your soul belongs to me. S E. Let's go ahead. That's some threatening. I'm mildly
 threatening actually. It's not more than mildly threatening. S E. Let's go ahead and toss
 you the hair hang glider. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command, jump off the highest
 point and glide us all the way out to a shopping mall. I saw a movie the other day called Hex.
 It was about a haunted, I don't even know how anyone would come up with this topic. It was
 a movie about these parachuter people. What are they called? Skydivers. And they're like,
 I'm probably should just get started with the other side. I'm actually not feeling that
 well. But let's just prolong the episode a little bit. This is the last of the week.
 I watched this movie recently about these haunted skydivers. They were, this is fantastic,
 this is a fantastic plot. The movie wasn't very good, but it was about these skydivers
 who they're like, they meet this new girl, they find this new skydiving girl. They're
 like, you dive alone. And she's like, yeah, I've always dived alone since my dad died
 skydiving or something like that. And they go, well, you know, I'd quit being such a
 poor dad's dad. Why don't you come and join us as we go skydiving? Let's do this. And
 so she goes skydiving with them and they said, you know what we should do now that we have
 six people in our skydiving group, we should do the hex. People are like, Oh, no, not the
 hex. And the hex is a, it's a sky, it's not real. I don't think so. I'm kind of scared.
 It's it takes six people. It's a haunted skydiving maneuver. So they're like, dude, let's do the
 hex. It'll be so cool. And people will be like, you can't do the hex. Every time someone
 does the hex, they die. And not because it's so difficult because it's like magical, because
 it's this magical cursed parachuting maneuver. And it's so funny. So they all go up in this
 airplane. You can tell basically what the movie was. It was very well made. Like, like
 cinematography was good. They had really good cameras and stuff like that. But you can tell
 it was basically someone owned someone owned a skydiving school. And they said, Hey, let's
 make a horror movie that takes place in broad daylight, 10,000 feet in the air. And so they
 do the hex. And like one guy's in the middle, one guy's in the middle of this circle of
 people. And they're falling. Then all of a sudden, he dematerializes. He just disappears
 in front of them. And they're like, Randy, no, Randy, where'd you go? And they still
 have to fall like another 9,000 feet, right? You see this guy simply ceased to exist in
 front of you. And they all land. And then the movie I was like, what in the world? They're
 like, where did Randy go? Where did Randy go? Did he pull a shoot early? No, he dematerialized.
 You were looking right at him. He just disappeared. He stopped existing. They're like, maybe he
 pulled a shoot. Well, then where is he? Well, maybe his shoot failed. And then they get
 investigated by the police. And they're like, you got to find a friend, Randy, man, he's
 missing. You must like parachuted away. He must have had one of those new dematerializing
 parachutes that the predator sold them. They go to the police and the police are investigating
 it. And they're like, you kids are crazy. You just can't disappear in the thin air literally
 because the air is thin up there. And they're like, no, Randy's gone. And they're like, are
 you sure about that? And then they see the helmet can footage of them parachuting down.
 And there was only five people up there. So Randy never existed. Or something like that.
 I'm not fully aware. That was when I kind of started checking out. I was like, I don't
 know about this movie. And then the movie kept going on and on. And then spoiler alert in
 case you're planning on watching hex, it turned out that there is so funny. I just need to
 get started with the episode. But I want to tell someone about this movie. No one that
 I know wants to hear me talk about hex. So I'm making you, it turns out that a parachute
 person like a master skydiver made a deal with the devil. And the devil gave him a
 cursed altometer. And the thing that tells how high you are, the devil gave him a cursed
 altometer. And this device makes the old grizzled skydiving coach immortal. You can't die, which
 would probably be pretty, probably be a pretty neat trick if you were skydiving all the time,
 like not releasing your parachute at all. You're like, people are like, Oh my God, Joe,
 you're gonna die. And then he hits the ground. There's like a puff of smoke from a roadrunner
 cartoon. And then you get down there and he's like tea anybody. No, you just fell 30,000
 feet and you didn't open your parachute. It'd be pretty, it would be a great skill for a
 skydiver. It also be super suspicious. When you're like, I'm never done all this crazy
 stuff. He's landing on his head intentionally. He's like, you're like, what? Let me see your
 altometer. Is it cursed? And then it had something to do with the girl. Like the entire movie
 took place in a comp... This was interesting. I never... I'm talking about it once I get
 to the interesting part. I got bored. I was like, the whole movie took place like in three
 minutes or something like that. It was kind of an occurrence at Al Creek Bridge. She was
 trapped. She died in the plane crash. They didn't even get to do the hex. The plane crashed
 or blew up or something like that. And I don't know. I lost interest somewhere in between
 the guy dematerializing. And then at the ending, the bad guy had this cursed altometer and
 the devil was driving the car. Not like a really cool CGI devil. Just a guy in a black
 suit. They're driving around. They're doing donuts in the desert. Somewhere in between.
 Somewhere in between. That was the final shot of the devil. It was like a favorite dream.
 Maybe this movie doesn't exist. Maybe I'm Randy. The devil's driving... I just got to
 get started with the episode. The devil's driving the car at the ending. And then about
 20 minutes in is when that dude dematerializes. The whole movie, I guess, takes place in like
 a three minute time period. The girl trying to solve the mystery as to where Randy went
 and how to uncurse the hex. How to get rid of the cur... Whatever. Whatever. I'm just
 talking about it. And now I realize it was interesting but it's kind of complicated to
 talk about. Anyways, I saw that movie so thank you for... Thanks for letting me talk about
 it. Nobody else wants to hear about that movie. I figured you might like it.
 S.C. go ahead and land this... Dead Red Rapper finally getting started with the episode. S.C.
 go ahead and land this hair hang glider in the parking lot of this shopping mall. We're
 right outside a Sears department store. We're going to walk on into it. Now, we don't have
 a location for this story. This is one of the stories where we don't have a location.
 We don't have a time period. We don't even have the name of the person. The person posted
 this anonymously. We're going to call him Sam. But if this story is true, this is a pretty
 insane paranormal event. Sam, who uses the online name "Fordor II Seater." Sam used to
 work at a mall photo studio. You know those places you used to go to to get your picture
 taken before every single person had a phone in their pocket? You'd go in there and get
 your photo taken. That's how it used to be back in the day. Sam used to work at one of
 these places. When Sam is working there, he's told pretty early on that the place is haunted.
 Sam says that this photo studio was set up... There was only really two main rooms to it.
 You had these two rooms. You had about seven different backdrops. You would go in there
 and be like, "Hey, you're going to go take a photo for your grandma. Let's make it look
 like you're in Maui." Obviously, your grandma's a huge idiot. You can't tell the difference
 between Maui and a backdrop at a mall photo center. You're pulling these backdrops down.
 A lot of people go in here to take photos of their kids. You bring your kid in and there's
 toys and stuff to animals that you can place around them. The baby's like, "Ah, click."
 Then there you go. Send that to grandma. You're like, "What? I know the baby was in Maui."
 That was about it. It was fairly small. You also had a room in the back where they developed
 the film. Actually, I'm thinking about it. The story's probably pre-Mid 2000s. I'm going
 to guess somewhere between the 90s and the 2000s is when the story takes place. They've
 developed the photos in their ... I don't know if this story could take place yesterday
 in Alabama, but you have the photos taken and developed there while you wait. Maybe
 you could go get a churro and an orange julie and swing back by, but you could leave with
 the photos that were taken. Basic place. These were around all the time when I was a kid
 and a young adult.
 Sam was told this place was haunted. Sam did realize it pretty quickly that, "Yeah, this
 place is haunted." Very, very by-the-book paranormal activity. There was no missing
 skydivers. It was just stuff ... I swear that I left this toy tiger in room A, but it's
 weird. When I went to room B, the toy tiger was sitting in there. You'd have toys move
 from room to room or ... that's weird. I remember we used the Maui backdrop for the last photo
 in room A, but then when I came back later, there was a different backdrop set up. Interesting.
 Now you could account that for the fact that people are constantly changing backdrops.
 There's kids there. Stuff's going to move from room to room. It would be easy to dismiss
 if you were a skeptic, but if you were working there and you knew you were the only one there
 or it was just you and somebody else and they weren't in the room in that time period and
 stuff was moving from room to room, it would also be easy to chalk up to paranormal activity.
 This would be easy for both a skeptic and a believer in the paranormal to kind of get
 an argument over, right? Because it's stuff that could easily happen with human interaction
 and you not realizing it. A customer changing the backdrop, a kid carrying the toy from
 one room to another, but if you believed in the paranormal, you could go and like, "No,
 this stuff was happening when there was no one else in the building. No one else was
 changing the stuff." But fairly basic. Fairly, fairly basic things. Also, again, this is
 a staple of paranormal activity. Lights would turn on in rooms where there was nobody.
 Malfunctioning lights. You could chalk it up to stuff like that. Very, very standard stuff.
 Except for what I'm about to tell you. I actually was messaging four door two-seater
 online. I've never seen anything like this. I couldn't think of anything like this. In
 the realm of ghosts at least. Let's take a look at this. It's fascinating. 20 minutes
 into the episode, let's get started. Sam and his manager were working at the photo studio
 one day when a teenage girl walks in and she needs to get a passport photo taken. Pretty
 basic stuff. You take a bunch of photos, select the best one, make five copies of it, hand
 it to the customer. Good to go. So they do that. The girl comes in, they put her on a
 stool, they have their basic backdrop, and 12 photographs are taken from about a few
 feet away. Click, click, click. I'm not gonna do 12 times. Multiply that by 4. And then
 it's time to develop them. Hey, young lady, why don't you go get a churro and an orange
 Julius while we develop these pictures? So Sam and the manager go into the back room,
 the dark room. Spooky is placed to be. Spooky is placed to be in a haunted photo studio.
 They're in the dark room to develop these photographs. And all of a sudden Sam hears
 his manager gasp. He turns to her and goes, "What? What's wrong?" And the manager hands
 the negatives, the film negatives over to Sam. Photo one is a picture of this girl sitting
 on a stool, the teenage girl, not like a spooky Annabelle girl. That's the first photo. Totally
 normal. That's exactly what Sam had expected it to look like. Second photo looks the same.
 Third photo looks the same. Variations in her facial expression, maybe her shoulders
 are a little slump. This is why they take 12 of them, right? The first 7 photos are
 of the young girl sitting on the stool. But Sam's continuing to look at these negatives
 and photo 8, 9 and 10, the girl is gone. In the photograph is just the wooden stool. Photo
 11, teenage girl sitting on a stool. Photo 12, teenage girl sitting on a stool. When Sam
 posted this, he does address the possibility that it could be a malfunction in the camera,
 but what would be the malfunction? What would be the malfunction? I could understand if
 the photo was blurry or if a photo wasn't taken at all. Like obviously you need time
 to get a new camera, but the photo is there, everything is there, but the girl. And then
 you could say it was a glitch because the remaining photos didn't have the girl. But
 there was 3 times that click happened where something was photographed. Well it's funny,
 I was about to say that wasn't there, but that's almost a misnomer. When we talk about
 ghostly photographs, normally what they are is someone takes a photograph of a hallway
 and then when the film is developed or when you look at your phone on your screen, there's
 something in the photo that wasn't there before. That's what common ghost photography
 is. I can't think of a time, and maybe you guys can correct me, I can't think of a time
 where a photograph was taken of something that was there that you could see with the
 naked eye, that was a normal object. You're looking at a chair, an old antique chair at
 a Goodwill and you want to send a photo to somebody, you take a picture of the chair,
 but then when you look at the photograph, everything else, everything else in that Goodwill
 is in the photograph except for the chair. And it's not that the chair is distorted,
 it's not like there's something blurry that's been added to the photograph, what you're
 seeing is something removed from the photograph that existed in reality. I can't think of
 another time that that's happened. And again, let me clarify this too, I'm not talking about
 a time where we have a story of somebody seeing a ghost walking down a hallway, taking a photograph
 of the photograph not appearing correctly. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about
 you see your mom walking down the hallway, not a ghost mom, a real mom, and you take
 a photograph of her and then when you look at the photograph later, it's just an empty
 hallway. Because that's what this seems to be. When I was talking to Sam online, they
 seemed to throw out the possibility that maybe the teenage girl was a ghost, maybe she was
 a ghost all along. I've never seen anything like that. I've never seen something where
 two witnesses, right, are seeing something with their own eyeballs that should be real.
 Again, it's not like two people see a UFO in the sky and they take a photograph and you
 can't see the UFO in the photograph. I'm not talking about, because we know that that's
 already a bizarre event. This is just somebody walking in to get their photo taken and then
 they cease to exist and then they come back. There's actually so many different layers
 to this. It's not like they simply cease to be in them and they walked out. She had never
 been there before because actually when I was talking to Sam about this online, one of
 their theories was that she was a ghost or the ghost of the photo store, which I think
 you could argue is possible. I didn't really go that direction because she showed back
 up in the photographs and they also gave her the photographs and they gave her copies
 of the photographs and she left. She left the story. She didn't dematerialize and the
 photographs fall on the ground. She probably did go to Orange Julius. She probably did
 get a delicious treat. I can't think of a time where someone's dematerialized in a photo
 session. Now to be fair, we haven't covered a lot of photo sessions on this podcast or
 even in my independent research, but what I think happened, what my theory is, is that
 what was ever in that film studio was so powerful it could manipulate the technology at the
 very least. It was so powerful that you could take a photo of something that exists, not
 something imaginary, not something that could be a trick of the light because it happens
 all the time in the world of paranormal. You think you see something walking down a hallway,
 take a photograph, you look at the photograph, the hallway's empty. That's normal. This is
 a situation of your mom walking down the hallway, you're taking a photograph, you look at the
 camera, it's an empty hallway. Your mom doesn't jump, she's right in your face. Time for dinner!
 That's what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about. Something real that
 ceased to exist for a couple moments in time and then it started existing again. So fascinating.
 I thought if it was my theory, again the story also could totally be made up, but my theory
 is that the ghost at the very least manipulated the technology of the camera to make the person
 cease to exist for three frames of film. And the reason why they would do that is almost
 as a flex to do it to show that they had that ability. The manager also said she had never
 seen anything like this before. She's never seen a glitch like this or even any haunting
 activity like this. So it would have been an ability for the ghost to show how powerful
 it was. That's theory one. Theory number two is actually far more disturbing and if it
 is true, this would rank as one of the most powerful ghosts on record. Because what is
 possible is as they were taking the photographs of this girl, the ghost literally made her
 disappear. It wasn't that she was blinked out of reality in the photographs, it was that
 the ghost made her blink out of reality in real life. Which would take a tremendous amount
 of energy. At that point, we're not talking about a ghost, we're talking about alien powers
 at that point. Aliens can dematerialize people and rematerialize people and things like that.
 That's what we see in the lore. They can also materialize and dematerialize themselves.
 But I can't think of a time. We do cover stories of people dematerializing. That's what a lot
 of missing 411 is. It's a kid walking around a berry bush and then they never see him again.
 Missing 411, although paranormal, never gets tied into the world of ghosts. There are pretty
 firm power limits on the way we describe ghosts. The fact that a ghost could dematerialize and
 then rematerialize somebody. You would almost need a haunted skydiving technique to do that.
 Fascinating story. I wish I had more information like where to display it. I mean I'd say that,
 but I'm sure this place is shut down by now. I don't think there's many mall photo studios
 still in operation. What a fantastic ghost story though. I really hope it's true. It
 could be creepy. It was posted pretty recently by someone who just talks about other stuff
 online and they weren't just writing about the paranormal. But it's awesome ghost story
 like that would be one. I would rather go to this place because that's such a powerful
 ghost than go to the same old haunted insane asylum that everyone else goes to. I'm walking
 through. I'm all possessed by an insane person. I'm all boring. Take me to the photo studio.
 Fascinating ghost story. If it's true, it does transcend anything we know about ghosts.
 She'd be looking at demonic at that point. Or alien. And I think again whatever it was,
 it was flexing its power level. It wanted the people there to know how strong it truly
 was. Why? Who knows. Sam didn't work there for long. It wasn't because they were too
 scared to go back to work. They worked there for a couple weeks. I don't know what happened
 after that. Again, I'd like to have more information about this, but that's all the information
 we have so far. Terrifying story. If true, that is one of the most powerful ghosts I've
 ever read about or came across. SE, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to those carbonar
 copters. Everyone's trapped in your parachutes. SE, take us up and away where we leave behind
 this mall photo studio. Take us all the way out to a bus stop. The year is truly beautiful.
 The year is 2007. We're going to meet a 7th grader online. He goes by the name NateW9731.
 We're just going to call you Nate. Nate is a 7th grader. And recently his family moved.
 He says we didn't move out of the area. I still attended the same middle school that
 I'd been going to. But we moved farther away from the school itself. So we're still in
 the district. We're just farther away. So I had to start taking the bus to school. And
 Nate explains that he's kind of a shy kid in general. And now that he's thrust onto
 this bus, this school bus, he's already shy since he just started riding the school bus.
 He doesn't have any friends on the bus. He hasn't made any friends. So it's kind of a
 double whammy, right? He doesn't have any friends. He's too shy to make some. And he
 says the bus in general was pretty rowdy. So that made him withdraw even more. Because
 now he's completely out of his element. He doesn't know any of these people. And they're
 a bunch of crazy people. So on this particular day back in 2007, he walks to the back of
 the bus. He gets on. And it loads up with all these really noisy kids that he doesn't even
 know. The bus leaves school. The bus has left school. And it's not far. It's not far from
 school. Only about a mile, he estimates. The bus is only about a mile from school. And
 it comes to a stoplight. This is a classic yellow school bus. So it sits really high.
 So Nate sitting on the very back, he can look out and he can look into other people's cars.
 And they're at this red light. The bus has stopped at this red light. And next to the
 bus is an old 80s era Ford pickup truck. There's two guys sitting in the truck. And Nate says,
 "If I had to guess, they look like father and son." One of them was in their 50s, early
 60s. The other one seemed to be in his 30s. I'm looking into this truck, seeing these
 two dudes sitting there. The driver, who's the older one, has both of his hands on the
 steering wheel. He's staring straight ahead. The passenger is sitting there also staring
 straight ahead, his hands in his lap. And there's just a weird look to their faces. Nate's looking
 at these two guys. There's just something weird, something very emotionless about them.
 They're just staring straight ahead. In between the two men, Nate sees a stack of what he
 believed was folded blankets. It was a stack of folded blankets. Could have been towels,
 could have been rags, could have been anything, but a stack of folded blankets between the
 two men. And he goes, "The stack of the blankets, the fabric, was about as high as the men's
 chest." So maybe about like two feet, you know, they're sitting down, probably about
 like two feet high of these blankets neatly folded up. Nate's looking at these two men.
 He's looking at the blankets. And his eyes just kind of scan down as he's looking into
 this car. He's looking down this pile of blankets until he sees nestled in between the neatly
 stacked blankets and the seat of the pickup truck is the severed head of a woman. Now,
 Nate, even now, you know, this story happened in 2007, he's having a hard time coming to
 terms with what he saw. Such a shock. But he 100% remembers looking down the blankets
 and seeing this head. And he goes, "I knew it was a woman's head." He goes, "If anything,
 it was a young woman." He goes, "I'm looking out the school bus window and I see the severed
 woman's head and it is completely pale as if it's been drained of blood." But the worst
 part about it, the part that he can't get out of his head, was the look on her face.
 He said this woman's eyes were wide and her mouth was locked in a eternal scream. This
 severed woman's head sitting underneath the pile of blankets. And Nate is so shocked by
 what he's looking at, he actually begins to look around the bus. He has this crippling
 shyness that won't let him yell out, "Guys, look, look!" He doesn't know anyone, there's
 no one he can turn to, there's no one he can tap on the shoulder. And the kids are crazy
 anyways, they're so rambunctious, the bus is full of noise right now. He's hoping another
 kid sees it. A braver kid, a louder kid looks over and sees this woman's head. But no one
 does. "Nate just sits there," he doesn't say a word. The light turns green, the bus
 makes a left, the pickup truck continues on its journey. And to this day Nate questions
 exactly what he saw. It's an interesting story, it's funny because Nate, when he posted this,
 seemed to think that this could have been paranormal, which it very well could have
 been. There are things that I've seen, personally seen, I'll try to find the episodes, put them
 in the show notes, but there are things that I've seen that when you look at something
 that isn't real, that doesn't make sense. And I'm not talking about like it's your
 imagination or something like that, you're psychotic. I'm talking about when you see
 any sort of ghostly activity that shouldn't be, your brain can create a false image to
 cover up the impossible. So for example, let's say you came home, let's say you came home
 and you have a kid and your kid was floating in air. That's impossible. That's impossible,
 unless your kid's Casper, that's impossible. Your kid can't float in the air. So what would
 happen, it doesn't happen all the time, but what could happen is you would come home and
 you would see your kid floating in the air and you knew that would be impossible and
 it's almost like a little bit of a glitch. You can't comprehend what you're looking
 at, but what would happen is let's say maybe three or four years later you may go, hey
 remember that time when Billy was balancing on three basketballs? And people are like,
 what are you talking about? And they're like, no, I remember one day I came home and Billy
 was balancing on three basketballs and it's completely impossible. That's that's equally
 impossible. But it's more plausible than your kid floating. That type of stuff does happen.
 So sometimes when we look at super bizarre memories that just don't make sense. We can
 look at a paranormal answer for those things. So I can see where Nate's coming from where
 he's saying that it's possible that what I saw was actually something paranormal that
 shouldn't have existed and my brain was processing it in that way. His logic behind that was
 there was no blood. There was no blood. I'm looking at the severed head, but there was
 no blood in the car. It wasn't dripping out any sort of blood. If it was a real severed
 head, there would have been blood. He also does to be fair, he does also bring up that
 it could have been a prank that could have been a Halloween prop as well. It's possible.
 Those are all definitely possible. I don't think this was a paranormal event, though.
 It actually wouldn't make sense these series of events that would make this a true crime
 tragedy for one when you decapitate somebody the head itself doesn't contain a ton of
 blood. While your brain needs blood and your skin needs blood and all this stuff and you
 need oxygen in your head, that's true. But it doesn't contain... I know it has a lot
 of blood. It has a lot of blood as compared to maybe your fingers, but you could drain
 a human head quicker than you could drain a human leg. It doesn't contain a lot of blood
 to begin with. You actually, when you decapitate someone, you could drain the blood out of
 a head fairly quickly. So the head not bleeding isn't a sign that it's paranormal, too. We
 don't know the situation here, right? It looked like it was a young woman's head here. So
 if you really were transporting a young woman's head, why would you transport it in that way,
 in between the two people with the blankets stacked up on top of it? The blankets would
 make sense to cover up the sight of the head for anyone who is driving by in a normal sized
 car. You know, no one would think that the bus is elevated, that there's a chance that
 you might come next to a school bus. Criminals aren't... they don't have a lot of foresight.
 That's generally why they get caught. But that would make sense. They're gonna cover
 it up. You go, "Why didn't they just put it in a box?" It's super interesting because
 when we do look at criminals, they do... not all of them, right? There's a lot of monsters
 out there, but most criminals were ordinary people up until the crime. They may have drug
 problems, gambling problems, things like that, but for the most part, they're ordinary people
 before the crime was committed. And you have all your normal superstitions and normal traditions
 and beliefs. Just 'cause you've murdered someone doesn't... you don't go, "Well, I guess I'm
 not Southern Baptist anymore." No, you're just Southern Baptist who murdered somebody.
 I could see if this victim was somebody that they knew that they wouldn't want to throw
 the head in a tackle box. It feels very disrespectful. It is an interesting quirk of crime, but you
 will... you know, you bury bodies after crimes for two reasons. One, to hide the evidence,
 to kill the two, also 'cause you don't want the body picked up by scavengers. You don't...
 you knew this person. You knew this person. You guys hung out for years and years, and
 then a drug deal went bad. He ripped off a bunch of money from you. You can't let that
 stand. Otherwise, everyone will rip off money from you. So you do have to kill this guy,
 but you don't want him eaten by the rats in the alleyway. So you could... I could see
 that happening. I could see them not throwing her head in a tackle box and those eyes wide
 staring into the darkness as it rumbles back and forth across the flatbed of the truck.
 I could see them wanting to have some sense of grace, some sense of compassion for this
 head. The number one reason why I think this is a real head, and again, the story could
 totally be made up. This could be creepy, but the reason why out of all of this that
 I think it was a real head was a detail that Nate said. Because while this detail isn't
 impossible to make up, most people don't think of it this way. Most people don't think of
 things like this. A violent death is a violent death. In the movies, people get shot, they
 fall down, they die. People get hit in the back of the head with a baseball bat, they
 fall down, they die. Or if it's the hero, he just goes "ouch." But in reality, killing
 someone is extremely violent. You start off trying to strangle somebody and then three
 and a half minutes later, the person is still alive, you grab the claw hammer. That's generally
 how it happens. Unless you come with your own murder weapon, and even then, stuff can
 go south, guns, jams, knives, break off. People go to houses with a steak knife that's used
 to cut steak, and now they're trying to stab someone in the rib cage with it, it's not
 going to work. I mean, it actually does work, but the chance of a malfunction goes up because
 it's not designed for combat. It's not designed to go into a human.
 Violent death is extremely violent. It's an extremely violent way to go. If you asked
 the average person, "What would a severed head look like?" If you chopped a head off,
 most people are just going to immediately think of something they had seen in the haunted
 mansion down in Disneyland or something they had seen in a movie, or like a guillotine
 type movie. It gets chopped off, it's a pretty clean cut. Head rolls around in the basket,
 right? Draw a picture of a chopped off head. And that is pretty accurate. When you chop
 a head off in combat, when you chop a head off while you're fighting someone, it's not
 a clean line. But if you are doing it post-mortem, you can make it fairly clean. I've seen quite
 a few severed heads in my life because my father used to own a crematory, and that was
 my summer job. So when you find these bodies that have been chopped up, it's pretty even
 cut. It's pretty even cut. I'm not saying you could put... I'm not saying that you could
 put a bubble level on it and it'd be perfect, but a detail that most people would miss.
 If you want... If I said show me the severed head of a murder victim, if I wanted to draw
 a picture of that, if I wanted you to just describe a severed head of a murder victim
 to me. One of the key details that I think a lot of people would leave out, and it's
 a key detail that Nate said, it's something that he observed, this image has been with
 him all these years, was that the woman's head was missing teeth. That is very common
 in a violent crime, and it's not something that most people would associate. If I asked
 you to picture a severed head, or to draw me a picture of a severed head, very few people
 would draw that picture with teeth missing. But it is... I mean teeth get knocked out
 in fights all the time. Teeth get knocked out in sports all the time. So when you're
 trying to murder somebody, teeth will break. Teeth will break, teeth will shatter. If it's
 a fight, if you're trying to strangle someone, again it takes a long period of time, it's
 a very, very violent death. If you're trying to hold someone down, you go, "Well we're
 just going to drown her in a bathtub." And as you're getting her head to go in there,
 her jaw hits the rim of the bathtub, she's going to break teeth. It's super common for
 a murder victim to not have all of their teeth in their face. It's not something you hear
 about a lot, because we, most people see the depiction of violence that they see, they're
 not seeing it on real life, and if they're not seeking it out in gore videos, they see
 what they see in Hollywood. So the fact that the head was missing teeth makes me think he
 saw a real severed woman's head. And these people, we don't know what happened, we don't
 know who the woman was, we don't know where they went, we don't know if these people were
 ever caught, we don't know if they were locals, there's so many questions about the story,
 but I do believe that head was real. If the story's real, if these details that Nate wrote
 are real, I think that was a real head. If it's creepypasta, it's creepypasta, I apologize
 for wasting your time. But it's a terrifying story, it's such a terrifying story, because
 in the end, you know, when we, if we suffer a violent death, I think the most we want
 is to be remembered and to be abenged. It's just such a tragic story, right? You can imagine
 this young woman in the last moments of her life not wanting to die, obviously, fighting
 for her life, that's why she would have lost her teeth in the first place. And then as
 she's dying, praying that she gets some justice, praying that these men don't get away with
 killing her. But when that light turned green, and that little boy sat there on that bus
 too shy to say anything, they did get away with it. We don't know for how long, they
 could have been arrested, like I said, they could have been arrested the next day, they
 could still be out there. This could have been a one off murder that was committed over
 drugs or jealousy or something like that, or these guys could have been budding serial
 killers we don't know. And I'm not blaming Nate, right? He's in seventh grade, he's a
 shy kid, I'm not blaming Nate, but it's just kind of a sad story and a creepy one at the
 same time. Who was the girl, why was she killed, who were the men, are they still out there?
 We'll never have any answers to any of those questions. All we can hope is that whatever
 happened, even though we don't know who that young girl is, there's someone out there
 who does remember her. That she didn't live her entire life just to be forgotten. Just
 to become a story posted on the internet. Just to become a screaming head tucked under
 some blankets in an old Ford pickup.
