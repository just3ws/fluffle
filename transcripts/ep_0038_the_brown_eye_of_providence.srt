1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
 A man is found crucified in South Korea. Is it murder or suicide? And does the all

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,480
 seeing eye on the back of the dollar bill really is it really a butthole today

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,760
 on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,160
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
 host Jason Carpenter. Hope you're having a great day. I'm having a great day. It's

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,040
 107. I think this might be a record for Hood River. It says on my phone it only

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,160
 feels like 101 so I guess that's some sort of solace but I disagree. I don't

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,880
 know if it necessarily feels like 107 but we're just a little more humid up here

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,440
 than you know other places I've been in that been this hot. What's up with this

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,160
 heatwave? It's driving me nuts. The only good thing I like about the heatwaves means

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,200
 we're going to have a very mild winter and I hate the snow so I'm totally fine

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,440
 with there being a mild winter. I'm totally good with that. So last night

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,360
 the play wrapped up. I've talked about being in it before. We just got done with

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,160
 another play we're doing Spoon River Anthology. It's actually kind of

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,760
 interesting. I might go back and read it. Oh I mean yeah I see I technically when

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,680
 I'm doing a play I don't pay attention to anything else anyone's doing on stage

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
 unless it relates directly to me and my character. Just kind of a little method I

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,920
 have. Also cuts down on people asking me for advice on how to do stuff because I

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,800
 just go I don't really pay attention to what you're doing. After the end of the

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,280
 party I'm I'm known for mixing my drinks and not like in the traditional like a

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,360
 little martini a little grenadier. Stuff like that I took. So we had Coca-Cola

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,520
 because I was taking a break on the keto. We had Coca-Cola and we had some wine so

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,160
 I mixed half Coca-Cola half house red. It was delicious. I'm not a big alcoholic.

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,440
 Well I'm not a big alcoholic but I'm not a big I don't drink a lot of alcohol I

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,160
 guess would be a better way to put it. It tastes really good. It tasted like

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,680
 basically cherry Coke and I was very proud of myself and somebody named it

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,960
 the woke you know like wine and coke but when I woke up this morning I'm pretty

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,640
 sure that's I'm pretty sure that's when Michael Jackson was giving to kids

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,040
 allegedly allegedly he gave them something called Jesus juice which was

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,640
 wine served in a soda can. So provided that the soda can was completely empty

31
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,240
 when he gave them Jesus juice I think I'm in the clear but if you ever come

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,800
 across some red wine and some Coca-Cola you know one time I mixed I got curious

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,400
 what would happen if you mixed Coca-Cola and Pepsi in together and it tastes

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,120
 like RC Cola. It tastes almost identical to RC Cola so I'm wondering if the RC

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,360
 Cola factory is just like two vats of Coke and Pepsi pouring into individual

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,960
 bottles I don't know but I you know I was funny I never thought of mixing those

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,320
 two before I wonder how many people have. Try it try mixing other drinks I I

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,000
 don't know where I'm going with this I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into the

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,120
 first story because I think that kind of ran out of steam so a while back we did

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,360
 food-based conspiracies and that's when we did deep soy and fake cabbage and all

41
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,480
 of that and this week I wanted to do another theme one so I've decided to

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,600
 do sex-based conspiracies conspiracies or paranormal events that have to do

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,520
 with sex and there's a lot of them actually we have some really good ones

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,840
 this week the first one we're gonna talk about is an interesting one

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,440
 apparently let's do a quick overview so the all-seeing eye is the pyramid and

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,360
 the top has the eyeball it's a very familiar logo if you've ever handled

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,760
 US currency it's supposed to be the the eye of Providence is what it's known as

48
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,640
 people have said you it's a Masonic symbol it's a lot of times it's tied

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,720
 into the Illuminati and it's just kind of this logo like we're always watching

50
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,920
 people have said it's like the eye of Lucifer or you know it has all these

51
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,560
 negative connotations especially when it gets tied into the Illuminati actually

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,480
 you know I've seen kids like little kids hold up their hands like a triangle and

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,840
 they're like Illuminati I'm in the Illuminati and blah blah blah and they

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,880
 don't know what they're doing but it's still a little chilling still a little

55
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,000
 creepy but anyway so this guy on Reddit of all places this was where I could find

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,880
 the most information on this conspiracy theory I don't necessarily because I

57
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,760
 found other sites that talked about it don't think that he came up with it

58
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,000
 himself but he's definitely put it in the most I hate to use the word logical

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,200
 but the most coherent form of this conspiracy theory so the theory is if

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,120
 he first off starts off by saying why isn't porn why doesn't porn have the

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,520
 same copyright hounds that every other industry has like if I posted a video of

62
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,320
 Pacific Rim uprising on YouTube I'm gonna get hit with a DMCA notice so it's

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,840
 basically a takedown notice saying that I've violated copyright however when we

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,920
 look at porn websites they it's all pirated material and he's specifically

65
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,280
 saying they'll use major pop songs in those videos so you'll see a video and

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,520
 it'll just be a compilation video of cream pies or whatever oh I guess I

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
 should say this is gonna be this week's probably gonna be pretty explicit

68
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,080
 episodes they're gonna have explicit tags you might want to wear your headphones

69
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,920
 I probably should have said that in the beginning but anyways so I'll keep the

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,080
 cursing low but the subject matter still still gonna be kind of intense so you

71
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,800
 have a Britney Spears song said to a compilation of facials or whatever and

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,200
 he's saying why isn't the why aren't these videos being taken down by the major

73
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,320
 companies and that's a fair point honestly it's a fair point we'll get to

74
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,520
 that he then postulates saying that the reason why they don't get taken down by

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,560
 Hollywood is because Hollywood is part of this Illuminati conspiracy to degrade

76
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,920
 humanity to make humans feel less feel more isolated from me from themselves

77
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 and to basically make us immoral and then goes on to say how come there's a much

78
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,520
 a straight anal porn all of a sudden now if you haven't picked up by now this

79
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,000
 guy watches a lot of porn and I'm not just saying that it's some sort of

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,640
 something I've picked out he actually says that he came to this theory quoting

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,280
 him it was something that just came out at me in a flash in a matter of

82
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,000
 speaking while I was watching a girl get plowed from behind by a BBC so he's

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
 watching a ton of porn and coming up with these conspiracy theories he's

84
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,760
 saying why is straight porn so anal specific nowadays why is there so much

85
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:00,440
 of it and his reasoning is that the Illuminati and the Freemasons and they're

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,360
 kind of one in the same and in his view they want to break down humanity and

87
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,560
 make us debase and immoral people and the whole idea of the Freemasons is to mock

88
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,360
 religion to mock God and his kind of overall point is if you if the pyramid

89
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,120
 if the all-C and I is supposed to be a replacement for God it's supposed to be

90
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:32,200
 a parody of religious symbols then maybe the pyramid is a parody of itself

91
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,600
 meaning that it's not a pyramid it's actually a it's the backside of a vagina

92
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,360
 between the legs with the anus perched atop as the eye of providence and those

93
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 are his exact words so basically we're not looking at the all-C and I we're

94
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,000
 looking at this butthole now I know you're thinking Jason this is just one

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,200
 lunatic online why are you why are you doing a segment on this guy well what

96
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,520
 was funny is not it's not just him there's other people who believe this

97
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,080
 stuff so this other article they're talking about something called AN this

98
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,880
 is talking about like Egyptian mythology Egyptian iconography and they go into

99
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,840
 say that the AN represents the anus which is obviously associated with

100
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,560
 darkness things done in darkness and the darkness in the bowels of office sorry

101
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,320
 and the darkness in the bowels of the orifice of perjait purgation

102
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,520
 purgation so this isn't just this guy like there are people are making this

103
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,880
 connection that the all-C and I is actually supposed to be I have to say

104
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,920
 I've looked at a lot of buttholes today researching these articles there's a

105
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,440
 lot of pictures of buttholes so all the links are going to be non-safe for work

106
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,720
 the thing is is like I know what a butthole looks like you don't have to

107
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,880
 do put a close-up picture of it on your website if you're trying to convince me

108
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,320
 that first off it makes me less likely of your argument because there's

109
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
 nothing that looks less than a human eye than a butthole the only thing they

110
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,320
 have in common is they're both circles that's ridiculous but you're gonna look

111
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,640
 at a lot of buttholes if you click on the links I probably should sit down in

112
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,400
 the beginning too so is the all-C and I representative of the human butthole now

113
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,760
 he goes on the the guy who wrote the reddit article he starts connecting this

114
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,360
 more saying that you know the Freemasons have connections to North Norse

115
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,920
 mythology and that Odin is often seen carrying a giant dildo around which I

116
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,520
 missed that in the Thor movies but Odin is represented in carrying a giant dildo

117
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,560
 around that he penetrates himself with and and you thought it stopped there no

118
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,080
 witches and broomsticks the broomsticks were dildos they weren't like broomsticks

119
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,840
 they flow around on they're dildos they masturbated with as they thought of

120
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,200
 Satan and little known fact the Nazis have taken over the planet since

121
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,240
 September 11 2001 and they are using the power of the butthole to control us all

122
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,720
 all of that stuff according to this guy is absolutely true now the thing that I

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,840
 the trouble I usually have with conspiracy theories is they do tend to

124
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,960
 cast a wide net he would have done a much better job these people would have

125
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,800
 done a much better job convincing me and like I said I go into all these

126
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,120
 conspiracy theories with the hypothesis that they are true if he said the butthole

127
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,440
 the all-C and I is really human butthole and it's because the Masons came up with

128
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,600
 it and the Masons love but sex and they have gay sex all the time or something

129
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,480
 like that and they kept it there I would still think it was a little ridiculous

130
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,820
 but when you try to tie it into witches and Nazis and North Missal North

131
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,160
 mythology and Egyptians and 9/11 and all this stuff it just totally ruins the

132
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,760
 point and when you tell me you came up with this theory while watching

133
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,840
 interracial anal porn and then he brags also that he never pays for porn oh and

134
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,200
 to go back to the copyright thing there are entire companies dedicated to

135
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:05,120
 shutting down pirated and copyrighted porn so his his idea that none of it is

136
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,680
 ever none of it is ever taken down because the Illuminati is controlling

137
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,440
 the porn industry it's not true there are companies that porn and porn

138
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,320
 companies and anyone can hire to go into these websites and give them DMCA's the

139
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,520
 problem is is that when you take a video down someone else just uploads it there

140
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,000
 is huge money behind porn and I go back to the point I've made a couple times on

141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,640
 the show stop watching porn it's just not healthy for you I don't care about

142
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,800
 the moral issues behind it because that may not affect you it actually

143
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,320
 physically affects your body you watch a lot of porn it makes you impudent you

144
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,480
 stop watching porn you will stop being impudent that's steady after steady after

145
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,160
 steady show and it causes erectile dysfunction and then stop watching

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,240
 porn it also causes you to come up with crazy conspiracy theories but again I'm

147
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,440
 gonna circle back one more time is it possible that the all-cni is

148
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,800
 representative of something other than the all-cni sure why not it's a it's a

149
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,160
 icon is it possible that it represents a buckle you know what honestly this is

150
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,880
 one of those things that if it's either or if somebody was able to provide me

151
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,080
 more coherent proof that wasn't brought up while they were watching porn and they

152
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,720
 go no we actually like if you look at the early text the people who came up with

153
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,920
 it thought it'd be funny or no it is like this esoteric symbol that the eye

154
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,240
 represents both what sees and what leaves the body I'll be like okay yeah sure as

155
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:34,280
 it stands now I think this guy's just kind of nuts but you know it's one of

156
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,840
 those things that and again either way it wouldn't really have any bearing on my

157
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,040
 life whether I would laugh every time I handed someone a dollar bill thought of

158
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,240
 it but yeah it's one of those weird conspiracies that it's it's possible I

159
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,360
 guess it's highly unlikely but it's possible there's other stuff that we've

160
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,480
 covered that I'm like no that absolutely didn't happen there's proof that it

161
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,200
 didn't happen but this is one of those ones that I mean you get a bunch of guys

162
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:06,320
 together and they start designing stuff maybe they do decide to have a laugh now

163
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,760
 what the what the all-cni is supposed to represent they always talk about the the

164
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,000
 eye of Providence you'll hear that referred to in conspiracy circles or

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,720
 the all-cni it's considered the all-cni of God it's supposed to be the eye of

166
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,920
 God watching over humanity that's why it's called Providence like it's this

167
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,720
 divine providence so I mean it is an old symbol I don't think it was supposed to

168
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,840
 be a butthole I think it's easy if you stare at something long enough or if you

169
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,240
 watch enough porn and you're thinking about it and you're seeing all these

170
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,240
 buttholes quench in front of you and they look like they're winking and I'm not a

171
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,120
 big fan of anal anyways but you know it looks like it's winking to make sure

172
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,400
 they get an eye whatever I think that the gentleman who wrote the first off I

173
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,220
 think he needs to stop watching porn so now I don't think that the eye of

174
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,280
 Providence is a butthole I think that kind of went without saying I do think

175
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,600
 that like he can weave an interesting story and maybe he should use maybe

176
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,680
 should stop watching porn and write I mean like he could write basically say

177
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,840
 national treasure meets you know like filthy facials volume 7 and have kind of

178
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,160
 this hero going on this quest to unearth this orgy Freemason group that's

179
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,320
 drawing these images in our money that makes us want to have butt sex with each

180
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,080
 other someone would buy that I think that'd be an interesting story bunch of

181
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,800
 Freemasons run around banging each other drawing buttholes everywhere they have to

182
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,000
 follow the clues they're looking at like the Constitution and they work out

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,680
 every other word and it gives you a web address that's on Ex Hamster the you go

184
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,440
 to you go to the you go to Mount Rushmore and like if you come on the

185
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,200
 four faces in the right order like this vault opens up and it's full of these

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,080
 it's full it has Odin's dildo in there I mean you know he could come up with

187
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,440
 these great scenarios just you using this core idea maybe he actually has

188
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,560
 something but no the eye of the Providence the eye of Providence is not

189
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,840
 but I'm glad I was able to finally put that at rest that was actually one on

190
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
 the conspiracy list as well so like I said there's a lot of weird stuff on

191
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,880
 there but we that one's done it's settled unless more information pops up

192
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,000
 which it probably won't but in but in case it does next story is really bizarre

193
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,480
 and it's one that I came across years and years ago it's funny because I used to

194
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,920
 just research weird events and then you know find I get books I read websites

195
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,080
 and I kind of bookmark stuff and I that was just kind of it I would just

196
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,600
 research it and then call it a day and as I started doing this podcast I've been

197
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,400
 going back through some moment old bookmarks I came across this story and

198
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,240
 it's still surprised me I was still like that's absolutely impossible so this

199
00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,880
 story is back from 2011 so you know quite old you know news wise so in South

200
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:09,400
 Korea I found this man crucified and crucified in the traditional way his

201
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,240
 feet were nailed to the to the bottom of the cross his hands were nailed to the

202
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,840
 cross he had a rope around his neck and he had a mirror oh and he had a crown of

203
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,480
 thorns just like Jesus you know Jesus did and imagery had a crown of thorns on

204
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,800
 he had a stab wound in his stomach where the Romans stabbed Jesus and there was a

205
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,680
 mirror in front of his face oh and there was two smaller crosses on the side

206
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:43,640
 those were empty but anyway so some guy finds it and they goes back he

207
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,680
 puffs off calls the cops the cops show up and they're looking around and they

208
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,120
 see all this stuff they're like okay yeah there's his feet you know they'll to

209
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,040
 that and stab wound and the mirror was in his face so he could look at his own

210
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,240
 suffering and you're I'm reading this I'm reading the article years ago me like

211
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,480
 oh man that's super brutal and I was reading it again last week and I am

212
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,840
 like oh man that's awful like was it like a drug deal gone wrong was a day

213
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,360
 like some sort of mafia Asian mafia send in a message you get to the last

214
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,600
 sentence in the article it says police still aren't sure if this case was a

215
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,600
 homicide or a suicide and I'm like what are you what are you how do you

216
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,720
 crucify yourself how do you commit suicide via crucifixion I know there's

217
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,680
 some crazy ways you can kill yourself but that's

218
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:40,640
 wait for that dog to pass I must have psychic powers right when I said that

219
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,640
 oh well maybe I don't that's the way people usually come up they say may have

220
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,760
 psychic powers they just think something and something happens and then they're

221
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:55,600
 like I'm gifted anyways so it's a hundred and seven I can't shut the windows

222
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,960
 that's the problem but I'm not gonna worry about it he's a happy little puppy

223
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,840
 he can bargol he wants I don't care anyway so I read this article and I was

224
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,160
 like okay this happened in 2011 they have to have some sort of resolution to

225
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,640
 this by now and the cops did finally rule he killed himself and they actually

226
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,680
 had to put on a presentation to prove because no one would believe how do you

227
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,960
 kill yourself you crucifixion so the police reenacted it listen to what this

228
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,720
 guy did so apparently he was this hyper religious guy and before he ended up in

229
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,560
 the quarry where they found the crucifix he had emptied his bank account he had

230
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,300
 planned they found notes about his crucifixion he canceled his mobile phone

231
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,840
 contract according to this now of course you could always say someone made him

232
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,920
 I'll do that to kill him and all that stuff but the cops are actually able to

233
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,560
 figure out how he did this so they said that and this might sound a little

234
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,720
 extreme and go all that sounds ridiculous but this is the cops hypothesis so he

235
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,760
 nailed his own feet to the cross first okay then he lifted his back up and put

236
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,200
 the rope or the rope is hanging off the cross already he put his head in the

237
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,960
 rope now that's Jesus didn't die have a rope around his neck but it takes quite

238
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,600
 a few quite a few days to actually die of crucifixion I think he's just beating

239
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,720
 that process up anyways then he stabs himself on the side so his feet are

240
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,880
 nailed to the crucifix who puts his head in the rope he stabs himself on the side

241
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:33,080
 oh man this sucks and then he drilled holes in his hands and there was already

242
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,560
 nails in the cross and he lifted his hands up and pushed the nail like head

243
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:46,600
 through his hand and got him both in there and then just slumped and if they

244
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,560
 died of a combination of blood loss and suffocation because when you when you're

245
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,160
 crucified even without the rope you can't hold up Jesus wasn't crucified

246
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,680
 through his hands by the way that's a misnomer he was crucified through his

247
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,880
 wrists but what happens is when you crucified people we know that

248
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,680
 scientifically your body will slump and your head will kind of push down into

249
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,440
 your chest and you can't breathe so you lift yourself up to get a couple more

250
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,280
 breaths but it's you have really no upper body strength it's not like these

251
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,600
 people are on a torch now they start to slump again they start to not breathe

252
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,280
 again you do that for about two or three days and you die a couple hours

253
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,240
 depending on because your lung capacity so it's very torturous way to die you

254
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,520
 can you imagine back in the day they talk about these accounts for people

255
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,680
 would travel down roads and they would just be crucified soldiers like

256
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,960
 crucified prisoners lining the road I mean we complain if we go to Cancun and

257
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,240
 there's a head in the pool could you imagine going to Bulgaria and there's

258
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,880
 500 people crucified and you're like this isn't where I want to be right now

259
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
 that was just and but you would just be like oh something was to happen here

260
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,280
 well I still got to go do business in this town you know it's bizarre but you

261
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,040
 just see that and you can't help them you can't help them because then you'll end

262
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,720
 up on there so anyways yeah there was a suicide apparently and again it's

263
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,640
 possible that this guy was murdered and this was all an attempt attempt to

264
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,400
 cover it up but the neighbors were like he was super religious they didn't really

265
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,000
 shock anybody he made the plans if there's a will there's a way as grim as

266
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,200
 that sounds if you want to crucify yourself you will plan out how to and

267
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,320
 that probably helped them to where they found how he planned they found notes on

268
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,960
 his crucifixion the police probably be able to go okay that's how he got his

269
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,560
 hands nailed into the cross he drilled his hands beforehand the nails are already

270
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,280
 there and he just hoisted it over you know at some point I'm sure he totally

271
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,080
 regretted doing that I mean he could have been caught up in some whole

272
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,520
 religious fear fervor but after like hour four he may have been like I'll never

273
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,120
