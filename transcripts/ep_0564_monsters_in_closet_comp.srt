1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 A man returning home is suddenly thrust into a world of true crime and conspiracy.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,240
 And then we travel to your bedroom to take a look what's hidden behind that closet door.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,240
 Is it really just a bunch of clothes? Is it a ghastly spirit? Or something far, far worse.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,280
 This episode isn't about you and how crummy your life is. This episode's a little dark though

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,480
 and it ends with spooky things in your closet. It ends with a thin piece of wood separating you

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,680
 from eternal evil so you know Zach doesn't have a choice. He has to be in this episode but maybe

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,760
 it's not the right episode for your Monday but Zach I'm gonna toss you the keys of the Jason

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,600
 Jalopy. We are headed out to Las Vegas Nevada. Zach Yoga's all flexible he's driving the car

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,960
 with his feet totally not hygienic but you know he is a Patreon supporter. It's November 6th 2020

21
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,040
 so incredibly recent story this just happened. We're driving through Las Vegas in front of us

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,400
 is a car driven by J. Kwan Singleton. Now J. Kwan was just leaving his grandma's house. His grandma

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,520
 was taking care of one of his children and he was headed back home to a house he shares with his

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,840
 girlfriend Amanda Sharp Jefferson 26 years old and their two daughters Rose is one year old little

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,760
 Lily is two months old. As he's driving back to his house he can't wait to see his kids he can't

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,400
 wait to see his girlfriend but things haven't been going well at the house recently. Now not your

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,960
 typical domestic strife fighting over bills and stuff like that she accused him of cheating on her

28
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,840
 which that's not abnormal right I mean I'm not saying J. Kwan gets accused of it all the time

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,880
 it comes up in relationships someone gets suspicious things like that but no matter how much he

30
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:56,000
 denies that he's cheating on her she says you are in the spirit world your alter spirit wife

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,600
 is who you're cheating on me with you see there's a world right above our own that's where you're

32
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:09,120
 going to cheat on me. J. Kwan walks into his house and Amanda's just sitting on the couch

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,920
 he's just kind of walking in the house is unusually quiet he notices that Lily's bassinet

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,480
 is sitting there but as he's walking up dropping his keys trying to get settled back into his house

35
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:31,120
 he notices Lily and Rose are both in the bassinet they're stacked on top of each other so it's not

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,120
 like they're comfortably laying taken a nap they're completely prone one on top of the other

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,680
 obviously J. Kwan doesn't his brain's trying to catch up to this situation of what he's seeing

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,560
 he sees both of his daughters perfectly still in a bassinet just laying on top of each other

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,560
 he turns to Amanda and goes what's going on shhh Amanda shushes him from the couch

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,800
 Amanda what happened to my dosh

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,400
 he reaches down and touches his daughter's bodies they're cold

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,240
 he goes to call the police Amanda's trying to keep him from calling the police

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,120
 telling him no no no no no no no no no don't call the police don't call the police

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,280
 do you know how much their organs are worth she begins to talk about how much the daughter's

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,560
 organs are worth as he's looking for his phone to call an ambulance call the police to call anybody

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,800
 she begins talking about how much money they can get for their organs when rescue personnel got to

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:44,080
 the house they overheard her talking about selling the organs she got arrested obviously she got

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,280
 arrested and then the story gets even more bizarre when the cops take her in a custody they ask her

49
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,520
 so tell us what happened here and she goes i don't know and they go ma'am we know that you murdered

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,520
 your two daughters just tell us what happened you'll get that weight off your chest people want to

51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,000
 confess and she looked at them and said i don't have any daughters i don't know who that man was

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,760
 who walked into my apartment i live alone never seen him before police kind of look at each other

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,440
 her story is that basically she's from an alternate reality she said that she's been living in her

54
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,120
 apartment alone all this time and then one day she walked into her living room and there were two

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,040
 bodies in a bassinet now that story okay so i'm leaving some stuff out that story in and of itself

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,800
 because let me just say that story in and of itself is is very disturbing

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,880
 it's very there's four multiple reasons one i can't imagine what that father is going through

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,800
 and all the family is going through to think that um somebody that you loved and had kids with killed

59
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 those kids that's the worst crime like killing your parents it's pretty bad like if i had to

60
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,680
 rate them if i had to rate a family side killing your parents it's like uh you know at a certain

61
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,920
 point you know saying all kids are destined to kill their parents but that's actually isn't that

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,240
 part of the motto myth like first you kill your parents then you kill your teacher then you kill

63
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,680
 god that's kind of like the evolution of man i'm not saying literally saying start banging on the

64
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,240
 gates of heaven or kill your parents don't start on that first step but like fighting your parents

65
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,040
 whatever oh i guess there's even fighting and killing them but don't kill your parents that's

66
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,520
 not what i'm saying but if someone told me that they killed their parents i'd be like what did

67
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,320
 they do to deserve it and hopefully there was a good answer hopefully it wasn't asking questions

68
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,120
 like what did they do to deserve it siblings killing each other it's pretty rough right it's a little

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,040
 more just a little more understandable again not advocating it i'm saying on the list of killing

70
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,640
 like if i had to rank them if i had to rank them killing your kids would be the worst is what i'm

71
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,320
 saying that was all leading up killing your kids would be the worst because you're that guardian

72
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,040
 you're that person who's taking care of them who created them and then but you know like siblings

73
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,880
 killing each other it's still horrible and then you killing your parents it's still horrible

74
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,800
 don't get me this is not i'm not starting an advocacy group but there's something just so

75
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,160
 despicable about killing your own children and then the things that that father must be going

76
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,640
 through is absolutely awful so we have that we just have this the sheer circumstances of it

77
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,560
 when we look at it through a paranormal lens we look at it though what if this would explain

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,920
 let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second what if this would explain why people

79
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,280
 are caught at crime scenes or people 100 believe they're guilty there's a bunch of evidence leading

80
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,560
 them to be guilty but they're not guilty like they're actually found not guilty or 20 years later

81
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,240
 evidence comes out that shows they're not guilty it's because they actually came from an alternate

82
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,520
 universe now hear me out hear me out or not or totally dismiss me but my point is is that

83
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,920
 what if like let's say oj simpson for example right immediately like that's a terrible example

84
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,240
 let's say oj simpson for example let's say that he the the oj of universe prime that's our universe

85
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,720
 because we're the best universe oj simpson of universe prime did murder nicole brown and uh what

86
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,160
 was the goldman uh i don't remember his first name but oj simpson of universe prime killed brown

87
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,640
 and goldman and then just disappeared then just fell through a wormhole and a you would be indistinguishable

88
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:45,120
 the oj simpson from universe 897 came through that same portal and was like out out of the crime

89
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,720
 scene he just stand there he's like uh oh and then uh but he's found not guilty because let's say he

90
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,520
 didn't appear at the crime scene let's say like say he appeared at a boutique or something like that

91
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,040
 then he was nowhere near there and that way he'd have the alibi but the cops could go we found

92
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,280
 all this evidence half of it we manufactured but there's evidence here or there's people that you

93
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,640
 know the cops know are absolutely guilty but their dna is different and they get set free like the

94
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,320
 cops are like we know that was the guy we have all this evidence maybe not dna evidence because that

95
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,240
 can fix a lot of people but they go we found the same type of fiber in his car and the jury's like

96
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,880
 nope they're not guilty what if you so what if your dna is different in another universe so if

97
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,240
 jason from universe prime this one interacted with jason from universe 1257 would we have the same

98
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,920
 i don't know how we're interacting we're playing ping pong and throwing skin flakes everywhere

99
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,120
 would our dna be the same it's creepy and again the crime itself is absolutely inhumane i don't

100
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,240
 want to minimize that but again with our conspiracy caps on paranormal view of looking at this

101
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,560
 she sees this alternate reality and she may have slipped in she's this basically the

102
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,760
 amanda in universe prime here she did she wasn't married in this other universe and she's walking

103
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,120
 around this apartment and she's like oh my god like there's i don't know who these children are but

104
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,320
 they're dead i don't know what's going on that story is creepy now i did leave out some key details

105
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,560
 because it totally would have ruined that ending she did she does say that she does 100 say that

106
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,440
 she just she does not marry to this guy she doesn't know who these kids are she walked into her house

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
 one day and she found these two lifeless kids in her basket the stuff i left out is after she saw

108
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,880
 that she went to take a shower and then went and sat on the couch and the cops are like if your

109
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,120
 story is true why did you take a shower so that kind of throws a little i don't want to say water

110
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,680
 because then that's a pun but that throws a little bit of you know milk and the honey on that one because

111
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,080
 if you walked in your house if you did come from an alternate reality and walked home and there was

112
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,280
 a crime scene there you want to be like oh i can't do anything about that time to take a shower

113
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,200
 obviously you would call the police also what's totally she could probably argue probably argue

114
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
 an insanity defense and they could say yeah you know it was just really hard to win on but she

115
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,840
 could they could say yeah she thought that she'd come from an alternate reality and that would be

116
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,720
 a wouldn't be a great defense you'd lose but she didn't even stick to that story because as the

117
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,680
 cops are investigating her and she's saying i don't know who those kids are i don't know who this guy

118
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,840
 is i just came home and found these bodies as the cops are investigating her she goes hey you

119
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,480
 guys are in law enforcement right they're like yeah yeah we are and she goes do you know how much i

120
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,360
 can sell their organs for cops you're like what so even then like even if she did come from an

121
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,480
 alternate reality for some reason she wants to sell people's organs she said she saw it in a movie

122
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
 she said she saw a movie where she found out organs were expensive so

123
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,280
 i'm that creepy it's funny the other day i was talking to pom pomeran on twitter

124
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,400
 pom posted a survey about who's hotter who didn't want a date or something like that and it was

125
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,440
 shigo from kim possible and then it was some girl from danie phantom i actually might cover this

126
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,040
 coming up but pom pomeran reminded me of this there was this guy who doesn't like buttholes

127
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,120
 he hated buttholes and he was in love with danie phantom not danie phantom himself but the girls

128
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,680
 from danie phantom and he would draw pictures of himself in the world of danie phantom and he

129
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:30,320
 hated buttholes so much he shot up a grocery store and then killed himself because he thought once he

130
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,600
 died he'd go into a world full of no one would have a butthole and everyone would be from danie phantom

131
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,840
 so i might do a whole episode on that i think he has a manifesto if i can find his manifesto i'd

132
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,720
 love to dive into that i've always loved doing that on the show i've only done it once but i

133
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,880
 read the manifesto again i think he has one if he did i read it years ago i love reading stuff like

134
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:01,280
 that and um yeah but anyways the point is is that it's crazy to think and that's probably a poor choice

135
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,160
 of words but it's crazy to think i'm just gonna do it again it's crazy to think that you can have

136
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,880
 someone who's already teetering on insanity and then they watch the wrong show and it fully

137
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,920
 see ments that insane world view like had the guy who was shooting i'll put it in the show notes

138
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,360
 i'll put it in the show notes if you can't wait for my episode on it it'll probably be next week

139
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,640
 but if that guy had not seen danie phantom if he had said watch tenage mutinousia turtles would he

140
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,880
 have tried to focus his energy into being a superhero i don't know i don't know i mean i guess

141
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,760
 anything would be better it'd be better if he just watched dragnet and just decided to be a cop or

142
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,600
 just watched nothing decided not to be crazy but it's creepy to think this woman watched a movie

143
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,280
 watched some random movie where someone was saying oh you know how much money we can get for these

144
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:56,800
 organs and that was the key that unlocked this horrific horrible plan kyle yogi you ready to

145
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,360
 take us out of here he's he's not in his head enthusiastically yeah i know it's a grim story

146
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,280
 it's especially a grim story for a monday but tomorrow's episode has something even grosser

147
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:13,120
 it's maybe not as grim but it's way grosser so i feel bad for the patreon the guy who supported

148
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,280
 the patreon for tomorrow uh zack gonna have a good laugh at that one zack go ahead and call in that

149
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:26,880
 carbonar copter we are leaving behind las vegas and avada and we are headed out to tulsa oklahoma

150
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,720
 rainstorm lightning and thunder kyle is perfectly cut zack i think i called you kyle

151
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:45,120
 i think i called you kyle a second ago so if i add in zack zack we'll edit those up and zack is

152
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,160
 flying us expertly through this rainstorm we're headed to tulsa oklahoma to meet a young girl

153
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,680
 named melissa helicopter lands uh we're running out on our raincoach you run a raincoat right you're

154
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,640
 like i didn't know he's gonna storm this episode we run and we pick the lock and now we're in melissa's

155
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,320
 house she didn't invite us she doesn't know the stories going on melissa h was living with her dad

156
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,160
 in this house in tulsa oklahoma and she had heard stories that it was haunted she got a feeling that

157
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,040
 it was haunted it was just one of those creepy places and she did what i consider one of the most

158
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:31,760
 unforgivable sins i hate doing it i do it if i'm too easy to get up she sleeps with the closet door

159
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:41,760
 open it's not a cat it's not her cat trying to get in her bed that's the door slowly swaying back

160
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,360
 and forth she probably should get that checked out doors aren't supposed to do that but anyways

161
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,800
 she wakes up one night her room is pitch black in the closet though she sees someone standing there

162
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,640
 no someone hanging there who she describes in her closet is a teenage girl wearing a white wedding

163
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:12,240
 dress this figure in the closet her whole body is spazming every muscle every joint every limb

164
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,760
 looking like it's the middle of some sort of musculature fit melissa is sitting in bed and she's

165
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,560
 too scared to scream she's just looking at this specter twitching in the darkness of her closet

166
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,440
 she jumps out of bed and she has to walk by her closet poorly designed poorly designed bedroom

167
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,720
 she jumps out of bed and she has to walk by her closet to get out of the room the whole time

168
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,480
 she has her eyes on the ghost even as she's reaching back to turn the knob to get out

169
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,040
 she can't stop looking at the girl the whole time this teenage girl in the closet her entire body

170
00:16:51,040 --> 00:17:01,680
 is convulsing the whole time she's staring straight into melissa's eyes here's another one we

171
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,920
 like oh that wasn't too scary here's another one zack let's hop back in that carbonicopter we are

172
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,160
 headed out to actually I don't have a location this one we'll just say this one's across the street

173
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,240
 it's a really really haunted neighborhood so we get in the carbonicopter we fly we fly 30 feet we

174
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:25,600
 land we're now at the house of another young girl let's call this one rebecca because we don't have

175
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,320
 a name this story actually came from mysterious universe they got it from true ghost tales rebecca

176
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:43,120
 is sitting on the couch watching tv with her mom and all of a sudden they hear screaming

177
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 they recognize the screaming it's her father so they jump up now the dad is an alcoholic so apparently

178
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,880
 he screams all the time so there's that it wasn't like they're like oh no right away but as it continued

179
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,400
 on they're like okay we should probably go check on him it's a commercial break on the show let's go

180
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,520
 check on him no they don't know where the screaming is coming from so they're kind of walking around

181
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,400
 the house probably taking their time honestly they're like dad where are you eventually they

182
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:16,640
 trace the screaming into rebecca's bedroom then they trace the screaming into rebecca's closet

183
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,280
 they hear the sound of her father screaming on the other side of this closet door now

184
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,520
 even though he's an alcoholic not all alcoholics scream that's a stereotype that i've just invented

185
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,840
 but there's a difference running through the house or just sitting there and getting mad at the game

186
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,840
 and throwing stuff around it's not great behavior either versus being in a closet screaming it's

187
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,840
 definitely more creepy they go to open the closet door rattle rattle rattle rattle rattle rattle the

188
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,120
 knob won't turn the door is stuck the mom's using all of her weight she finally opens the door and

189
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,600
 they're in the closet is their father which is what they expected they didn't expect the rest of

190
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:06,000
 this paragraph he was floating in midair hanging it seemed by his neck for a few seconds this doesn't

191
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,800
 go by it's not like a flash it's not like he jumped up right before they opened the door and he's all

192
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 ta-da for a few seconds they're actually looking at this adult man hover in the air like he's being

193
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:26,080
 hung or held up by something finally he falls to the ground he scrambles to his feet but get out

194
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,760
 of the way women and he runs out of the bedroom to hide in another corner of the house now the

195
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,120
 daughter and the mom go to follow him and they're like what was that that's not what we expected

196
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,200
 we were watching charles in charge and we got this since then he said what happened was he was

197
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,760
 walking through the house he's thinking what am i going to scream about tonight i'm just the right

198
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,200
 amount of drunk i need to start my screaming soon it's almost 7 p.m he's walking through the house

199
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,080
 he's walking through the house he walks into rebecca's room and he watches the closet door open

200
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:06,800
 he said he heard something begin to call his name i didn't make up a name for him so the thing is

201
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:17,120
 going dad daddy papa papa come here kind of stunts him for a second because he didn't expect to

202
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,880
 hear that he also didn't expect the closet to go daddy he's like dude my name's robert the next thing

203
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,360
 he knows a dark figure darted out of the closet and then he blacked out next thing he knows the

204
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 closet doors opening up his family is looking at him stunned a few days later rebecca's sitting on

205
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
 the couch i don't know why they haven't moved at this point right rebecca's sitting on the couch

206
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,000
 and she said the whole light was on and it was the way that the house was structured was that

207
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,160
 you could look down the hallway which is one of the creepiest things possible ever looking down a

208
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,400
 hallway you look down the hallway and see into her bedroom and she said she looked down the hallway

209
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,160
 and the whole the hallway light was on the whole place was lit up she says her parents are only

210
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,680
 about 10 feet away from her in this story so i don't know if that means they were in a separate

211
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,840
 room or if they were in the same room just 10 feet away i don't know how small this house was

212
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,600
 she said her parents are only about 10 feet away she sees like in a flash a dark figure

213
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,240
 standing in her bedroom doorway it reaches its arm out and begins to beckon her to him

214
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,120
 she opens her mouth to scream nothing comes out it's interesting because that happened to melissa

215
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,840
 as well she starts to scream she's trying to scream but nothing will come out she turns her head

216
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,120
 looking for some sort of help and when she turns back the figure is right next to her it's sitting

217
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,320
 on the couch she feels a hand wrap around her neck this demon kisses her forehead kisses her neck

218
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,000
 disappears rebecca said her family had not seen the thing since they'd never seen it again

219
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,960
 but she does say whenever she's in a dark room she feels like she's not alone

220
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,440
 so super spooky story obviously i did leave something out of that story as well though

221
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,960
 because i don't i don't know if this adds to the spookiness or if it makes she kind of roll

222
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,080
 your eyes but i don't want to ruin the narrative but i did want to include it so the next day in

223
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,120
 between those two events right there's a little prequel for you here's a little prequel for you

224
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,560
 or uh jason why'd you ruin that story the next day so first time the dad's being hung the third time

225
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,920
 it jumps out this is the jump scare real-life jump scare on the couch but in between the two events

226
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:30,160
 the next morning after the dad was hanging in the closet they went into her room and they opened the

227
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:46,320
 closet door and inside and inside and inside and inside was a vampire was a vampire so

228
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,800
 i love that part out because it's so dumb it totally ruins the story this is what they next day

229
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,360
 they these are my notes next day they checked out the closet they saw a man standing in there

230
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,840
 his hands over his chest like Dracula when he sleeps he had long fingernails and he had wings

231
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,120
 and he was sleeping because it was daytime it was the next day and then they closed the

232
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,040
 closet door like what do you do after that anyways that's that part makes it totally

233
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,920
 ruins the story right anyways forget about shut the door on that part of the story as well totally

234
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,320
 ruins it the reason why i wanted to cover this is because closets are super super spooky but i

235
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,600
 didn't want to end it with just telling you some spooky stories one that involves a movie vampire

236
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,000
 i fought to suck your blood that was the part that she cut out because even she knew that was

237
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,960
 ridiculous the question isn't are closets scary they are scary i'm sure one or two of you guys

238
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,200
 will be like well closets aren't scary i work in a closet repair shop and i've never seen a ghost

239
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
 and you're actually a ghost you didn't know that you've been a ghost for a hundred years but for

240
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,760
 the most part most rational people think closets are scary so i wanted to tell a couple scary

241
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,480
 ghost stories involving closets but then i wanted to talk about why are closets spooky actually

242
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,520
 looked into the science behind closets being spooky it's interesting i didn't find any science on it

243
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,280
 at all but i did find a website called magic for the real world and so it's like the reverse of

244
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,800
 science magic is the reverse of science so this counts as scientific there's been a lot of studies

245
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,400
 on doors that's actually true i'll see if i can find it for the show notes but there was a study a

246
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,960
 long time ago that when you know how when you walk through a door and you forget what you were trying

247
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
 to do you're like what was i gonna do what was i gonna do oh yeah i was behind in this closet and

248
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,640
 be a vampire you walk through a door you go to get your keys you forget what you're in there for

249
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,040
 you can't figure it out you're like why am i in this room all that stuff i've actually done studies

250
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,840
 on that of why that happens the answer is they don't know the scientists don't know but what's

251
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,120
 weird is they can actually do it virtually they said you can set someone up at a computer

252
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,480
 and if they press a button and a virtual door opens it actually degrades their memory there is

253
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,400
 something about passing through thresholds that makes people forget why they are in there that

254
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,400
 doesn't make sense at all did cavemen do it when they were walking in one cave they're like oh me

255
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,600
 og me no no why i'm here they're like do we only have three things we have a club we have saber

256
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,320
 two tiger meat and we have a this chalk to ride on a cave he's like me still not know at what point

257
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,520
 if i'm walking through a forest and there are two trees their branches come over and make an arc

258
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,240
 or an arch however you pronounce it and i walk through those while i forget why i'm in the forest

259
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,040
 so at what point is a doorway a doorway like does it actually it doesn't actually have to

260
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,440
 have a door because in the vr you can do it so at what point like if i crawled through a hole if i

261
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,920
 was crawling through a tunnel i keep forgetting why i'm in there like why am i in here why am i in

262
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,240
 here why am i in here every foot like at what point is a doorway a doorway so that's weird that's

263
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,920
 just a weird scientific thing and a big philosophical question as well if you cut a hole in the wall

264
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,040
 and crawl through it is that a doorway technically it's an area of transition but if you took the

265
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,640
 forest that example or if you had like a broken down gazebo it's just one side it's just one side

266
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,560
 and you walk through the gazeb I don't need to keep making examples you guys get it at what point is

267
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:21,040
 a door not a door because otherwise you shouldn't have any doors at all or any archways and nothing

268
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,120
 submarines submarines just have to they're basically boats you can't have little hatches on them

269
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,360
 that's the last thing you don't climb in a hatch and they're like what am i doing on here they're

270
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,760
 like look out torpedoes are hitting them but my point being is those are that's weird just the

271
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,520
 idea of doors is super spooky but uh back to reality magic for the real world website they say

272
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,840
 that an area of transition is actually exactly what it sounds like you're moving from one room

273
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:58,800
 to another but anytime you have an area of transition it's not just for us that doorway you built

274
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:06,880
 also allows anything else to transition through that doorway see that that wouldn't make sense

275
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,840
 about like haunted woods because you'd have ponds that would basically be a transition spot between

276
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,080
 the earth and the water archways and trees groves circles of rocks all of these would be

277
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,720
 transitional areas any area of transitions can allow these creatures to come through magic for the

278
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,280
 real world had a pretty simple solution for this what you need to do is you need to remove

279
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,760
 as many transitional areas as possible which is unless you live in a yurt is impossible because

280
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,480
 again even if you removed your door you're still going to walk through it they're not they're not

281
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,560
 requiring you to remove your doors but they are saying to limit them as much as possible they said

282
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,480
 rearrange furniture to minimize shadows so there's that um or you could just change your light bulbs

283
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,560
 or have no light bulbs at all i mean i guess i'm taking it to the was just thinking stream

284
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,600
 they're just saying move your couch and i'm like burn down the foundation and move your furniture

285
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,160
 around so there's less shadows they also said this and i think this is the worst advice ever

286
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,720
 leave your closet light on now i think that's a bad advice for two reasons one must closets

287
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,520
 don't have lights but let's say that you went out and got a light bulb for your closet i think it's

288
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,720
 creepy you're honestly i hate this is one of the things i hate because i'm laying down to go to bed

289
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,000
 if i leave a light on in another room which i'll do for different reasons i have i have my reasons

290
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,040
 i leave a light on in the other room i'm going to bed i can see that thin strip of light i'm always

291
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,600
 worried i'm gonna look and i'm gonna see feet stand in there you're like you're like chaston

292
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:49,760
 so you're so you're saying there is an off chance that one time you may look over and see feet standing

293
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,560
 outside your door because the light there but the alternative is to have monsters giant monsters

294
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,680
 floating around in the darkness waiting for you monsters that look like universal pictures vampires

295
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,760
 that's your choice is a pair of boots a pair of boots outside your bedroom door or some sort of

296
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,840
 hellish monster yeah but i don't see that see the monster plus i think if i was a ghost it'd be a

297
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,960
 lot easier to just manifest my feet so if i wanted to scare myself i would just be feet i mean

298
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
 that'd be terrifying anyways right you're sitting there eating lunch you just see feet sitting on

299
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,040
 your table seeing a full body like standing there would be super scary but i'm imagining that it

300
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,640
 takes a lot of work takes a lot it takes a lot of spiritual work to get your body in shape so

301
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,000
 you could either manifest your entire body after maybe a hundred years or you should just be feet

302
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,360
 today be feet today and if you could just easily be feet then you could just appear outside my door

303
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,000
 but as you get ready for bed tonight make sure that your closet door is locked possibly barricaded

304
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,880
 shut make sure that your feet aren't hanging off the bed and the blanket covers you from

305
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,720
 toe to neck and just keep an eye on that old rickety closet door you might think that with it

306
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,720
 locked there's no chance of anything getting out to hurt you but is it really possible for two inches

307
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:21,200
 of wood to hold back the might of a dark spirit we tell ourselves that these things will protect us

308
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,920
 so we can get a good night's sleep but in the end that door opens and while you have a restless

309
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:36,480
 sleep it stands over you and watches it's just waiting for the right moment to make you disappear

310
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,400
 from the world of the living
