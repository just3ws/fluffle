00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
 mysterious fortress in the middle of the desert. Crows can't tell the difference

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,680
 between the living and the dead and we take a quick look at some mysterious

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,200
 footage shot in the catacombs under Paris today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,400
 host Jason Carpenter. Hope you guys are having a great day. I'm having a great

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,480
 day. It's really really hot but you know I'm just staying hydrated drinking a

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,240
 bunch of water. I used to hate drinking water. I just couldn't you know I was I

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,320
 don't know what it was. I know a lot of people complain that water has no taste

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,880
 and it doesn't have a taste. It's funny because it technically has to have a taste

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,960
 but maybe the taste particles are so spread out. It's like one taste particle

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,680
 per million or something like that. But yeah I'm not a fan of water but I've

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,840
 recently been drinking it a lot and it is really good for you. You guys are

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,300
 probably like of course it's good it's good for you but as an adult male who's

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,000
 gone most of his life without drinking water it's a I have to admit it's pretty

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,200
 good for you. I don't sweat a lot and I was telling that to someone the other day

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,640
 and they go oh you're so special I was like no I don't sweat because not because

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
 of anything special because I'm constantly dehydrated. I don't have

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,120
 enough liquid in my body to come out of my pores. My body's like a laptop with

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,880
 the fan not working. I think it's constantly overheating. So now that I've

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
 been drinking more water I've been getting a little bit of sweat a little bit of

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,640
 sweat going on you know on my forehead. No CNC music factory level but it's a

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,080
 bit different. It's a bit different for me. I used to drink a gallon of Kool-Aid a

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:54,280
 day and when I in let me when I was 35 years old not when I was a young kid

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,600
 which I drank Kool-Aid back then but probably from about 35 to around 38 I

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,240
 drank a gallon of Kool-Aid a day. I actually have a Kool-Aid man poster in my

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,380
 apartment just because I love to Kool-Aid so much and then once I went to the

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,960
 doctor and we were talking about weight loss and I told him I drank a gallon of

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,080
 Kool-Aid a day and he laughed not just at that and I kind of realized I was like

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,800
 that's kind of weird that he laughed at that and he caught himself really

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,720
 quickly after we talked and did the whole visit thing. I wasn't there for the

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,280
 weight loss or something else going on but we were sitting there talking he

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,240
 goes hey you know I can tell you're kind of a funny guy you can take a joke I'm

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,640
 gonna go ahead and tell you what I was laughing about earlier. Now at the time

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,200
 my hair was real my hair I have is I kind of have crazy hair if I don't do

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,360
 anything with it if it's not like shaved down it just kind of grows in every

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,320
 direction and he goes when you said you drink a gallon of Kool-Aid a day the

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,640
 reason I laughed was because you reminded me of the Hawaiian punch guy and I

38
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,760
 laughed because that was funny and it was pretty true so yeah and it's you know

39
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,560
 it's always good to have a rapport with a doctor like that he's not my regular

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,880
 doctor unfortunately but I think he's moved on a lot of times the doctors at

41
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,080
 little clinics end up getting better paying jobs at hospitals so good for him

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,920
 good for him I hope he keeps his sense of humor and I hope he runs into a lot of

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,200
 other patients with their sense of humor probably not because they're seeing them

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,000
 because they're really sick. So the first story we're going to cover tonight is

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,960
 recently made the news but the study had been going on for maybe two years so

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,320
 there was a case of well it's no one in science that crows will often hold

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,640
 funerals for other crows and they've always kind of wanted to understand the

48
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,920
 phenomenon now crows are incredibly intelligent they've done so many studies

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:51,800
 on crows where crows will remember you as an enemy for like up to two years there

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,720
 was a guy and I think it was even longer than that there is this professor who was

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,480
 throwing rocks at crow for whatever reason for science I guess and then the

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,480
 crows would attack him and he ended up leaving going to an eye you know what's

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,120
 funny I'm gonna tell you the story and I honestly probably can't back it up I

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
 don't know if I can ever find this article again but the scientist was

55
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,520
 throwing I'm assuming he's a scientist was throwing rocks at crows on his

56
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,320
 college campus he ended up getting a job in another college campus he came

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
 back years later to visit some friends he got attacked by crows he'd gotten

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,800
 attacked by crows the whole time he was working there which made him want to

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,320
 throw more rocks but even after he left and came back the crows remembered him

60
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
 and continued to attack them they've done studies where people have been mean

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,040
 to crows and then other people have had worn worn masks of the person who was

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,960
 mean to crows and the crows attacked them again I'll see if I can find those

63
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,120
 links to prove what I just said I'll see if I can find that information but if

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,760
 you don't see the links then you'll just have to take my word for that but

65
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,240
 anyway so they have observed crows holding funerals and one of the one of

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,160
 the hypotheses is that the crows aren't necessarily mourning the dead what it is

67
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,800
 is they know that there's an enemy in the area so they're trying to figure out

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,120
 what killed it they're trying to do a little bird CSI for cause scene

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,600
 anyways there's there's anyways so they try to figure out what killed it so they

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
 won't die themselves so they don't necessarily know if it's like a funeral

71
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,560
 like releasing the bird spirit to heaven so this scientist got together with this

72
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,280
 film crew and she's like oh we're gonna have this I'm gonna run this experiment

73
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,240
 you guys can be there and you can record the birds having the funeral so the

74
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,960
 camera crew gets there and they put out this fake what's a real bird but it's

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,360
 dead and it's stuffed they put it in the road and another crow flies down looks

76
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,480
 at it and begins to hump it begins to try to dry hump it and the scientist is

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,440
 like that is not what that's not what they're supposed to do so for two years

78
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,360
 she was taking these stuffed crows and leaving them around the Pacific Northwest

79
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,840
 I think it was in Portland actually maybe Seattle but anyways and out of 4% of all

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,240
 the case she does like 200 times or something like that out of 4% of these

81
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,640
 cases the bird had sex with the dead bird and in one case the dead bird was there

82
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,840
 and then two birds came down and started banging each other in front of the

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,280
 dead bird and what her hypothesis is that it's tends to happen during mating

84
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,240
 season and she goes it's not because there's not enough mates to go around

85
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,040
 she even saw one time that a bird's mate was in the area and the bird still came

86
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,480
 and banged the dead body so it's like cucking with a dead bird which has to

87
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,520
 be the ultimate form of cuckoldry but she says that when they're mating system

88
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,720
 their brains actually aren't working right because in some of the cases the

89
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,840
 birds would attack the corpse and in most of the cases the birds would go down and

90
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,680
 try to figure out what's going on so she thinks that when mating season comes

91
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,920
 around the birds the wiring is mixed up in their brain and so they don't know how

92
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 to react they want to figure out the danger they want to attack it as a as

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,400
 a interloper into their area and they want to have sex with it like all things

94
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,480
 are coming together yeah so now it's part of crow science that four percent of

95
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,320
 these dead birds will get molested at some point and it just you know four

96
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,400
 percent is such a small percentage that it probably wasn't seen and if somebody

97
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,440
 did just see it you know a lay person would be like oh that birds just kind of

98
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,400
 jumping around that other bird because birds don't have penises I guess they

99
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,520
 just like rubbed their vents against each other it was funny too because this

100
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,120
 scientist she got the cops called on her a couple times because all the people in

101
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
 the neighborhood would see is a woman go and set down a dead crow and then

102
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,120
 retreat to the bushes with a pair of binoculars so people in the neighborhood

103
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
 were quite nervous of why she was doing all of this stuff but I just thought that

104
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
 was an interesting story it popped up oh and the pun obviously is I didn't make

105
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
 this up it was in the scientists actually put this in her paper which was

106
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,440
 great putting the crow in necrophilia that's if you if there's no if there's

107
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,120
 a Nobel Prize for great great scientific phrases that's the one that might

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,600
 have even actually been the name of her paper honestly the second story was an

109
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
 interesting one because I was researching something off the conspiracy

110
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,960
 list called Colgate forts and I actually found out what that was we're gonna do

111
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,080
 another story on that and it's the Colgate forts itself well I just tell you

112
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,680
 right now it's Russian soldiers went to Siberia and to they were like soldiers

113
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,960
 fleeing the purge the purges the Stalinist purges and they actually made

114
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,120
 forts out of Colgate toothpaste to live in and I you're thinking okay well

115
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,200
 that's the end of that story the story actually gets more fascinating than that

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,520
 but while I went and we'll say that for another episode but while I was researching

117
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:10,600
 Colgate forts I came across just this mind-boggling mind-bogglingly weird slash

118
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,000
 like it's like this weird mystery that not only doesn't have any answers but it

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,840
 seems like nobody wants any answers this is a real place you can find it on

120
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,200
 Google Earth it's historical place it's called and I might be getting the

121
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,440
 pronounciation pronunciation pronunciation wrong and it's called

122
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,440
 Rani Kot fort or Rani Kot or a in in I'm not gonna spell for you but anyways so

123
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,720
 this is in Pakistan so you're thinking oh you know there's a fort in Pakistan

124
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,760
 what does it have ghosts is it full of cryptids no it's known as if not the

125
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,440
 largest fort ever constructed on the planet Earth it's like in the second

126
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 place there's been some dispute over whether or not this one in Pakistan is

127
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,920
 bigger or one in India is bigger and of course there's a dispute because they

128
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,880
 hate each other but this fort and using the fort is kind of a weird phrase

129
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:15,800
 because it's actually a 19 mile long perimeter of these massive walls and it

130
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,480
 goes up into this hill range and it comes down it's because it's on people say

131
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
 it's the it's like the Great Wall of China it's just this massive fortress in

132
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,240
 Pakistan and so it's just sitting there in the desert there's been a little bit

133
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,760
 of restoration work but not recently and it's free to visit here's the thing no

134
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,200
 one knows when it was built no one knows who built it and no one knows why it was

135
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,360
 built so you're going oh you know okay fine some Mesopotamians built some stone

136
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,320
 structure you know 10,000 years ago big whoop you know of course we're not

137
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,360
 gonna know this structure was built any time between the 9th and the 18th

138
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,080
 century they don't know and their people are going as probably built in the 17th

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,520
 century 17th century we have documents still from the 17th century you're

140
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,640
 telling me one of the world we're just gonna call it the world's largest fort

141
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:21,440
 the world's largest fort was built in the 1700s and we don't know who it is at

142
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,160
 first I thought okay we don't know who it is it was probably some like a Syrian

143
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,560
 warlord no and I know those groups aren't in Pakistan but those are just

144
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,080
 the ones I know off the top of my head and I can pronounce because the names in

145
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,280
 these articles I can't pronounce 1700s they built a 19 mile long fort

146
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:47,800
 white's perimeter fort and nobody knows why who built it no documents no poems

147
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,680
 about it no legends about it it's simply there they don't know who built it

148
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,000
 their theories ranging from this group I can't pronounce to that group I can't

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,960
 pronounce to Greeks to the here I'll try to pronounce this one because this is the

150
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,720
 most recent one the talpers yeah the other ones are okay the parthas

151
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,400
 Parthenons yeah I can't say most of these but anyways so most recent evidence

152
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,960
 says that it originated under the talpers it costs 1.2 million rupees to

153
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,560
 build these are all things that they can estimate just from like the size of it

154
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,840
 there's three little forts inside of it and it was just massive undertaking

155
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,920
 it's in the middle of nowhere people go there's nothing defensive in that area

156
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,280
 that word would require someone to build such a massive fort it's not a

157
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,160
 strategic choke point it's not a resource point it's not near anything

158
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:51,200
 here nowadays so why was it built why was it built and if it was built so

159
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,360
 recently how can we have no information the one theory I could find was that the

160
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,440
 reason why we don't have much information on who built it and you know

161
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,600
 it's just sitting there and it's been named like a World Heritage site

162
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,520
 Pakistani government's really not doing anything to keep it up all the rest last

163
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,840
 of the restoration happened in the 18th century so even then they were still

164
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,880
 working on it still fixing it up they're still massive doors it's amazing but

165
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,160
 the theory is is that the group that they believe built it or think built it

166
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,440
 is a different religion or a different royal dynasty from the current one and

167
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,240
 they want the current one wants to seem like they're the greatest and they don't

168
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
 want to give any credence to other groups and that's possible I mean people are

169
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
 petty like that but I just think it's amazing that something could be built so

170
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,000
 recently that we have no information on if this thing had been hundreds and

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,880
 hundreds of years old I can understand we don't have any information we come

172
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,720
 across that like we'll find mounds in America we'll find structures and

173
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,640
 scientists are like we don't really know who built it we think it's some sort of

174
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,360
 burial mound but we're not entirely for sure it could be this tribe it could be

175
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 this tribe but they didn't have any written records this was far past the

176
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,240
 this was far past the time where people are having rented written records people

177
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,880
 have having printing presses people have already at this point circumnavigated

178
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,640
 the globe 17th 18th century is far far far too recent to have no information on

179
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,480
 this thing and the weird thing is this no one's out there steady in it the

180
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,440
 articles I read said it seems relatively safe there's not a lot of bandits in the

181
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,720
 area but there's no police but we have scientists going into the Middle East

182
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,280
 going in you know in war zones that have just started to cool down to look at

183
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,920
 artifacts and this place is just sitting there who knows what's there who knows

184
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,440
 what to find now that being said I have a theory why would you build a fortress

185
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,680
 in the middle of nowhere zombies I have a theory and it's I have nothing to back

186
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,880
 this up but what if we had a zombie infestation and early human history and

187
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,280
 I'm thinking like bubonic plate times dark ages times and this is kind of my

188
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:07,320
 kind of my guess to that in all over the world when we look at royal soldiers like

189
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,440
 the high-level soldiers a lot of times they had padded armor but in Europe the

190
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,560
 soldiers were decked out in metal the knights the knights that we all know of

191
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,080
 if you're fighting zombies what do you want do you want padded armor that maybe

192
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,240
 they can bite through or do you want to be encased in steel I don't know if it's

193
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
 actually steel but do you want to be encased in metal what if hear me out

194
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,040
 what if the bubonic plate existed but it was actually a zombie virus and that's

195
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,040
 what caused one-third of the world's population to decline and the only thing

196
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,080
 you could do to stop it was to send knights out to just bash in infected

197
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,040
 peasants heads and the thing is it's like any writings of that of people dying

198
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,840
 of this horrible disease and coming back and and moving throughout this

199
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,400
 civilization of northern Europe and people fighting these things all of

200
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,320
 that stuff would just be chalked up to religious superstition they'd go no no

201
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,360
 no no that was just an actual plague and look under a microscope and this is

202
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,440
 what a bug looks like and blah blah blah maybe the bubonic plague because we

203
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,720
 still have the bubonic plague around again I just realized that we actually

204
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,280
 know what the bubonic plague is because it's still an issue and like but anyway

205
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,680
 so we don't have zombies that we know of but what if that was the core reason

206
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,640
 why knights were encased in all metal now as much as I love that theory I do have

207
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,600
 to throw a little assault on that fire I don't know if that's a phrase but you

208
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,840
 know the knights did exist long before the black plague came into town but but I

209
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,360
 did find out that in 100 AD 15 million people died in Europe and they don't

210
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,280
 know why they they think it's because of like global cooling or global warming

211
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,480
 and the crops all dying but maybe it's zombies so how does this play into rain

212
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,680
 caught for it in the 17th century maybe there are zombies out in the middle of

213
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,320
 desert maybe someone opened like a gin or a some sort of I jins don't exist in

214
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,920
 Pakistan assuming they exist at all but maybe there was some sort of unholy

215
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,560
 force that came out and they had to build this giant fort to fight him like

216
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,960
 that movie the Great Wall which nobody saw I don't think anybody saw that movie

217
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,880
 but I think it's in the tristitory and honestly that theory okay they built that

218
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,720
 fort to fight zombies or to some sort of supernatural force a that theory is

219
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,760
 just as valid as any other one because actually okay it's not as valid as any

220
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,000
 other one but it's the only theory put forward most people are like yeah we

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,880
 don't know why it was built and I've read multiple articles on this and it's

222
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
 frustrating because it's a mystery I think could be solved they could go out

223
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,640
 there and say oh this guy thought the land was holy and built this fort or

224
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,560
 this land actually was some sort of strategic choke point at that time but

225
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,680
 it's just nothing there's no investigation into this fort at all

226
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,880
 that's what makes it such a huge mystery you know we cover a lot of stuff on the

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,600
 show that just can get easily debunked but I can't find anything for why this

228
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,320
 fort exists or really anything to say why people aren't researching it science

229
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
 it's just stuff's coming up and they're like yeah scientists aren't really

230
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,760
 interested why not archaeologists other people who study old stuff so look that

231
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,480
 up look up rainy caught fort and if you're an archaeologist you're looking

232
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,000
 for a thesis subject maybe you just found one we're gonna wrap this up really

233
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,520
 quickly you guys may have seen this before this video originally got deleted

234
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,440
 and now it's back up it's super bizarre on a couple different levels but it's

235
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,680
 fairly short so I'm gonna keep this part short there's a video of a man in the

236
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,840
 lost cat and the catacombs of France so underneath they had such a oh my god

237
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,400
 they had such a problem with people dying in France they had so many bodies

238
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,560
 they had to put them in caverns what if that was the victims of the zombie plague

239
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,160
 bam wrap around anyways they had such a problem with all these dead bodies they

240
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,760
 didn't know where to put them they put them in all these catacombs underneath

241
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
 Paris and so this guy is on a video camera and he's walking through the

242
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,360
 catacombs and this footage was broadcast on ABC family of all things so here

243
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,560
 let's play a quick audio clip of the Paris catacombs thing you I mean obviously

244
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,320
 you're gonna want to watch the video to get the full effect but I'll just play

245
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,600
 a little clip of it here we hear his breathing get louder and louder as though

246
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,800
 something was scaring he was he's frightened he's frightened occasionally

247
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,560
 stops perhaps to try to decide which way to run among all the many different

248
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,480
 corridors he's running faster and faster and faster and deeper and deeper into

249
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,240
 the catacombs and all of a sudden

250
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:46,520
 so I just wanted to include that because it I think it's just such a creepy video

251
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,600
 and people have said oh you know it's fake and blah blah blah but I you know I

252
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,200
 and it may be I mean the guys definitely in some sort of tunnel system people are

253
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,960
 like well if a monster was chasing him why don't we see the monster on film and

254
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,080
 I'm like well maybe it's not a monster maybe it's a ghost or maybe something

255
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,760
 crawling on the ceiling or maybe it's fake or maybe he was just having anxiety

256
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,640
 attack I mean those are probably the two most likely ones because he's underground

257
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,200
 and there's a bunch of dead bodies around him but I think it's an interesting

258
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,720
 video I hope you guys check it out I remember seeing it years ago and

259
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
 thinking it was creepy and then I had to find it again because now that I'm doing

260
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,040
 this podcast there's a couple of stories and stuff that I remember coming across

261
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,800
 early on you know years and years ago and I'm like oh that would be cool to put

262
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,840
 on the podcast a video is probably not the best thing to put on a podcast but

263
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,480
 this one has some pretty cool audio too I think you can kind of get a gist for it
