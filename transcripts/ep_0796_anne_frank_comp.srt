1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,820
 Is it possible to catch a miracle on video?

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,660
 Would you feel comfortable sleeping in the same room where a man slid his own wrists?

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,200
 And then we take a look at the absolutely bizarre story, I'm shocked I've never heard of this

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,060
 before, about a woman who is claiming she is the reincarnation of Anne Frank.

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:33,560
 Is it possible that a writer from Sweden may have proof that there truly is life after

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,160
 death today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:46,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,880
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,360
 Hope you guys have some cool plans for the week and I'm gonna go see the new Spider-Man

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,880
 movie.

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,440
 That looks cool, it's been a while since I've seen a superhero movie in the theater and

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,760
 I like Spider-Man and I guess in this movie, cause you know how they have the different

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,400
 Spider-Man like the Tobey Maguire and the Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,120
 This is the first movie where they're gonna combine the universes so for the first time

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,240
 on screen we get to see all three versions of Aunt May and they say it's like I'm ex-war

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
 of you.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,400
 Just these old women walking around and yeah, so I can't wait to see Marissa Tormey and

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,800
 the Sally Fields which they want to remember and then the old lady from the Tobey Maguire

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,920
 Aunt May and yeah, I cannot wait.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
 It'll be, I just can't wait but I hope you guys have plans.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,160
 Hope you guys have aunt related plans as well.

23
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,640
 Speaking of aunt related, it's not but I need to segue.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,920
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,840
 Everyone give it up for everyone's favorite aunt man, Alexander.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,160
 Alexander Helander, everyone give Alexander a big round of applause.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,120
 I'm recording this episode really late at night, they shouldn't clap so loud.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,360
 Alexander, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,160
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it, trust me, I totally get it.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,120
 Just help spread the word about the show, that really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,160
 And then let's not get started just yet, actually let's give a shout out for this awesome fan

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,720
 art for Fan Art Friday.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,200
 Take a look at this one.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,560
 These are miniatures created by one of our Patreon supporters.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,280
 I'm living in your walls, I'm living in your walls, he posted these up on the Patreon Discord.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,200
 These are the figures of Jay Son, the swamp wizard, that's me, that's me the little mohawk.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,760
 And then his son, Mungo Jr. or maybe he just called him Mungo, I don't think he has a Mungo

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,440
 Jr. but that is his frog son, that's so dope.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,080
 They're doing a campaign and I'm an NPC.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,760
 I'm a swamp wizard with my boy Mungo, that's totally dope, that's amazing, right?

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,400
 Who would have thought I would ever be, who would I be in NPC and some dudes campaign.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
 Hopefully for all I know these guys are a bunch of lunatics in each game, they're like

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,440
 let's see who can torture Jay Son the most and make Mungo watch and I'm like no, I'm

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
 trapped in this alternate universe.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,640
 But amazing, that's so awesome.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
 Thank you so much, I'm living in your walls, really, really appreciate it.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,240
 Happy adventures to you and all of your players.

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,720
 Alexander, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

49
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,960
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed all the way out to an aircraft

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
 carrier.

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:33,440
 It's probably not the best thing to just sneak up on a US aircraft carrier in an unmarked

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
 Durgible, but we're gonna do it, we're gonna live dangerously.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,600
 I recently got this sent over to me by Carson, longtime supporter of the show.

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 I think he was one of the original listeners of the show, honestly, I think he was like

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,440
 in the original 14 listeners.

56
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,760
 Really good guy, a Patreon supporter, close personal friend, and he always sends me over

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
 quality stuff.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,320
 He sent me this thing over recently, there was this post online where they were talking

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,840
 about, hey veterans, anyone in the military, can you think of a paranormal or weird experience

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,680
 you had during your time serving?

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
 And who doesn't like to hear stories like this, right?

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,440
 Because at the very least you're just gonna hear maybe some cool war stories, right?

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,400
 And at the very most you might actually get something paranormal related.

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,640
 So Carson, thanks for sending this over.

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,440
 Fascinating stuff.

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,680
 First one we're gonna look at, I got two of them, it's a really cool list.

67
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,780
 First one I got was posted by a guy named Silent Implosion.

68
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,320
 This one was caught on video.

69
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,800
 And at the time when it was on video it was, National Geographic was doing some sort of

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,600
 documentary so you had these camera crews on the deck of this aircraft carrier.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,360
 And it's September 11th, 2003.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,320
 And we're off the coast of Virginia and there's this aircraft carrier here and this jet is

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 getting ready to take off.

74
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,680
 And I put the video in the show notes, you'll be able to watch this.

75
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
 And just watching the video is a miracle.

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,520
 But Silent Implosion gives us a little bit more backstory to this.

77
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,840
 So what happens is this F-18, shh, shh, shh, people are doing the danger zone stuff, they're

78
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,200
 like getting down, they're moving their arms up and then the pilot's like, is it me that's

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
 supposed to go?

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,320
 And they're like, go, go, go!

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:20,000
 And he starts to go down the flat part of the aircraft carrier, shh, shh, flying into

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
 that danger zone.

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,360
 And then the cable snaps.

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,800
 Apparently there's a cable hooked up to these planes to make them fly.

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,040
 You love this scientific description?

86
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,000
 I could have easily done 15 minutes of research on this.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,120
 I was too busy watching the video and singing Take My Breath Away.

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,760
 The jet is taken off and the arresting cable gets stuck and the plane goes over the edge

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
 of the aircraft carrier.

90
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,760
 Now, not in a good way, because you're like, is that what planes do?

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,640
 They don't stay in the aircraft carrier forever.

92
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,880
 If you love something, you have to let it fly away.

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,760
 It goes, it goes nose down into the water.

94
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 And I think the dude ejected, I'm pretty sure he's fine.

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
 But that's not paranormal.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,600
 That's just really good technology, working the way it's intended.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,320
 This cable snaps and silent implosion goes, this is what is expected when these cables

98
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
 snap.

99
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,720
 They whip down the rest of the aircraft carrier.

100
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,720
 I mean, it's this giant tension thing and now it's going whaaaaa, dude, don't call me

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
 that.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 It actually made that noise.

103
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
 I don't know if it made a Looney Tunes noise.

104
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:32,460
 But on the video, as this cable is snapping, we see a guy in a yellow shirt and they're

105
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,100
 called yellow shirts.

106
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,520
 He's standing there and the wire is coming and he jumps up in the air.

107
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,640
 He jumps over this super tensed up wire that's now snapped.

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,280
 He jumps over it, he lands, and then he jumps over it again.

109
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,840
 Now you're watching the video and you're thinking, oh, you know, it's a huge cable that obviously

110
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,120
 is enough to like, support an F-18.

111
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,320
 And you may be thinking, you know what, it's a really thick cable.

112
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,840
 Maybe he saw it come in twice and stuff.

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,200
 Like, yeah, it's definitely possible.

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,680
 But then the camera, this is all caught on video.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,260
 The camera shows the plane go over and then the camera kind of follows along with the

116
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,260
 cable.

117
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,260
 We see the yellow shirt jump twice and then it continues to kind of pan and follow the

118
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,860
 cable and you see people just getting knocked over.

119
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,380
 Because they didn't see it coming.

120
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,180
 Like this one guy straight up had his back to it.

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,340
 Yeah, it went boom.

122
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,900
 Again, don't call me on the sound effect, but it knocked a bunch of people over.

123
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,620
 Seven, seven, really.

124
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,460
 Seven or eight soldiers got knocked down.

125
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,440
 Well, silent implosion says, yeah, this is caught on video, but what happened was he

126
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,400
 was on the aircraft carrier.

127
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,260
 And he talked to the yellow shirt and the yellow shirt guy said, I was standing there

128
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,240
 because it all happened so fast.

129
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,880
 This whole thing's happening so fast.

130
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,040
 He goes, I'm standing there and imagine this is your job.

131
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,280
 So eventually, like the first time you do it, you're probably like, whoa, that's what

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
 airplanes do when they take off.

133
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 Awesome.

134
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,400
 But then you've been on this aircraft carrier for like two years, you're no longer excited

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 by it.

136
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,900
 You're literally going to turn your back to a billion dollar piece of machinery to find

137
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
 the laws of gravity.

138
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,060
 But you're like, whatever.

139
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,300
 So the cable snaps and the yellow shirt says, this is what happened.

140
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,740
 He goes, I'm standing there and I heard a voice in my head say, jump.

141
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,860
 So I jumped.

142
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,460
 I did not know what was coming.

143
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,180
 I did not see what was coming.

144
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,340
 I heard a voice say, jump.

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
 And I jumped.

146
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,080
 And when I landed, the voice returned and said, again.

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,640
 And I jumped.

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
 The other seven or eight servicemen did have to be lifted off.

149
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,440
 And silent implosion goes, they didn't hear any voices.

150
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,520
 So it's possible that they suffered injuries, obviously, but maybe this would have killed

151
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,760
 the yellow shirt and maybe this was a guardian angel, time traveler, all time.

152
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,480
 I mean, isn't that, that's a really cool story because we have the video evidence.

153
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,320
 We know that it happened.

154
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,060
 And now we're getting this paranormal answer for it.

155
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,260
 So really, really cool story.

156
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,580
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

157
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,020
 Let's jump off this aircraft carrier.

158
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,620
 We're headed all the way out to Fort Sam in Texas.

159
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:19,220
 I said in the intro, how would you feel about sleeping in a room where somebody has slit

160
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,220
 their wrist?

161
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,380
 Really, sleeping in a room where you know someone has died.

162
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,880
 And I think a lot of people would be weirded out about it.

163
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,120
 Some people wouldn't be.

164
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,800
 But I have a friend in the home lending mortgage business and stuff like that.

165
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,320
 And they were telling me that every home, I'm not going to say your name because I don't

166
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,240
 want to, this is part of a business, I don't want to interfere with it.

167
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
 But basically she was saying, in a way, every home, someone's died in it.

168
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,240
 And there's a reason why every home has someone who's died in it.

169
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,700
 Where do you want to die?

170
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,980
 You want to die at home?

171
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,940
 Most people want to die in their homes.

172
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,540
 And so they choose to die in their homes, right?

173
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,540
 And I'm not talking about suicide, but if you're really sick, are you going to go to the hospice?

174
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
 You're going to go to the hospital?

175
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,740
 You're going to go to the retirement home?

176
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,140
 Or are you just going to spend the rest of your days in the place you're the most comfortable?

177
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,140
 So pretty much every living space, unless it's a brand new house, someone's died in there.

178
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,620
 In that place where they built that brand new house, there was probably hundreds of years

179
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,040
 of people getting their heads split open and settlers coming and like torching native encampments

180
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,680
 and all sorts of stuff, right?

181
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,480
 You'd have all this stuff, you'd have brigands, shooting dudes in the back of the skull and

182
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 stealing their gold.

183
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,200
 So no matter where you're at, you're basically having a chance to be on cursed land.

184
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
 People have been everywhere at this point.

185
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 But people always are dying at home, but we're not at home.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 We're not at home.

187
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,040
 And I think like this house, I've talked about being haunted, my closet's haunted and stuff

188
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
 like that.

189
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,880
 I've made it my home.

190
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,760
 My energy is here and it's intermingling with some of the other energy here.

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,800
 But on a military base, is it ever really your home?

192
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 You're basically there.

193
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 That's where you're stationed.

194
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 You might have on base housing.

195
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,600
 That's not the situation here at Fort Sam.

196
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,480
 Apparently this was posted by someone going by the name 27 Letters.

197
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,600
 They were saying that they had gotten put on restriction.

198
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,520
 They were in school, in the military, this is in Dennis the Menace.

199
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
 They were doing this thing and they got put on restriction.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,160
 So they were sent to this different facility, this different part of the base, where that's

201
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,440
 where they were going to be staying at this point.

202
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,280
 That was going to be their room.

203
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,640
 And he goes, "This room, it just really had bad vibes."

204
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,320
 And that would make sense just from a paranormal aspect.

205
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,040
 You'd have a lot of people, this is your career.

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,840
 You're joining the military to maybe leave behind your small town or to start a career

207
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 in the military, maybe it's a family gig.

208
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,600
 And you're in this room because you've done something wrong.

209
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,920
 You might be getting demoted.

210
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,080
 You might be getting kicked out of your career.

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
 You might be getting fired, right?

212
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,080
 So there's going to be a lot of negative energy in this room.

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,920
 It's a place where people don't want to be.

214
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,000
 So he's in there and he has a roommate in this room and he just gets the weirdest feeling.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,840
 He goes, "I don't like this place."

216
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,920
 Now, you guys already know a little bit because obviously, even away in the intro, so you guys

217
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,640
 know a little bit more than this dude.

218
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,040
 We'll call this guy Mike.

219
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,040
 One night, Mike wakes up and he sees his bed buddy.

220
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,600
 So they're not literally laying next to each other, but there's two beds in there.

221
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120
 And his buddy is sleeping in the bed next to him, right?

222
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,600
 But when Mike wakes up, he sees his roommate standing at the foot of his bed, staring at

223
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 him.

224
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,720
 Now, this room's already creepy.

225
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,880
 It's already not the best place to be.

226
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,160
 He knows that he's in trouble, so he's not in the best mental state.

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,640
 And he can't figure out why his buddy's just standing there.

228
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,960
 But whatever, right?

229
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,520
 The military sometimes brings in a bunch of wackos, so he just goes back to sleep.

230
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:06,080
 Next morning, he wakes up and his buddy, the bunkmate, will call him Larry.

231
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
 Larry goes, "Hey, Mike, dude.

232
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,080
 I know that we're cool and all, but what was up with you standing at the foot of my bed

233
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
 last night?"

234
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,080
 Mike's like, "What are you talking about?

235
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,760
 I wasn't standing at the foot of your bed."

236
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,360
 And Larry goes, "Listen, dude, I woke up in the middle of the night.

237
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,760
 You were standing at the foot of my bed, and I was not able to go back to sleep.

238
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,360
 You were just standing at the foot of my bed staring at me.

239
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
 It was terrifying."

240
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,720
 And Mike goes, "Okay, when did that happen?"

241
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,760
 And Larry said, "It happened over whatever time."

242
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,120
 It's just say 3 AM.

243
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,480
 The spooky is time.

244
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,240
 And Mike realizes that's when he woke up and saw Larry standing at the foot of his own

245
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,800
 bed, of Mike's bed.

246
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,640
 So they go to the staff sergeant.

247
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,360
 They go to the person in charge, whoever it is, and they say, "Hey, I know we're on restriction

248
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,400
 and all that stuff, but is it possible we can get another room?"

249
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,080
 Because we already thought that room was spooky, but something happened last night, and we

250
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,840
 were standing at the foot of each other's bed, and the dude's like, "I'm going to stop

251
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 you guys right there.

252
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,520
 I'm going to stop you guys right there because I have to sleep as well."

253
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,360
 That room, I'm not going to say it's haunted.

254
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
 Officially, I'm not going to say that it's haunted, but let me tell you what happened.

255
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,120
 Long time ago, they get a little campfire, they're cooking s'mores all of a sudden.

256
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,400
 A long time ago, on a day just like this, an instructor got busted down, right?

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,600
 It actually wasn't a long time ago.

258
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
 I looked back over and my notes, it was a year ago.

259
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,480
 This happened the year before Mike and Larry got involved in this, but a year ago there

260
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,980
 was an instructor on base who got busted down, was doing something wrong, and got put on

261
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,680
 restriction and had to stay in this room.

262
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,000
 And then they caught him using his cell phone, which apparently you're not supposed to do

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 in the military.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Is that a thing?

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,520
 Got put on restriction, got caught using his cell phone, was going to get demoted, was actually

266
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,320
 going to lose rank, lose pay, and he was totally freaking out.

267
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,080
 He was freaking out so much that other people were like, "Dude, you need to calm down.

268
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,040
 You're acting really, really weird."

269
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,160
 But he couldn't calm him down.

270
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,400
 They go, "It's really not a big deal.

271
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,560
 You'll just work your way back up.

272
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,720
 It's not a huge thing."

273
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,080
 But one day he goes in the room and the next morning they find him and he had slit his

274
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,080
 wrist and OD'd on drugs at the same time, which a lot of people do that when they're

275
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 committing suicide.

276
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,720
 They'll do more than one.

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,960
 This guy killed himself and because he had OD'd and he slit his wrist, they said there

278
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,400
 was blood and puke everywhere.

279
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,760
 He's vomiting it up all the toxins and he's bleeding out and thus ends the life of this

280
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
 instructor.

281
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,120
 Now, is this story true?

282
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
 We don't know.

283
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,400
 We were able to see video evidence of the first one.

284
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
 Is this story true?

285
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 We don't know.

286
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,120
 But it's interesting nonetheless.

287
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
 It's creepy.

288
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,880
 Obviously anything where you wake up and you're seeing something at the foot of your bed that's

289
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,440
 just instinctively creepy because we're in our most vulnerable state.

290
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,000
 It's interesting that each person is seeing the other person at the foot of the bed.

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,720
 My question would be if they, none of them ever seemed to look at the other bed.

292
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,280
 If they did, was it empty?

293
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,600
 Like if Larry looked and he saw Mike standing at the foot of the bed and then looked over

294
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,120
 and saw Mike sleeping, then you would know it was a ghost.

295
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,480
 But the more disturbing answer would be Larry waking up seeing Mike at the foot of the bed

296
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,440
 and then looking over and the bed's empty.

297
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,040
 So that means it really is Mike standing at the foot of the bed.

298
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,040
 Or this demon, the spirit, this vengeful phantasm has the ability to assume the shape of someone

299
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,640
 else and hide their original form from view.

300
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,560
 Both are equally terrifying, right?

301
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,960
 Both are equally terrifying if a ghost can actually make you not see something that's

302
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,600
 there.

303
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,880
 So yeah, really, really creepy story either way.

304
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,920
 And again, Carson, thanks for standing over.

305
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,200
 And 27 letters in silent implosion for sharing that with us as well.

306
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,160
 Alexander, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbenter copter.

307
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,960
 We are saying goodbye to Fort Sam.

308
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,120
 They're like, no, we still need a new room.

309
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
 Don't leave us in here.

310
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,280
 They're locking the door.

311
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
 Start the experiments.

312
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
 We're leaving.

313
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
 We're leaving.

314
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,120
 Goodbye to these guys as they're banging on the door and these ghosts are sneaking up

315
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 behind them.

316
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,080
 Alexander, we're leaving behind Fort Sam.

317
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,960
 Take us all the way out to Sweden.

318
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,360
 I gotta give a shout out for this story.

319
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,880
 I had never heard this story.

320
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,240
 It's still fascinating to me.

321
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,640
 I think people, long-time listeners of the show know one of the hallmarks of this show

322
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,200
 is finding stuff that's super obscure.

323
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,920
 Like I like to cover stuff that I've never heard of.

324
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,040
 But every show often I could, and I research this stuff all the time, so if I haven't heard

325
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,160
 of it, it's very likely that most people haven't heard of it.

326
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,720
 But every show often I come across a story and I'm thinking, how have I not heard this

327
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
 before?

328
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,080
 How do I not know this story?

329
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,200
 This seems so, it's older, right?

330
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
 It's from the 70s to 60s to 70s.

331
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,400
 It's just super weird.

332
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
 Let's just get into it.

333
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 I'm shocked that I hadn't heard of this.

334
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,640
 But I want to give a shout out to Brent Swancer from Mysterious Universe.

335
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,760
 He wrote this, I never heard this story before.

336
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,200
 He recently wrote an article about it and I got a lot of information from it and just,

337
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,280
 it's awesome that we are still, I've been in this game for 30 years.

338
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,120
 More, 33 years at this point and I'm still learning new stuff and I love sharing that

339
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,480
 stuff with you.

340
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,400
 There's a woman in Sweden named Barbara Carlin.

341
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,160
 But before she's a woman, she's a baby girl.

342
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,840
 Me, me, me.

343
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,320
 The mom's like holding the baby and goes, I won't name you Barbara because in Sweden

344
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,640
 that's a normal name.

345
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,200
 She constantly has nightmares.

346
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 Oh no.

347
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,640
 Mommy, I had the nightmare again.

348
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,080
 The men in the uniforms took, I don't know why I'm building up the suspense.

349
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,080
 You've seen the title of, you've seen the title of the episode.

350
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,600
 I mentioned it in the intro.

351
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,920
 It took, I was like, long ago back in 1940s.

352
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
 You guys know, you guys know what it is.

353
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,200
 Barbara Carlin, I had a bunch more notes, I had a bunch more notes where I was going

354
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,320
 to build the story up and then you were going to find out that Barbara is actually the reincarnation

355
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,240
 of Anne Frank.

356
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,840
 So Anne Frank, quick overview.

357
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,160
 I'm sure everyone's familiar with Anne Frank, but you never really know.

358
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,400
 Anne Frank, young Jewish girl.

359
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,000
 The Nazis were rounded up, all of the Jews.

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,800
 And her and her family lived in an attic for a couple months and eventually the Nazis found

361
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,960
 them and pulled the family out of the attic and she died.

362
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,480
 She died in the camp.

363
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
 You have that.

364
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,760
 So young girl, she's writing the diary of Anne Frank.

365
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,880
 So we get to see this story from this young woman's point of view, this massive historical

366
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,000
 event from the point of view of a 13 year old girl.

367
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,400
 And it's a great book.

368
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,040
 She's pretty much read in every school because on the one hand, it's well written and it's

369
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,760
 a great way for kids, it has a lot of good vocabulary for kids to read, right?

370
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 And on the other hand, it's just a tale of horror in the resiliency of the human spirit,

371
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
 right?

372
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,760
 It's just so it works on a literary level and it works just on a human level.

373
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,080
 So when Barbara, though, she's born in 1954, we all know who Anne Frank is today, but she

374
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,360
 was born in 1954. The diary of Anne Frank was written in 1947 and I can't say that it

375
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,080
 was a huge blockbuster.

376
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,080
 I don't think many people would read it if it wasn't required reading in school, honestly.

377
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,640
 So she says, "Listen, I didn't know about Anne Frank.

378
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,440
 We didn't really know about Anne Frank in Sweden.

379
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
 Is there a shift from side to side?"

380
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,400
 Because, I mean, maybe not, right?

381
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,360
 Maybe if you were there at the time you knew about her or when the book was being published,

382
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,640
 I'm sure there was a lot of publicity.

383
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,800
 But in 1954, and the story, as far as I know at that time, wasn't required reading in Sweden.

384
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
 It may not even be required reading.

385
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,280
 Now, but she says she didn't know who Anne Frank was, but she knew her name was Anne Frank

386
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,760
 and she knew that since the age of three.

387
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,600
 Now she started talking about being Anne Frank and she started saying, "I have these nightmares

388
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,440
 about these men in uniforms kicking down the doors and taking me away."

389
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,640
 And that this is going on for so long her parents take her to a psychiatrist and the

390
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,240
 psychiatrist apparently does not know anything about Anne Frank either because they go, "Oh,

391
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,800
 you imaginary friends, imaginary friends, they just happen, right?"

392
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,880
 You don't know who this person is, who this Anne Frank is.

393
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,240
 It's a passing phase, she'll get over it.

394
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,760
 Now, Barbara may have just fade into obscurity at this point and just go, "Oh, you know,

395
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,800
 maybe, maybe I don't really have these memories.

396
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,520
 Maybe it is a passing phase."

397
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
 Whatever.

398
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,960
 Or she could have continued to think she was this person named Anne Frank.

399
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,880
 But the reason why we're talking about Barbara today other than her making this claim is

400
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,480
 she is a famous author and she actually, well, in Sweden, let me put a little asterisk next

401
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,260
 to that in Sweden, she started writing, she's like a wonder kind when it comes to writing.

402
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,200
 She published her first book of poetry by age 12.

403
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,000
 And by the time she was 16, she had 11 books published, including prose as well as poetry.

404
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,680
 And at this point, she kind of stops talking about Anne Frank, not because she doesn't

405
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,240
 believe it because it constantly just brings about ridicule and a bunch of questions are

406
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
 being asked.

407
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,880
 But at this point, I believe they know Anne Frank is real.

408
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,080
 One point, they're going through a tour of Europe and they end up in Amsterdam and they

409
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,200
 go, "Hey, let's check out the Anne Frank house."

410
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
 Which is weird, right?

411
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,780
 If you're, you thought your daughter had some sort of mental illness connected to Anne

412
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,320
 Frank and then you found that Anne Frank was a real person and then you just happened to

413
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,400
 be in the country where the story took place, would you go to the house?

414
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,240
 I think it would depend on if you thought your daughter was stable enough, but they

415
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,680
 go to the house and she's walking around and she goes, "Oh, I totally remember this place."

416
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,960
 This place brings back this place brings back such horrible memories.

417
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,440
 And they're walking around and they go upstairs to like the crawl space, the attic, and she

418
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,760
 starts to have a panic attack.

419
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,160
 Oh no, this is awful up here.

420
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,040
 And I guess there was like a smaller room that Anne Frank was actually like hanging

421
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,960
 out in like her own little room.

422
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,600
 And Barbara goes in that room and she opens the door and she goes, "Oh, look at the photos.

423
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,080
 The photos of the movie stars are still on the wall."

424
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,680
 And so apparently Anne Frank, it's been years since I read the book, I guess this part's

425
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
 in here.

426
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,640
 She was cutting out a movie star picture, which is so funny.

427
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
 It just shows how kids never change.

428
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,640
 Basically, she had the equivalent of Jonathan Taylor Thomas photos from TigerBee magazine.

429
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,880
 She had them of stars of the day on the wall.

430
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,440
 And Barbara goes, "Look, the photos are still here."

431
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,240
 And she's saying that to her mom and her mom goes, "What photos?"

432
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
 And Barbara looks back at her mom and then when she looks back to the wall, the wall

433
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
 is bare.

434
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,240
 There's nothing there.

435
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,400
 I guess that they ended up asking the tour guide about the photos.

436
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,080
 Like, "Hey, there used to be photos on the wall up there."

437
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,760
 And the tour guide goes, "Oh, yeah, we actually took them down recently because we're going

438
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,040
 to put them under glass because people were scribbling on them.

439
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,680
 They're like, "Oh, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, you're the sexiest."

440
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,760
 They're writing little hearts on there.

441
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,800
 And so the implication is that she was seen into the past.

442
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,160
 She was seen through Anne Frank's eyes.

443
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,760
 And at this point, so now she kind of believes that this is true.

444
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
 Like she's kind of had some vindication.

445
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,760
 She had a mild hallucination.

446
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,040
 So she does at this point, seems to totally grow out of this belief.

447
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
 She's Anne Frank.

448
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,160
 She joins the Swedish police service as a mounted officer.

449
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,240
 But while she is moving on with her life, you know, sure, I'm Anne Frank, but you know,

450
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,040
 I got other stuff to do now.

451
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,800
 She's riding her horse chasing down criminals.

452
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,920
 There's another officer she absolutely hates.

453
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,880
 And she's like, "I don't know why I don't like that guy.

454
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,160
 But I just know I hate his guts."

455
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,320
 And then she finds out.

456
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,200
 I don't know how she finds out.

457
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,680
 I don't know if she rummages through her garbage or if she found out surfing the astral

458
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,960
 plane, but she finds out that this cop that she doesn't like, who she randomly hates, is

459
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,960
 actually the reincarnation of a Nazi guard.

460
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,520
 Wouldn't that be interesting if, think about all the people that you've disliked or haven't

461
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,880
 trusted just instinctively.

462
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,640
 And we go, "I just get off a weird vibe.

463
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,440
 What if that person killed us in a past life?"

464
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,040
 Or maybe not killed us, but maybe they cheered on our death.

465
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,440
 Maybe as you were some gladiator back in ancient Roman times and you were hacking a lion with

466
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,720
 a sword, there was a dude in the stands going, "Boo you lion!

467
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
 Eat his nuts!

468
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 Eat his nuts!"

469
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,240
 So, maybe that's all that explains why all those people you hate, and you don't know

470
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
 why you hate.

471
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,520
 You're trying to lie in to bite your testicles in some past life.

472
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,320
 That's how you die in every iteration of you.

473
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,760
 You're like, "Oh no, you just got a baby pit bull.

474
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,160
 You just sit at home and the baby pit bull is cuddling up in your lap."

475
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,160
 You're like, "Oh no, the cycle begins anew."

476
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,920
 So anyways, she said, and then all the memories start come flooding back.

477
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,360
 She's like, "I can't deny that I'm Anne Frank anymore.

478
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 I just can't."

479
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,360
 Like, there's a bunch of Nazis out there, right?

480
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
 There's a bunch of Nazis out there.

481
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,800
 I want to keep running these guys.

482
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,200
 She ends up writing another book called "And the Wolves Howled."

483
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,360
 And it's her life story.

484
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,360
 It's a story of two lives, her story of Anne Frank and her story as Barbro.

485
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,880
 It's interesting because one of Anne Frank's living relatives, I think Anne Frank's last

486
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,840
 living relative, kind of co-signed Barbro.

487
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,800
 They met on a book tour and he's like, "Yeah, I do believe that this is the reincarnation

488
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,520
 of my niece, Anne Frank."

489
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,560
 Which is a weird, again, a weird claim to make.

490
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,840
 I don't know how well this man knew Anne Frank.

491
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,800
 Maybe he knew her very well.

492
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,240
 He sees the same mannerisms in Barbro.

493
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,720
 But today, she wrote this book and she kind of went on tour.

494
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,400
 It was a very, very big story.

495
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,640
 I'm surprised I'd never heard of this before.

496
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,920
 And nowadays, though, she left the Mounted Police.

497
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,200
 She's like, "There's a bunch of Nazis who work from here."

498
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,000
 And they're like, "Oh, we hear that all the time."

499
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,440
 She leaves the Mounted Police.

500
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,080
 She ends up, nowadays, she's a horse trainer.

501
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,240
 She trains horse riders and she does dressage, which is like dancing horse stuff.

502
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,200
 The horse is just like walk around the grass and rich people clap and then like the horse

503
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
 like jumps.

504
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,120
 I don't know.

505
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,080
 So anyways, she does that.

506
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,160
 It's a fascinating story.

507
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,480
 I've never heard of it before.

508
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,880
 I love stories that I haven't heard of.

509
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,200
 Reincarnation is one of those things that I think is fully plausible.

510
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,920
 Like my belief about what happened when you die, you know, you die, you go to heaven,

511
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
 but I don't know, right?

512
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,520
 And reincarnation is one of those things that it's not outside the realm of possibility

513
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
 for me.

514
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,400
 I would find it really fascinating to be reincarnated over and over again and working through your

515
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,480
 life struggles.

516
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,040
 Why would the two be mutually exclusive?

517
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,760
 Why can't you go through reincarnation until you get it right and then go to heaven?

518
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
 Right?

519
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 So I don't know.

520
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
 I love stories about reincarnation.

521
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,040
 It's one of those things that I'm definitely open to.

522
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,280
 I am always a little suspicious, especially when people start pumping out books on this

523
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,560
 subject about how they're reincarnated of, you know, these great, powerful people.

524
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,520
 But you know, Anne Frank, not necessarily, Anne Frank wasn't necessarily a powerful person.

525
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,120
 She was a young girl trying to survive in the midst of Maelstrom.

526
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
 And she died.

527
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,360
 You know, her legacy survived, but she died.

528
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,560
 It's interesting though, because as I was reading the story, I thought, shouldn't, if

529
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,440
 you weren't truly the reincarnation of Anne Frank, don't you think you should be doing

530
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,240
 better things with your time?

531
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,640
 Like if I was reincarnation of like Martin Luther King Jr. and I was playing Fortnite

532
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,560
 all the time, it seemed like it would be a waste, especially if we're looking at reincarnation

533
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,480
 as moving your soul forward.

534
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:04,200
 Like you would think somebody who faced down evil was such calm, was such childlike calm,

535
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,280
 because that's what she was, right?

536
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:14,560
 Don't you think you would have a responsibility to be like a social leader, to be a politician,

537
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,280
 to be doing things, to make the world a better place, to guarantee that that never happens

538
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
 again?

539
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,480
 If you're the reincarnation of this great and grand person, don't you have a responsibility

540
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,560
 to carry on that mission?

541
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,640
 But then I was thinking about this as well.

542
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:43,320
 If you were a little girl, a little Jewish girl, born at really the worst time in the

543
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,760
 worst place to be Jewish, and your entire family was cramped into an attic, and you

544
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,160
 sat there, afraid, until people came in and pulled you out of it, and then took you to

545
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,920
 a camp, and kept you there.

546
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:11,440
 Your last moments on earth, laying on a cot, surrounded by dozens of other people suffering

547
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:21,320
 these horrible diseases, the smell and the filth, the fear and the loneliness, if that

548
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:30,040
 was the way a little girl's life ended, what better way to enjoy the next existence by

549
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:42,240
 spending it riding horses, magnificent beasts carrying you across grassy fields, underneath

550
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,720
 a crisp blue sky?

551
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,560
 Maybe the point of reincarnation isn't to make the world a better place in the next life,

552
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:01,680
 but it's to experience the joys that were taken from you in your previous existence.

553
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,240
 I don't know if Barbara's story is real, I don't know if reincarnation is real, but

554
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:14,360
 if they are real, what a beautiful way for the story of Anne Frank to continue.

555
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:22,280
 No longer a frightened little girl, now a grown woman experiencing all the beauty the

556
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:31,800
 world has to offer.

557
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,120

 Come on Aunt May, let's go.

564
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
 Ooh, Peter.

565
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
 What?

566
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,280
 What do you say like that Aunt May?

567
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:02,200
 Well, you're not my Peter, you're from an alternate universe, I guess, but it's not,

568
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
 it's okay.

569
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
 It's okay.

570
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,120
 I'm not your real aunt, I'm just like, I'm Toby McGuire's aunt.

571
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,960
 I don't know, well, yeah, but you're kind of old.

572
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,840
 Hey, just because there's snow on the mountain doesn't mean there's not lava in the volcano.

573
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
 Aunt May.

574
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:41,320
 Yeah.

575
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:51,840
 Yeah.

576
00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:06,680
 Yeah.
