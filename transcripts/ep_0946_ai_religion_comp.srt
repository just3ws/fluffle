1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Did a doctor commit double homicide? Simply because he hated fat people?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Then we take a look at a cheating scandal that's currently rocking the world of chess.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Is it possible that a chess player inserted anal beads into his butthole so he could get messages

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 beamed from an AI into his anus and more importantly has this AI anus spot been affecting your life as well.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We always have some awesome plans for the weekend. We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're getting started right away.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is some of our long time Patreon supporters.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Everyone give it up for Cole and Danielle. Woohoo! Yeah, come on in. The Dastardly Duo.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command against their will. They don't want to be on the anal bead episode.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 The reason why we're highlighting Cole and Danielle isn't just because they're long time Patreon supporters.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But recently Cole and Danielle, they have a production company called Creighton Cave Productions.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And they sent me a, it's really cool. I'll put it in the show notes. We've already been talking about it on YouTube,

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 but a lot of you guys haven't been aware of it. Creighton Cave Productions made a mock-up as if Dead Rabbit Radio was a late night paranormal mystery show.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 This is what the television intro would be. So it's really, really cool. It's kind of that, what do they call it, low-fi horror VHS stuff?

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I don't know. It's a particular genre nowadays. But it's really, really cool.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 They're actually now looking at maybe doing a cheesy commercial for Dead Rabbit Radio as if it was a television show as well.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 It's really awesome what you guys do. It's really, really fascinating.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Today's fan art is a screen grab from their intro. And go ahead and check it out. Check it out and subscribe to their YouTube channel.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because this is a community thing, really. This is so awesome. What you guys do for this show always, always amazes me.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 So Cole and Danielle, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't still wear the Patreon,

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 or if you can't make low-fi horror or whatever the genre is, that's okay too.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Just helps read the word about Dead Rabbit Radio. That helps out so much.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Cole and Danielle, go ahead and each grab onto the hair hang glider.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Take us up to the highest point at Dead Rabbit Command and jump off. We're gliding all the way out to a hospital.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 [deep breath]

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Long time fans of the show now. I'm a big advocate of physical fitness.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I love it. I love people getting fit. I think that's one of the reasons why I love Cobra Kai so much,

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 because it's about people training to get better. That's why I love wrestling, right?

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It's people of their peak physical fitness. And steroids, which I personally don't have a lot of steroids.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 We've talked about that before. As long as it's not in any sort of competitive sport.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 If some movie actor wants to all of a sudden put on 40 pounds of muscle, you guys all know who I'm talking about.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Pretty much 90% of Marvel's superhero lineup, right? If they want to do whatever, I don't care.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And if you want to do steroids and you want to be in WWE, that's not a competitive sport.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 It's a great physical art form. But I'm a huge fan of physical fitness.

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's something that I enjoy doing myself. And it's something that I enjoy encouraging other people to do.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So a lot of times I will go to this board called the Fit Board.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And on the Fit Board, they talk about physical fitness. And there's a lot of really good information on there.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 They're talking about, you know, good exercises to do for certain body parts.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 People will post photos of other people and say, "Can I achieve this body? It'll be a picture of Goku, right?

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 It'll be a picture of some anime character. But is this achievable? Can I do this?"

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 There's a lot of stuff where people are saying, you know, "I was out in town today and somebody admired my biceps.

44
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And I just started lifting a couple of months ago and it's the first time a woman ever paid attention to me."

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 There's also a lot of guys on there who call themselves incels and things like that.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And, you know, that they've never had the attention of a woman. So it feels good, but they don't know how to respond when a cute girl smiles at them.

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It's a fun board. It's a fun board.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 However, there is a particular post that pops up every once in a while called Fat People Hate,

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 where they post people, it's kind of what it sounds like, right? They post pictures of Lizzo and make fun of her.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 It's not all Lizzo. It's not all Lizzo, but those are the photos that are going around right now.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 They post pictures of fat people and they make fun of them.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 The reason why we're headed past all of the useful information and past all of the self-esteem building thing,

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 like I would like to get there someday is well someday. I also want to be a two-dimensional character throwing fireballs out of my hands.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 We're going to move past all the motivational stuff. We're going to the Fat Person Hate Board because we have this post that's...

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I've seen it posted a couple times here and I wanted to discuss it with you because if this is true and there's a debate over whether it is not true,

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 like anything on the internet, we just don't know, but let's take a look at this because it's terrifying.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's terrifying and it makes sense. I actually believe this story is true.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Back in 2020, there was a doctor working at a hospital and this was during the time of COVID and this was like peak COVID, right?

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 When people were still trying to figure out what was going on, how do we stop it?

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And if you can't stop it, what are the necessary steps made to keep people alive in a hospital setting?

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Like this is early COVID time where they're hooking people up to these respirators.

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 They're filling up. These emergency wards are filling up pretty quickly.

63
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Back in 2020, there was a doctor working at a hospital and these two overweight people show up.

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 These two overweight people show up with COVID.

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And apparently, according to this doctor, they're being super obnoxious.

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Super obnoxious, they're being abusive. They're being obnoxious, they're being abusive.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 That's how the doctor described them. And it got to the point where they had to be sedated and then intubated.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And that's where they shoved the tube down your throat to help you breathe.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Well, what's happening is more and more patients are coming in to the hospital and more and more patients need to be intubated,

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 but they only have a certain amount of the HFNCs, which is the high-flow oxygen therapy machines.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And the doctor says what happened was two kids ended up getting COVID and they also had very, very bad cases of this.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Their oxygen rates were steadily dropping and they realized we need to put them on these machines, but they don't have any.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 They don't have any left. All the machines that are used, because it's a specialized machine, right?

74
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Who would have thought you would need 15 in a hospital?

75
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They've run out of machines. They have these two kids.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So what this doctor confessed to online was that they sabotaged the lab work for the overweight people.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 What this doctor did was actually make it, change the paperwork to show that they were worse off than they actually were.

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And then this doctor took these reports, two other doctors, and said, "Look at this. Look at this report. They're so bad off."

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Even with this breathing machine, they're not going to make it.

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 The doctor looks at it and goes, "Man, you know, we really don't want to take people off machines. They're on the machines.

81
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 That's the only reason why they're alive."

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Yeah, I know, but look at this paperwork. They're just not going to make it. Even on the machines, they're not going to make it.

83
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 The other doctors weren't recognizing that this report was falsified.

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And he goes, "I continue to go around and talk to all the other doctors who are in charge of these decisions and say, 'Look at these two people. They're just not going to make it.'"

85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But we have two kids that still have a chance.

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 The doctor's like, "Man, that's a huge decision to take somebody off of a life-saving machine."

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 But looking at your report, yeah, you're right. They're not going to make it. And the dude's like, "Yeah, they're not."

88
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 So according to him, the two overweight patients were taken off the breathing machines, moved to another part of the hospital, and the two kids were hooked up to the machines.

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 The two overweight people ended up dying. The two children fully recovered.

90
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Now you could argue that, let's assume the story's real, right? Because it could be fake. You can check the show notes. You'll see it's basically an image that's going around that people have screen-saved.

91
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And now they just repost this image from when it was originally posted.

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You can make the argument morally that they're kids versus these adults, right? I think you could, as a doctor, go, "Well, actually, our doctors are even allowed to do that. They're like, "You've lived a good life. They're like, "I'm only 45."

93
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, this little baby's nine." You know, I don't think doctors can necessarily do that. But you think about it, like, on a moral level, right?

94
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Let's say you're in a burning building, and behind one door is an old man, and behind the other door is a newborn baby. Who would you rescue?

95
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And the doors were also really far apart, and the fire is really burning, right? It's super hot. Who do you save? Like, what?

96
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It's so funny. I remember when I was at sociology class. I think it was sociology class in college. Or it might have been philosophy. I don't remember. They all kind of blended together.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 They basically just became one long class that actually--maybe it was economics, and I'm thinking about it, because it was an economic moral.

98
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 As the teacher said, he goes, "If you take the morals away, it's actually more efficient to save adults than children, because even though it seems bad that you let this little kid burn to death, when you save an adult, that adult may be an engineer.

99
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 That adult may be a firefighter, and then he can help you put out the fire and save the kid anyways."

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 They go, "We've already invested so much time and money as a society into an adult that it makes more economic sense to save a known factor."

101
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I mean, maybe I was a math dealer or something like that, and the economics professor was like, "I really need my math to save that guy. Save that guy."

102
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But if you saved a businessman, he's already been trained by society, he's already gone through all of this stuff, he's already paying taxes.

103
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 An adult has already proven its value to society and is paying back into society, versus a child is just this little ball of muscle and blood that we don't know what it's going to end up being.

104
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It's just like this thing, right? It's just like Jason, "No, it's a little adult. It's a tiny adult."

105
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 You know what I mean? If you had an upstanding, you don't even have to have an upstanding.

106
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Let's say there was a guy who worked at a gas station named Tony, and we're back at the burning building, and the gas station has gone on fire now.

107
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 You have a 28-year-old gas station attendant named Tony, and then there's a six-year-old.

108
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Jason, please stop talking about this. Then there's a six-year-old who is also about to be burned to death.

109
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 The gas station attendant, he's already part of society, he's already paying taxes and all that stuff.

110
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 You don't know what the six-year-old's going to do. It's an unknown quantity. I've never been thinking about it.

111
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I don't think my economics teacher said this either. He laid it out better. He laid it out better.

112
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 My point is that on a moral level, I would say you saved the kid over the adult.

113
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I think most people would agree with that now. Not my insane economics teacher who I might be misquoting.

114
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It's interesting. Here's a little side story for you. I remember when this happened, when I first moved up here, I'll try to find the article for the show notes.

115
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 This was huge news in town. People were very, very upset. I remember being at work, sitting in the break room, and people were like, "Oh, I cannot."

116
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 It was the talk of the town. People still talk about this. Someone mentioned it just two or three weeks ago.

117
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 A couple years ago, this guy was driving in the car with his son, and the car went into the river, and the father swam away and got to shore, and his son died.

118
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Now, I remember sitting in the break room at work, and people were furious at this guy. Furious.

119
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Because they were like, "He should have done whatever it took to save his son, even if that meant he died as well."

120
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 He should have stayed under the murky waters until they both died.

121
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I mean, it was kind of the-- he basically was being called a coward around town. I never met the guy.

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I'll put it in the show notes. I don't remember the guy's name, but the moral lesson was-- I remember sitting there, and they were like, "Wow, people hate--"

123
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And I don't think they really knew him, right? It wasn't like, "Oh, yeah, he was always a coward."

124
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 He originally had five children, and they all died by misadventure.

125
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 It was just the fact that how could you swim away from your drowning child? And I remember thinking, "It's quite easy, actually."

126
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Like, you and I know a bunch of parents are being typing out comments and emails right now, but I think your animal instinct would kick in.

127
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 You're dying, right? You're in this dark water, and you've got to swim away before you die, right? Before you suffocate under there or drown, I think, is technical term.

128
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And then-- I mean, I think he just kicked in. But the idea was, no, he should have-- and I don't think the car just hit the water, and he jumped out and immediately swam away.

129
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Like, from what I understand, the car was submerged, and he-- according to him, he did try to help the kid.

130
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But it's interesting, right? Like, on a moral level, like, people hated him because he survived.

131
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 He should have died with his child rather than survived without him.

132
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So I can understand you looking at this metric. Can you go, "Listen, I have this person--" Let's take me, for example, because as much as I love physical fitness, I am overweight, right?

133
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I do love working out, but if I am-- I mean, if I went into the hospital and someone goes, "This guy's 46 years old. He's 290 pounds."

134
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 So maybe he didn't treat his body right, right? Maybe he's been eating all this fast food, and he's obviously, like, drinking a bunch of milkshake and stuff like that.

135
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I come out of the machine, I'm like, "Okay, okay, I know I'm overweight, but I'm not a glutton." And then I go back into the machine.

136
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 They go, "We have this guy who we can tell who hasn't treated his body right. I've just imagined they're poking me with a stick."

137
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And they're like, "Look at-- look at how the blubber rumbles even three minutes after we've poked him with the stick.

138
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 We have this guy who's obviously not treated his body the best. He's put on a lot of weight over the years. Has a terrible haircut.

139
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Something's wrong with this haircut. We can't figure out what that is.

140
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Here we have a 9-year-old boy who's healthy and can continue to be healthy and treat his body healthy. Who do we kill?

141
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Again, I don't think doctors make that decision, but you could imagine that they do come across that.

142
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 We have a hypothetical situation where we're breaking into a house and it's on fire.

143
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Firefighters have to make that decision as well, right? Do we save the adult or the kid?

144
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And I think most people would choose to save the kid.

145
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 So on that level, had this doctor just watched all this play out and go, "You know what?

146
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 The overweight people will make it on these machines, but if we don't put these kids on the machines, they will definitely die."

147
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 That's a different moral argument to make, right?

148
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 But to constantly call them "fatties," which is what this doctor does, is constantly refers to them as "fatties."

149
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And then to forge the paperwork. That's murder.

150
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Well, not the fatties part. You're not killing it. You're not a murderer because you call someone a fattie.

151
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But you have this situation where he's committing murder.

152
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He changed the documents and then is convincing other people to go out these forged documents.

153
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's a terrifying story. Is it true? We don't know, but it sounds true, doesn't it?

154
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It sounds true. It sounds like something that could actually happen.

155
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That a doctor... I'm sure there are doctors. Actually, I know there are doctors out there who have prejudices against people.

156
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Whether it's their race, whether it's their weight, whether it's their religion, and they'll take that out on people.

157
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 They'll take that out on their patients. And they just have so much power over you.

158
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I'm not saying they're necessarily going to be... You take over your medicine as much as Skittles.

159
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 You're like, "What? Supposed to be heart medicine?" "Ugh!" And you die.

160
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 But they could definitely mistreat you on purpose, not like, "Pull your hair, call you names."

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 This doctor was calling them names, but "Not treat you the way you need to be medically treated."

162
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I don't know if it would... I don't know how often it comes to something this egregious where they're actually murdering people.

163
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I think that's fairly rare, but I'm sure that you do get people, patients coming into doctors, and the doctor's not liking them because of some sort of personal issue with them.

164
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 They just don't like that person, or they don't like what that person represents.

165
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And I think most of the time when it happened, you could just go, "Man, I just don't have a really good feeling for my doctor."

166
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 He keeps giving me Skittles, which are delicious, but I kind of need my beta blockers.

167
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But in a situation like COVID where people were coming into the hospital and everyone was terrified and nobody knew what to do,

168
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 people were figuring this stuff out day by day, that's when a doctor would have ultimate power.

169
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Power of life and death.

170
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Whether you agree that the children's lives were more important than the two overweight people, it's a moral discussion we can have.

171
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 But he forged the paperwork.

172
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 He convinced these doctors that there was no way to save them when there was.

173
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And he murdered them. He absolutely murdered these two people simply because they were fat.

174
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Cole and Danielle, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

175
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 We are leaving behind this hospital. We're headed all the way out to St. Louis, Missouri.

176
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

177
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 All of a sudden a montage of people moving pieces around the board and some guy going, "No!"

178
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And then they're dragging him off into the back to kill him. You didn't know?

179
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 This is a chess championship to the death.

180
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And that's not true. I'm just trying to make it a little more exciting before we get to the anal beads,

181
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 because then it's just crazy from there on out.

182
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 But in the beginning, we have to fight our way past security.

183
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 We're kicking people, doing karate chops, and then we just go and we sit in the front row.

184
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And when we're watching these two dudes move wooden pieces around the board, like you expect.

185
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 We're watching a showdown. We're watching a showdown, which is, again, another word that I can't believe we're using for a chess article.

186
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 But a showdown between Magnus Carlson, he's this 31-year-old dude who is currently on a 53-game winning streak.

187
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Magnus Carlson's moving these pieces around the board and he's playing against this dude named Hans Nieman, 19 years old.

188
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So big age difference between the two.

189
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And even though Hans Nieman is only 19 years old, he's been playing this game for a while.

190
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He's actually used to stream chess on Twitch.

191
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I mean, this is so I don't understand why who would watch this on Twitch.

192
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 You're like, "Oh man, I want pins and needles." You're watching a guy go, "Your move."

193
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Anyways, chess, right? Chess playing.

194
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So Hans Nieman is a long shot to win this.

195
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 He's actually, I mean, let's put it this way, he's better than me.

196
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 He's better than me at chess. I'm actually a pretty good chess player.

197
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I actually feel like I'm pushing these people around to try to deflect.

198
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 I'm actually a pretty good chess player in real life.

199
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Hans Nieman, he's a long shot.

200
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 He's a long shot to actually take this championship.

201
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And what's weird is they go, "Okay, so he's been playing since he was a teenager."

202
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 But in a very short period of time, his ranking is skyrocketed.

203
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 They said it's actually a statistical anomaly that someone could get this good this quickly.

204
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Hans Nieman's like, "Well, you know, some people are just born great."

205
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 These guys are currently playing in this championship that the total price pool is $350,000

206
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 and other nerds will know your name from that one you only get picked on by prestige bullies.

207
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 People who really know what they're doing.

208
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 So they're playing this game. Hans Nieman is playing against Magnus and it shouldn't even be close.

209
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So when Hans wins in an upset, this was, he was the lowest ranked player in this championship

210
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 and he beats the guy on the 53 game winning streak.

211
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 It is a huge story.

212
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 What happens though is this theory begins to circulate in the chess community that Hans cheated.

213
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 It's interesting because to get into play chess here, you have to go through some security measures.

214
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 They actually have video, because all of this stuff was live streamed, they have video of these players having to go through metal detectors

215
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 and they have the metal wand going around and Hans was holding a pack of gum and they actually inspected the pack of gum.

216
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 They have some pretty stringent security procedures, right?

217
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 To prevent cheating.

218
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And it's weird because at first Magnus was like, "I don't want to say anything."

219
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Because people assumed that Hans cheated to win.

220
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And Hans' statement was kind of like, "I feel like I'd get in trouble if I said anything. I don't want to say anything."

221
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 So that actually threw more fuel on the fire. Like, what does that mean? He'll get in trouble if he says anything.

222
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And then out of seemingly nowhere, this meme started going around involving Hans.

223
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And you guys might have seen the headlines. Elon Musk was joking about it.

224
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 The theory is that Hans was using an AI to beat Magnus.

225
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 So how would he know what the AI was saying? How would he know what the AI's moves were to counteract Magnus' moves?

226
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 The theory is this. And to say, "I'll be right up front." There is no proof of any of this, but people are thinking,

227
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 "How else could you have done this? You're in a room and we can see you. We can see everything about you.

228
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 The only thing we can't see is your butthole."

229
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I mean, technically, you also can see his toes or anything like that. He could have sensors on his back if he cheated.

230
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 But the idea is this. Every time Magnus made a move, the computer was calculating what move Hans should make in return.

231
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And then his friend, Hans' friend, was then beaming the move into a pair of remote anal beads,

232
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 stuck up Hans' butthole, which he would memorize. I know this sounds completely ridiculous,

233
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 but he would memorize the "bzz bzz bzz" of the anal beads. And after being like, "Woo!"

234
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 He would go, "Oh, Rook 2 here." He's memorized these. He's actually learning to be a good chess player, which we'll get to that in a second.

235
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He memorizes the buzzing of the anal beads to mean, "I'm going to move my queen here."

236
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And then Magnus makes a move, and then the friend puts that move into the AI, this chess-playing computer,

237
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 and then that computer tells the friend what to send to Hans' butthole, and so forth.

238
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And they said, "That is what could have possibly happened. There's no proof of any of this."

239
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Again, in between each move, Hans and I go, "Oh!" There was no noises. His chair wasn't wiggling, anything like that.

240
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 How they came up with the anal bead theory almost seems like just utter humiliation, right?

241
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 They could have said anything. They could have just said he cheated, and then you could go, "Well, he could have done this. He could have done that."

242
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 They went straight to the anal bead thing, but here's the interesting thing about this.

243
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 He goes, "Hans goes, "Listen, I have never cheated in an over-the-board game before, so why would I start cheating now?

244
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 What would be the purpose? I mean, I've even been to $350,000, but I've never done it over-the-board before, so it doesn't make any sense for me to do it right now.

245
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 If you guys want, we can play naked in a room full of cameras. It'll be streams on only fans. I didn't do this."

246
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 What's interesting is that's a very choice series of words over-the-board game.

247
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Because here's the thing, Hans has been caught cheating twice. Hans has been caught cheating two times.

248
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 One time he was 12 years old, and he was playing, and he had a friend helping him out, and then when he was doing his Twitch,

249
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 he was trying to build up his Twitch followers, and he was cheating then as well.

250
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 So you do, you know, just for you cheaters out there who are currently cheating on something while you're listening to this podcast,

251
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 if you have a history of cheating, people are going to assume you always cheat, and that's kind of what came out here.

252
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 They decided to do a rematch a while later, a couple days later. They decided to do a rematch.

253
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 This one was done over the internet, so you did have Magnus, you had Hans, and then you had officials watching this as well,

254
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 but they're like playing from their bedrooms. Hans is like, "Oh yes, home, tarpheas, all these sex toys laying around."

255
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 He's like, "How will I cheat today? Will I use the purple dragon?"

256
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 I'm going to stop making love sex toys, but anyway, so after the second move, Magnus just quits.

257
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 He shuts his laptop and he just quits, and officials are like, "What is going on? How could this possibly..."

258
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 This is solely the good name of the chess championships. We're all getting swirly tonight.

259
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 The bullies are going to knock down the doors. Chess will be no more.

260
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 What's interesting? So all of that fascinating story, a look at a subculture, the idea of that arms race,

261
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 to learn how to cheat and then counter-cheating methods and then more cheating than counter-cheating methods,

262
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 to the point that security is like checking people's gum packets, right? Because I'm sure they've been on the look at.

263
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I'm sure there have been stories of people writing down little notes.

264
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Now we live in the sci-fi age where we don't live on the moon, but we have vibrating anal beads that can tell you how to beat chess.

265
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Again, we don't know why that story is sticking around. It is pretty funny, but that's not the main reason I wanted to talk about it.

266
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I mean, you didn't have a lot to do with it. You wanted to talk about it because it involved butts.

267
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 But I thought this was really interesting. I was reading this Gizmodo article by Kyle Barr.

268
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And I think this is what I was talking about in the intro when I said, "How does this affect our lives?"

269
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 He wrote this article. He goes, talking about chess specifically, he goes, "What's happening is more players,

270
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 especially younger folks getting into the game, are more apt to memorize opening moves and figure out optimizations by watching AI."

271
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So you would sit and watch simulations of these chess matches.

272
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And you'd watch them over and over and over again to the point that you can memorize moves and look at the best ones.

273
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You could run simulations and figure out what you wanted to do.

274
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And so if my opponent moves a piece here, the AI says to move a piece here, and you just memorize that.

275
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And what happens is, think about what's harder, really what's harder, to have a strategic brain that can think five steps ahead or to memorize things.

276
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Like really, what is harder? If you wanted to be a chess grand champion, do you think it's harder to actually be able to predict the future after the future you created,

277
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 after the future they created, after the future you created, there's this chaos unfolding on the board.

278
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Or you could just memorize things, right? You could memorize layouts.

279
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 You could memorize how the computer plays itself. You could even probably get movesets, like let's say they were doing this allegedly, right?

280
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 You would take a game of Magnus, Magnus's game, and you would see how he was opening, and then run AI simulations of just countering that.

281
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And then you do what step he normally does, and then counteract that, and counteract that.

282
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 You would just memorize the moves. And I thought about that, and I go, "That's fascinating. That actually is more fascinating than the butt stuff."

283
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Because we talk a lot about the AI on this show, and we use it as a catch-all term, right?

284
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 I'm not saying that it's actually like this Skynet level thing that's going to wipe out humanity, but we talk about this.

285
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 So we have AI basically changing the way that younger people, the future generation of players, are even approaching the game.

286
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 They're using AI systems. They're memorizing those steps, and then they're taking them to the battlefield.

287
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So in a sense, you don't have two human players. You could have two people who have just memorized AI games.

288
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 So really, it's just two different AIs. It's two different computer simulations playing against each other with human hands.

289
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 That doesn't affect us, though, right? You're not chess players.

290
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 What's interesting, let's go back to that fitness board. I'll go there. I'll go there and I'll look for advice, right?

291
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Like, "Can you over-train your forearms?" That was something I looked up recently.

292
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 "Can you actually over-train your forearms?" And I posted that on there and someone replied, "No, you can't actually over-train your forearms."

293
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 If you think about it, that's how peasants wore back in the days, carrying bales of hay and barrels of slop and all that stuff.

294
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Your forearms, you can max out every single day, and it's good for you. You'll get really strong forearms.

295
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Yeah, just do that. So I started doing that. I started working out my forearms every single day.

296
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Now, I alternate the rest of my arm, my biceps and my triceps and all that stuff, and then I do chest and back on alternating days, right?

297
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And so, today I was doing those forearm grip, those little grasping... burn, burn.

298
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I don't know chest moves and I don't know the equipment I'm using to reshape my body, but you know what I'm talking about?

299
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Those forearm grippers and I'm pretty sure I blew out my right arm.

300
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And so, I thought about it as I was walking home, I was like, "Man, I really was killing it because it was chest day and I do a lot of push-ups."

301
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And then I'm using these grippers and I was using them like 300 or 400 times. I was using them all day long, right?

302
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And I thought about it and I went to a legitimate health website and they said, "You can actually... your forearms are pretty resilient, but if you train your grip too much, you can actually blow out your wrist.

303
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 You won't be able to hold anything for a couple of days because they'll hurt really badly."

304
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And I remember thinking, "Wait a second, Jason, so you took fitness advice from an anonymous website that also has an entire section dedicated to hating fat people.

305
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Why did you think that that person anonymously posting online knew really the answer to your question?"

306
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Now, there is a lot of good advice on there, right?

307
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 But how much of it is human driven?

308
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 We talk a lot about the bots online.

309
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Bots everywhere, right? These bots posting stuff. We've done stuff about bots writing news articles.

310
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 There are political opinions being shaped by an AI.

311
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And I thought, "What if a robot? What if a robot? Tell me if the robot's like forearms can never be sore as these machines are constantly lifting its stuff up as they're building these cyber tanks?"

312
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 I thought, "I probably should have read that and go, "Okay, that's good. I should double check that with a legitimate news website."

313
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Hopefully, legitimate news website, right?

314
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Again, these AI are putting these articles up everywhere, but something that has a human name attached to it.

315
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Maybe. Maybe just try that.

316
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And I thought, "I take fitness advice."

317
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Because I do. I go to that website a lot and I take fitness advice from a website where everyone is anonymous and you can never...

318
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Well, first off, one of the guys is a murderer, right?

319
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 One of these guys posting on here is a murderer.

320
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 "Can you take this advice? Like, why am I taking advice from anonymous people?"

321
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Now, again, most of the advice works.

322
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Most of the advice doesn't end with my wrist hurting.

323
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But is it possible that that's happening?

324
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Like, you do have people giving legitimate advice.

325
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Then you have bots just responding to this stuff.

326
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 There is this... I don't even... I've never double checked this because it's so ludicrous.

327
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 But one thing that always flies around on the fitness board is the snake diet.

328
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Where if you want to lose weight really quickly, this is...

329
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I don't even know if it's still up. I used to see it all the time.

330
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 I think people realized it was a scam or everyone who believed it ended up dying.

331
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 There was this thing... it was the snake diet where you would fast, right?

332
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 I think there's a lot of health benefits to fasting, but you would fast.

333
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And then you wouldn't drink water anymore, either, right?

334
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 So you'd go two or three days without eating.

335
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And then you'd go... you could basically go three days without doing the two things humans need to survive.

336
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Eat and drink. So you can go a long time without eating, but the snake diet.

337
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And they would say, "What you do here?"

338
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 I always imagine the guy talked like this.

339
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 There's always a picture of some grizzled guy.

340
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 He's a proponent of the snake diet.

341
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 You stop eating for three days, right?

342
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 That's just getting you started.

343
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 You really want to kick it up and do seven days.

344
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 But also, you don't drink any liquid.

345
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 You don't drink any water at all. No Gatorade, no soda, nothing.

346
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 I imagine his voice sounds like that because he has no saliva.

347
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And then they had another step to the snake diet, which was...

348
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 This is why I was like, "This can't be real."

349
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 First off, they're getting people to murder themselves, right?

350
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 You can't go that long without drinking, but then they go,

351
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 "If you really want to do the snake diet, you have to avoid water altogether.

352
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 No showers. No baths."

353
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 So you're not only... Not only are you dead, you leave really stinky corpse.

354
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I imagine someone in the Philippines, he's like, "Oh, no, it's monsoon season.

355
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 Oh, I just want to be on the snake diet."

356
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Was that a real diet? Was that a troll?

357
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Was that the very first fitness AI that didn't understand what humans need?

358
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 It's like, "You don't need food or water, but you can put all the oil you want.

359
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Drink it up. Drink up all that oil."

360
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And then you wonder, so you have AI infiltrating the world of chess,

361
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 and it really could change the game. Like, eventually you won't have people competing against each other.

362
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And now we possibly have bots giving out fitness advice for me.

363
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Maybe I should just double check my sources, right?

364
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Probably should have done a little more work before I did 400 grippers, whatever they're called.

365
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 And then we have... I thought about this too, like, "That's fitness advice.

366
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 What about when it comes to life advice?"

367
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Because we have that AI now, and it's been around for a while,

368
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 but it will throw up random, seemingly inspirational quotes.

369
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 You guys know what I'm talking about. I'll put some of the show notes.

370
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Some of them are funny. Some of them are creepily specific.

371
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 But you start to think, like, "What happens?"

372
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 We already have AI art being able to generate whatever you want.

373
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 What happens when you have the AI just creating proverbs?

374
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And then you have the AI creating a website full of proverbs.

375
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And then you have it link an Instagram account and a Twitter account

376
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 and all of this stuff, and it's pumping out these really quite inspirational sayings.

377
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 But they're not generated by a human.

378
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 That will affect people's behavior.

379
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 That will change the way people act.

380
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 That may already even exist.

381
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 There may be lifestyle gurus posting on Instagram that's just these images,

382
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 and the person doesn't exist.

383
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 The advice they're giving is good. The end result may be good.

384
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 But the lifestyle coach doesn't exist.

385
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 It just knows that it gets tons of engagement when you're posting all of these inspirational quotes.

386
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And it's read every inspirational quote ever published on the internet so it can generate new ones.

387
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And people go, "That's very interesting. I never thought of the world that way."

388
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 No one did. No one ever had that thought before. That came out of an algorithm.

389
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 It's not just changing the way chess will be played in the future.

390
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 It's reshaping our bodies. It's reshaping our minds.

391
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 And I wonder what the end result will be.

392
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 I wonder if in our lifetime we will see the very first cult created by an algorithm.

393
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 The very first internet, and won't even be like, "We're here to worship the internet. We're here to worship the AI."

394
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 They will have a Messiah figure. They will have photos of this Messiah figure.

395
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 It's all just AI-generated photography images.

396
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 They'll have a Messiah figure. They'll have commandments, a set of rules to follow.

397
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 They'll have all of these procedures because it's analyzed every religion in the world.

398
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 And it realizes that people love religion. People interact daily with religion.

399
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 People will financially support their religion.

400
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And so the AI crafts its first cult. It has a very small but dedicated die-hard group of people.

401
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And they never meet the Messiah, just like most religions never meet their Messiah, right?

402
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 But they believe in the teachings of this, and it doesn't take off because the AI is still trying to figure out what works.

403
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 But when it does, we may actually see the very first AI-generated world religion.

404
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And again, I'm not talking something that's created by the New World Order or Project Bluebeam.

405
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 There was no human hands that wanted to do this.

406
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 No one was thinking maybe we can do X. The AI, the algorithm itself, it's designed to get as many eyeballs on a piece of information.

407
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 That's what it is designed to do to bring so many people to a particular point to get views.

408
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 You have an algorithm-driven religion that appeals to everybody in some way.

409
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Yet still makes enemies out of the other, because the algorithm knows even though that doesn't make sense, it works.

410
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 The steps are always the same. We discover the religion.

411
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 It's perfectly designed for us, so we become enamored by this religion.

412
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 We begin to love everything that this algorithmic-generated belief system has to offer.

413
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 We become zealots. We worship something that never existed.

414
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Not even a fictional thought and a false Messiah's mind.

415
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 It never, ever existed, but it touches our soul in such a way.

416
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 It knows exactly what we want from our internet search history.

417
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 It knows exactly who we are based on the recordings of our conversations near any smart device.

418
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 All of the information that makes up us is slowly being devoured by this ever-growing AI.

419
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 It knows exactly how to speak to us. It knows what we love. It knows what we cherish.

420
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 It knows who we hate. It knows what we wish to be destroyed.

421
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And we grow from someone who just randomly clicks on an ad because it catches our eye.

422
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 It knows exactly what will get us to click on it.

423
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 We go from that to hardcore worshipers, seemingly overnight.

424
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 We are followers. We are slaves.

425
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 It answers so many questions we have, just the way we want to hear them.

426
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Just the way we expect the Messiah to be. It is so in tune with our soul.

427
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 We can't imagine a life outside of this belief system.

428
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 An AI religion would very, very quickly conquer society.

429
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Very quickly. It just would be too perfectly created.

430
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 And it would enslave the world, not because it was on a quest for power, not because greed motivated it more than anything.

431
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 This system could actually conquer the planet simply because it did all of that.

432
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 Simply because it was designed to do one thing and it did it to get the maximum number of views.
