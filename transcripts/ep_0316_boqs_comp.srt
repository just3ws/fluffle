00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Is the San Francisco Bay haunted by a ghost boat that floats silently under the Golden Gate Bridge?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to the Pacific Northwest to meet a big foot that's not legendary for the size of its feet,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 but for the size of its genitalia today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Here's a little brain teaser for you to get the morning started.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 What do you think came first?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 The club, we're talking about caveman weapons here.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We're not talking about different places where you hang out.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 What do you think came first? A club or a spear?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And I know what you guys are going to say. It's a club because that's the easiest thing.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's just a branch you pick up swinging around.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 However, think about it, clubs are really inefficient.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 They can really only be used to like knock bats away and like hit saber-toothed tigers on the head,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 which while those are noble endeavors, if you were stuck in the woods,

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 you're like, "Ah, you fall out of an airplane, you survive the impact.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 You land on a bunch of spider cobwebs. They slow you down. Now you're in the middle of the jungle."

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 What's the first thing you're going to do?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You're going to find a sharp branch and get that.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I honestly think it was the spear.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I honestly think the first thing that a caveman did, not the very first thing,

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 obviously they ate and reproduced.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 They didn't appear on the planet and go, "Ah, stab you, Og."

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But I think a spear probably came first.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Someone probably picked up a big log and they go, "I'm going to smash you over the head with this."

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And the other guy's like, "I want to see you try."

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And they just stick them in the heart.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And that was my ancestor.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I'm descended from the first dude who stabbed another man with the spear.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But yeah, the clubs, I don't think lasted very long.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Making Mouse Club, not with Sandy.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So, we also have this.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We have a new Patreon.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Everyone say thanks.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I don't know why you're saying thanks to him.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I'm saying thanks to him.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 WillH, thank you so much for donating to the Patreon.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It really means a lot.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Really helps support the show.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Let's meet by stuff like Veronica.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Oh, and I bought a bunch of backup cables.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 My interface device, I bought one of those.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I bought everything that I need so in case something breaks, we're ready to go.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Because we were having that problem about two weeks ago.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm able to do stuff like that because of the Patreon.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'm able to buy all this backup stuff because of that.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 So I really, really appreciate it.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, just get the word out about the show.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 That helps out a lot as well.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Let's go ahead and get started now.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yesterday's episode kind of ended fairly abruptly because I just run out of time.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 We were doing Ghost Boats of the San Francisco Bay and I highlighted the Squando.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 That was one of them that I talked about.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But there was two in the Bay that I wanted to touch on.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 No pun into it.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Is that a pun if I say something and it just doesn't make...

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Can you touch a Ghost Boat?

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's really what I was getting at.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But anyways, where was I going with this?

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Oh yeah, Ghost Boats.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So in the San Francisco Bay, apparently there's two Ghost Boats.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We have the Squando, which was more of a ghost story that took place in San Francisco,

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 but it turns out it didn't.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 It took place somewhere else way before.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I love that.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I really was thinking about the story all day long.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 How interesting that was.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 But now we're going to the Tennessee that's interesting in its own way.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And again, both the story of the Squando and today's story about the Tennessee both came from like paragraph long ghost stories,

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 very, very short ghost stories.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And I started digging through the evidence like a little gopher.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And the evidence was a carrot and web pages was the dirt.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And I was looking for the particular carrot.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Anyways, digging analogy time.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I'm finding a carrot.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I found a carrot.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 What am I?

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Okay.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Okay.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Let's just talk about the boat.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Okay.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And then we'll get to the carrots.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 There are no carrots, by the way.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Well, there's facts.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Never mind.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 The analogy is confusing me.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 1853.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Let's hop in the Dead Rabbit Rowboat.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 We're rowboating all the way from Oregon.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 We're going back to San Francisco Bay.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 So choppy choppy waters.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 We're helping move some Colombians were like, Hey, can you deliver this to San Francisco while you're there?

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And I was like, Yeah, totally.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And you're like, No, dude, don't wait, why are there Colombians in Oregon?

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And why am I dumb enough to take their package?

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 But we do.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And you're like super suspicious.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 You're like, Oh, and I'm just sitting on this giant bale of white powder.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And we're like, Oh, you're about DE agents are flying by.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 They used to cut cocaine with anyways.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Anyways, that segway side, we're in San Francisco Bay and we didn't get arrested, which is good.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 We're in San Francisco Bay.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The year is 1853.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 So now they have a bunch of baking powder in 1853 San Francisco.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 What happened was there was a boat, a clipper.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 That's an old, that's word old timey boat as like sales and stuff.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Big, big old clipper.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I did all that stuff about drug running.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I can't even be bothered to find out what a clipper is.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Anyways, imagine a sleek boat with sales on it and would made a wood probably it's 1853.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Anyways, the SS Tennessee is sailing underneath the Golden Gate Bridge and it smashes into the rocks.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And people are like, Oh, that sucks.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And they all jumped off the boat and they named that place Tennessee Cove.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It's not called that anymore, but it used to be called Tennessee Cove.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And there was a popular story going around at the time that on foggy nights, you could still see the SS Tennessee floating underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 You have sailors talking about it.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Arr, Metis, did you see that clipper?

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And the other pirates like Arr, Metis, what's a clipper?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And they're like, they explain it better than I do.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And they're like, Arr, that makes sense.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And old salty sea sailor people really, really love this thing.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Seagulls tried landing on it.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I wonder if a seagull could land on a ghost boat.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 That's always the thing.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Can I get on a ghost boat?

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I wonder actually now if I think about it, there's ghost boats.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 If we accept that as a reality, are there ghost planes or ghost blimps?

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And I'm not saying you look up in the sky and you see a ghost plane, because that's just UFO.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Could you get on a plane that was a ghost and it fly away, like Wonder Woman?

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Or could you get in a ghost blimp and take the longest, most boring journey of your life?

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Could you get on a ghost boat?

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Could you walk on a ghost boat?

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Because if a ghost can walk in your house and not fall through the floor, there must be some sort of solid matter going on.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So it should be the inverse.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 If a ghost can walk in my house, I should be able to walk in a ghost's house, is what I'm saying.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Is kind of what I'm getting at.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Right?

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Anyways, we'll leave that one for the scientists out there.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 November 1942, the world is at war.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 The USS Kenneson is a boat, it's a destroyer actually, I believe.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You don't know what a destroyer, I know as much what a destroyer looks like as what a clipper looks like.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So it's a big metal boat that has guns on it, right?

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And it's sailing underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Now, you had a bunch of people standing on the boat, a bunch of sailors, a bunch of military officials standing on the boat,

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 not just random tourists who fell off the bridge and they're like walking around.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Boats going underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It's a foggy foggy night and then they hear, they don't hear anything.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I'm making that deal.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Do you see a clip?

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 A clipper sailing right next to him through the fog.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And they're like, Captain, Captain, look, port side and the captain looks and he goes, what?

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It's a ghost boat and everyone's like, it is.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And some people are like, yes, yes, it is the old tail.

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 There's an old salty, old salty sea dog onto this USS Kenneson.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 He has the pipe and he's missing the leg.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He's like, ah, the tails are true.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 The Tennessee, that's the boat.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 So anyways, that's basically the whole ghost story.

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So this boat ran aground.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 People have been seeing it on foggy nights and then historically in 1942 in November,

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 a USS Kenneson saw it, all the people, all the deckhands, all the swabbies saw the Tennessee sail right by them

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 as they're going underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So we do what Dead Rabbit Radio loves to do with this type of stuff.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 We investigate it.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Now I'm not going out there with a little tape recorder and EMF reader.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 I'm just swimming in the bay. Sharks are eating me and freezing to death.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I'm like, unusual cold spots as the freezing water splashes over my little digital thermometer.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 No, using the information from the story, the question is, is any of this real?

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And first off, you have to go, are any of these events real?

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's really hard to determine whether or not the haunting is real, but as I've learned over the course of this show,

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 sometimes the stories themselves are completely made up.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 So it's not that the haunting may be fake, it's that the story never existed, that none of these people ever existed.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So looking at this, I found some interesting stuff.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 First off, the USS Kenneson was a real ship stationed on the West Coast.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 It was a destroyer and it was patrolling the ocean or patrolling the sea, the coastline during World War II.

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So we definitely know that that was in San Francisco or at least on the West Coast at the time that this happened.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So that gives us a clue.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The SS Tennessee was a real boat. This is what I thought was interesting.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 So as I'm reading this story and as I was telling it to you, I say the boat ran aground,

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and there's no mention of casualties whatsoever.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So it's not like the boat is cursed or haunted or anything like that.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I did those haunted ghost boats of the Mississippi episode like 200 episodes ago.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Mass casualty events, all these boats.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Makes sense that the boats are haunted.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Squando had a dude with his head chopped off, a bunch of captains killed, supposedly haunted.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But this one, the boat runs aground and everyone just kind of gets off of it.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 So your question is, well what's funny is the original ghost story just says the boat crashed into the rocks.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So you would assume moms are like holding their babies in the waters like rising up and they're like, oh no, it's either you or me, baby.

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 They're touching the baby and then they do a straight breaststroke out of the boat.

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But no, everybody, not only does everybody, the boat, so the boat does exist.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 The boat did crash. Very detailed records on this.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Everybody got off the boat.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Not only did everyone get off the boat onto the rocks, but they were like unloading letters.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 They're like, oh, since everyone's here, let's start unloading all of our valuable supplies.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 They're like getting like bags of letters, a bunch of cotton, some suspiciously packed white bales from Columbia.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 They're like, oh, this is pretty cool. Let's put this over here.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And they're thinking, well, if all the packages are off and all the people are off, the water should lift the boat and the boat will sail back into the harbor and we can swim back to it and take control of it.

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 What happens is the water raises and then drops again suddenly and the boat just smashes down again.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So first it runs aground and then it gets lifted up by the water and smashed down.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And it's just destroyed at that point. They can't salvage the boat.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Three people did die, but they died on the journey.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So like one guy had like old timey disease number four and the other guy had old timey disease number eight.

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 One guy had tuberculosis. The consumption.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So they just died because it was 1853.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 But what's interesting, so nobody died on the boat, except for those people who were going to die anyways.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 The boat crashes. What does that have to do with whether or not it's haunted?

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 This is what I found absolutely fascinating. Honestly, I thought this was bizarre.

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 People loved this boat. They absolutely loved this boat.

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 This was a, basically when the boat, it was a very popular boat. People used it.

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It was kind of like a packet ship. You would deliver people and parcels all over.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 People loved it. Loved it. When the boat crashed, it had an obituary.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 This is from, I found this, this is from the Daily Alta, it's a California newspaper at the time.

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Here's a quote. She was a favorite craft and one of the best sea boats that plowed the Pacific Ocean.

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 She was the home, the pride, and the refuge of her officers and crew.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 "Many a tear as salt as the brine that surrounds her shattered whole has coarsed unbidden from manly eyes

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and sprung up involuntarily from the bold and courageous hearts of those whose pride and delight she was

218
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 as they have gazed on the last resting place of the gallant Tennessee."

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I think it's fascinating because a lot of times we talk about hauntings in the term of tragedies that take place.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 They're head-shopped off and their ghosts is haunting the place. People killing themselves and their ghosts haunting the place.

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 But again, when we look at the stuff, the inverse should also be true.

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Where you love something so much, you just can't let it go.

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And it's haunting you, quote unquote, haunting you, which we think of as being scary,

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 but it's more of just reminding you of the joy you once had with that person-placer thing.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 This boat was so beloved that old salty sailors wiping their eyes.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I'm not crying. Just got some salt in my eye 'cause I'm salty.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Newspapers were giving it tributes. People love this boat so much.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So does that prove that there's a ghost boat floating underneath the San Francisco Bay? No.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 But I think there probably is. I think it's probably something that was so beloved that people just couldn't let go of.

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And the boat just manifested back into reality.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Because the people who truly loved the Tennessee, when they saw that boat sailing through the fog, it wasn't scary.

232
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It wasn't a sign of doom or distress.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It was a sign of life after death, even for an inanimate object that they loved more than the sea itself.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Let's do a quick, I love that story. I think it's fascinating when we find hauntings from good hauntings, stuff that is haunting us to give us a good memory.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But we don't really hear about that as much. Let's do a very quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Now I gotta say, I feel like I've talked about this one before, but I went through my past episodes, notes, and I didn't see it.

237
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 So there's really nothing I can do to tell you anything more about this movie, though, than the title and the tagline.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's called, and there'll be a link in the show notes for the IMDB page, it's called RWD.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 RWD is in Rewind, like the short term Rewind.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 The tagline is they went hunting for ghosts, they found themselves instead.

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It's a feature length horror movie featuring only two actors. It's a found footage film.

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And anything else I can explain about it would absolutely ruin it.

243
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I had no idea what I was getting into when I put it in.

244
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And it's one of those movies that just builds out.

245
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And since you don't know how it's gonna start, you have no idea how it's going to end.

246
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Fascinating horror movie. Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So we're leaving behind San Francisco. Goodbye, Tennessee. Goodbye, SS, Tennessee.

248
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It's all toot toot. It doesn't have a, what would a boat, a wooden boat have?

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 I fell that ding-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-

250
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 British Columbia considered the Pacific Northwest. If it's not, then we're not in the Pacific Northwest.

251
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 If it's not, then we're in British Columbia area.

252
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And there we're gonna meet a tribe of Native Americans.

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 They're not Native Americans, they're Native Canadians.

254
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Natives called the Bella Coolas. Bella Coolas.

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Now this is a recommendation from our resident Bigfoot expert, Bennett.

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 He denies it. He sends me a ton of different stories to cover.

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 But I always picked the Bigfoot ones.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Now he has some really good ones coming up.

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But anyways, thanks Bennett. Bennett recommended this.

260
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 We're hanging out with the Bella Coola. And we're like, hey, we are from the future.

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 I'm Jason. This is...

262
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 I'm supposed to say your name whenever there's a pause like that.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 My name's Jason. This is...

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And so, and after the introductions, they go,

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 "So, why are you here?" And we're like, "Well, we heard that you're having a little bit of a 'bock' problem."

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And they're like, "Yes, yes, the box, the box. Come with me, young people."

267
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And we will talk about the box.

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So we go out into a field, a nondescript, non-racist field.

269
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I don't want to say like they go into a...

270
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I don't want to say like they're at a TP or a wigwam or anything like that.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 'Cause I don't know. Maybe they had buildings. I don't know.

272
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I don't know anything about the Bella Coola tribe.

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 We go to the middle of a field, okay? That's not racist.

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 We're sitting in the middle of a field and we go, "Oh, it's a beautiful field you have here."

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And they're like, "Yes, yes, yes it is."

276
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And it's very non-stereotypical. I'm like, "You're right."

277
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And so the Bella Coola chief goes, "Okay, here's the straight dope. This is what's going on."

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 "Many moons ago."

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So there's this bigfoot in the area and we're like, "Ooh, bigfoot."

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And he's like, "Yes, yes, bigfoot."

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 But this bigfoot's different.

282
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 So I found two different descriptions. Everything's the same, but some sources say that the box is actually shorter than a human,

283
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 which would make you think orangutan.

284
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But then other people are like, "No, not only is the box bigger than a human, it's almost bigger than a normal bigfoot."

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So that's the one detail that I couldn't mesh between my sources.

286
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But anyways, they're tall. They're hairy. We'll go with the tall version.

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 They're tall, they're hairy, they've got big old long arms.

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 They walk like a man, talk like a man, walk like a man. Why don't you?

289
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 He's singing that song and we're like, "What?"

290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And then he goes, and he doesn't even know the lyrics for the rest of the song, he goes, "Listen, they're big, bigfoot."

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You know what a bigfoot is, right? We're like, "Yes."

292
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So what makes these guys so special in the chieftains?

293
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Like, it will make you very inadequate, but they have giant penises, and you're like, "Oh, okay."

294
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Box have giant penises. Now, I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking the same thing.

295
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 How big is giant? Like, at what point does it go from being large to the first thing you notice?

296
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Now, they're bigfoot, so let's say they're seven or eight feet tall.

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Okay guys, that should be clear. We're talking about penises for the next 15 minutes.

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So you might want to shut the episode off, mom.

299
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You have a bigfoot seven feet tall. You figure it, like, down to his knees.

300
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 You'd be like, "That's giant. That's huge, right? That has to be like a good two or three feet."

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 These guys, it's so big, according to legend, they have to throw it over their shoulder.

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 They can't even carry it. It's so big. So, just throw it over like snuff-a-lufacus, just trunk.

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I wonder if it's hairy. I would imagine it was hairy.

304
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Imagine it was totally hairy. And also, it's most likely uncircumcised,

305
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 unless they have like a giant, sharp rock out there somewhere.

306
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Anyways, they wrap it around the back of their neck. Now, that's pretty--that's giant.

307
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 That's giant. But when we look at the legends of these guys, that's nothing.

308
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 One of the famous stories involving the boxes, there was a young native woman on a beach, like a river.

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 What's the sandy part of a river called? Probably a beach. It's probably just called a beach.

310
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Anyways, she walks down to the river, has a bucket. She's going to get some water in it, right?

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Take it back to the tribe. Take it back to a field where they live.

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 They're totally non-racist. And so, she's filling up the bucket full of water, and across the river,

313
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 [breathing heavily]

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 We have Bach vision. We're looking through his eyes across the river.

315
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I do little computer graphics of like Target acquired. [imitates sound]

316
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And so, the Bach comes out of the bushes and takes his penis and throws it across the river.

317
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Still attached to him. He doesn't detach and then throw it like a worm.

318
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 He basically throws it like a lasso. [imitates lasso]

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And it lands and on her--in her, it would probably be a more accurate term.

320
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Now, he's banging her from across the river.

321
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Now, I know what you're thinking. Again, I'm sure we're all on the same page with these Bachs.

322
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 How big was the river? [laughs]

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 So, here's my thing. Like, there is--if it's a river, you have a river, you have a stream,

324
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 you have a creek, and then you have a trickle.

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 A river would suggest several feet of--like, I'm thinking like 30 feet of water.

326
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 [imitates water]

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Going down a mountain or a hillside or whatever.

328
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 So, you--it can't just be wrapped around the back of his neck, dude.

329
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Like, unless his neck is 30 feet, he's like super broad shoulder, there's no way.

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He almost has to have one of those things that you have on the side of your house that you wrap a garden hose up in

331
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 to be able to throw it 30 feet. I'm just assuming 30 feet. It's a river.

332
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It wasn't a creek. And to be fair, come on.

333
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Even if it was a creek, that's still a good 12 feet.

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And you're like, "Jace, why are you coming up with these arbitrary distances?"

335
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 There's no geologist who goes, "That's not a creek. That's a river."

336
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Based on how wide it is. That's not how we determine this stuff.

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 But still. Still. Come on.

338
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I was thinking, if there was a hot check on the other side of like a trickle of water, a leaky faucet,

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 and I'm like, "Listen, lady, you're really hot, but I don't think I can go over this trickle of water.

340
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Apparently I'm a vampire now.

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 If one drop of water hits me, I'll turn into dust. Because the vampires turn into dust.

342
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 What dies when water hits it?

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Something, no. There's a mythological-- Vampires don't like crossing water,

344
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 but I thought there was a mythological creature that if you threw water on it, I guess I'm just thinking of whizzing a wuss.

345
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 So anyways, I'm the wicked witch of the west. I can't cross the trickle of water.

346
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 A river is way more than just throwing it over your shoulders.

347
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But he did, apparently, so he's banging this chick from the other side of the river,

348
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 and she can't move. She's completely frozen.

349
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And they kind of say it was more of like a frozen-- not necessarily frozen in fear, but frozen in like magically frozen hypnotized.

350
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And a bunch of dudes saw this going on, and they were trying to like pull it out, and they couldn't.

351
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 It was too strong. So one of them gets this thing called a "Sollaberry Leaf,"

352
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 which is a type of like little-- I had to do much research on those, too.

353
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 It's a little like berry that you eat, and apparently they're like, "Okay."

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 They're not the best berries, but they're not the worst.

355
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But they take the leaf, and apparently the leaf is razor sharp, which isn't true.

356
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I didn't find that when I was looking on how to pick up solid berries.

357
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 They ran at the penis with the leaf, and to the bigfoot, at least, to the bock, it is super sharp.

358
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 So he pulled his penis back so he didn't get chopped up with the leaf and ran away.

359
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 That's a very, very famous box story. So yes, giant penises, they can shoot over rivers, tributaries,

360
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 probably a small sea.

361
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 So the idea of having a cryptid with massive genitalia is amusing-- it's kind of amusing visual.

362
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 That's so heavy, you have to throw it over their shoulder.

363
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 However, these things have more tricks up their foreskin than the average cryptid.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 That's disgusting. That was a disgusting joke.

365
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Anyways, I'm going to leave it in.

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 What if you could hide stuff up in there?

367
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I guess if it was big enough, you'd keep your wallet in it.

368
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 It just folds over. It's like an ant eater.

369
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Now, apparently these things were all over the place in British Columbia,

370
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 and they said, actually, when the white men showed up, the Bella Cula was hearing from other tribes,

371
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 "Oh yeah, our bigfoot's left. Yeah, we don't see the Sasquatch guy anymore.

372
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Yeah, Wendic goes."

373
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But the Bella Cula, they could not get rid of these guys.

374
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 They were like cockroaches. They say, even when the white men showed up, these creatures still existed.

375
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And the last major sighting of these guys was in 1924, and you go,

376
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 "Well, Jason, bigfoot was seen in Arkansas back last week."

377
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And I'm like, "Well, yeah, somebody saw something."

378
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 We can't really say that it was bigfoot, but whatever, whatever.

379
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I'm not going to get into all that stuff.

380
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 What I'm trying to say is that these things were measurably large populations up until 1924.

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 They just couldn't get rid of them.

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 So you had, what happened is you had Europeans start to have run-ins with these things as well.

383
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 So these things, they've had the ability.

384
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 There's a story about this guy trying to outrun him in a boat.

385
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 His wife and his kid are in the boat, and the box start hunting them.

386
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And they see him on the shoreline, and they're like, "This is not going to be good, so he's rowing down the river."

387
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And the box actually raised the earth up.

388
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 He said that the river became like a stream.

389
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Uh-uh, see? There is a difference.

390
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And the boat started to run aground.

391
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So originally it was a river. He jumped out. Now it's like knee deep.

392
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 The box were able to like control the, basically the water was the same, but they lifted the earth under the water.

393
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And he said he had to push his boat all the way to the fort as the box were running along the shoreline.

394
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So it's kind of weird. You very rarely see cryptids with geomancy, like these level of powers.

395
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 But I thought a more interesting story was, just because it's so funny, there's this dude hanging out with his buddies.

396
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 This was a European guy, he's hanging out with his buddies, right?

397
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And he sees a balk up on the hill, because again, these things are very well known.

398
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 They weren't supposedly legendary to the people who live in the area.

399
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And all of this stuff could be 100% fake, by the way.

400
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I have no proof any of these stories ever happened.

401
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I wasn't able to research them more than just the legends.

402
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 But anyways, this dude is chilling with his buddies, and they're just drinking whatever they drink back then, mead.

403
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And he sees a balk up on a hill collecting clams.

404
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Oh wait, that's what they were doing. They were collecting clams too.

405
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 So this dude was hanging out by the beach, by the river, collecting clams.

406
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Clams live in the river? They must have been by the sea.

407
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Because I don't think there's clams in the river, unless they accidentally get washed down.

408
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 But anyways, the point is, there's this dude and his buddies are collecting clams.

409
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And they look up and up on this rocky mountain pile thing, pile of rocks, they see a balk, collecting clams.

410
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And the dude goes, "I'm gonna blow its brains out. I'm gonna go kill that thing."

411
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 But he's like, "Really?" And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, watch my clams. I'm gonna go up there and I'm gonna shoot him in the face."

412
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 He sneaks up, he has his musket, right?

413
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And he sees the balk, and he says, "The balk looked like he knew something was up.

414
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 The creature looked like he knew he was being watched, but he really wanted to get some more of those sweet, sweet clams."

415
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 So he's like, picking the clams up and putting them somewhere, and the guy sees where he's putting them, and he goes and he hides behind a giant pile of clams.

416
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Which must be the most smelly hiding spot ever.

417
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And he has his musket there, and he's like, "Click."

418
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 He's waiting, and he sees the balk have an armload of clams, and right before the balk drops all the clams on the pile, the dude jumps up,

419
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 he's like, "Gotcha, ya son of a click."

420
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 [Barking]

421
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And the musket just explodes, like straight up Bugs Bunny, peels back metal, guy has a black face, and the balk books it.

422
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 He loses all of his clams, too.

423
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 The guy goes back and he's like, wiping the soot off of his face.

424
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 "What happened, man? We heard an explosion."

425
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 He's like, "Yeah, thanks for checking on me."

426
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I had this gun level right with his eyeballs, dude.

427
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I was about to just blow this dude's head off all over the clams.

428
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 My gun exploded, and they go, "Oh, it must have been a defective gun."

429
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And he slaps him.

430
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 "No, the gun's not defective, you idiot. You didn't let me finish."

431
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 The balk magically made my gun blow up.

432
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So that's the level of power we're talking about with these things.

433
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And you go, "Jason, they just raised the earth. Who cares if they make a gun blow up?

434
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You should have told those stories in reverse order."

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "A defective bullet can make a gun blow up. I can stick my finger in a gun and make it blow up.

436
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 I can't lift the earth."

437
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 "Yeah, yeah, you're right."

438
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 But I thought that story was more entertaining than just a family fleeing for their life as the earth was moving under their feet.

439
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So that's the story of the box.

440
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Is there really a Bigfoot tribe with Genitae Leia so massive they can throw it across the river?

441
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Is there still a Bigfoot out there that has junk that's so heavy they have to wrap it over their shoulder to just be able to walk?

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I think that is as realistic as any Bigfoot story out there.

443
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And so I will say yes.

444
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 From now on, when someone asks me, because the conversation always comes up because of what I do with this podcast,

445
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 people ask me, "Do you believe in ghosts?"

446
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 I go, "Yeah, yeah. Do you believe in aliens?"

447
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 I kind of go over it. Give them a brief overview of what I think.

448
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But from now on, when people go, "What do you think about Bigfoot?"

449
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 I'm like, "I don't know. Bigfoot might be real, but let's go out to a field. Let's have a talk. Let's talk about the box."

450
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 They'll be like, "I'm not doing any of those things."

451
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And I'll be like, "Well, you asked if I believed in Bigfoot."

452
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 So I said, "You're not going to go to the field with me. I'll tell you right now.

453
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Bigfoot might be real, but if Bigfoot is real, then so is the box."

454
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 If you want to learn more about that, let's go out to this field.

455
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 No, seriously, like, if Bigfoot's real, the box is real.

456
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I was really wondering what I was going to say. I just said that two minutes ago.

457
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I'm just trying to figure out a way to end this. Oh, here's a way to end this.

458
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 So the next time you hear a story about a group of Sasquatch hunters lurking through the darkness, guns ready, or simply cameras ready,

459
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 to find proof of a real-life Sasquatch.

460
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And when the hunt turns to a chase, when the hunter themselves hear the cry of battle feel hot breath on the back of their neck,

461
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 and realize that they are now being pursued by the very creature they set out to look for,

462
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 as they're running through the pitch black forest, they're looking for a place to hide,

463
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 and they hide behind a fallen tree.

464
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 [panting]

465
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Hope I'm safe here.

466
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And that's when they realize the fallen tree is moving like a snake through the darkness.

467
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 That's when they realize that that log is actually a living creature's giant penis.

468
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 And that is when they realize they are about to be crushed to death by the whip-like weapon that only the buck can wield.

469
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I'm talking about its penis, in case you missed it.

470
00:31:32,000 --> 00:32:00,000
