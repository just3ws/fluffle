1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 The ghost of a little girl haunts the creepiest location.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,460
 And then we take a look at a lake monster that destroyed the town built next to it and brutally

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:21,480
 savage the farmlands around it until it finally met its match today on Dead Rava Radio.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,360
 Hey everyone and welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,680
 We've got a lot to cover today so we're gonna go ahead and jump in here right now.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,520
 So I actually got an email recently from a listener named Austin and we talked about

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,680
 a couple things via email but one of the things that he said was why aren't there any, he

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,840
 actually had two points, why aren't there any ghost cavemen, why don't we see any ghost

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,880
 cavemen and why aren't there a lot of haunted office buildings and department stores and

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
 things like that.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,400
 Now I'll get into the caveman thing in another episode but there are, you know it's funny

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,600
 because I said the Walmart and Hood River is haunted.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,480
 There's actually a ghost apparently in the hardware department which is funny because

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,520
 it used to be the fabrics and crafts department and then they did a remodel of the store so

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,240
 the fabrics and crafts department got shortened, got made smaller and the hardware department

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,920
 is now where most of the fabrics and crafts were and since they did the remodel, employees

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,040
 don't like being over there by themselves late at night.

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,640
 Stuff will get knocked over, they say cans fall off the shelf.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,600
 I don't know if there's any video proof of any of this, I've just heard it from the

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 workers there.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,200
 Stuff gets knocked off the shelf, signs will get knocked over, you feel creeped out while

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,040
 you're standing over there and my theory and I shared this with Austin, my theory is that

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,200
 there may have been a ghost of an old lady who's favorite thing in the world was fabrics

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
 and crafts.

27
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,080
 It's not my thing, I don't like that type of stuff but you know a lot of people do and

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,120
 so she was really into it and her ghost was like I want to spend eternity looking through

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,320
 all the fabrics and kind of watching the young girls and their moms pick out scrapbooking

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,840
 supplies and go man their lives boring but once they remodeled it to the hardware imagine

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,000
 being the ghost of a little old lady stuck around carburetors and power tool sets and

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 since then stuff's getting knocked over, that's always been my theory.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,520
 Now again it could just be a bunch of workers are paranoid or they just don't want to work

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,280
 over there and they go no no there's a ghost over there, I don't want to work over there

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 tonight.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,120
 Put me in the video game section but there is another, I found another Walmart ghost.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,240
 Now I've stumbled across this website, I've used them a couple times before but they've

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,840
 really started to lose their credibility recently and we'll cover that in an upcoming

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,720
 episode but there's a website called Backpackerverse and they do these stories about ghosts and

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,480
 they're just so so poorly sourced they're hilarious but this one there might be something

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
 to it I don't know.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
 This one is in Oxnard California.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,440
 Apparently there's a Walmart there in Oxnard California and you're walking through the

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
 Walmart.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,760
 You're there to buy your video games and your laundry detergent and some new pants and a

46
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,840
 picture frame that's the best thing about Walmart you can pretty much buy everything

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
 there.

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,120
 But for some reason you go to the toy aisle, maybe you're there to pick up the latest,

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,280
 my little pony toys, is that still even a thing or are there still like bronies and

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
 stuff like that?

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,920
 It's been so long, it seems like such a f- I don't even know if the show's still on

52
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,920
 but anyways, you know the show's still on and you're there to buy the latest Rainbow Dash

53
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
 toy.

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
 They got a new one, it talks.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,720
 So you're walking down the aisle and you see a little girl standing in the little girl

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,520
 toy aisle and you're thinking that's typical, I don't even know why I registered that, there's

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,160
 a bunch of little girls here and me buying my little pony toys.

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:50,080
 But this little girl, she's just standing there and you're like, "Oh that's weird, girls

59
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,200
 are normally seen in themselves or if they do it's like Taylor Swift or something."

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,360
 And then she turns to you very slowly and dramatically.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,480
 Maybe she flickers a bit like the ring.

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,400
 I don't know if she does that but anyways this little girl turns, they're just trying

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
 to make a groove here.

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,160
 This little girl turns to you, she looks at you and her eyes.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,880
 She stares at you with milky white eyeballs.

66
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 Looks right at you.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,240
 And that's when you notice she's covered in blood.

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,760
 She smiles and right when she smiles, right when you register there's this bloody little

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,040
 girl in front of you with milky white eyes, she vanishes.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
 Now if that happened to me, the first thing I would do was to make sure that I wasn't

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
 on any sort of drugs.

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,120
 I'd be like, "Did I take acid today?"

73
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,320
 No, no, I didn't take shrooms.

74
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,160
 I would run a mental check to see if I took any drugs.

75
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,760
 But I would still have to wonder, like maybe someone slipped me something.

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,560
 And then I would go to security and go, "Hey listen guys, I don't know you and you don't

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,920
 know me but you can either make fun of me or we can make a million dollars.

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,760
 Let's watch this video and see if there's a little girl in this aisle."

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,560
 And if there's nothing, make fun of me but if there is something, we can sell it to whoever

80
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,240
 buys this sort of nonsense.

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
 We sell it to the Sci-Fi channel.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,520
 So apparently a lot of people have seen this little bloody girl in this toy aisle in Oxnard,

83
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
 California.

84
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,120
 There is a quote in an unsourced quote in this article about a woman who saw this thing.

85
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,560
 This is the direct quote, "The first time I saw her, I just about died and went up to

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
 Jesus."

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,000
 Now, on the one hand, immediately when I read that quote, I go, "Black woman said that."

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And you could go, "That's racist."

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,160
 But I don't think it's racist because I don't think this quote's real.

90
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
 So I think the person who made up this quote is racist.

91
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
 Does that make sense?

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,320
 They might as well just put, "Laudy, laudy, laudy.

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 When I first saw her, I thought I'd die and went up to Jesus."

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,280
 That is, come on, if you're going to make up a quote, don't make up a stereotypical quote.

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,080
 I don't think this person existed.

96
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,760
 I don't see why they wouldn't put their name in this thing.

97
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,880
 The whole article is poorly sourced.

98
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,280
 But I want to believe, not that the writer can make up racist quotes.

99
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,200
 I don't want to believe that.

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,680
 But I want to believe in little ghost girls, or just ghosts in general.

101
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,120
 I think it would be interesting if you actually had proof of this.

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,000
 If you had a place that you could go to where you will see a ghost multiple times.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,240
 Now, again, supposedly this girl's always hanging out here, so I don't know why it's

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,000
 not being swarmed by ghost hunters because it happens so regularly.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,160
 This quote here, the first time I saw her, I just about died and went up to heaven.

106
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,200
 That means she saw her multiple times, but again, the person's not, there's no proof

107
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
 or anything like that.

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,720
 And to top it all off, because it's 2019, sometimes this little girl is spotted in the

109
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,360
 boys' toy aisle.

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
 So she's progressive.

111
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,560
 You don't tell her where to go.

112
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,400
 Sometimes she wants to play with Barbies.

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,880
 Sometimes she wants to play with GI Joes.

114
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,360
 If they still make those, I don't know.

115
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,080
 Sometimes she wants to play with Barbies.

116
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,120
 Sometimes she wants to play with the Avengers.

117
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,440
 But then you see her just handling the Black Widow doll and you're like, "That's what I

118
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
 figured."

119
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,560
 She's not as progressive as you thought.

120
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,560
 But that is the story of the bloody ghost girl from, the actual name of the article

121
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,400
 was the bloody ghoul of Walmart.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,360
 I expected a little bit more than a girl covered in blood.

123
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,760
 I don't know, that actually sounded quite grim.

124
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,160
 I mean, oh, and the theory is, is that she was a Hispanic girl who was killed before

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,280
 the Walmart was built.

126
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,720
 But again, there's no proof of any of this at all.

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,640
 Suckerverse comes out with these articles that basically are almost 100% fiction and

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,400
 they get suckers like me to click on them and then read them and then go, "Well, I want

129
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,560
 it to be true, but it probably isn't."

130
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,720
 And you guys are racist for, if you're going to make up a quote, don't make up a quote

131
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 like that.

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,520
 Just be like, "Hey, you know the first time I saw him, I was like, "Oh no, a bloody ghost."

133
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,000
 Not, "I just about died and went off to Jesus."

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Sorry.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,320
 Why would you quote?

136
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,240
 Why would you make up that quote?

137
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,680
 Although maybe I'm wrong.

138
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,760
 Maybe the fact is, why would someone make up that quote proves that the quote is real.

139
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,880
 I don't know.

140
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,680
 If you live in Oxnard, California, go to that Walmart.

141
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,440
 Check my, here, there's a history of backpackerverse websites where they'll have this article

142
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,560
 and then the comments will be like, "That place isn't haunted."

143
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,880
 I've been there 100 times, it's not haunted.

144
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,560
 They get facts wrong all the time.

145
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,320
 So again, I'm thinking they made up a racist black quote to add some color, no pun intended,

146
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,920
 to this made up article about a bloody Hispanic girl who plays with girl and boy toys.

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,120
 It's very, very diverse, very diverse hoax, backpacker universe.

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,840
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

149
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,400
 We're going to modern day Palmdale, California.

150
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,280
 It's near Arizona, but it's in California.

151
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,680
 It's a little, it's a little region.

152
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
 It's a little geographical spot on earth.

153
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,520
 And specifically in Palmdale, there is a place known as Elizabeth Lake.

154
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,200
 Not Lake Elizabeth, Elizabeth Lake.

155
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,720
 And we'll get to that maybe, that's part of the story is dumb.

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,760
 But anyways, it's called Elizabeth Lake.

157
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,360
 But before it was known as Elizabeth Lake, it had a more evocative name.

158
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:10,440
 In the year 1780, there was a Spanish explorer/priest named Junipero, Junipero, Sarah.

159
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,360
 Now he's an explorer/priest.

160
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,680
 Here's a little tip from a D&D player, old D&D player.

161
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,120
 I haven't played in a while, but never split your class because then you can never specialize.

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,280
 You never get the good stuff.

163
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,160
 He should have just been an explorer or a priest.

164
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,200
 But if he was a priest, he probably never would have found this place.

165
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,680
 But he would be able to fight the undead much more effectively.

166
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,520
 He comes across this beautiful, beautiful lake.

167
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,560
 And the natives in the area tell him, yeah, it looks really sweet here.

168
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,480
 And it would be a nice place to raise cattle.

169
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,080
 And the priest is like, yeah, I was thinking that too.

170
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
 I was thinking about splitting my class again and being a rancher.

171
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,880
 And they're like, yeah, don't do that.

172
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
 Don't do triple classes.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Come on, even we know that.

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
 And we've never even seen a 20-sided die.

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
 But it seems like a beautiful place to raise cows and stuff like that.

176
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,960
 But there's a monster in the water.

177
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 Priest is like, what?

178
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
 I don't know.

179
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,080
 Okay, you know, back then there were monsters everywhere.

180
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
 Actually, he probably would say, what?

181
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
 He probably didn't even write down his notebook.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,560
 He's like, yeah, another monster.

183
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
 There's monsters everywhere.

184
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,160
 But it was then named Laguna del Diablo, which basically is the Devil's Lake.

185
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,440
 Now you would say, and then he just scurried on and went on to his next adventure.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,160
 So he named it Laguna del Diablo.

187
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,880
 Now, like most places called the Devil's Lake, people were still like, ah, yeah, it's

188
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
 probably just a legend.

189
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,200
 So they started finding this beautiful lake.

190
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,840
 And they're like, this is a perfect place to raise cows, right?

191
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
 Natives?

192
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
 And the natives are all gone at this point.

193
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,320
 They've all basically been run off the land.

194
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,120
 So no one was there to tell them, hey, no, no, no, there's a monster here.

195
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,280
 And so settlers, though, now there's just a bunch of settlers moving through the area.

196
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,260
 Even though they had no natives there to warn them of the legends, they would start to see

197
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,440
 stuff in the water.

198
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,560
 Sometimes it was just a glimpse, a head poking out of the water, a noise at night, a spooky

199
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,400
 noise at night, not just any noise.

200
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,160
 And they would be like, that's kind of creepy.

201
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
 Let's move on.

202
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
 Let's leave this place.

203
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
 That was kind of spooky.

204
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 And they're like, really?

205
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,760
 So bobbing in the water, you're going to leave?

206
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,080
 I think it was more than just a log.

208
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,680
 And over the years, the description of this creature kept getting added to.

209
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
 Now, this is one of those things.

210
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,120
 We've seen Loch Ness Monster type beasts.

211
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
 We haven't seen them, but we've heard of Loch Ness Monster type beasts.

212
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
 They're basically those swimming Brontosaurus creatures.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 What are they?

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Plastiosaurus or something like that with the paddles instead of the feet?

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 It seems sucky.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
 I'd rather have feet.

217
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,840
 But anyways, it's always like this.

218
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
 Not this one.

219
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
 Not this one.

220
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,320
 It's just your time with just a sea monster story.

221
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,880
 This creature, check this out.

222
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,960
 This is what I was like.

223
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,680
 This thing is either the most badass thing that's ever walked the earth or 100% fake.

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,880
 And we'll get into that in a bit.

225
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,480
 A massive creature, 50 feet long.

226
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,600
 So right there, you're like, boom, dinosaur sizes.

227
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,680
 Massive creature 50 foot long.

228
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,240
 Huge wings of a bat.

229
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,840
 I bet you didn't expect a flying lake monster, dude.

230
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,280
 The neck of a giraffe, that's pretty standard for these type of creatures.

231
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,240
 That kind of puts it into that Brontosaurus character.

232
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,640
 Head of a bulldog.

233
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,240
 Just a flattened little mug head.

234
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
 What is it?

235
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 Not a mug.

236
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,920
 A little pug head attached to the neck of a giraffe all swinging around.

237
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 Six legs.

238
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
 That's pretty dope.

239
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,560
 Look at that Loch Ness monsters getting jealous right now.

240
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
 Bat wings.

241
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,040
 You got six legs.

242
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,680
 And I don't know if this is a benefit or a con, a pro or a con.

243
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,040
 Horrible horrible stench when it goes flying.

244
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,360
 So you could say, Jason, that's obviously a con.

245
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,640
 Who wants to be stinky?

246
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,080
 But it's a perfect weapon.

247
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
 Especially if you're living alone.

248
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,440
 If you live by yourself, if you're a monster all by yourself, why not stink as bad as you

249
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
 can?

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,760
 Because then you don't ever have to worry about anyone.

251
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,920
 I wonder how bad Shrek smelled.

252
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,560
 It's always the funny thing when you watch movies.

253
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,960
 They can really give us pretty much any sensation but smell.

254
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
 And touch.

255
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,420
 But touch you can kind of like look at something and go, oh that's quite spiky.

256
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,640
 Or that looks soft.

257
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,320
 That looks super cuddly.

258
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,920
 But with just like, I wonder how Shrek had to smell like human waste that was sitting

259
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 in the sun.

260
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
 Every character should have been like, oh god.

261
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,720
 He bathed in dirt.

262
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,520
 So you wonder, like yeah, in all of these movies, all these cuddly monsters, monster

263
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,960
 squad, that must have been the smelliest weekend for those kids ever.

264
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,560
 They're fighting decaying flesh and all sorts of horrible things.

265
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
 Gross werewolves.

266
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,760
 You can't really replicate smell.

267
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,880
 Zombie movies would smell absolutely terrible.

268
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,400
 Like you're like, Jason, that's a bit of an understatement.

269
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,440
 But imagine like Dawn of the Dead when they're on the roof of that mall, the remake, which

270
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,560
 was my favorite.

271
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,160
 Just the smell of armies of the dead, all that rot.

272
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,480
 Plus all the flies would be flies and maggots everywhere.

273
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,840
 Movies can never really capture smell.

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,400
 But anyway, so imagine this guy smelling like Dawn of the Dead meets Shrek when he's flying

275
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
 around.

276
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,800
 So people would show up, they would catch glimpses of the monster, they would leave.

277
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,680
 And again, there was no one ever really there to tell them, hey, don't go here, there's

278
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,040
 a big old monster.

279
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,920
 In 1830, there was a guy named Don Pedro Carrillo.

280
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
 And he goes, oh, this is a perfect place to raise cattle, because it really was a perfect

281
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
 place to raise cattle.

282
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,320
 So he puts up all of his cattle, and he's there for a bit of time.

283
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,000
 But then one day, his ranch is completely burned down.

284
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,640
 Every building's completely torched, and he leaves.

285
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,960
 Now it doesn't really say how often he sighted the monster, but apparently he thought that's

286
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
 what was going on.

287
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,320
 In the 1850s, there was various American settlers coming to the area.

288
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,240
 The American settlers eventually set up a town on the banks of the Devil's Lake.

289
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,280
 They were probably hoping to call it something a little better, and again, we'll get to that

290
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
 stupid story.

291
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
 But anyways, it was called the Devil's Lake.

292
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
 They set up this town, but what happened was at night they would hear screaming, they'd

293
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 hear a lot of screaming in the forest, not like sexy, sexy screaming coming from the

294
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,600
 brothel.

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
 That actually sounded really bad.

296
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,440
 Screams of fascism is what I meant, not screams of human enslavement.

297
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,400
 But like sexy, sexy screaming, they would hear unnatural voices.

298
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,520
 So who knows what that could be?

299
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,240
 That could be a guy who sounds like he's underwater or could just be some foreigner speaking in

300
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,960
 another language, and they're like, "Oh, that guy's not from around here.

301
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
 Let's move."

302
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,840
 And they would also experience terrible visions, terrible psychic visions.

303
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,240
 So I think at this point you're realizing this is something more than just a lake monster.

304
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,960
 Now I have my theory, but before we get to my theory, the settlers moving away.

305
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,400
 And at this point there was a guy who came into town called Don Chico Lopez.

306
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,680
 And he's like, "I'm gonna set up a huge ranch.

307
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
 I see that there's abandoned town here.

308
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,960
 I see that there's a bunch of burnt out buildings over there.

309
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,440
 I don't know what happened.

310
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
 I don't care.

311
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
 I'm gonna set up a big old ranch."

312
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 He sets up a big old ranch.

313
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,680
 And for a couple months he had no problem at all.

314
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,760
 Now one of the issues was is that whenever someone new would come to the area, the previous

315
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,400
 occupants were already gone.

316
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,200
 By the time the American settlers got there, the ranch that was set up, they got burned

317
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,520
 down, that dude was gone.

318
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,960
 By the time that guy got there, all the natives were gone.

319
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,880
 So people just kind of kept stumbling across ruins of previous settlements and going, "This

320
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,960
 is a perfect place to raise our cattle.

321
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
 We're all alone."

322
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,160
 And they weren't wondering why there were abandoned buildings on the edge of this lake.

323
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,640
 But when Don Chico Lopez came in, he didn't really care.

324
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,520
 He set up this massive ranch and for a couple months, absolutely no problems.

325
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,560
 But what happened was he started having cattle disappear at night.

326
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,560
 Like not like he comes out and there's like a dead cow.

327
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,000
 The cow's gone.

328
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,960
 And it's happening so commonly that he starts to put two and two together and thinks, "Something's

329
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,480
 stealing my cattle."

330
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,920
 So one night him and his ranch hands stay up and they see this creature come up out of

331
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,000
 the lake and begin to descend on the cattle.

332
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,840
 Basically like a raptor, a bird of prey would fly out of the river, grab cows and take them

333
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
 back underwater.

334
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
 They're shooting it.

335
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,440
 All him and all of his ranch hands are opening fire with these old-timey rifles.

336
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,240
 Bullets are straight bouncing off this dude.

337
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,560
 He's like smog, but he has no weak point.

338
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,840
 Bullets just...

339
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,920
 He's flying down just eating cows.

340
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,480
 And he did that all the time.

341
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,720
 He just kept coming because he knew they couldn't stop him.

342
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,640
 Eventually Don Chico Lopez has to leave.

343
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,320
 He's just simply losing too much cattle.

344
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,680
 But at this point, we got a new character show up into the story.

345
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,200
 Now the people who have heard me in my Christmas episode, I talked about that I'm Bask.

346
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,120
 My ethnicity is Bask.

347
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,400
 There's only like two million of us left on the planet.

348
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
 So whenever there is a Bask person shows up in a story, I'm like, "Oh yeah, here we

349
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
 go baby.

350
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,160
 Here we go."

351
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,480
 Little bit of that ethnic pride my friends.

352
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,800
 Bask farmer, there's this Bask farmer named Miguel Leonis.

353
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,560
 Direct descendant of Leonidas and future ancestor of Optimus Prime.

354
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 Yes, we are born from heroes.

355
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,400
 Anyways, Miguel Leonis comes to town.

356
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,760
 Apparently historically he was a total jerk.

357
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,720
 He was actually considered like a dictator.

358
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,880
 He owned huge swaths of land in California.

359
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,120
 And he didn't treat people that well.

360
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 And since he owned a bunch of land, squatters would come and live on his land.

361
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,240
 And he would send armed guards to go and beat up these settlers.

362
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,840
 They're like, "No, we're just sitting, we just sat down underneath the rock."

363
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,080
 So not the nicest man in the world, but he was just getting his job done.

364
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,720
 He was doing what he needed to do.

365
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,760
 So he goes, he's like, "I'm building a ..." It's almost like he knew there was a monster

366
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,360
 here because he came prepared.

367
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,080
 So he's there, he sets up a huge cattle ranch pretty much the same size as Don Chico Lopez's.

368
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,760
 Miguel sets up this massive cattle ranch.

369
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,880
 And the same thing starts happening almost immediately.

370
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,440
 The giant monster's coming out of the water, begins eating his cows.

371
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,800
 And he's like, "I'm not leaving.

372
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,760
 Not only am I not leaving, let's set up an ambush."

373
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
 People are like, "What?

374
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 People are working on this farm?

375
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
 What are you talking about?

376
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
 It's a 50-foot-tall flying monster with six legs and bat wings.

377
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
 You want to set up an ambush?"

378
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,800
 And he's like, "Did I stutter?

379
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 Get your guns.

380
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 We're setting up an ambush."

381
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,680
 Well, the other people don't want to do this, right?

382
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,040
 And so, anyways, one night the creature comes out to just get a little snack.

383
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,400
 Now the creature is the good guy basically in this story because of what's about to happen.

384
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
 This creature is just doing what it does.

385
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 It eats cows.

386
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 That's what it does.

387
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,000
 I don't know what it was eating before people showed up when there were no cows, but anyways,

388
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,680
 it's eating these tasty, tasty cows, breaking them open, drinking their delicious milk,

389
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
 eating some meat.

390
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,680
 So one night the creature does come and it's the same effect.

391
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,560
 The animals are loading their guns on this creature and the bullets are just bouncing

392
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 off of it.

393
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,280
 Well, eventually the creature doesn't care.

394
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,440
 It lands to go eat a cow.

395
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,080
 Miguel, this badass rancher, runs up to the creature and takes his gun and smashes it in

396
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
 the nose with the butt of his rifle.

397
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
 "Oh, my nose!

398
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,880
 I'm just trying to do what I do."

399
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,240
 But Miguel didn't care.

400
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
 Miguel beats up squatters.

401
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,120
 Miguel beats up humans down on their luck.

402
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,160
 He doesn't care that this creature is only following instinct.

403
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,360
 As the creature is rubbing his nose, he climbs...

404
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,240
 We'll get into whether or not this story is true in a second, but this is the legend.

405
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,560
 And relatively recently, again, this was like in the 1860s this happened.

406
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,720
 As the creature is rubbing its nose, Miguel runs up and punches it in the eyeball.

407
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,660
 This bulletproof monster that's been plaguing people for over a hundred years, Miguel punches

408
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,120
 it in the eyeball.

409
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,480
 And then releases the worst stench possible, like worse than normal, as a defensive measure.

410
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,440
 And they watch it fly into Arizona.

411
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,040
 Now again, I know that Palmdale's close to Arizona, but I don't know if they could just

412
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,680
 be like, "Yep, he's left the state."

413
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
 Flew away.

414
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,560
 Now, there's been a connection between that creature and a couple years later another

415
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,920
 creature was killed in Arizona.

416
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,160
 And they say that was the Thunderbird, the famed Thunderbird photo of the five guys standing

417
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,000
 in front of the dead pterodactyl corpse, which is a fake photo.

418
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,520
 A lot of people keep saying that it's real, but it's fake.

419
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,720
 The first time it was ever really seen was on that show, "Irie Indiana."

420
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,440
 It was like viral marketing for "Irie Indiana."

421
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,040
 And it's fake.

422
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,320
 But anyways, they're saying that that creature may have been the pterodactyl killed in that

423
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,640
 photo, but it doesn't even match.

424
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,760
 The pterodactyl is 50 feet long.

425
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 The pterodactyl photo didn't have the giant neck or the six legs or anything like that.

426
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,640
 But that's the legend of Devil's Lake.

427
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,880
 And at this point now it's called Elizabeth Lake.

428
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
 The reason after that whole amazing backstory, the reason why they changed the name to Elizabeth

429
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
 Lake?

430
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,440
 Because like in the 1920s, some ditzy chick named Elizabeth was walking by the lake.

431
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,720
 It was so funny when I was reading this, they were like, "Later on, decades later, there

432
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,840
 was a young pioneer named Elizabeth who was walking by the lake with two pails of water."

433
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,320
 And I was like, "Oh dude, is this like an epilogue where she mysteriously disappears

434
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,920
 like the creature came back?"

435
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,040
 And then it's like she was carrying these two pails of water.

436
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,680
 And she slipped and fell in the lake in front of a bunch of tourists.

437
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,080
 And begin teasing her and calling it Elizabeth's Lake because she slipped in it.

438
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,480
 Everyone thought it was funny.

439
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,840
 So the name is now, I'm like, "Are you kidding me?"

440
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,200
 You go from Devil's Lake, you come from this amazing story with the sea monster, to some

441
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,360
 girl slips in it and a bunch of tunies, a bunch of outsiders see it and they start calling

442
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,440
 it, "Hey look it, that's Elizabeth's Lake."

443
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
 That's lame.

444
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,000
 Call it Laguna del Diablo, way better name.

445
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,160
 But here's the thing.

446
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,120
 Is the story true?

447
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,840
 There's elements of it that are true.

448
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,880
 There is a true part of the story where people would set up ranches there and their cattle

449
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 would be eaten.

450
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,680
 You could not ra... even though it was perfect grazing land, great water supply, you couldn't

451
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,040
 have a ranch there.

452
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,840
 Now I found this out on the Wikipedia page and it was mentioned nowhere in any of the

453
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
 articles about the sea monster.

454
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:13,120
 This area, especially back around the time the 1850s, 1830s, had a massive bear population.

455
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,480
 It was infested with grizzly bears.

456
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,000
 So they think that... in the Wikipedia article they never mentioned the sea monster, they

457
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,840
 just say there was a huge bear population which made ranching almost impossible in the

458
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,580
 area in the early, in the mid 1800s.

459
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,160
 That is most likely what happened.

460
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,720
 That there was just a bunch of bears running around and no one could get anything done and

461
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,120
 that's why people would stumble across settlements and be like, "That's weird, why is this town

462
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,680
 here and there's nobody here and there's like bears in the poker parlor, there's bears

463
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,920
 in the brothel like banging other sexy bears, bears that are all curvy, like ahhh."

464
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,000
 That's where the shaman bear met his wife actually was in the brothel.

465
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,240
 So that is the most likely scenario and you wonder, well then why were people making up

466
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,800
 these stories about a giant sea monster?

467
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,960
 There may have been something in the water but it having all of those like wings and

468
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,960
 the six legs and stuff like that, that sounds super imaginative.

469
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,800
 There may have been something in the water people can understand.

470
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,040
 It could have just been a floating log people saw every once in a while.

471
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,040
 That plus massive bears coming out of the woods every night and eating everything.

472
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,120
 They could have had the legend mixed up plus also the unnatural voices could have been just

473
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,440
 bears, the sounds of bears, the visions in your head could have been the vision of you

474
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,720
 seeing bears climbing through your window.

475
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,960
 A ton of bears, they were everywhere.

476
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,920
 You go to the bathroom and bear would pop out of your toilet like the goolies.

477
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,160
 So as much as I like to think that a bass guy beat up the Loch Ness monster, I mean maybe

478
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,280
 he wrestled a couple bears, I'll give them that, but most likely there wasn't a sea monster.

479
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,480
 But I always think it's interesting when we can look at these legends and watch how they

480
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,200
 evolve and then find an actual real world component because really the mystery is what's

481
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,960
 happening to all these cows?

482
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,600
 The logical answer is well it's the bear that recently ran for mayor and won because all

483
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,600
 the other bears in town voted for him and you're like oh yeah that makes more sense than the

484
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,080
 giant monster.

485
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,520
 But I think it's interesting because we get to see the real world, we see these real world

486
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,640
 events and then the myths that are created to kind of hype everything up because at the

487
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,280
 end of the day people just kept coming to an area and go what happened to this town?

488
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,800
 I'm just going to build something here and see if something happens to me.

489
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,480
 Makes you wonder about stuff with the Bermuda Triangle as well where there's natural events

490
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,120
 but then people have made up this whole mystical thing to it.

491
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,680
 Also I do believe this, I've been doing a little bit of research on this.

492
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,680
 Bigfoot and I'm not the only one to do this, I'm not going to take sole credit for this,

493
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,800
 I've read this in other places as well but Bigfoot's associated with the terribly strong

494
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 scent.

495
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,280
 These creatures associate with the terrible strong scent.

496
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,280
 Demons are associated with the smell of like sulfur, terribly strong scent.

497
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,600
 There's a theory going on in kind of the scientific community that kind of borders on the paranormal

498
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,920
 community that these visions are caused by natural gas releases and basically you're

499
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,920
 smelling the smell of a gas, like a gaseous element, a chemical element and then you're

500
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,040
 hallucinating these things.

501
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,440
 So that could definitely be it too.

502
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,600
 A lot of these creatures are always associated with bad smells.

503
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,600
 Bigfoot in particular and the theory is that you're walking upon some sort of gas release,

504
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,040
 some sort of natural gas release and you're getting so much into you, you're basically

505
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,760
 hallucinating this and you go I smelled a horrible smell.

506
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,920
 I turned around, Bigfoot was behind me, you're hallucinating and that would be the same thing

507
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,360
 with demons, that would be the same thing with this creature.

508
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,280
 There may have been some sort of chemical leak in the area, some sort of gaseous leak

509
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,800
 in the area that was giving people visions, was making people associate the smell with

510
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,360
 the monster and they weren't really paying attention to the bears that were actually

511
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,800
 doing the property damage.

512
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,920
 So kind of an interesting link to that too.

513
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,080
 But maybe all the theories are wrong.

514
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,680
 Maybe there really was this creature.

515
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,720
 You know it's interesting because all of this stuff would have happened back when the frontier

516
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,280
 was new.

517
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,000
 All of these stories that we hear about these monsters come from a time when people from

518
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,280
 the west were really first planning their flag in these areas.

519
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:21,880
 The natives said, despite all of my stories about the scent or the bears, the natives

520
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,800
 in the area had said yes there is a monster in there.

521
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,120
 Besides the fact that it almost seems like a biological impossibility to have a creature

522
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,960
 like this.

523
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,000
 Could it have been something unexplained, something truly monstrous living in that lake?

524
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,720
 Unlike the Loch Ness Monster which supposedly lived for hundreds of years and you could

525
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,120
 still go over there and maybe catch a glimpse of it, a true monster would only exist in

526
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,640
 one place at one time.

527
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,200
 And that's what makes it a monster, that's what makes it so fierce and frightening.

528
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,040
 I think this idea of Bigfoot having a tribe and having a family and stuff like that actually

529
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,040
 just turns it into a monkey that lives in a place they normally don't live.

530
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:12,000
 When you try to add some sort of biological necessity to it, that makes it biologically

531
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,600
 or scientifically possible.

532
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,840
 That doesn't make it a monster.

533
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,800
 I'm not afraid of Bigfoot because again that's just a gorilla that may be a little bit smarter

534
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,160
 and an area gorillas don't normally live.

535
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:35,080
 The six-legged lake monster with bat wings is truly something out of the realm of nightmares.

536
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,240
 To us in the modern world it may seem like a quaint story of settlers trying to figure

537
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,800
 out why their cows are disappearing, but back then it would have been an insurmountable

538
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,200
 obstacle.

539
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,160
 We look at it through the lens of modern times and go just to fable, just the next explanation.

540
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,840
 If this monster existed the question isn't where did it go?

541
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,680
 The question really is where did it come from?

542
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,080
 And could another one show up today?

543
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:17,920
 A bulletproof flying creature appearing in modern times would be a marvel and a disaster

544
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,440
 because it would prove to us that these things really do exist.

545
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:28,760
 And if they exist, what can't exist?

546
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,800
 If another creature like this showed up, even if it was dispatched very very quickly by

547
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:39,160
 another strong Baskman/podcast host, never split your class, but punching it in the eye

548
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,960
 during a live stream, it wouldn't matter.

549
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:51,000
 Because once we know that the stuff of nightmares is real, all bets are off.

550
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:17,400
 If the sea monster can exist, so can the monster under your bed.

551
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:38,600
 Thank you guys.

552
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,180
 (upbeat music)
