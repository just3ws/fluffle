1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
 A series of strange letters leads us into the world of gang stalking, and then we take

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,920
 a look at a small race of cannibal humanoids that live in the woods.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,440
 They have a terrifying reputation, but their name is anything but terrifying.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,360
 Today we take a look at the melon heads on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:31,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
 We got a lot to get through today, so we're going to go ahead and get started.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,480
 Now, so the first story we're going to look at, the first way we're going to start off

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,840
 the first story comes from the conspiracy iceberg.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,520
 It's about middle tier in the conspiracy iceberg.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,800
 We got to go to Jolly Old England, so let's hop in the carpenter copter.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
 It's fired up.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,680
 It's me hitting switches.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,080
 I always think it's amazing.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,600
 When you look at a helicopter in real life, you just see the circle because the rotors

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,840
 are, but when you film a helicopter, sometimes the rotors look like they're moving real slow.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
 It's kind of weird looking.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,560
 But anyway, so we're in the carpenter copter.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,440
 We're flying over England right now.

22
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,160
 It's funny because I always refer to England as like it's just one big city, but that's

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,720
 because I don't know any better.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
 Wait, no, England is the city.

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
 Wait, no, is England the country?

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 Oh, London is the city.

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,840
 Anyways, I don't know what city this takes place in, so we're just going to hover over

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,680
 England until we see a proper young gentleman go to retrieve his mail.

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,520
 This chap, this Jolly Old chap, his name is Trevor Silverwood.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,760
 He's actually a member of parliament, so he's pretty high up in the government, equivalent

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,320
 of the US Senate.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,080
 So Trevor is out sipping his tea, he's wiping little crumpet crumbs off of his tie.

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,560
 He's a very dapper man.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
 And he goes to his mailbox.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
 We see him retrieve a letter.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
 We're looking overhead.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 He doesn't look up.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,760
 He doesn't hear the incredibly noisy and loud helicopter above him, but he gets a letter.

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,560
 He looks at it and we just see him kind of slump as he opens it up.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,080
 He knows what the letter is going to say.

41
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:20,360
 It's always a little crazy, it's always a little weird, and it is always correct.

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,280
 From 1969 to 1979, Trevor Silverwood would get letters delivered to him.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,640
 He'd open it up and it would say, "Hey, Trevor, you had a great day yesterday, didn't you?

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,320
 I saw you walking down the street in your gray P-coat, your black shoes.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,600
 You seemed like you were a man on a mission.

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,040
 Hope you had fun.

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,280
 See you again."

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,520
 There was never a signature except for a little drawing of the saint, a little stickman with

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
 the halo over his head.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,920
 It was a television show around the time.

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,720
 Trevor Silverwood would get letters explaining what he wore the previous day, or in the

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,160
 past, because some of the letters take a while together, but they would explain what he was

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,840
 wearing, what he was doing, who he was with.

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,560
 His letters were postmarked from all over the world.

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,960
 He would get a letter from India saying, "Nice shoes the other day.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
 Look like you polished them.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,480
 Look like you were really trying to set some sort of fashion trend, Mr. Silverwood."

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,760
 And of course, after the first couple of letters, he ends up getting the police involved.

59
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,560
 They could never figure it out.

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,980
 What they think was someone was spying on him in England, and then they would mail the

61
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,680
 letter to an accomplice in another country who would then mail it back.

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,000
 Sometimes the letters came from his neighborhood.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,800
 Not all the letters came from foreign countries, but they could never track down who it was.

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,760
 Now this story was first told in this book called Truly Bizarre, which was published in

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,480
 1979, and they were stating he was still receiving the letters at the time the book was being

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
 published.

67
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,040
 And this has always been kind of a quirky conspiracy.

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,520
 And there was a forum where they were talking about the strange letters.

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,640
 That's what it's known as, the strange letters, and that's how it's listed on the conspiracy

70
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
 theory iceberg.

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,680
 There was a forum talking about how crazy it was that no one could ever figure it out,

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,280
 and in 2011, someone claiming to be Trevor Silverwood's son went onto the forum.

73
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,200
 Because you know, you Google your dad, you Google your name.

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,040
 It's not bizarre to think that this guy would find.

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
 And he said the story was absolutely true as well.

76
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
 He said that the story was true.

77
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
 My father did get these letters.

78
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,520
 He saved them, actually.

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,760
 He saved them, and he told us a story about it, and eventually they did peter out.

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,160
 People on the forum asked him, "Can you take photos of the letters?"

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,600
 And he's like, "No, I don't feel comfortable doing that."

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,960
 So may have been a lark, may have truly been his son, but the stories were reported, and

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,600
 the police were involved in all these things, and it is a true story.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,880
 Now that's that for that conspiracy.

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,360
 But it's a lead into a topic that is kind of a mainstay of conspiracy theory, and that's

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,080
 the thing called gangstalking.

87
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,040
 Now let me give you a brief overview of gangstalking.

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,680
 Gangstalking is not a police investigation.

89
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,160
 Gangstalking is not you owe money to the mob and they're coming after you.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,800
 Gangstalking is not you're the witness of a crime and a street gang's getting you.

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,880
 Gangstalking is this bizarre conspiracy belief.

92
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,320
 So there are TIs, which are considered, not the rapper, there are TIs which are considered

93
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,120
 targeted individuals, and these people who are otherwise completely normal in the world

94
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,000
 are being stalked by some sort of shadowy government or Illuminati-esque organization.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,520
 So if you were a targeted individual, you would walk outside and let's say that if you saw...

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,160
 Okay, let me put it this way.

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,720
 If I walked out to my house and every day there was a Pacific power van outside my house,

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,360
 the first one thing I'm going to think is, it must be having problems with the power

99
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,080
 lines, but after three or four days, my personal thing is, I'm going to think there's feds

100
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 in there.

101
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,920
 They're investigating someone, possibly me.

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,640
 There's a cops in that van.

103
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,880
 But it's going to take a while for me to come to that conclusion.

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,200
 If you start seeing black SUVs with tinted windows driving through your street at the

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,600
 same time at night, I'm going to think that's some sort of drug running operation.

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,920
 That's not what we're talking about.

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,920
 That's not where gangstalking, that's not where targeted individuals think gangstalking

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 is.

109
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,800
 Here's some ways you can tell, according to this young woman, and everyone has their

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,240
 own way, but there's some key things.

111
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,920
 This young woman wrote on a forum about gangstalking.

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,880
 This is the way she knows that she is being stalked by a shadowy organization.

113
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,100
 Tell me if any of those things have happened to you, you might be gangstalked as well.

114
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,920
 You go to a store and it's crowded and people get in your way.

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,400
 You might be being gangstalked, according to her.

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,160
 If you're at home, and let's say you're milling about in your yard, you're raking your leaves,

117
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,440
 here's a way.

118
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,300
 This is a way to tell that you are a target of a shadowy organization.

119
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,560
 People will mow their lawns or weed-wack them to annoy you with the noise.

120
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,520
 See they're trying to break you down.

121
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,880
 Trying to break down the targeted individual.

122
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
 They will chop or chainsaw their firewood.

123
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,460
 I have no idea where this woman's living.

124
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,080
 What neighborhood do you live in where people can both weed-wack mow their lawns and chop

125
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
 firewood?

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,840
 I guess something in the suburbs, but maybe she's living in the boonies or something like

127
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
 that.

128
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
 Here's another thing.

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,280
 If your neighbor is "improving their home's facade," you might be being gangstalked.

130
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,220
 See the point is, is they're causing all this noise, I guess, to drive you nuts.

131
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,300
 Rev their car engine.

132
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:36,940
 If they yell at their animals or yell at each other, or if it's dark out and they have

133
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,780
 flashlights, these are all signs of people who are working for a shadowy organization

134
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,700
 that is targeting you.

135
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,380
 And that's where the insanity comes from.

136
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,260
 These are all things that normally happen.

137
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:54,960
 I live in an apartment complex downtown and I will wake up sometimes to a loud lawnmower

138
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,400
 and I'm like, "Who is mow- what lawn is possibly being mowed right now?"

139
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,040
 Everyone has like a foot of lawn.

140
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 Why am I waking up to RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

141
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 Why am I waking up to "Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

142
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:57,740
 I'm

143
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:27,540
 so

144
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
 excited.

145
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
 I'm so excited.

146
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
 I'm so excited.

147
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
 I'm so excited.

148
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
 I'm so excited.

149
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
 I'm so excited.

150
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
 I'm so excited.

151
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
 I'm so excited.

152
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
 I'm so excited.

153
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,540
 I'm so excited.

154
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
 I'm so excited.

155
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
 I'm so excited.

156
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
 I'm so excited.

157
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
 I'm so excited.

158
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
 I'm so excited.

159
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,540
 I'm so excited.

160
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
 I'm so excited.

161
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
 I'm so excited.

162
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
 I'm so excited.

163
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
 I'm so excited.

164
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
 I'm so excited.

00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,540
 I'm so excited.

356
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
 I'm so excited.

357
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
 I'm so excited.

358
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
 I'm so excited.

359
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,540
 I'm so excited.

360
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,540
 I'm so excited.

361
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
 I'm so excited.

362
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
 I'm so excited.

363
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
 I'm so excited.

364
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,540
 I'm so excited.

365
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
 I'm so excited.

366
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
 I'm so excited.

367
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
 I'm so excited.

368
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
 I'm so excited.

369
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
 I'm so excited.

370
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
 I'm so excited.

371
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
 I'm so excited.

372
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
 I'm so excited.

373
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
 I'm so excited.

374
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
 I'm so excited.

375
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
 How did this rapper get next to my car?

376
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,540
 A spy must have put it here.

377
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,540
 And, yeah, it would just be like, oh, that's crazy Archie.

378
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,540
 Crazy Archie living in the streets, always running around talking about doorknobs and

379
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,540
 dead spiders.

380
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,740
 But now, crazy Archie can go online and meet people from all over the world who are finding

381
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,540
 these inconsequential clues and they're building their own delusional web.

382
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,540
 Massive amounts of people believe they are targeted individuals.

383
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,540
 This, to me, is a bigger threat than people who believe in Flat Earth.

384
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
 100%.

385
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,040
 People can have all sorts of loony scientific conspiracy theories that they want.

386
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,980
 This one, someone believes in Flat Earth, it doesn't matter.

387
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,820
 They still go to work and it's not a big deal.

388
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,740
 They pay their taxes, they go out and have a good time, they have friends, stuff like

389
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,740
 that.

390
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,740
 They just have one wacky conspiracy theory.

391
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,980
 People who believe in this believe that the world is their enemy.

392
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,500
 And, they may see you as their enemy as well.

393
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,820
 We'll go a little bit more into gangstalking in a future episode because I have found people

394
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,380
 who are dedicated to taking the fight to the gangstalkers.

395
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,380
 We've had at least one mass shooting connected to gangstalking already.

396
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,940
 This is a serious problem, it's only going to get worse.

397
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,140
 Because people are always going to find dead spiders, people are always going to find busted

398
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
 light bulbs.

399
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,580
 People are always going to find McDonald's wrappers by their car.

400
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:50,380
 And, it's just a matter of time before these people in mass start really feeling like they

401
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,380
 only have one way out of this situation.

402
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,300
 Let's go ahead and move on to a topic that's a little more lighthearted.

403
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,460
 It does involve cannibalism.

404
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,100
 It does involve mutants.

405
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,580
 But, it's still a little more lighthearted than just mass psychosis.

406
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,540
 And, what we're going to be talking about right now is the story of an interesting little

407
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,700
 cryptid.

408
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,860
 No one has the melon head.

409
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,460
 So who are the melon heads?

410
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,780
 I just love that name.

411
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,780
 The melon heads.

412
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,460
 Now, it's a very evocative phrase.

413
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,180
 Bigfoot, the name tells you right there, has bigfoot.

414
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,540
 Or people can think that the creature is actually a bigfoot.

415
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,620
 There are some cryptids that the name is just perfect.

416
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,980
 Bigfoot, shadow people, Bloody Mary, melon head.

417
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
 You go right there.

418
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,300
 The dude must have a head shaped like a melon and you're 100% correct.

419
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,780
 But these guys are even better than that.

420
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,780
 Not only do they have big old heads, they got tiny little bodies.

421
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,740
 They got like baby bodies, big old melon head.

422
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,940
 And you think, there's always, I have this thing, it's called, I call it the Chucky

423
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,060
 Conundrum.

424
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,860
 Where you try to do that new Chucky movie looks amazing by the way.

425
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,740
 That new, oh man, that trailer looks great.

426
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,940
 But, it's the Chucky Conundrum.

427
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:07,300
 Is there a point where a killer becomes so timey that it doesn't become threatening?

428
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 Chucky scary?

429
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,060
 Like, I've never been scared of Chucky, but the idea of Chucky scary.

430
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:18,380
 The fetish doll from that old movie trilogy of terror absolutely terrified me for like

431
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
 decades.

432
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,420
 Very, very scary.

433
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,100
 That thing's only like a foot tall.

434
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,180
 Would you rather be chased by a cannibalistic dwarf with a baby body and a big old melon

435
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,220
 head or an adult sized cereal?

436
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,580
 Oh, I guess they're both bad.

437
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,860
 But is it scary because it's tiny?

438
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,220
 And I think there might be a point where it's not, where it's too tiny, maybe like microscopic

439
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,740
 Chucky wouldn't be scary.

440
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,860
 But there are a lot of people who go, "Ah, Chucky doesn't scare me, I just kick him over."

441
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,740
 I think, let's get into the melon heads and then we'll go more into combat strategy.

442
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:00,540
 The melon heads are a cryptid/urban legend that's mostly in the states of Connecticut,

443
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,060
 Michigan, and Ohio.

444
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,500
 It's a rural story or suburban story of these creatures.

445
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,220
 But it's interesting because we're going to look at three different urban legends and

446
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,740
 some of the details are the same, some of the details are different, and that makes

447
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,300
 me think one, there's either was based on some sort of truth or some kids who used to

448
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,660
 live in Connecticut ended up moving to Michigan and then later told their kids in Ohio.

449
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,380
 Like, that's also going to be how it's spread.

450
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,340
 Oh, and I should say this before I get into the gruesome stories that are followed.

451
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,380
 Melonhead is also a term for a fan of the Los Angeles Rams.

452
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
 I found that out.

453
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
 We're not talking about them.

454
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
 They're not the only people.

455
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,380
 They may have tiny baby bodies.

456
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
 I don't know.

457
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
 I don't watch sports.

458
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,380
 Connecticut.

459
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
 The year is 1960.

460
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,780
 You got like a fog rolling through the city.

461
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,220
 And other parts of the country people are wearing bell bottoms.

462
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,860
 People are protesting the Vietnam War.

463
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
 Did that start yet?

464
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,860
 1960.

465
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,180
 They're protesting a war because they think something's going to happen.

466
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,620
 Everyone's just grooving.

467
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,780
 People are practicing their kung fu fighting for when they might have to start moving as

468
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,900
 fast as lightning.

469
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,020
 But in Connecticut in 1960 on a dark stormy night there is an asylum for the criminally

470
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020
 insane.

471
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:24,260
 Bunch of inmates are trapped in there rattling their chains.

472
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,780
 Doctors walking through the darkened halls.

473
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,340
 Man, these sane people are driving me nuts.

474
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,220
 Why did I take this job?

475
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,220
 But you know, you got to make a living, right?

476
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,780
 And it's like, yeah, I got to make a living.

477
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,280
 Lightning strikes.

478
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,380
 Somehow, some reason.

479
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,460
 Luck or curse.

480
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,900
 A fire breaks out in the insane asylum.

481
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,780
 Doctors like, "Ugh, uh, uh, uh."

482
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,220
 Actually I don't know if he burned to death.

483
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,020
 But he doesn't get mentioned anymore.

484
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,100
 However, 10 to 20 inmates escape.

485
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
 "Let's break out boys.

486
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 Let's go."

487
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 That's what he thinks he says.

488
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,980
 He really just goes, "Ugh, uh, uh, uh."

489
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
 They escape.

490
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,620
 They go into the surrounding forest around this asylum for the criminally insane.

491
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,820
 They're out there and they go, "Oh no, we're insane.

492
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,580
 We don't have any survival skills."

493
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,740
 So then they begin eating people for food, not just for fun, maybe a little bit fun.

494
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,980
 And because they're out in the middle of nowhere and they're insane and they're cannibals and

495
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:34,060
 tinder doesn't exist yet, they begin to interbreed and their babies are born with hydrocelephus,

496
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,660
 hydrocephalus, hydrocephalus, and which is basically water on the brain.

497
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,220
 When you're a little baby and you get it, your brain, your skull actually gets distended

498
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,180
 and then you look like you have a melon head.

499
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,100
 You look like you have a big old head.

500
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,500
 So the idea is that they were interbreeding with you.

501
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,860
 They were inbreeding with each other.

502
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,520
 The crazy people were inbreeding with each other.

503
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,020
 Their babies were deformed with these melon heads.

504
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,140
 And to this day, the babies are still running around, jumping out of the woods, eating people.

505
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:08,540
 Or the other version of the Connecticut story is there was a family from the colonial era

506
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,820
 that was accused of witchcraft, ran into the woods, started banging each other, and their

507
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,700
 babies had melon heads.

508
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,940
 That story, both stories are kind of ridiculous, but that story actually makes more sense because

509
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,900
 that would give, you just can't bang your sister and have a mutant baby.

510
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,260
 It doesn't, it can, but it generally tends to happen the farther you bang your sister

511
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,180
 and you have a baby and then one of you like bings the baby when it grows up and then that's

512
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,760
 the mutant, that's the mutant baby.

513
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,420
 So it's not like you would just break out of jail, inbreed with the inmate who was next

514
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,940
 to you from the insane asylum.

515
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,920
 Like it would take a couple generations for you to start to produce mutated babies.

516
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,300
 But anyways, that's the Connecticut version of the story.

517
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,820
 Now we're going to go to Michigan.

518
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,220
 Here's the Michigan version of the story.

519
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
 Insane Asylum.

520
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,860
 That's a common theme with this story.

521
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,900
 And I think it's because insane asylums tend to be scary because they're basically just

522
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
 buildings full of crazy people.

523
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,420
 But in insane asylum, inside the Felt Mansion.

524
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,980
 Now Felt Mansion is this giant building.

525
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,300
 It looks like Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.

526
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,860
 It's this beautiful building.

527
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,500
 It was founded by this guy named Dor Felt, which is kind of a dope name.

528
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,220
 Dor Felt's successful businessman, very well known, very well liked in the area.

529
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:31,820
 He was an inventor and now all the only thing the Felt Mansion is associated with is really

530
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
 is melon heads.

531
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:40,340
 Like all of his life's work gone into building his business and now his house is the headquarters

532
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,980
 of cannibalistic children.

533
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,860
 So but he was long dead.

534
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,620
 The Felt Mansion ended up turning into insane asylum where there was an evil doctor there

535
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,620
 who was this guy.

536
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,020
 It wasn't just walking down hallway saying how much he hated his job.

537
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,260
 He actually kind of liked his job because it gave him an opportunity to abuse and torture

538
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
 the inmates.

539
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,780
 He was just having fun.

540
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,100
 He loved showing up at work.

541
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,660
 He's like, oh dude, I can't wait to go to work.

542
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,180
 Man, I got all these new tools I'm going to use to abuse these people.

543
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,180
 Woo!

544
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,180
 His wife's like, what?

545
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,180
 Why are you talking about?

546
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,300
 He's like, oh nothing honey.

547
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,460
 He gets, the doctor gets in his car.

548
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,180
 I don't know why I'm building up the backstory.

549
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,540
 The point is the doctor works at the hospital in insane asylum.

550
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,540
 He's torturing these people.

551
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,900
 They finally get tired of being tortured.

552
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,060
 They attack him.

553
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:28,100
 They rip him to pieces and hide different pieces of his body all over Felt Mansion.

554
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,740
 Then the little people, they're not little yet.

555
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,260
 The insane asylum people, again, escape from the insane asylum and hide in the local cave

556
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
 system.

557
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,900
 Now, they also jump out and eat you, the Mellonheads.

558
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,580
 And people have said that if you break into Felt Mansion, you can see the ghost of Mellonheads

559
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,020
 and see the murder of the doctor reenacted.

560
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,180
 That story's a little bizarre because if the Mellonheads are running around in the forest,

561
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,020
 I don't know why their ghosts are also in the mansion.

562
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,780
 But that's the story from Michigan.

563
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,380
 Now we're going to Ohio, which was really the story that I was like, this, this, someone

564
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,340
 heard the, someone used to live in Connecticut and then moved to Michigan and thought, you

565
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,060
 know what, I'm moving to Ohio.

566
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,460
 I'm going to add my own spin.

567
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,220
 I'm going to give the Mellonhead story a dark reimagining.

568
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,500
 We're in Ohio, we're specifically in the Cleveland suburb of Kirtland.

569
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
 Kirtland.

570
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,980
 If anyone's from Kirtland, I'm sure they know about this.

571
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:31,460
 And this is why I think this story is definitely, this story was, was crafted by someone who

572
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,020
 is a connoisseur of the Mellonhead legend.

573
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:42,980
 In the suburb of Kirtland, there is a mansion, an insane asylum, but it was like a hidden

574
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
 insane asylum.

575
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,540
 It's like a, like it was a normal house in the basement.

576
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,780
 This guy kept, kept prisoners, kept these prisoners, right?

577
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,180
 Now his name was Dr. Crow, but he went by another name.

578
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,600
 He went by the name Dr. Mellonhead.

579
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:10,100
 So I don't know if his name was like James Mellonhead and he, that was like his family's

580
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
 name.

581
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,020
 He comes from a long line of Mellonheads and that's how they got the name Mellonhead.

582
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,580
 But again, that's from saying it's almost like a gritty reboot.

583
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,060
 Like they had to explain, this is his Han Solo, how Han Solo got his name.

584
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,780
 This is that of urban legends.

585
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,460
 This is how the Mellonheads got their name because they are actually the byproduct of

586
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,060
 Dr. Mellonhead.

587
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:38,180
 So Dr. Mellonhead worked with kids with hydrocephalus, hydrocephalus.

588
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,620
 So he was basically saying, I will take care of your baby.

589
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,260
 Oh, your baby has water on the brain and their, their skulls all big.

590
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,620
 I will take care of them.

591
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,740
 And the parents are like, well, thank you because we can.

592
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,740
 And you're a doctor.

593
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
 Thank you, Dr. Mellonhead.

594
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,900
 And he's like, yes, Dr. Mellonhead MD.

595
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,620
 Anyways, so Dr. Mellonhead goes to work.

596
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,300
 But what he does is he doesn't treat the baby.

597
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,780
 This is, this is this urban legend.

598
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,100
 I'm not making this up.

599
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,420
 Dr. Mellonhead does not treat the babies.

600
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:13,140
 He instead wonders what would happen if I inject more liquid into their brain.

601
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:21,380
 So he begins to inject fluid into these babies brains, making their heads even more melon-like.

602
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:28,940
 Here, I'm not a scientist, but if a child is suffering from a horrible disfigurement,

603
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,860
 I don't think the answer is.

604
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,380
 The question should not be, I wonder what will happen if I make them more disfigured.

605
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,220
 Because you know the answer to that.

606
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,660
 They will become more disfigured.

607
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,820
 But apparently Dr. Mellonhead really was a fan of water on the brain.

608
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,620
 He began injecting these kids, these babies, with more liquid.

609
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,140
 If I was six years old and I heard the story of Bloody Mary, which I did, totally terrified

610
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
 me.

611
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,660
 If I was six years old and my older brother tried telling me this version of the Mellonhead

612
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:05,340
 story, I would probably have become a skeptic on the spot.

613
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,900
 Because the story is so ridiculous.

614
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,580
 Injects them with more liquid.

615
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,060
 Eventually though, these mutated Mellonheads, even more melony than their brothers in Connecticut

616
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,260
 and Michigan, these are the super Mellonheads, they also end up killing the doctor.

617
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,860
 But these Mellonheads, again, gritty reboot, they run into the forest.

618
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,980
 They'll scamper off.

619
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,180
 Big Mellonheads bouncing along.

620
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,860
 These ones are also cannibals, but that's not good enough for Ohio.

621
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,980
 Cannibalism is so Michigan.

622
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,860
 These ones specifically enjoy the taste of babies.

623
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,580
 So you know, like, put your baby down.

624
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,100
 Hush little baby, don't say what.

625
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,940
 Mom's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

626
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,940
 Yes, that mockingbird.

627
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:05,020
 And from the closet, you see like a pair of yellow eyes.

628
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,700
 The mom's swaddling the baby.

629
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,180
 Whatever that word means, wraps it up in a blanket.

630
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,860
 I think that's what it means.

631
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,700
 Kisses the baby on the head, leaves the room.

632
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,260
 Closet door slowly pushed open.

633
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,220
 It doesn't use its hand, it just slowly leans its head forward.

634
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,940
 The Mellonhead pushes against the door.

635
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,300
 Luckily the doorknob is loose because a gangstalker was in there, so moves silently out of the

636
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,940
 closet towards the baby's crib.

637
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:41,900
 Oh, and also in Ohio, the version of the story, this baby might actually be safe because

638
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,380
 the Mellonheads have terrible vision because of all the extra liquid in their brain.

639
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,660
 So they can't, if you wear red or black, they won't attack you because they can't see you,

640
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,660
 but if you wear white, they'll attack you.

641
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,460
 So moral of the story is, don't put your baby in white clothes.

642
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,140
 You shouldn't do that anyways, because your baby's going to be totally messy, it's going

643
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,420
 to make stains everywhere.

644
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,220
 But also because the Mellonheads will get them.

645
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,940
 So this is the interesting thing about the Mellonhead story.

646
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,300
 Felt Mansion was never an insane asylum.

647
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,500
 They've never been able to track down, so that part of the story we know is false, the

648
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,700
 asylum for the criminal insane that burnt down in Connecticut.

649
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:24,140
 That may or may not have happened at some point, but I couldn't find a name for any

650
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,740
 insane asylum there.

651
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,660
 There were stories that Dr. Crowe did, did not go by the name Dr. Mellonhead, but did

652
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,540
 perform illegal abortions in the area, but that is also probably a retcon urban legend

653
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,780
 type of thing.

654
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,420
 There's a bridge in that area they call Cry Baby Bridge because apparently you can hear

655
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,380
 babies crying underneath it, and that's either because Mellonheads are eating babies and

656
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:52,540
 throwing their bodies into the bridge, under the bridge, not into it, you're driving by,

657
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,580
 you're driving over the overpass and a baby comes flying at you, or that he was dumping

658
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,100
 the bodies of aborted babies there.

659
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,980
 Here's the thing, I don't think the Mellonheads exist.

660
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,420
 I think, and I'm not going to go into this whole thing like because we think they exist,

661
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
 they exist.

662
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:12,620
 I think this is an interesting idea of an urban legend that there probably was a kid

663
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:19,340
 with a horrible disfigured head in one of these areas at some point, just statistically,

664
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,380
 and this rumor started.

665
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:30,020
 That's fairly likely, and I think it's interesting how it's fairly, fairly in this geographical

666
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
 region.

667
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,740
 You don't have stories about Mellonheads in California, you don't have stories about

668
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,340
 Mellonheads in New York.

669
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,940
 Well you do have in California, they're Los Angeles Ram fans, but it's not like Bloody

670
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,740
 Mary where it's a universal urban legend.

671
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,380
 The Mellonheads is really restricted to these areas.

672
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,940
 These areas are, one of the creepiest areas really in America because it's the suburbs

673
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,220
 bordered by forests is generally where these creatures exist.

674
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,620
 They're areas that are fairly well traveled, but not civilized, and I think growing up,

675
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,980
 that's always a scary thing because you have a perfectly manicured neighborhood, or maybe

676
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,860
 even just like a trailer park, but then you have a place where you're totally familiar

677
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,940
 with all the sights and the sounds and the people there, and then bordering that is a

678
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:23,580
 forest full of creatures and wonder and mystery and darkness and weird noise that you don't

679
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,580
 understand.

680
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,700
 And I think that's why urban legends like this are so catchy.

681
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:35,780
 It's this idea of the familiar budding up against the unfamiliar and the alien.

682
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,700
 So if in an environment like that, added with someone telling you once that they went to

683
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,620
 school with someone with a Mellonhead, Dr. Mellonhead, they knew him in elementary school, these

684
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:53,140
 stories get mixed up, and again I think it's most likely that kids from one state made

685
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,780
 up the story or heard the story from their uncles or whatever, and when they began moving

686
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,980
 or changing high schools and things like that, the story spread.

687
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,140
 It changed because you had a new group of people to entertain, but the key component

688
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:12,340
 stayed, tiny little cannibals with Mellonheads is really the key component in it.

689
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,420
 But that all being said, that all being said of where I think the Mellonhead legend came

690
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:27,220
 from, we can go even farther back, a couple states away, but in the state of Idaho there

691
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,700
 was an old Native American legend of these things called the Auehi Mountain Dwarves.

692
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,900
 The Auehi Mountains is a physical place, but there is an old legend of these two feet tall

693
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,580
 creatures that specifically fed on children.

694
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,580
 Is it possible that a subset of a creature like that, of a cryptid like that, still exists

695
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
 today?

696
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,380
 We're in the realm of the mystical, these guys had tails that would wrap around their

697
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:58,860
 body to give them some sort of body armor, and they were quite cunning and cruel, but

698
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,420
 if we accept things like Bigfoot, this is really no different.

699
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:08,660
 So we have a little bit of urban legend, a little bit of Native American tales, literally,

700
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,220
 that wasn't intended, but where is the truth in that?

701
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,820
 Were these stories just completely made up by a drunk uncle one night?

702
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,020
 Was there really a Dr. Mellonhead who was performing obscene experiments on the bodies

703
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,940
 of babies?

704
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:30,580
 Was there a race of cannibalistic dwarves that once prowled the mountain sides and spilled

705
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,020
 out and moved into other parts of the country?

706
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
 Who knows?

707
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,660
 Who knows?

708
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:45,640
 But if you do have a child, make sure you check the closet and look under the bed.

709
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,220
 Make sure the window's locked before you kiss them goodnight and shut the light off

710
00:32:50,220 --> 00:33:09,820
 tonight.

711
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:21,820
 Bye.

712
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,400
 (upbeat music)
