1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
 Today, we look at two cases where ghosts helped solve their own murders.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,240
 First off, we head to Australia, where a man who's gone missing may have left the ultimate

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,540
 clue.

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,040
 And then we travel back to the United States to meet a grieving mother who prays every

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,680
 single night that the spirit of her daughter will give her a message.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,280
 And then one night, her daughter arrives.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:44,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,440
 Order in the court.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,320
 Today we're talking about ghosts that helped solve their own murders.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,600
 So let's hop on board the carpenter copter.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
 First off, let's pack it full of all the stereotypical Australian stuff.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,020
 We got shrimp on the barbie.

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,440
 We got Foster's beer.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,760
 We got Knot Knives.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
 These are knives.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,040
 We're all ready to go.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,520
 We're flying to Campbelltown in New South Wales, Australia.

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,920
 It's flying over.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,120
 It's a dusty little village.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,800
 I'm assuming we land.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,240
 We hop out of the helicopter.

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,480
 And it's 1826, so it's super old-timey.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,560
 It's extra dusty back then.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,400
 June 17th.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
 Walking around Campbelltown.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
 It's a nice old place, right?

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,640
 Not a place you would want to live.

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,560
 It's where convicted felons from England are still being transported.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,680
 So everyone there is a felon.

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,000
 That's why we have our...

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Those aren't knives.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 These are knives.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 We're all pulling them out.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Walking out of the street with our blades ready.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,560
 No one's gonna mess with us.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,200
 We go to the helicopter currently.

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,040
 They're currently scuttling the helicopter, taking everything they can carry.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640
 We go on a local saloon and there we meet George Worrell.

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,160
 Hey, George, what's up?

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,840
 He's like, "Hey guys, have a seat.

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,880
 You can have any drink you want as long as you pay for it."

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
 That's how bars normally work, right?

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
 So we're like, "Okay, fine."

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,360
 Now, George is friends with Frederick Fisher.

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
 They actually both wore convicts from England, but it served their time in Australia.

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,240
 And Frederick was like, "You know what?

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,800
 I own some property here, but I'm done.

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
 I got my farm, but I just...

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
 I don't like it.

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
 It's gross.

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
 It's dusty.

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
 There's like snakes everywhere.

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,160
 A helicopter landed in the middle of my farm destroying my crops for the season.

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
 I'm out.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
 I'm gonna go back to England."

61
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,800
 And George's like, "Well, okay, but what about all your property?

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
 Like you built this."

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, but here, I'll give you a will.

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
 Here you go.

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
 I'll sign this.

66
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
 And now you own all my property.

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,200
 I'll give you power of attorney too, whatever.

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 I'm out."

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,400
 So he leaves and George Worrell's like, "Okay."

70
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,920
 He takes the property.

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,240
 October 1826.

72
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,600
 Four months later.

73
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,200
 John Farley runs into the hotel.

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 We've been sitting in this...

75
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,560
 It was the exact same table.

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,360
 It's drinking the exact same beverage for four months.

77
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,960
 Trapped in our own personal hell.

78
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,680
 John Farley runs in.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,600
 "Guys, oh my God.

80
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
 You won't believe what happened.

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 Oh my God.

82
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 Oh my God.

83
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
 It sounds like you're having an orgasm."

84
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
 John is like, "No, no.

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,280
 Just personally, it's making my voice.

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
 Making it sound weird is all."

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 John's like, "Not having an orgasm."

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
 I saw a ghost.

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,320
 And at that point, we re-animate.

90
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,440
 We were frozen and suspended animation for four months.

91
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 We turn around.

92
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
 I saw a ghost.

93
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,160
 I saw a ghost out at the bridge.

94
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,360
 Now what he saw, John Farley said he was walking down the street, and he saw a ghost

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,960
 sitting on the rail of the bridge.

96
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,240
 Now I'm going to assume it's middle of night because it's super spooky then.

97
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,000
 It might have been early in the day, but let's assume it's nighttime.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Super spooky.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,040
 And he's walking down the super spooky bridge.

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,000
 He's walking and he sees this ghost sitting on the rail, and then the ghost just kind

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,080
 of points over to an area down underneath the bridge where the creek disappears.

102
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,200
 Now John Farley tells the story, and it really kind of scares everyone.

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,480
 Everyone's like, "Oh man, I live next to the bridge.

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,320
 I have to cross the bridge to get home."

105
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 Dang it.

106
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,080
 And I don't have flashlights because you know it's 1826.

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,720
 You just got to walk in the dark.

108
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 Sucks.

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,320
 They're all jumping in kangaroo pouches.

110
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,080
 The kangaroos are too scared.

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 They're like, "Get out!"

112
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
 Pushing them out of the pouch.

113
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,360
 That and the kangaroos are horribly scarred from all the people jumping in their pouches

114
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
 all the time.

115
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
 They're like, "Ugh.

116
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
 No more Uber.

117
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
 Kangaroober?

118
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
 Huh?"

119
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
 Anyways, that was good.

120
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,360
 I like that one.

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,120
 Anyways, let's move on because I know you guys didn't like that one.

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
 Let's move on.

123
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
 I could have heard, I drew space and time.

124
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,880
 I heard you groan.

125
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,080
 I was listening to this episode three years from now.

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,240
 I could still hear you groan at that joke.

127
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,840
 Anyways, the point is that people were scared and multiple people in town while crossing

128
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,800
 the bridge start seeing the ghost of Frederick Fisher pointing off underneath the river.

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,440
 Sometimes when they walk, they see the ghost just standing there and then he jumps off into

130
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,360
 the darkness below with despair.

131
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,080
 And the local constable is like, "That's ridiculous.

132
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
 That's super stupid."

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,600
 And they're like, "No, no, no."

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
 And the first time when John Farley talks about it, he's like, "Okay, John, you saw

135
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
 a ghost."

136
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
 Whatever.

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
 Like, I don't believe in ghosts.

138
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,600
 But towns people kept saying, "I think there's something down there."

139
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,080
 Listen, Frederick Fisher's missing.

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,320
 Well, George said he went back to England.

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
 "Yeah, but George is a convicted felon.

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
 You're a convicted felon.

143
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
 I'm chief of police.

144
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
 I'm a convicted felon.

145
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
 We're all convicted felons.

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,480
 If that's the thing that we need to trust each other, then no, it's going to trust each

147
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,880
 other at all."

148
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,520
 But the towns people were persistent.

149
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,960
 Just go down there and see if there's anything down there.

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,960
 To the cop, put a little siren on the top of his kangaroo.

151
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,960
 The kangaroo's hopping.

152
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
 He goes down to the riverbed area.

153
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,880
 And I could imagine there's a bunch of people on the bridge pointing, pointing, being like,

154
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
 "No, he was pointing this way."

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,040
 "No, he was pointing this way."

156
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,560
 "He was pointing this way."

157
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
 Eventually, the cops like, "Right here?

158
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
 Is this where they were pointing?"

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
 And they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

160
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,880
 They start digging, and lo and behold, they find the body of Frederick Fisher.

161
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,480
 George Worrell, very shortly afterwards, was arrested and confessed to the crime.

162
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,480
 And then he was found guilty, and he was eventually hanged.

163
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,360
 Now, what's weird about this?

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,560
 In fact, the fact that the ghost helped solve the crime, there's two actually weird things

165
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
 about this.

166
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,160
 To this day, in Campbelltown, New South Wales, if you're down there, you already know what

167
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,800
 this is, they have a festival of Fisher's Ghost.

168
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,120
 It's 10 days long.

169
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,360
 That's longer than spring break, right?

170
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,400
 10 days of a Fisher's Ghost festival.

171
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,360
 They really must be nothing in this town.

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,680
 They have things like a parade.

173
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,880
 So a parade for a man who was murdered.

174
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
 That's always great.

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,120
 Children's events, a fireworks show.

176
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,120
 Each firework goes up, it's just the, like, "Pshh," it's the shape of a skull.

177
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,600
 "Pshh," the shape of a bat bledging in a man's head.

178
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 They have a thing called "Miss Princess Quest," which is like, I'm assuming it's like, you

179
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,240
 know, the girl who waves her hand at people, it's the parade's going down the road.

180
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,440
 And they've actually canceled that because no one wanted to be that anymore.

181
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 No joke.

182
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,000
 The last time they had it was in 2016 and girls were like, "No, I'm good."

183
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,560
 I'd rather not be the symbol of a murdered man's parade.

184
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,800
 And a Fisher's Ghost art award, which I imagine is just little kids drawing pictures of a

185
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,120
 slowly rotting body in the dirt.

186
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,520
 That all stuff is interesting about.

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
 This is the fact that people can celebrate this for 10 days.

188
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
 Secondly, the story is half-fake.

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,760
 Now this is what's interesting.

190
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
 The murder is true.

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
 Frederick Fisher was murdered.

192
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,280
 George Warrell did confess to murdering him, all that stuff.

193
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,440
 They did find his body buried.

194
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,440
 However, people now believe that John Farley, the initial guy who reported the ghost, knew

195
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,560
 of the murder and was threatened.

196
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,040
 If you tell anyone about this murder, I'll get you to.

197
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,920
 You'll end up at the bottom of that bridge, too.

198
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,480
 So he couldn't directly report it.

199
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,600
 So instead, after about four months, he's guilty.

200
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 He can't sleep.

201
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,360
 He's thinking, "Poor Frederick's just rotting away down there.

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
 No decent burial.

203
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
 George Warrell has all this property, but he can't rat him out."

204
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,280
 He tells the story of the ghost and mass panic strikes.

205
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
 Other people start seeing the ghost.

206
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,960
 John Farley, his report, the cop isn't going to do anything.

207
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,720
 But after multiple towns people saw this and are pestering the police, they investigated.

208
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,120
 So a ghost didn't actually appear.

209
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,440
 A man's guilty conscience created the ghost story to get a guilty man thrown in prison.

210
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
 And you're like, "Jason, that's lame.

211
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,640
 You told us this wasn't happening.

212
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
 You started this off.

213
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
 You're all mad at me.

214
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
 I'm all backing up.

215
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

216
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
 Put down.

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
 That's not a knife.

218
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
 This is a knife, dude.

219
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
 Seriously.

220
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
 You're approaching me towards the side of the bridge.

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,680
 Jason, I'm tired of your bait and switches.

222
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 Whoa, dude.

223
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
 Hold up.

224
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
 Yes, I did lie to you.

225
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,280
 However, I do think it's more interesting than this.

226
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,320
 I think this is more interesting because not only did you have a guy, this story is 100%

227
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,360
 true, which always makes more interesting.

228
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,040
 You had a guy with a clever way to catch a murderer and you were able to show.

229
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,280
 You think that whole time John Farley was like, "Other people are seeing this ghost?

230
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
 What is going on?

231
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,760
 I made this up."

232
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,080
 And I wanted people to believe that the body was down there, but now other people are actually

233
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
 seeing the ghost.

234
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,560
 That must have been really trippy for him to deal with.

235
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,360
 But a murderer was caught, a man's death was avenged, and Frederick Fisher was eventually

236
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,640
 placed to rest, not just right into the bottom of a ravine.

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,560
 So real ghost or not, and it wasn't.

238
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,000
 It was a story that I just told you.

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,480
 I find it fascinating nonetheless.

240
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
 Now let's pack up our gear.

241
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
 Here, no, you walk ahead of me.

242
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,240
 I don't trust you at this point.

243
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 You keep turning around.

244
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,640
 I'm going for my blade.

245
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,880
 You're-- no, no, no, no, no.

246
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,160
 I will not stab you in the back as they podcast those.

247
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,000
 I promise to not stab you.

248
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,960
 And as my listener or as we recently learned, a group of wild rabbits is known as a fluffle.

249
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,720
 So as we are one fluffle, both rabbits at heart, we agree not to murder each other, although

250
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,400
 you still are a little-- you're a little peeved that I tricked you.

251
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,520
 But anyways, we're getting on the helicopter.

252
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,560
 We're getting on, and we are headed out to Greenbrier, West Virginia.

253
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,800
 Here in the switches, and I keep looking over my shoulder because I don't entirely trust

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
 you.

255
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,040
 You're like, Jason, no, I swear I'm not going to stab me in the back.

256
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,280
 You're definitely not going to stab me in the back as we start to take off, because now

257
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,680
 we're-- I don't know how high helicopters go.

258
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,280
 We're 1,100 feet in the air.

259
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
 All right?

260
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
 That's pretty high.

261
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,600
 You're like, Jason, you're flying a helicopter.

262
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,040
 You've been flying it for 400 episodes.

263
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,200
 You never ever looked at how high a helicopter can go.

264
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 Great job, pilot.

265
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,440
 Now you're not going to stab me.

266
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,160
 You're just being really sarcastic.

267
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,480
 And kind of mean.

268
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
 Okay, guys?

269
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,440
 The little teardrop flies from me.

270
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,840
 We're flying to Greenbrier, West Virginia.

271
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,880
 The year is 1897.

272
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,280
 And there we're going to meet Mary Jane Hester.

273
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,200
 She's a grieving mother who's currently sitting in court, and a defense lawyer is kind of

274
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,040
 pacing back and forth in front of her.

275
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,800
 Now luckily, we have some interesting court documents for you.

276
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,960
 But again, this is 100% a true story.

277
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,960
 We have some really interesting court documents from all of this stuff.

278
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,080
 So we actually have a transcript of this.

279
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,160
 The defense lawyer asks her, "Are you telling the court that your daughter came to you in

280
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
 a dream?"

281
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,720
 And she says, quote, "It was no dream.

282
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,600
 She came back and told me that he was mad that she didn't have no meat cooked for supper.

283
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,640
 She came four times and four nights.

284
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,320
 And the second night she told me that her neck was squeezed off at the first joint.

285
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,080
 And it was just as she told me."

286
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,600
 Defense lawyer walks a little bit closer, quote, "And was this not a dream founded upon

287
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
 your distressed condition of mind, Mary Jane?

288
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
 No, sir.

289
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,760
 It was no dream, for I was as awake as I ever was.

290
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,200
 She wore the very dress that she was killed in.

291
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,600
 And when she went to leave me, she turned her head completely around and looked at me

292
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
 like she wanted me to know all about it."

293
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,280
 And Jerry's like, "Uh, she was spooking one of the jurors, puts a blanket over his head.

294
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,920
 Let's go back in time a bit."

295
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,800
 Mary Jane had a daughter named Elva Zona Hester.

296
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,560
 And Zona became a mother herself, an unmarried mother, at age 22.

297
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,440
 Well, you know, we're talking 1897, so not a good time to be an unwed mother.

298
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,600
 Mary Jane's making the best of it.

299
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,040
 They're doing what they can do in this little town in West Virginia.

300
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,960
 And eventually a blacksmith comes to town.

301
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,440
 He seems to be a pretty cool dude.

302
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,920
 All the ladies want him, all the men want to be him.

303
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,400
 And everyone who needs blacksmithing or blacksmith supplies have to go to him because he's the

304
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
 dude in town.

305
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,440
 His name is Edward Shoe, but he goes by the nickname Trout.

306
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,920
 So you know you're cool when you can pull off a nickname of a big old ugly fish and

307
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
 people are like, "Hey, what's up Trout?"

308
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
 Within a month, these two are married.

309
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,520
 Whirlwind romance.

310
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,640
 Three months later, it's January 24th, 1897, and Trout's ching, ching, ching, working

311
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,760
 to the blacksmith, hitting that metal against other metal that's like hot and informing it

312
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 into something.

313
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 And he's like, "You little boy, little boy person who works at my shop.

314
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,800
 Yes, Mr. Trout.

315
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
 Go home and fetch some eggs.

316
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
 You guys want eggs?"

317
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 Everyone's like, "Yeah, eggs on me."

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,280
 They were like, "I'm planning on putting eggs on the anvil, cooking them on the anvil."

319
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,560
 They're like, "Mmm, tastes like solder."

320
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,000
 So anyways, the kid goes home to his house to pick up some eggs.

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,280
 Kids like, "Yeah, I'm gonna go get some eggs."

322
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
 And he goes in the house.

323
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:58,320
 Hello? Hello? Apparently they live in the Grand Canyon.

324
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,600
 And there at the bottom of the stairs lies the broken body of Zona Hester.

325
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,240
 Little boy lets Trout know authorities get called when the police get their Trouts already

326
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,720
 at home.

327
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,680
 He's beside himself.

328
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,680
 He's absolutely grieving about what happened.

329
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
 Sobbing.

330
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,200
 He washed his wife's body down, put on her favorite dress with a really, really high neck.

331
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,600
 Really, really like, really hold, hold to that neck in place.

332
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
 Didn't it Trout?

333
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,520
 Really, really got that turtle neck on.

334
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,920
 Put that on that dress.

335
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,000
 He's like, "Oh, you know what she always loved?

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,640
 She always loved this scarf.

337
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,880
 Oh, yes she did.

338
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,320
 And let me wrap this scarf around her neck."

339
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,120
 And everyone in town, well I shouldn't say everyone in town, but a lot of people in town

340
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,480
 are kind of suspicious because normally the job of preparing the debt, like washing the

341
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,080
 body down, putting it in nice clothes is what, it's women work, right?

342
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
 Men don't do that.

343
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,880
 Men work with their hands.

344
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 Well, that takes hands.

345
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,040
 Women don't do it with their feet.

346
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,280
 But you know, like men lift up trees and like smash iron with their bare hands and make

347
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
 swords.

348
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,840
 I thought the women put the clothes on.

349
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,280
 So they thought it was a little weird that Trout was doing this.

350
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,320
 But some people go, "Maybe he's just grieving."

351
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,040
 And maybe she really did like that scarf wrapped super tight around her neck.

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
 Maybe she'd enjoyed it.

353
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,040
 She had been currently being treated by the local doctor, who was actually the guy who

354
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,240
 was coming to check the money on.

355
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,080
 And when the doctor gets there, he goes, "She had been being treated by the doctor for,

356
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
 quote, 'female trouble.'"

357
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,600
 And then her cause of death, decided by the same doctor, was first listed as everlasting

358
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
 fate.

359
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,320
 "Oh my stars, there was no handsome man there to catch her.

360
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,520
 She falls down, she dies."

361
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,120
 Then that condition, cause of death, was changed to childbirth.

362
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,600
 Which was interesting in town because not many people thought she was pregnant.

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,520
 Her mom especially, Mary Jane hadn't heard anything about her daughter being pregnant.

364
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,160
 But the doctor was like, "Nope.

365
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,680
 She came down with a case of the kids.

366
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,320
 She came down with a case of kids in the belly and it killed her."

367
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,120
 Delicate, delicate woman.

368
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,440
 She died cause she had a little baby in her.

369
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,360
 People are like, "That's not really how it works.

370
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,080
 You know where babies come from, right?"

371
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,280
 And the doctor's like, "Nope.

372
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,960
 I do not."

373
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,800
 Now every time they had to do something with the body, trout was always there.

374
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,040
 They're like, "Okay, let's move the body."

375
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,200
 He's like, "Okay, here, I'll stand by and sob really loudly right in your ear so you

376
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,440
 can't think."

377
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,160
 They take her down to the funeral home, crying like tears are actually falling on the coroner's

378
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
 face.

379
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,480
 Get off of me.

380
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,080
 The cops go to like look at the body.

381
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,640
 They think it's a little weird, you know?

382
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 Again, people don't normally just fall over dead due to child.

383
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,240
 And he would be crying, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

384
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

 oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

386
