00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 Did Russian cosmonauts see angels flying in space? The truth may shake up the

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,320
 paranormal community forever. And then we travel to New York City to take a look

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,400
 at a bizarre crime spree that happened in the 1930s. Who is 3x and what is the

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:33,000
 red diamond of Russia today on Dead Rabbit Radio? Hey everyone welcome back to

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,240
 another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,580
 great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Let's give a shout out to

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,520
 our newest Patreon supporter Caleb. Caleb thank you so much for supporting

 the show that really really helps out a lot. You are awesome, really really

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,680
 appreciate it. Everyone all the other patrons are like you never called me

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
 awesome. You're all awesome. Caleb's awesome but all of you guys are awesome.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Thank you so much for your support. Still sending out those Dead Rabbit Radio

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,280
 stickers. I'm gonna be revealing the design soon. You guys are gonna be like

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,840
 "Oh I got a support Patreon" because these stickers are dope. These stickers are dope.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,320
 Caleb, but Caleb we are actually going to take a new vehicle. I don't think we've

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,320
 used this before. I think I just made it up now. We're gonna do a slow motion walk

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,960
 or in our spacesuits and there's like NASA voices. You know NASA voices they're

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,400
 like 10, 9, 8, because you know normal people don't count. Only NASA people.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,960
 We're in the rabbit rocket. We're like "Uhhh" it's like G-forces and stuff. We're

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,080
 leaving behind the Earth's atmosphere. We're blasting off into space. We're gonna

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:49,840
 go to a Russian space station known as "Salute 7" dead rabbit rocket. You

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,600
 don't want a vehicle that has the word dead in it. I just realized that the

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,200
 rabbit rocket though it breaks away of the coil of the planet Earth. The planet

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,080
 Earth is shaking its fist at us. I'll get you one of these days. I'll get you on

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,880
 reentry. We're like gulp. We're floating around space. We're back in the year 1985

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,160
 and Soviet space station "Salute 7" it's in low orbit. Low Earth orbit. Now up

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
 there there's six cosmonauts just chilling, running scientific experiments,

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,480
 doing wedgies on each other. I do... that'd be actually so funny. Now that I

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,760
 thought about that you should have a movie where there's a bully on a space

29
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,980
 station. So you have like this guy who's so muscular his suit. You know the suit?

30
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,920
 Space suits are all baggy. His muscles are bulging out of his space suit. He's

31
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,040
 just beating up nerds. James Wan make that happen. I know you listen to this

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,880
 podcast. I know you do. If I was one of... if I was an astronaut I'd totally be a

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,480
 bully ruining all their experiments. They're like what? I didn't know that

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,560
 Space Mold had mustaches. I'm gonna draw on it with the Sharpie. There's a reason

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,560
 why I'm not a scientist. So anyways, but now we are. We're docking with this

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,360
 "Salute" space station. There's six cosmonauts up there. One of them is Oleg

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,080
 Atkov. Just floating around and then they see like this orange gas floating

38
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,600
 outside of the space station. At first they think they're all going to die.

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,600
 What's going on out here? We shouldn't be seeing orange mist outside the space

40
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,320
 station, but then suddenly the mist forms into shapes. Each shape is about 80 feet

41
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:28,820
 long. These massive shapes. They end up seeing seven angels. Hold on. Don't

42
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,800
 shut the podcast off yet. Caleb's trying to hotwire the rocket to get out of here.

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,080
 He's like this story's lame. Hold on. Hold on. I know it's completely

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,480
 unbelievable, but let's just keep going with it. And actually I'm sure a lot of

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,900
 you guys are like, "Oh, Jason's covering this. I've seen this story on

46
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,120
 ancient aliens. This is a real popular story." That's weird. He normally does

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,940
 weirder, more obscure stuff. Hold on guys. Do not panic. Do not panic in the space

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,960
 station. There's a reason why I'm doing this story. So anyways, as lame as it

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,980
 sounds, these angels are floating in space and the Russian cosmonauts are like,

50
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,460
 "Oh!" They reported back to Earth. They call up the Soviet Union on their rotary

51
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,380
 phone in space because it's Russian technology. It's not the most advanced

52
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,180
 stuff. There's a wire going all the way from the space station to the

53
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,180
 Kremlin. We just saw some angels up here and they go, "Nyet! Do not tell anyone

54
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,900
 else about these things of the phone." That's pretty good impression, right? You

55
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,500
 guys like that one? Another group of cosmonauts ended up coming up to the

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,400
 space station and the Oleg and his buddies are like, "Hey, yeah, it's pretty cool. You

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,200
 can float around and give people wedgies. It's hard to do a noogie in a space

58
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,000
 helmet." But we found a way. They have a little mechanical arm that doesn't...

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,340
 But there's also a bunch of angels. There's lots and

60
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,400
 bunch of angels that will show up and the cosmonauts are like, "What? We weren't

61
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,760
 briefed on that." And then soon enough with the new cosmonauts up there, there's

62
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,420
 this orange glow outside the space station. Angels show up. And NASA had

63
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,260
 intercepted this communication. They had their own phone line going right to the

64
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,700
 White House. NASA had intercepted this communication and their thing was like,

65
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,820
 "It must be some sort of mass hallucination. There must be some sort of

66
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,420
 oxygen deprivation going on in the space station." Something, because that's

67
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,580
 impossible. So NASA was looking into this and then some NASA astronauts have also

68
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,060
 said they've seen some weird things up there. The story is extremely popular. I

69
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,960
 found it originally on a non-alien. A non-alien is a website I go to all the

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,680
 time. I also, Mysterious Universe, covered it. Ancient aliens did a segment on it. So

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,120
 it's been covered a lot. I normally don't cover stories that are that wide known.

72
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,240
 The reason why I'm covering it now, because it is an interesting story. Angels in

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,760
 space, it does sound super cheesy. But the reason why I'm covering it is all these

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,720
 other sources have covered it. I tried to be more obscure. I was able to track down

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,640
 where this story came from. The earliest mention that I could find in

76
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:56,340
 print was a book from April 1st. April 1st, 1996. This book, that was when it was

77
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,780
 published. I don't think it was published on that date on purpose, but there's a

78
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,500
 book called Moments with Angels. Spectacular encounters with heavenly

79
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
 heavenly messengers. And you'll see the book in the show notes. Not the book

80
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,020
 itself, but the link to buy the book. And in this book contains this passage, quote,

81
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,180
 "According to the Weekly World News," and then it tells the story that I just told

82
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,220
 you. If you don't know what Weekly World News-- half of you guys, I think I heard the

83
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,920
 face palm. If you don't know what Weekly World News is, imagine the-- here's some

84
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,360
 other headlines from Weekly World News. Idaho Man stricken with potato feet.

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,960
 They covered the Bat Boy, Bat Boy saga. Bat Boy was found in a cave. Bat Boy joined

86
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,380
 the military. I think Bat Boy ran for president at some point. I was Bigfoot's

87
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,460
 love slave. That's a famous Weekly World News. It's fictional news. Fictional news.

88
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,680
 So it's made up. It's made up, dude. And this story's been going around for years.

89
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,380
 This is what's so funny about this. I've heard about this story years ago.

90
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,940
 Ancient aliens, they had got all their experts together. They did reenactments.

91
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,820
 It would be the equivalent of ancient aliens doing an episode and they'd be

92
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,000
 like, "And some people still believe that this school houses both witches and

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,500
 wizards to this very day." Then you have like some reenactment of some fourth

94
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,740
 rate Harry Potter wannabe flying around and then you cut to a talking head and

95
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,460
 he's like, "Well, you know, magic and mysticism go long back into England's

96
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,700
 history. It's fake. It's so fake. I don't know if I'm frustrated or having a ball

97
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,360
 with this." Because I've heard this-- I cover a lot of obscure stories. I'm sure a

98
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
 good portion of you knew this story before I even talked about it. It's fake.

99
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:47,140
 It's 100% fake. 100% fake. And it took me 20 minutes to find. You know what the

100
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,460
 key was? It was like on one of the articles they had a photograph or like an

101
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,940
 illustration I looked at it and I go, "That looks like that was from the Weekly

102
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,140
 World News." I read the Weekly World News growing up. I thought it was hilarious.

103
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,980
 That's from the Weekly World News. So I did a reverse image search. It wasn't

104
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,940
 pulling up anything. So I had to do the typical thing where I just go back to

105
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,080
 find the farthest back reference to it. And I found that book and it said-- I did

106
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,360
 a little Google book search for the inside of the book and it said, "According to the

107
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,720
 Week--" No! Because of course you want it to be true, right? As cheesy as it is.

108
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,320
 First off, I'd be like, "How come the Soviets get to see the angels and not the

109
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,080
 Americans?" Because come on guys, right? We don't have telephone wires going from

110
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,080
 Earth to the space station. But that aside, that ethnocentrism aside, the

111
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,420
 story's fake anyway. So I'm actually glad it was so, you know. It wasn't John Glenn

112
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:46,040
 or Neil Armstrong. It's in this Oleg dude. It's on his Wikipedia page. Like, it's

113
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,860
 like-- he actually invented all of this. Like, he has all these patents for like

114
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,020
 these devices that allow open-heart surgeries to go by much easier. On his

115
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,500
 Wikipedia page, it says that he saw angels. That's ridiculous. It's hilarious.

116
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,880
 It's hilarious. But guys, really, Mysterious Universe, Anomalien-- I get it.

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,760
 When you put out a ton of content, you're gonna make mistakes.

118
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,200
 Mysterious Universe and Anomalien-- I get a lot of stuff from them. A lot of their

119
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,040
 stuff is good. Neither of those articles had an author's byline on it. So I'm

120
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,800
 wondering if the author figured out, "Oh, wait a second. This isn't true." And then

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:29,160
 had their name removed. That's possible. The Anomalien article was-- a couple points

122
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,880
 said, "This does sound ridiculous," but they kept going with it. I get it.

123
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,300
 Both of those websites post stuff daily. I get you have to churn stuff out. I've

124
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,420
 done stories that turned out not to be true as well, like Lone Pine Devils,

125
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,460
 Civil War of the Worlds. I've done stuff that turned out not to be true, but I'll

126
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,620
 correct it when it's brought to my attention. But I'm not gonna say, "Oh,

127
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,700
 Mysterious Universe, you suck." Anomalien, you suck. When you're throwing a hundred

128
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
 darts at a dartboard, you're gonna miss from time to time. They might want to

129
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,160
 run corrections on it now. They don't have to pull the article down, but they

130
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,520
 can say, "Hey, we found this out. Ancient Aliens. Ancient Aliens has a dedicated

131
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,040
 team of writers and editors. I hope. Maybe I'm wrong, but they have a dedicated

132
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,200
 team of people that-- that to me is more inexcusable. Mysterious Universe

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,120
 website, they have a couple writers. They're always looking for content. They

134
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,880
 put out a lot of good stuff. You're gonna make mistakes from time to time. An

135
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,520
 Anomalien, it's the same thing. You're just looking for content. You're gonna

136
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,220
 get hoodwinked. But they're not these multi-- I mean, come on, dude. By the time, at

137
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,580
 some point when the guy playing Oleg, when the-- when the guy doing the

138
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,300
 reenactment for the Russian cosmonaut, he should have been like, "Wait a second.

139
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,980
 This story sounds really, really dumb." But then again, Ancient Aliens, the

140
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,540
 producer of Ancient Aliens, may have turned him up and go, "Have you ever seen this show?

141
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:55,600
 It's all dumb." I always rag on Ancient Aliens and just to back it up, you guys

142
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,680
 might be a huge fan of the show and that's totally fine if you enjoy that

143
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,440
 show. It's totally fine. There is a YouTube video. I'll have to put it in the

144
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,640
 show notes. There's a YouTube video I refer to all the time called "Ancient

145
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,960
 Aliens Debunked." It's three hours long, but it has timestamps so you can click to

146
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,500
 the stuff that you want, like goblitepke or whatever you say, pyramids, like the

147
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,660
 Nazca lines. You click on what you want and the guy has done his research and he

148
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,480
 goes, "This is what really happened." In fact, it was from a guy who loved Ancient

149
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,760
 Aliens. It was his favorite show. He had a little penant that said "Ancient Aliens."

150
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,000
 And then one day, he realized that they told him a lie. They said, "Yeah, we'll pick

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,160
 you up at five." And he's out there and it's raining and it's 6.45 and there's

152
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,200
 still no car. He's like, "Ancient Aliens." He realized they said something that wasn't

153
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
 true and he started researching a lot of their claims and realized that wasn't

154
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,220
 true so he made this three-hour long YouTube video. Check it out. If you enjoy

155
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,180
 the show, whatever, like I'm not a snob. I definitely think it's

156
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,340
 interesting, but this story, I don't believe it, but this story is 100%

157
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:59,620
 fake. It's from the Weekly World News, so I feel bad for Oleg. I feel bad for Oleg.

158
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,980
 It's on his Wikipedia page. If one of you guys wants to go change it, I'm sure he

159
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,100
 would appreciate it. His ghost or if he's still alive, but while you are

160
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,780
 changing Wikipedia, we're gonna take this rocket back down to earth. We're gonna

161
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,800
 sneak in though because the earth still wants to beat us up. We're gonna come

162
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,200
 around to Australia. We're gonna fly nice and low. We're actually taking the

163
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,960
 long way around the world because apparently that's how that works. Now

164
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,280
 this story, I never ever heard of this story and you guys know I always like to

165
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,680
 give credit where credit's due. Or bash on people when they get something horribly

166
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,400
 wrong. This is from a Reddit user called Trailwentcold. Trailwentcold is

167
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
 actually also the name of this user's podcast. It's a true crime podcast called

168
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,260
 Trailwentcold. I haven't listened to the podcast, but this is a really good write-up.

169
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,940
 Wanted to give them credit for this. Okay, Lib, let's hop out of the rabbit

170
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,280
 rocket. We are taking off in the carpenter copter again, flying nice and

171
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,620
 low over the ocean. The earth is still looking for us. We're flying low over

172
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,140
 the ocean. We're headed to College Point, New York. It's June 11th, 1930, and we're

173
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,540
 flying to a Lovers Point. You know what they call it? Like Lookout Hill or

174
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,800
 Lovers Point or Makeout Mountain or whatever. You know where people, Lovers

175
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,560
 Lane. That's what I was looking for. It's the place where you go to like make out and

176
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,080
 stuff, kiss people. Not because you can't do that at home. Well they couldn't. This group

177
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,360
 of people couldn't. Joseph Mosinski. He's 39 years old. He owned a grocery store.

178
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,720
 And he's married, but she's not in the car with him at Lovers Lane. No, instead

179
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,480
 we have Catherine May, a 19 year old girl. He's been having an affair with her.

180
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,580
 So the sun has set, the earth is asleep, we're able to evade detection, the moon

181
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,660
 is high, they're just sitting there in the dark. Because I don't think they had car

182
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,460
 radios back then, right? I think you still have to have the giant piece of wood,

183
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,660
 wooden radio in your living room. So they're just sitting in a car having to

184
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,180
 talk to each other. They're not even talking to each other. They're in the back

185
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,540
 seat, they're making out. And then outside the car, it's not a guy's sandpapering

186
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:05,340
 some wood down. It's a stranger walking up alongside the car and he knocks on the

187
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,560
 car door and Joseph jumps up. Totally scared. This wasn't supposed to happen.

188
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,120
 He was supposed to make it out with his 19 year old lover. Instead there's a guy

189
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,800
 standing there and he tells Joe, "Get in the front seat." But in a German accent, I

190
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,680
 can't do a German accent. In a German accent, he tells Joseph to get in the front

191
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,920
 seat. Joseph gets in the front seat, Catherine stays in the back. Joseph is

192
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,880
 waiting for the next command, "Pop! Pop!" Two bullets enter his head. He falls.

193
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,620
 Now Catherine's in the back seat. She's completely panicking, but before she can

194
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,580
 even take in that her lover had been shot, the back door opens up, the man

195
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,780
 climbs into the back seat and rapes Catherine. After he's done, he orders her

196
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:53,220
 out of the car and says, "I will take you to the bus stop." So they walk to the bus

197
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,140
 stop, they get on the bus together. So now the bus is driving through New York.

198
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,480
 A murderer, a rapist sitting next to a young woman driving through the city

199
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,280
 streets. Eventually they get to the bus station and the man gives her an envelope

200
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,480
 and says, "Do not read this until tomorrow." She gets on another bus like they

201
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,920
 took him to a bus terminal, a main bus terminal. She had to take another bus

202
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,640
 home and once they separate, she opens up the letter and it says, "Joseph

203
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:28,340
 Moisinski 3x3x097." Now while she's riding the bus, she remembers something.

204
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,300
 Catherine remembers something because she just looked over at her notes.

205
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,420
 Like I just did and I forgot this detail. When she had a flashback, when she was on

206
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,700
 the bus, she looks over and she sees the man, the stranger, go through Joseph's

207
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,140
 pockets after he killed him. He pulls some pieces of paper out of Joseph's

208
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,180
 pocket. He's kind of looking at him. He's kind of like, "Ugh." Then he crumbles him up,

209
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,520
 sets him on fire, throws him on the ground, and then we come back to the present

210
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,800
 day. Now she's all alone. The dude dropped her off at the bus station

211
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,000
 and just walked away and she's taking the bus home. She doesn't go to the police.

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 She doesn't go to the police because she's honestly, and this is the way

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,800
 sometimes people act, yeah she just saw a murder and she was just a victim of a

214
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,080
 horrible crime herself, but she didn't want her parents to know she was with a

215
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,340
 married man. She figured, "Well, if I go to the cops, that will come out, so I'm

216
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,340
 just gonna keep my mouth shut." But that's not really how crime works, right? You

217
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,300
 don't always need the testimony of someone because what happens is the next

218
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,420
 day people are up at Lever's Lane and they see a car parked and they're like,

219
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,220
 "Whoa, he's here early," and his brains are all over the car and they're like, "Ugh."

220
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,660
 So they call the cops. The cops go out there and they're checking in on them. It

221
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,060
 doesn't take long for the cops to trace him back to Catherine May. So they pull

222
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,880
 her in for questioning and they're like, "What happened?" She starts telling the

223
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,480
 story, she shows them the note, and they don't believe her. The very most they

224
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,240
 think she might have set him up and this note is supposed to misdirect him from

225
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 the crime, but they don't believe her. They don't believe her story at all. It

226
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,400
 does seem very far-fetched. Now, they hold her for a long period of time. They're

227
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
 constantly interrogating her trying to get her to break, but while they're

228
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,200
 interrogating her across town, the New York Evening Journal, it's a local

229
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,680
 newspaper, they get a letter. And the letter starts off with this quote,

230
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,780
 "Kindly print this letter in your paper for Moyzinski's friends." Then there's a

231
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,820
 bunch of coded letters and numbers. It goes on by saying, "By doing this you may

232
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,340
 save their lives." And the women may know where the missing papers are and who has

233
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,980
 them since they were given to Moyzinski. We do not want any more shootings unless

234
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:40,460
 we have to. Signed 3x, the man behind the gun. The letter was actually postmarked

235
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,840
 before the body was found. So the police know that the letter, whoever wrote the

236
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,600
 letter, knew about it, but it doesn't totally absolve Catherine, right? Because

237
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,960
 this could just be part of her scheme to kill somebody and get away with it. So

238
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,700
 they're still questioning her. The New York Evening Journal does not publish the

239
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,500
 letter though, so they get another letter. And the other letter explains, "Listen,

240
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,240
 Catherine May had nothing to do with this," which would actually make the police

241
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,800
 more suspicious because why is this guy saying, "Oh yeah, I killed and it may kill

242
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,280
 again, but she's innocent." Again, I think the cops are still thinking, "Catherine May

243
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,120
 has something to do with this." But the second letter says, "Listen, she had

244
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,940
 nothing to do with it. Not only did she have nothing to do with it, Joseph

245
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,640
 Moyzinski was super gross. He was banging six other women and two teenage

246
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,920
 girls, a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old." He goes, "Catherine May is innocent and this

247
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,600
 dude is no saint to begin with, so quit trying to act like he's some victim." He

248
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,120
 is a victim, a murder victim, but he basically deserved it. It's kind of what

249
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,640
 3X is saying, and now he's making his case. He actually has, in this second

250
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,040
 letter, he goes into really what's going on here. He says, "I am an agent of a

251
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,520
 secret international order, and when I met Moyzinski that night, it was to get

252
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,600
 from him certain documents, but unfortunately they were not in his

253
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,720
 possession at the time." And then he goes on to have this coded message, and he's

254
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
 saying, "If anyone knows where these documents are, we're going to need them."

255
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,160
 And then eventually the note ends with, "These papers must be returned to us at

256
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,960
 once, or 14 of Moyzinski's friends will join him. Moyzinski's relatives and

257
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
 friends have up to Monday, 12 p.m., to bring these documents to us or to have

258
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,560
 someone get in touch with us and tell them where to find them. If no answer is

259
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,400
 received by that time, we will start merry hell for all of them." And then he has

260
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,280
 his normal signature 3X, the man behind the gun, and then there's an inverted V

261
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,680
 and a regular V. All that stuff happened within a five-day period, because by the

262
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:41,760
 time June 16th 1930th rolls around, we have Noel, Noel in OEL, Noel, Noel

263
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,520
 Soutley, 26-year-old radio mechanic, and his girl, his main squeeze, Betty Ring, 18

264
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,760
 years old. They're on a floral park neighborhood in New York. They're making

265
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,080
 out. It's big news about this guy getting killed, because you're getting letters

266
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,240
 written to the newspaper, everyone, it's super intriguing, it's sexy, they

267
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,280
 don't know about the rape, it's not reported in the newspaper, but like, "Ooh,

268
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,440
 who's this man behind the gun? Who's this mystery man?" So Noel and Betty must have

269
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
 known about this, but what are you gonna do? You're gonna go to Lever's Lane,

270
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,040
 footprints up alongside the car. Guy pulls out a gun, 3X, as he'll be named

271
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,920
 from now on, pulls the gun out, points it at Noel, and asks him for his driver's

272
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,560
 license. So Noel pulls out his driver's license, and at that point 3X is looking

273
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,960
 at the driver's license, puts it down, and pulls a flashlight out and kind of

274
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,800
 clicks it, shining the light off into the tree line, and then he turns back to

275
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,600
 Noel and he goes, "I'm letting my friends know I can do this one alone."

276
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,000
 Odd detail. 3X asks Noel, "Do you know who John Moisinski is?" And Noel says, "No."

277
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,320
 And before he can continue to deny that he knows this guy, 3X shoots him in the

278
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,800
 mouth. Noel says, "Plades with them, I'm not the man you're looking for." 3X

279
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,000
 shoots him again, killing him. He begins going through Noel's pockets just like

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,560
 before, and he pulls out a piece of paper and he looks at it and he goes, "I have it!"

281
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,000
 Puts it in his own pocket and then sees Betty sitting on the other side of the

282
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,040
 car. He begins to walk around the car and he approaches Betty. Now the rape was not

283
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,880
 reported. Betty doesn't know what may happen, but she probably didn't have to

284
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,420
 read on the newspaper to gather the intent of this guy. Plus he just murdered

285
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,000
 someone. I think she kind of knew what was coming. As he's getting closer to

286
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,360
 her, she actually has on this religious necklace and she kind of holds it up,

287
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:35,240
 almost like warding off a vampire. And 3X changes his mind, leaves her alone, but

288
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,320
 does escort her to a local bus stop and they both take a bus to the bus station

289
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,760
 and they go their separate ways. He does give her a letter as well, and on the

290
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,260
 letter it says, "Sowley 3X." Again, a total targeted kill. He just pulls out the

291
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,200
 letter and hands it to her. She goes directly to the police. She goes directly

292
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,680
 to the police. And the police are looking at all this stuff and they're like,

293
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,680
 "There's no way that a 39 year old grocery owner and a 26 year old radio

294
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,200
 mechanic are part of some sort of international intrigue, spiring. It's a

295
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,440
 super ridiculous. Like this guy is either picking people at random and then

296
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,560
 it's some sort of magician. He can just pull stuff out of his pocket that has

297
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,480
 someone's name on it. Or these are targeted killings like mob hits and

298
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,040
 this is a cover story. At this point they've let Catherine to make go, but

299
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,080
 they're like, "There has to be something else going on here." When they go to the

300
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,440
 crime scene and they find Noel, the police go through his pockets and they

301
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,900
 find an article about Joseph's murder. On that article the name Moisinski is

302
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,640
 stamped on it and in the margin someone wrote, "Here's how." The police are

303
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,480
 looking at each other and they're like, "Are you serious?" So these guys did know

304
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,280
 each other somehow enough that what it looked like was something, this is just

305
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,620
 supposition that somebody sent Noel a news article warning him, which is

306
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,540
 interesting to think of because then what Noel's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know. I'm

307
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,240
 gonna go to Lovers Lane anyways. I don't care. No one's gonna keep me from

308
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,920
 smooching my sweet thing." Someone sent you an article about someone getting shot

309
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,080
 playing a pick-up game of basketball. I would just suggest not to play

310
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,840
 basketball for a while, but anyways he went to Lovers Lane. He was killed as

311
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,200
 well. Even in journals it gets another letter and it basically says, "3x is

312
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,240
 starting to detail." It's a lot of coded messages. Like all these people have

313
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,740
 different coded words and numbers, but it's basically saying, "Hey, thanks for

314
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,980
 publishing my paper. One of these people came forward and gave me some of the

315
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,380
 paperwork I'm looking for and I got $37,000 in money that had been blackmailed

316
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,700
 from people and I'm gonna keep doing this stuff and it looks like we're getting

317
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,500
 this all taken care of." And then on June 21st they got one more letter. Even in

318
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,620
 journal got one more letter. It said, "The last document, NJ 4344, returned to us

319
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,760
 on the 19th at 9 p.m. My mission is ended. There is no further cause for worry."

320
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,320
 And then in a theatrical gesture it decides to let everyone know exactly what

321
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,920
 was going on. He goes on to explain that he does indeed work for a secret

322
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,000
 international order. This time he names it. It's called the Red Diamond of Russia.

323
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,520
 And he said, "Part of his signature with the inverted V and the regular V," he goes,

324
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,920
 "Those were symbols in and of themselves. The inverted V symbolized the

325
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,260
 supreme tribunal of the order and then the regular V was the secret agent. You

326
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,820
 put them together, it forms the form of a diamond. They didn't have emojis back

327
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,860
 there. This is about as complicated as you could get. Upside down V, regular V."

328
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,260
 He says that Joseph and Noel both were members of the Red Diamond, not just

329
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,940
 affiliated, not just owing a money or stumbled across them and this was their

330
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,500
 way to keep them quiet. They were actually members of the Red Diamond of

331
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,540
 Russia and they committed treason against the group. They'd actually sold top

332
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,440
 secret documents and were blackmailing people with them. And they started their

333
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,240
 own little ring. It was them two and fourteen other people who were blackmailing

334
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:57,160
 people with this information. And so they had drawn lots and 3x had gotten the

335
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:04,480
 winning lot to go to America and retrieve these documents. He says, "My job's done

336
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,040
 though. My job's completely done. Any other letters signed 3x are fake. I'm

337
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,020
 going back home. I'm done." And it was true. They actually did get letters after

338
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,180
 that, but the police in the evening journal were like, "No, these aren't from the

339
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,540
 original 3x." No one was ever caught and the police have always still been

340
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,260
 scratching their heads over how real this story is. Because, I mean, first off, they

341
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,660
 interviewed the families and families are like, "No, they had no ties to any

342
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,780
 sort of international crime ring or spy ring or nothing. That doesn't make any

343
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,120
 sense." I could understand a 39 year old grocery store owner. Maybe at some time in

344
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,920
 his past had gotten involved in something and then retired and tried, you

345
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,760
 know, doing something else and maybe took some documents with him for his

346
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,560
 extra payday. By the time he's 39, you've usually lived a pretty full life.

347
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,080
 You've pretty lived a pretty diverse life. At 26, so that'd be really hard to

348
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,600
 pull off. To join, to find, join and then leave a spy organization within a short

349
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,700
 amount of time. Like the FBI, the CIA, they don't, I mean, other than a

350
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,860
 specialized agent, they really don't even want to talk to you until you're out of

351
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:15,620
 college. They want you to get a lot of life learning under your belt. It's not

352
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,820
 like they're scouting out high schools. Now, of course, CIA, FBI agents, do they

353
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,380
 have underage agents? Absolutely. The FBI actually now they say that. They may not,

354
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,500
 but I'm sure the CIA has had agents that were 14, 15 years old. I would be shocked

355
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,240
 if they didn't have those. But, I think the FBI seems more investigative stuff.

356
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,080
 CIA does a lot of more undercover stuff. So you would need someone who was 14

357
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,500
 years old sometimes, or maybe they can just get an adult. It's not like doovy

358
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,600
 houses are working for the CIA or Webster. Let's go on an adventure, but first,

359
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,180
 clack, clack, my gun ready. Just in case we run into any weirdos. It would be weird

360
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,160
 that, and it's also like, if they were in the Red Diamond of Russia, that they had

361
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,960
 come up with this plan together. They just, the age and the skill level

362
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,220
 difference, you know, grocery store owner versus a radio mechanic. They just seem so

363
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,220
 vast. So the police have always been kind of scratching their heads, and they go on

364
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,780
 one hand, he could have just been this guy wanted to murder these two people, and

365
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,140
 created this elaborate backstory. They could have been highly targeted

366
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,380
 killings, and this was the backstory the guy went with. Maybe it was a thrill killer.

367
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,780
 Is this really any different than the Zodiac? This is basically just the

368
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,220
 Zodiac killings with extra steps, right? This is having that writing the code and

369
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,680
 messages, but this guy's built up his own mythology, his own world behind it.

370
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,840
 The Zodiac wasn't popping out letters with people's names on it, so that's a

371
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,800
 different thing, but the idea of writing the letters and building up the myth

372
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,640
 behind the man. Otherwise, it's just two people who got shot at Lovers Lane. But it

373
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,720
 could actually be that the Red Diamond of Russia is a real organization, and I

374
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
 say is and not was, because if a group like this existed, I would imagine they're

375
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,520
 still around today. I would imagine they're still around today. So I think it's a

376
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,860
 pretty clear thing. If you're working for a secret organization that has no

377
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,380
 problems sending killers out to take care of business, don't steal from them or

378
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,140
 try to blackmail them or any of that stuff. First off, I want to get involved

379
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,620
 with them in the first place, but secondly, if you decided to, when there is an

380
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,660
 opt-out clause, take it and don't walk out with a filing cabinet. Just be like,

381
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,400
 "See you guys later. I will go now work at my grocery store. I will blackmail

382
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,580
 none of you. Bye guys." And that's the conspiracy story, but also I think it's

383
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,580
 interesting on a meta level, just as a story level. And so I want to take a note

384
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,780
 here real quick to explain this part of the thing. So because other people have

385
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,260
 probably heard of this story and or you could follow the show notes. If you

386
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,620
 read the articles of the time, it never mentions the rape. It never mentions the

387
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:54,400
 rape of Catherine at all. I only saw it in the Reddit post by Trail went Cold, and

388
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,520
 I was doing my research and I was looking this and I go, "That's weird because it's

389
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,200
 only in this one Reddit post." So I actually messaged Trail went Cold, because

390
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,080
 this is how you do research, ancient aliens. This is how you do this, okay? When

391
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,000
 you come across things that seem off, you have to track down the source. I go, I

392
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,520
 need some clarification on the rape issue. I'm not seeing that anywhere else.

393
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,600
 And Trail went Cold said, "The detail was so scandalous that the

394
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,260
 newspapers didn't report it." And I was like, "Okay, that's interesting." And then I

395
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,220
 verified that as well. I found a book from the 1940s written about this case,

396
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,020
 and it also said that she, you know, enough time had passed they had said that

397
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,140
 Catherine had been raped. So it's an interesting side note, and it also

398
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,540
 tinges the story a bit. Because as we get more into the story, you're gonna be

399
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,060
 like, "That's it! Like this guy seems quite noble. He seems like he might act..." Oh

400
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,700
 yeah, but he raped a woman. Like it's really weird. If you read the story

401
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,480
 without the rape, it actually has a more of a...

402
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:58,080
 a noble revenge type of thing. A man on a mission type of thing. But the

403
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,240
 rape really tinges. It's really weird. I mean, I'm not saying that the killing's

404
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,800
 okay, but it's just a weird detail. And I think that part of the mystique, I think

405
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,560
 at the time, even the mystique that this killer builds up, wouldn't have been so

406
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,900
 endearing if it was... if that detail was readily available. So is the Red Diamond

407
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,540
 Arrest just still in operation? Are they still out there just minding their own

408
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,260
 business until someone crosses their path? Or is it a group that has more lofty

409
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,900
 goals? I always say a lot of times people claim the Illuminati's running the

410
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,880
 world, or this ethnic group is running the world, or this political party's running

411
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,420
 the world, or whatever boogeyman you have. I always think the more realistic

412
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,800
 thing is you have thousands of small groups constantly vying for control, and

413
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,040
 there's allegiances, and betrayals, and things like that. And these groups are

414
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,360
 constantly trying to take over from other groups, and eventually conquer the

415
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,360
 world themselves, but no one's even come close yet. I think that's far more

416
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,840
 realistic, and I honestly far more frightening, because when you have a

417
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,960
 thousand groups fighting for control, that's just unmitigated chaos. It's kind

418
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,640
 of what it always feels like. But when things feel crazy today, things have

419
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,740
 always felt crazy. There's always been these groups fighting for control. So if

420
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,140
 the Red Diamond of Russia still exists, and they most likely do, they're

421
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,260
 still out there making moves. They're still out there sending agents. And again, if you

422
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,100
 work for one of these groups, the last thing you want to do is piss them off,

423
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,460
 because not only can they take you out, because that's kind of what they're

424
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,100
 known for, they can do it in a way that you will never find justice. Your killer

425
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,060
 will never be caught. If this guy wasn't sending letters, it would just be too

426
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,240
 random murders and a rape on a police blotter. No one would have thought twice

427
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,160
 about it. But the Red Diamond of Russia wanted to send a message. He tried to

428
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,920
 blackmail us. We will do whatever it takes to silence you. And that message was

429
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:01,160
 heard, and it's still being heard 70 years later. People are still talking

430
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,560
 about this story. Whether or not the group ever existed, or whether or not it

431
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,900
 exists today, it's definitely become a legend in the true crime community.
