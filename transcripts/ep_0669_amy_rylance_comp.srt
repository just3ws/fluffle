1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
 Today we meet a group of people who believe the more rotten the meat the sweeter the treat

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:13,560
 Then we take a look at some bizarre statistics that show what people really think about conspiracy theories

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,360
 Now we travel to Australia to take a look at a bizarre UFO story when Amy Rylance is abducted in front of a witness and

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,320
 Beamed aboard a UFO. She's only gone for three hours

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,360
 But how did her hair grow so long in such a short time?

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:44,560

 They're damned to hell. It's Dean Ryan everyone give a applause to Dean Ryan

12

 There's like a janitor wheeling in this giant giant mirror. It's like family on it. Let me out. Let me out

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,520
 Someone smash that mirror. I'm not gonna do it. I can't afford the bad luck

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,200
 Someone smashes it Dean Ryan. You've now been released to join us with the rest of the world

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,520
 Dean Ryan

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,680
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon

 Or if your soul is not doomed to an eternal two-dimensional existence. That's fine too. Just helps read the word about the show

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,960
 Really really helps out a lot Dean. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit robo

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,920
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna head out to a

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,360
 Tropical little paradise no one as the middle of nowhere

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
 splash

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,440
 splash

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,040
 Splash rowing all the way over there's a dude you guys may have seen this this is popped up on the news recently

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,760
 if you guys

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,520
 Have seen it. I apologize for bringing it back up. I apologize for these bad memories

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,800
 There's a guy who got his name on YouTube. He goes by severage

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,640
 Severage is a man and he has a unique idea

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,120
 Severage is what's known as an

29
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,080
 Anti-vegan now it's different than a non-vegan. I'm non-vegan. I don't eat vegan food if you eat vegan food fine

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
 I don't care right as long as you're not trying to eat my food. We're square

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,760
 Non-vegan is people who aren't vegan and anti-vegan is

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,360
 Someone who is against veganism who thinks that it's wrong and you you eat funny cuz you may go well Jason

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,920
 I actually think veganism is unhealthy or I think it's kind of highfalutin. I think it's pretentious whatever

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
 You're still not an anti-vegan in the way that severages

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,360
 Because you still eat I'm assuming you still eat vegetables

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,240
 You may not agree with the vegan lifestyle again. I really don't care

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,160
 I used to be vegetarian for moral reasons and then it got too expensive and morals went out the window

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,000
 I was like, I'll eat a cow you may not like the vegan lifestyle

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,680
 You may think it's pretentious or it's not super healthy, but you're not still not anti-vegan anti-vegan is someone who consumes no vegetables

40
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,560
 at all

41
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,120
 Not even the carnivore diet is considered anti-vegan because see anti-vegan

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,480
 They're like what you cook your food you disgusting man

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,040
 Anti-vegan is the consumption of raw meat

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,600
 Surprisingly, there's more than one person who does this they consume raw meat

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,360
 Now as I'm telling this story, I'm gonna keep having visuals of this video. I watched of

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:40,600
 Severage he had a jar. Okay, hold on a second. I can't be gagging the whole story. There's this video. It's on YouTube

47
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,240
 He has a jar of meat that he has let sit in this jar for a year

48
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,040
 Never cooked it

49
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,120
 Not like it would matter if it was cooked first and then he left over a year

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,360
 He sticks his fork and he pulls out what looks like hard

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,960
 clam chowder

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,080
 It's dripping white goo

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,720
 Sorry, my apologies if you're eating clam chatter tuna casserole my apologies if you're eating anything right now

54
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,400
 It's basically like a giant meatball of rotten meat and he goes I'm gonna eat the whole thing right now like that's supposed

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
 to be in the impressive part

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,880
 And he begins to he begins to devour this piece of rotten meat

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,960
 It's funny because I've never eaten rotten meat. I've eaten undercooked meat

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,440
 I've never eaten rotten meat. I assume most of you guys have never

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
 Severage turns out to be a

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:40,480
 Severage is Dean Ryan. This is the episode he's supporting. He's like, oh no trapped in a mirror and he's making fun of me

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,000
 We've never eaten rotten meat, but just you there's an instinctual thing

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 That kicks in when you talk about it and you look at it

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,320
 It's not like I can even like if someone was eating poop

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,280
 I've never eaten poop, but because I spend a lot of time around poop myself

65
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,040
 I'm not like a poop connoisseur that I know like the smell and the texture. I don't want anything to do with it

66
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,800
 So when Cece I can't watch people eat poop

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,000
 I don't feel bad about that. I'm not like oh man, I really should I really should start doing that

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
 But watching someone eat rotten meat

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,560
 I've never really been around rotten meat more than once or twice especially not year old meat watching him do it

70
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,180
 It makes you physically ill. I could barely watch it and he's eating this raw meat this year old raw meat

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,820
 And they do it for a couple reasons one because they're anti-vegan and this is all they can consume. They're so hungry

72
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,840
 They're like, oh when will dinner be ready? Oh three more months. Oh, no

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,800
 They're eating I'm sure they have to eat other meat in the meantime, but

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,600
 They're they're anti-vegans. They eat this raw meat and it also gets them high

75
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,240
 That's what I found out about it

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,280
 There was recently some news articles in the Sun and Newsweek

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,960
 Where they were like this new trend some people on the internet quote-unquote some people on internet

78
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,240
 Which is usually like three or four weirdos and then all of a sudden eight people tweet about it

79
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,200
 And then some lazy journalists will write an entire story about it

80
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,720
 And then some lazy podcaster will cover it the difference is is I know the game

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,760
 I know the game when Newsweek or Huffington Post or God forbid the New York Times runs a whole article about three tweets

82
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,700
 It blows my mind have my degree in journalism. It absolutely rattles my cage when

83
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,640
 Anyways, I'm part of the problem because I reported on a podcast this podcast is goofy and it covers weird stuff

84
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,800
 It's not the gray lady. Anyways, some people on the internet a couple people are eating raw meat

85
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
 It's become this viral storm viral because of the worms in their stomachs

86
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,720
 apparently if you eat it it gets you high and

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,160
 The articles they're like well, I really don't know the articles like IFL science commas like we really don't know the mechanism

88
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,920
 Of why it would make you high it could be that the bacteria

89
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,800
 Hit your stomach it could be that you're definitely ill it could be the side effects of these diseases

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,200
 I watched this video a severage and as he was eating it like before the video was like five six minutes long after he gets

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,700
 Then eating and he goes yep

92
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,760
 I already feel high already feel high and I thought oh

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,360
 That's how he gets high they make it up

94
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,560
 It's all in their head

95
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,880
 There's very few drugs that you can ingest that you get high immediately

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,600
 Like within five minutes of taking the drug so it's it has to be just psychosomatic

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,080
 IFL science. There's your answer. I almost feel like it's just a way to attract people to their disgusting lifestyle

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,880
 If you eat rotten meat, you'll get high you may get some sort of rush from the fact that you're doing something

99
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
 That's been forbidden by nature

100
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,880
 But I don't think you could actually classify it as a high if you're saying it was a high after two or three minutes of eating it

101
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
 I think it's in your head or

102
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,080
 It's similar to that high that endorphin rush which again

103
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,200
 Is it really a high when you eat salsa when you eat really really hot salsa?

104
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,920
 It makes you feel high

105
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,640
 But it's not like you're sitting next to the stoner and the guy's dropping acid and be like dude

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,160
 I can see the elves too. You're just faking it

107
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,920
 You're trying to get just eating bell peppers the whole time

108
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,080
 But you want to get in with the cool kids

109
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,120
 But if you want to get illegal high and you want to be the most disgusting person in your neighborhood

110
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,600
 Try raw meat so the very least you can pretend like it does something so bizarre

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 Subculture internet fad whatever it is the media could be hyping this up right now

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,120
 I did watch a man eat rotten meat

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,800
 I did watch a man eat meat that was a year old and if you look at a couple of his other videos

114
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,400
 This guy might be moving into Hans territory. He has a video where he's eating a lump of meat

115
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,200
 That's a year old Hans never did that Hans never did that

116
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
 He also has a whole video about how time doesn't exist and he uses as an example

117
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,160
 Proving time does not exist

118
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 The movie back to the future

119
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,200
 So

120
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,000
 I'm gonna be following this guy for a bit. He basically says there is no past. There is no future

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
 We are hanging out with Jesus right now

122
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:04,320
 Maybe he is getting high off that meat

123
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,520
 He believes the grass is the seed the blade and the decayed remains all at the same time interesting quantum philosophy

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,960
 You kind of lost me when you started talking about back to the future

125
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,280
 I have a lot of bad memories of conspiracy theories connected to back to the future and the fact that while you're explaining this conspiracy theory to me

126
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
 Your breath smells like Salmonella

127
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,880
 I'm gonna take a pass on this one, but I will continue to look into them. We might have a new Hans on our hands

128
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:39,040
 Dean Ryan, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind the anti-vegan movement

129
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 We are headed out to

130
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 Canada

131
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,360
 Cars driving underwater because we are on an island, but eventually we reach America's North Cousin Canada

132
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,920
 We pull up to a research laboratory. We all got on our lab coats

133
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,480
 We walk in in Canada. I found this so fascinating when I saw this the other day in Canada. They recently did this survey

134
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,680
 It was done by Insight's West polling company and I can't remember a survey done recently

135
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
 That's given us this kind of breadth of information

136
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,120
 This poll was done very recently between March 31st and April 5th. These questions were all conspiracy questions

137
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,080
 Do UFOs exist?

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,600
 53% of Canadians and we're actually gonna I think these would match up pretty much to most places in the Western world

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,640
 Do UFOs exist 53% of the population says yes

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:39,000
 18% of them absolutely believe they exist. That's kind of what I expected that one didn't surprise me that much

141
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
 But then we look at this

142
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,080
 COVID-19 created in a lab. It's actually been so long since I've even thought about the COVID-19

143
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:55,920
 Origin conspiracy theories remember like the official story. It was bat soup when's the last time you even heard the term bat soup

144
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,440
 That was the official story. So I was I totally forgot about this stuff COVID-19 created in a lab

145
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,280
 37% of Canadians believe that's possible

146
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,440
 They believe somewhat and 11% totally believe that it was created in a lab and I go that that's interesting 10% of the population

147
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,960
 Believes that any of the JFK conspiracy theories

148
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,720
 33% believe somewhat in the conspiracy theories 9% totally believe them

149
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,920
 So we start to see this the really the biggest conspiracy theory that people believe in is

150
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
 UFOs exist

151
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,520
 I think most people when they think about the scope of the universe they go there has to be aliens out there somewhere

152
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,960
 So I think that that's why that has such a high percentage any JFK conspiracy theory whatever it is

153
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,080
 33% but then we start to get into some conspiracy theories

154
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,880
 That are fairly popular that I didn't think would be

155
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,960
 Scientists have found a cure for cancer

156
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,800
 31% of people believe that scientists have found a cure for cancer, but they're not revealing it to make money

157
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,640
 Dude, that is a conspiracy theory

158
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,760
 I have not heard of in a long time that used to be really popular in the 80s and the 90s and

159
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,440
 I also heard it about AIDS that they had a cure for AIDS, but they weren't revealing it

160
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,480
 But Magic Johnson got it. That was the conspiracy theory

161
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,720
 Also, there was a conspiracy theory that he didn't get AIDS in the first place or HIV

162
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,120
 He didn't have HIV in the first place that it was some like

163
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,680
 Way for him they basically some bookie or someone says you owe money say they it was a weird conspiracy theory

164
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,200
 But there was one conspiracy theory that Magic Johnson didn't have HIV in the first place

165
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,080
 The other one was that he got the cure because he's still around. He's doing great HIV is not the death sentence

166
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,060
 It was when I was growing up, which is good

167
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,520
 But that scientists have found a cure for cancer that one is actually they took this poll in 2014 and then they did another one in

168
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,240
 2021 that's dropped 17 points that has almost been cut in half

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,320
 Since the last time it was pulled so very very fascinating

170
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,440
 There's a couple other conspiracy theories that took total tanks in the past couple years, but that's one of them

171
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,560
 29% of people somewhat believe

172
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,560
 That humans have been cloned

173
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,480
 That at least one and it's so funny because I joke about like when we talk about all the Hillary Clinton weird stories and

174
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,680
 Obama's a clone Hillary Clinton's a clone Nancy Pelosi's clone doppelganger, whatever I make fun of that

175
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:25,400
 I 100% believe that a human has been cloned. I don't think it's cloned and then growing to look exactly like

176
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,160
 68 or 78 hour old Hillary Clinton is I don't think we're anywhere near that

177
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,360
 Nor do we want to be why would you want to clone you?

178
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,600
 Make you super old

179
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,760
 But I do believe there's at least one person walking around today who by definition would be a cloned person. I

180
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
 100% believe that that technology is there. I would be in that 29%

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 I just don't think they're like lifelike

182
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,280
 lookalikes I

183
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,760
 Think that you they have probably taken genetic samples from people and cloned them

184
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,400
 But they would be little little baby Barack Obama little baby Hillary Clinton eating herself

185
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,880
 I think that she's taking a bite out of her arm to like Hillary. We have to grow you a new arm again

186
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,200
 Bigfoot exists

187
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,960
 20% I don't know if that's higher or lower than I thought honestly one in five

188
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,320
 Canadians again this is the poll you have to extrapolate everything and I'm extrapolating this to a lot of the Western world is where well

189
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,960
 But one in five adults believe bigfoot exists

190
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,720
 I live in an area where a lot of people believe bigfoot exists because I live up in kind of the home of bigfoot

191
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,960
 I live up in the Pacific Northwest, but in California. No, I wasn't even interested in bigfoot

192
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,360
 I thought it was kind of lame you wouldn't run into a lot of people who believed in bigfoot

193
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,080
 So overall see that's the thing like I'm around more people now who believe bigfoot exists

194
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,000
 But growing up it was just something goofy it was on the level of the Loch Ness monster and

195
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,440
 They don't ask specifically if Loch Ness monster exists in this poll they ask if oh go go go

196
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,600
 Exists which is the Canadian Loch Ness monster only nine percent of people exist

197
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,400
 And I think you could extrapolate that to say maybe a little bit more maybe

198
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,040
 10% 11% believe Loch Ness monster exists 20% one in five people believe bigfoot exists

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,080
 This is what I found bizarre because I had not really heard this conspiracy theory

200
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 I didn't know was a conspiracy theory

201
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:28,000
 Out of all my years of research. I've my great-grandma. I think believed it to a certain extent

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,520
 But I just figured it was my great-grandma being a sore loser

203
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,560
 I and I know people would believe this but I didn't think it was this high or that this was considered a conspiracy theory

204
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,040
 20% of people

205
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,800
 Somewhat and five percent of those absolutely believe the lottery is rigged

206
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:55,360
 Fascinating I honestly didn't know there was that high of a percentage of people who believed that I

207
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,320
 Know there have been

208
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,920
 Lotteries state lotteries things like that that have been rigged

209
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,120
 I know that crimes have been committed where it's been rigged, but to think one in five of

210
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,360
 Adult Canadians believe that the lottery is rigged. It's the same amount of people who believe in bigfoot

211
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,400
 That's weird to me. I that kind of threw me for a loop. That's actually bigger than

212
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,440
 Stuff like global warming as a hoax the pharmaceutical industry has something to do with cova 19 that it was engineered

213
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,280
 It's twice as big as the cova 19 vaccine has a microchip

214
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:39,160
 Like that's a huge level conspiracy theory and what I think is so interesting about that is conspiracy theories so often

215
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,200
 You can use to make money. There are whole industries that popped up

216
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,760
 Relatively overnight off of people's fears about cova 19 and the vaccine

217
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,800
 There's whole YouTube channels podcast

218
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,320
 There's stuff you can buy to help suck up the stuff that the vaccine people are shedding all this stuff all this nonsense

219
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:04,680
 Who's making money off the lottery thing that almost seems like if you guys if you guys have some money and you're looking for

220
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,160
 Something to spend it on I bet you you could honestly get a pretty good following if you started a

221
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,440
 Podcast or YouTube channel that focus specifically on the lottery is rigged

222
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,000
 Because I think that is an empty lane

223
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,240
 I don't think anyone else is doing that all these other

224
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,240
 Conspiracy theories we talked about are very very well populated UFO people. I got a tweet today on my phone

225
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,920
 Did you know UFO disclosures happening tomorrow? I mean it's non-stop. It's non-stop

226
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,880
 But the lottery thing I don't think anyone is pushing that conspiracy theory

227
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,680
 9/11 the 9/11 was a conspiracy set in fourth by the United States government

228
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,640
 And this is in Canada that they're doing this it may be a little higher in the United States

229
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:56,040
 17% that's a still a huge amount that is almost one in five Canadians believe that 9/11 was an inside job

230
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,240
 But that actually dropped 12% from 2014 so that's also taken a sizable hit in

231
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,960
 The last six seven years people have gone. Maybe that's not accurate. So that's another one that's on its way out

232
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,320
 That one in the scientists the cure for cancer those ones are going to be much smaller

233
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,080
 Conspiracy theories cross the political boundary. It does not matter what side of the political spectrum is on it

234
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,560
 Honestly does not matter what your education level is it doesn't matter what your religious background is a lot of people think it's a bunch of yokels a

235
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,880
 Bunch of like fundamentalist yokels up in the woods who believe this stuff about 5g and COVID it cuts across all barriers

236
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,700
 It's just different conspiracy theories different groups believe in different conspiracy theories

237
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:51,120
 And the general consensus is that more men believe in conspiracy theories than women that can be correct

238
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,900
 That can be correct what this poll realized was that does happen for

239
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:05,080
 Specific conspiracy theories there are two conspiracies in this list that more women believe in than men

240
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,660
 One that the Princess Diana car accident

241
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,500
 Was not an accident. It was either an assassination or there was something else going on

242
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,980
 It wasn't an accident more women believe that than men and

243
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
 The lottery is red

244
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,000
 By a wide margin of 23% of women believe that versus 16% of men

245
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,240
 So fascinating we I hope you guys enjoyed this. I hope I didn't bore you with these numbers. I find this stuff absolutely

246
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,800
 Fun to talk about because it's these raw numbers. We don't really get to see this much stuff

247
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,360
 We live in a realm of paranormal. I'm all it's so funny because I'm

248
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,380
 Whenever I meet someone and they're like, I don't believe in ghosts or any of that stuff

249
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,280
 It always takes me a back because I spend so much time in this sphere

250
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,240
 I'm just spending time in this pair of dimensional sphere. I'm rolling through the city

251
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's been so much time in this world and I know that people don't believe in UFOs. I know people don't believe in ghosts

252
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,800
 I guess when I'm saying when I meet people who don't believe in anything

253
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,340
 Any of it because some people don't believe in ghosts, but they're like, oh, yeah, UFOs are real or they don't believe in ghosts

254
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,880
 You're your foes, but they'll be like, oh, no, I swear I saw bigfoot ones

255
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,200
 But I'll run into people who don't believe in anything and it's always odd to me

256
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,160
 It's always weird to me. So it's nice to look at these numbers and see

257
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:28,960
 How how they break down how they break down and to see that some of the conspiracy theories like the coven 19 5g internet connection

258
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,080
 That is only 6% of people believe that we have nothing to compare it against in 2014 because it didn't exist

259
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,180
 But oh 6% of people believe in that which is still a sizable amount when you're talking about, you know

260
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,880
 Nations of millions and millions of people but like the UFOs I could see it being a 50/50 split

261
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,400
 So I hope you guys enjoyed that. I really had a lot of fun reading that to you

262
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,600
 It's nice to see the total picture of

263
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,860
 Paranormal belief, but we've done enough number crunching with these nerds and then now we're all ripping up their notes

264
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,680
 I'm like, sir, we need that for the next day. We're like get out of our way retired being nerds are messing all this stuff up

265
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,620
 We retired of learning stuff. It's time to go investigate a real life

266
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,360
 UFO abduction. We don't need no numbers for this Dean Ryan

267
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,840
 I'm gonna toss you the keys of that carbonicopter you go ahead and signal that bad boy to land we're leaving behind egghead central

268
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
 We're headed out to

269
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,540
 Australia

270
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,800
 I

271
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,080
 Got most of this information from a website called howan wise.com. We've actually been to this website a lot

272
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,920
 And I wanted to give him a shout out. They actually did a really good write up on this story

273
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,480
 I had some other sources as well, but that's a great website. You guys should check it out Dean Ryan

274
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,800
 We're headed to Australia specifically. We're headed to gun dia. That's in Queensland, Australia. It's 9 30 p.m

275
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,640
 October 4th

276
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,360
 2001 longtime listeners of the show know that is my birthday

277
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,140
 Not 2001 that would make me 20 years old. I was 25 when this story took place

278
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,680
 I was 25 years old we're in gun dia

279
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,560
 we're actually at a

280
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,360
 Construction site a site where they're about to build a winery known as whispering winds

281
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,840
 Now there's a little house a little structure there where we have Keith Rylance 39

282
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,080
 Amy Rylance his 22 year old wife and their business partner Petra Heller who's 35

283
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,100
 And what's great about this story is they have gone on video talking about this. We have names

284
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:38,860
 We have specific dates. We have faces. This is a very very verifiable story at least from their point of view a lot of times

285
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:45,140
 On this show and just paranormal stuff in general like yesterday's episode all the alleged hauntings at the university

286
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,480
 It's nice to actually have names and faces and proof that people are coming forward and telling these stories

287
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,340
 But this night October 4th

288
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,200
 2001

289
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,580
 Keith has already called it a night. He's already gone to bed pretty early Petra is in her room and

290
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,220
 Amy is in the living room. She's up watching television. The rooms are fairly connected

291
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,380
 So it's not like this sprawling house something happens in one room. You're gonna be able to hear it in the next a

292
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,380
 Huge storm rolls into the area

293
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:26,920
 Amy's still just watching television. She's watching the storm channel. She's like whoa surround sound. It's amazing

294
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,280
 But by 1115 she is also dozed off so everyone in the house is asleep

295
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,200
 The storm is gliding over the Australian landscape and then all of a sudden it's something wakes Petra up

296
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:48,320
 It's 1115 she's the only one awake now

297
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,320
 She's walking through the house and she gets into the living room and that's when she sees a

298
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
 rectangular beam of light shining in from outside the house

299
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,760
 In the middle of this beam of light is Amy. It's like the light is aimed directly at her and

300
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:15,520
 It takes Petra a second to realize what's going on here. Amy is in the beam of light, but she's no longer laying on the couch

301
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
 She's hovering off of it

302
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,160
 Petra is terrified. She's speechless as Amy is floating through the rectangle of light

303
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,200
 she then

304
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,440
 Flies out the window and as she's going out the window the window was opened at this point

305
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:39,000
 But the window screen was still there. She actually pushed through the window screen and tore open as she flew through it

306
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,520
 Petra faints at this site. She can't even really get anything out. She faints and almost immediately comes to and

307
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,280
 Begins screaming

308
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,160
 This is when Keith wakes up and he runs out in the living room and Petra is screaming

309
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,120
 She can't get a word out. She can't even comprehend what she just saw

310
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,680
 All Keith knows is there's woman. It's on the ground screaming. There's a rainstorm outside

311
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,920
 His wife is gone and the window has a huge tear in it

312
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,440
 So he goes to run outside to see what had happened your first instinct would be kidnapping

313
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,600
 Second instinct wild boar you're in the house back after all kangaroo mob. Who knows?

314
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,360
 As he goes to run outside Petra starts saying don't go out there. Don't go out there

315
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,560
 They got her they got her which of course is going to make him even more want to go out there

316
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,280
 She tries to convince him of what happened that she got sucked up in this beam of light Keith does not believe her

317
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,160
 He runs out. He begins running through the wilderness around the house calling out for his wife's name. No answer

318
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,560
 He goes back in and Petra again is pleading with him what I saw you got to believe me what I saw

319
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,360
 She was abducted at this bright light came in she floated out the window Keith still can't believe it

320
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,000
 But in the back of his mind, he's trying to figure out like what could it have been? Where could she have gone?

321
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,800
 They call the authorities

322
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,600
 They call the police at 1140 so it's about 25 minutes later. They make the phone call now because it's Australia

323
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,940
 It takes them until 1 a.m. To get there because there's a police station down the road

324
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:23,000
 There's a police station maybe in the nearest town might even be the town past that

325
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,400
 Keith is still out looking for her and as time goes on he starts to believe that maybe Petra is telling the truth

326
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:38,040
 Because what else could it have been? The police show up and they you have to imagine they were extremely suspicious of what's going on

327
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,560
 Young woman goes missing man with his female business partner are there

328
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:49,120
 Female business partner is saying she was abducted by aliens the man kind of seems to be going along with it

329
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,600
 The cops are probably thinking like did they murder her is this some sort of weird cover story? Is this the worst alibi ever?

330
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,120
 Police are kind of searching the area around the house as well

331
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,200
 Ring ring

332
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,520
 Their phone starts ringing Keith answers it and there's a woman on the phone

333
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,240
 And she goes

334
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,440
 Is this the home of Amy Rylance?

335
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,280
 Keith is like yeah

336
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
 The woman goes she's safe

337
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,240
 She's safe. She's here

338
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,080
 Where's here?

339
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
 Where's here Keith asks?

340
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,160
 So this is what the second side of this story is

341
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:36,000
 500 miles away. It's an eight-hour drive. There's a town called Mackay

342
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,920
 It's it's around 1 a.m. And a young woman comes stumbling out of the wilderness headed towards a gas station

343
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,400
 She's disheveled

344
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,720
 She's dehydrated. She's barely coherent. She stumbles into the gas station

345
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,520
 She's not really making any sense. They can tell that she's in distress. They give her some water. They charge you for it

346
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
 They're like you have money on you right? She's like oh

347
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,120
 They give her some water and there's a woman there who was gasping her car up. She actually says

348
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,480
 I think this woman needs to go to the hospital

349
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,120
 So her and her friend who was traveling with her they put the young woman in the car

350
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,120
 They can't figure out who it is. She can't really say what her name is

351
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,800
 They drive her to a local hospital and at that point when they get to the hospital, she's getting more fluid in her

352
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,640
 She's becoming a little more lucid and apparently the woman who took her down there was going through her personal items

353
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,920
 found her

354
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:35,240
 Certification was able to get the phone number of her husband so on and so forth and that is how she's placed in this phone call

355
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,640
 McKay is

356
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,360
 500 miles away from where she was abducted. It's an eight-hour drive

357
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,520
 But remember she was abducted at 1115 and now we're sitting a little bit past 1 a.m

358
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,480
 How did she get so far away?

359
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,480
 Now if you believe in UFOs we know how she got so far away

360
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,040
 But the detectives are trying to figure this out the detectives

361
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,720
 Don't really believe the story and if we've talked about this before on the show

362
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:11,660
 There is a totally different view of aliens today than there was when I was growing up from the 60s until the early

363
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,320
 2000s really it was a huge joke if you watch and I'll be in the show notes. There's

364
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:24,000
 The news segment about this story in Australia and when they're interviewing one of the detectives when they're interviewing

365
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,980
 Detective senior sergeant leaf Lindsey. He's laughing on camera at these people

366
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,600
 He's laughing at them

367
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,080
 Because it was a big joke for the longest time. It was a big joke now people take it a little bit seriously

368
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,080
 But it's he doesn't seem to believe this story and that's fine, but he's like oh my god

369
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,120
 I'm so sorry. I'm giggling and he's like trying to keep a straight face and he starts laughing again

370
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,320
 He's like oh my goodness is this on is the camera on and it's super disrespectful

371
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,760
 But he's openly mocking these people in their story

372
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,800
 So the cops don't believe it, but they can't really figure it out. They actually are investigating

373
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,200
 When they start looking at the story they go with the idea that this was staged and they begin asking people

374
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:13,600
 In the town of McKay if she was seen before this happened if she was actually waiting there for the signal

375
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,400
 But if you believe in UFOs

376
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,800
 This is the story she tells she's on the couch. She's watching television. She doesn't fall asleep

377
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 She's just sitting there on the couch

378
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,360
 Watching TV and then all of a sudden she's standing on a metal bench in a room full of lights

379
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,160
 She immediately knows she is someplace other than where she should be and

380
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,360
 The fear sets in

381
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,600
 That's when she hears a male voice say don't be afraid

382
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,240
 We're not gonna hurt you. Please be calm and

383
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,200
 Then a door

384
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
 Opens up a six foot tall man

385
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,920
 Wearing a suit that covers him literally head to toe

386
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,640
 There are some drawings with the story

387
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:06,800
 It almost seemed like a full biohazard suit and the person wore a black mask underneath it to cover like their mouth and nose

388
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,320
 So definitely humanoid, but they were covered in in a giant suit

389
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,200
 She could see his eyes, but she couldn't see his mouth or his nose. He comes out and

390
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,680
 Some sort of procedure was done

391
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,520
 She doesn't remember what was done when they did pick her up from the hospital and they do show this in the video as well

392
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,220
 She has these small triangle marks on her thighs and on her

393
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:36,280
 Heels on the bottom of her feet and the reporter asks what happened and she goes I don't remember

394
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,760
 I think they were just taking some sort of skin samples

395
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,440
 But she says she was standing on the bench the guy entered something happened

396
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,400
 She doesn't recall and then she said that the man said he was going to drop her off

397
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
 Not far from where they picked her up

398
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,000
 and

399
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,680
 The next thing she knows she's walking through the bushes in the middle of nowhere and she sees the lights of a gas station off in the distance

400
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,280
 And she finally gets there and basically collapses and is brought to the hospital

401
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,400
 They do end up calling some local UFO researchers

402
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:16,160
 They come out start interviewing them and then the trio of them Petra Keith and Amy disappear not mysteriously disappeared

403
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,640
 They just stopped returning phone calls. They couldn't be they didn't want to go back to that house

404
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:25,000
 They told the UFO researchers that they believed a car tried running them off the road

405
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,700
 They believed that possibly the men in black were after them. They didn't feel comfortable telling their story anymore an

406
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,520
 Interesting detail to note as well

407
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,760
 When she is reunited with the people who know her they noticed a couple things one she recently dyed her hair

408
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:47,040
 But her roots were showing much more than they should be in that amount of time that had passed

409
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,000
 She dyed her hair a week ago her roots shouldn't be showing that early

410
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,280
 And that could just be a bad job right though. She might need to get her money back

411
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,400
 But it was also her legs. She normally shaved her legs

412
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,720
 Her legs had several days worth of hair growth on them

413
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,360
 So that's another outside factor now to the cops

414
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,400
 They just go well, she's just not shaving her legs

415
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
 It's a

416
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,200
 Interesting hoax that they're trying to pull off and that was kind of the way the cops are going with it

417
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,520
 But was she

418
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,680
 This is what I find absolutely fascinating

419
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,720
 We talk about lost time, but technically should be able to work both ways if you have vegan

420
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,960
 You have to have anti-vegan if you can exist in our timeline if you can disappear

421
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,640
 For an hour and then be dropped back off into you. It seems like a minute, but really an hour has passed

422
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,060
 It could work in reverse where you are gone for three hours. You are measurably gone for three hours

423
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,860
 But where you're at four eight ten days go by and

424
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,300
 I think we'll wrap it up like this. I think the story is an interesting clue

425
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,560
 to

426
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
 other phenomenon

427
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,000
 Stuff like missing people even stuff like missing 411

428
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,080
 Because you have people being abducted and then dropped off quote-unquote nearby

429
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,880
 To a starship

430
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,060
 500 miles is nothing right something that's built to cross the galaxy

431
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,120
 500 miles is nothing

432
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:25,080
 To us five feet is nothing, but to an aunt that's its whole day. It's like damn it

433
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
 You gotta get the sugars way over there

434
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,360
 So to the alien who picked her up and dropped her off that could have simply been nothing

435
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,920
 500 miles it's eight-hour trip

436
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,800
 Just get on your eye on teleporter and you'll be fine

437
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,880
 It'd be interesting to think like these people who mysteriously go missing they walk into the backyard they disappear

438
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,800
 They're walking through the woods. They walk me on a shrub. They disappear. Maybe they aren't missing forever. They're just deposited in a place

439
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,040
 So far away

440
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,120
 No one thinks to look for them there and even then they didn't drop her off the gas station

441
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,840
 They dropped her off in the wilderness near the gas station if it had been a young child or someone who was drunk

442
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,960
 Someone who was frail

443
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,880
 They would have just died in the wilderness

444
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,160
 She could have ended up going the wrong direction and in her dehydrated confused state instead of walking towards the well-lit

445
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,200
 Gas station. What if she had walked in the opposite direction? She'd be bleached bones in the Australian wilderness

446
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,240
 And Petra and Keith would probably be on trial for murder

447
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,720
 It could even happen to you tonight

448
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:44,240
 As you're falling to sleep hoping to find some peace some comfort in your dreams

449
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,800
 You close your eyes

450
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,400
 And then you open them

451
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,320
 You're no longer in your bedroom

452
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,000
 You don't remember how you got here

453
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,840
 Your limbs are trembling you can barely stand up

454
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,960
 Your thoughts are racing your throat is dry

455
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,080
 Your skin feels singed and sore a

456
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,000
 Memory comes back a

457
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,560
 Kindly alien telling you to just be calm everything will be okay

458
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,320
 And you did what they said

459
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
 You work home

460
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,840
 You didn't panic is the laser scalpel singed to your skin

461
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,560
 You did what they said you did everything that they said

462
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,000
 But you can't understand why you're here now

463
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,080
 You're crawling on all fours across the mossy forest floor

464
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,080
 it seems

465
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:01,820
 Devoid of all wildlife almost as if the beasts of the forest were scared away by whatever deposited you here

466
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,920
 As you crawl across the forest floor

467
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,160
 You hope you're crawling in the right direction

468
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
 You hope you will find civilization

469
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,320
 But you won't

470
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,360
 You will just be another missing person

471
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
 Seriously vanished from their own home

472
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,560
 Did they run away?

473
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,840
 Were they kidnapped where they murdered these are questions people always ask when your name is brought up

474
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:41,040
 But they won't ever think to look a thousand miles away at that soft lump of vegetation

475
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,560
 Underneath that oak tree that vaguely makes out the shape of
