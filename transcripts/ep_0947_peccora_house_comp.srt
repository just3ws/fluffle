1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When a man has a bizarre fantasy of walking around Burger King restaurants,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I love doing this show,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 when a man has a bizarre fantasy of walking around Burger King restaurants and lecturing the employees,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 is it just a horrible mental delusion, or does it point a finger at a far deeper, far darker conspiracy?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And then we travel to Denver, Colorado

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 to take a look at a bloody crime scene that turned into a notorious haunting.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Is it possible that the story of Joseph Pacora, an organ grinder who kidnapped children off the streets,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 even in his death, continued to torture the souls of the children today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had lots of fun this weekend.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I didn't. I paid money to go see that movie Barbarian.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Ugh. I might do a review of that.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I don't have time to talk about it now.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 First 45 minutes, awesome.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And then the monster showed up.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Sorry, spoiler alert if you didn't know there was a monster in it, but...

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Pewee, man.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Anyways, someone who never stinks the place of walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 let's give it up for all I know this guy's like a worker on that movie.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Give it up for our latest Patreon supporter, Jake.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Woohoo! Yeah! Come on in, Jake. Walk on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Shut that door before the Barbarian monster gets you.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Jake, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Or if you work on the movie Barbarian and hate me now, I totally get it.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Just help spread the word about the podcast that really, really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Now, Jake, let's go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robot.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Row us all the way out to Nevada.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Splishity Splash.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Splishity Splash.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Guys, I have to get rid of this rowboat.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I can't think of any good sound effects.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 It's only been 900 and what, 50 episodes at this point.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Jake is rowing us out to Nevada.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Specifically, we're going to Tonopah, Nevada.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 In Tonopah, Nevada, we're about to meet this guy.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 His name is Bun-Hine.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 His name is Bun-Hine. That's the name he goes by online, right?

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 You figure, okay, that's a maiden name.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And obviously, no one was named Bun-Hine.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Apparently, his full name is Bun.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 His first name is Bun, apparently.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Bun-Hine's Butler.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And he lives in Tonopah, Nevada.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Now, I spent an inordinate amount of time.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I don't have a lot of time to research stuff.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I spent a lot of time looking into this guy

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 because I was like, this guy has to be a troll, right?

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 This has to be fake.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Just from the way he talks to people online

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 and the stuff he talks about.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I'm not for sure.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Because the more, first off, I was like, this guy's a troll.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 No, it would be this weird.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But the more I read, I was like, oh my God, this is super fascinating.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So Bun-Hine's Butler, he has...

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I didn't know this existed.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Me, paranormal researchers constantly talking about Bigfoot and aliens.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 I was like, this is real.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 He has a podcast that is only broadcast on Reddit.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time,

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 he has a paranormal show called "True Tall Tales with Bun-Hine Butler."

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Which is so fascinating.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I'm so fascinated to listen to this.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 "True Tall Tales with Bun-Hine Butler."

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 He's also the moderator of...

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I was like, this can't be real.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 This guy can't be real.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He's the moderator of a subreddit about voles.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Which is like this tiny varmin, it's like this tiny mouse.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So that's all they post pictures of little mice poking their heads about a dirt,

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and they're like, vol, vote for the vol.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Here you go.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And somehow, despite the fact that he's having a pretty narrow level of interest, right,

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 he has a paranormal podcast that obviously makes you some sort of mental case

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 that makes you an outcast just in and of itself.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Also loves voles so much that he has a whole subreddit dedicated to them.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Somehow he takes the time to post on every other single subreddit possible.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 He is all over the monster energy drink subreddit.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 He's constantly drinking monster energy drinks.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Which is fine, whatever.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 It's fine for your heart, they're super unhealthy.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But he believes that the right energy drink,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 basically like some sort of video game character,

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 if you drink the right energy drink at the right time, it will give you abilities.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Mostly just a bunch of energy, right, that's the only ability.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 He tells the story, he's obsessed with drinking stuff.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 He's obsessed with drinking stuff.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And that's where we're going to end up with this conspiracy theory.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 But he tells the story, he goes one day he was walking around the mall,

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 and he quote, "went to take a diarrhea."

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I've never heard it referred to as that before.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I've never heard it as a singular.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I've never heard someone go, "time to take a diarrhea."

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Actually people don't talk about that. People don't talk about that at all.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's how whenever I call in sick to work, that's the excuse I always use.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Like when I'm faking it, right?

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I say, "Oh, I couldn't come to work, I had diarrhea."

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Because no one ever lies about that, right?

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Except me, except me.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I would always be like, "Hey, I can't come to work today, dude."

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 "Diarrhea."

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And they're like, "Okay, Jason, you don't have to tell us that."

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And they never questioned why I was calling in.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So anyways, but I never refer to it as I was taking a diarrhea.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 That just sounds weird.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 But anyways, so he was taking a diarrhea.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He's in the bathroom of this mall.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And a guy tries opening the stall door.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And he's like, "Oh no, dude, I have not done."

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 He's like holding the stall door shut.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And the guy is trying to forcefully open it.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And you have to wonder who this mighty man is, right?

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Because here we have Bun pulling on one angle.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 You have this guy pulling.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 This is in tonopod.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Well, just know if you go to the bathroom out there.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Someone will try to break into your stall.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But see, luckily, Bun has an ace up his sleeve.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 He tells us that 15 minutes before he went into the bathroom,

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 he drank a pipeline punch, which is a random monster energy drink.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 So he says that gave him the energy to not only hold the door,

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 it probably also gave him the diarrhea, if we want to be honest.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 It's probably a made of sick dose though.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 But not only is he holding the door because he drank this pipeline punch

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 15 minutes earlier, he said, I don't know how physically this works.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But he says that the struggle ended with the man on the other side of the door

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 flying through the bathroom.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Like I guess like maybe Bun let the guy open the door and he like flew around.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 This guy's clearly insane.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Anyways, he says that this contest of might between man, muscle, and pipeline punch

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 ended with the other guy flying backwards through the bathroom,

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 smashing into a bathroom sink and flooding the bathroom with water

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 to the point that Bun is complaining that his socks are wet.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Now I'm going to go out on a limb.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Probably none of that ever happened.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I'm assuming he drank a pipeline punch, gave him diarrhea.

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 He went to the bathroom.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Someone knocked on the stall.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 They heard what was going on on the other side of the stall.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 They walked away.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 That's probably what happened.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But according to him, maybe he made up this whole story because he walked home

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 and people were like, dude, why are your socks wet?

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And he's like, I got a story to tell you.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And the person's walking away because they know it's going to be completely insane.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 He's obsessed with drinking stuff.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He tells a story.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He has a long haired cat that sits on his chest and he was brushing it one day.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And the cat's like meow, meow.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And the only thing he had to put the long hair in that was coming off the cat

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 was this cup of water next to him.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 So he's brushing the cat off, digging the clump of hair, putting the water.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And you're like, Jason, this story's not going to end where I think it's going to end.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 He's continuing to brush the hair and put more hair in this cup of water,

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 brushing more hair off, putting more hair in the cup of water.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And then the cat walks away.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 He does not say if he did this on purpose or if it was an accident.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I would like to think it was an accident.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I think we all would.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But apparently after brushing off the cat and the cat leaving,

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 he forgot that he was putting the hair in the water cup and he drank the water.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 He drank a bunch of cat hair water.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And he goes, I could feel it in my throat.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I could feel the hair in my throat.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It was tickling.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So, Jason, you're clearly just talking about a troll.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 You're clearly talking about a guy who's making stuff up.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 You just wanted to talk about, you really just wanted to talk about a guy having diarrhea

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 fighting over a bathroom stall door.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Hold on, there's more.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 This part is true now.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 If you're a fan of fast food restaurants, take note.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Like I said, he's obsessed with drinking.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 He's obsessed with sodas and stuff like that.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 One day, Bun went to a local Burger King.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 So remember, this season, tone up on Nevada, so the Burger King out there.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 He walked up to the counter one day and he goes,

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 "Hey kids, you think you're Burger Kings and Queens, but you're really just Burger Serfs?"

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 You see that, he's actually not that clever.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 He didn't say that.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 But anyways, he goes, "You see that soda machine over there?

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It's filthy.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 That soda machine inside of it is full of dirt and grime and mold."

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And as he's doing that, they look over and the little kids pour in a big gulp,

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 go, go, go, go, go, go, drinking it.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Kid walks away.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He goes, "That kid is probably going to die in 50 to 60 years if that kid keeps drinking that soda."

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Eventually, he'll become a mold man.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 This thing is full of grease.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Let me show you guys.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So he went up to his car, he got his tool kit, he came back in and he removed the front panel from the Burger King soda fountain,

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 pulls it off and he goes, "Look at this.

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Look at that dirt."

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And workers are like, "Oh yeah, yeah."

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 They're probably actually calling 911.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They're like, "Why is this guy vandalizing her place?"

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Humoring the weirdo who comes in.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 He's like, "Look at all this dirt, look at all this grime.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Look at, you can even see some mold starting here on where the little fountain, like where the juice comes out of the nozzle."

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks really interesting."

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It's not supposed to be interesting.

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 They're barely paying attention.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It's supposed to be gross.

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You guys got to take care of this.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Now, I'm going to leave this panel off of this machine so you guys can clean it.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And when you guys are ready, just give me a call.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I'll be down at the A&W down the street.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 He's going to hang out there for a couple hours, he said.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 So just call the A&W down the street when you want me to come back and put the panel back on.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 He leaves the Burger King.

214
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And people were like, "Wait a second."

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So you just randomly walked into a Burger King and took the panel off and then left.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Then put it back on.

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 To that point, Bun said, "Oh, no, no, that never happened. That's just something I dream about every once in a while.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 That should happen."

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And people were like, "So wait a second.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 If you had a fantasy life, it would be removing panels from Burger King soda fountains."

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Now, here's the thing.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Bun, I really want to check out your podcast.

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I'm sure it would be thoroughly entertaining.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But whether or not Bun's a troll, whether or not Bun is mentally unhinged,

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 or just the normal guy who loves drinking cat water, that's true.

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 That thing about the soda fountains is 100% true.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 You'll see people online go, like people ask, "How often do they clean soda fountains?"

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 You'll get responses going, "Well, you know, we clean them every night."

229
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 That's actually part of the closing duties for these fast-food restaurants.

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 We got to take them apart. We clean them every night.

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Let me tell you about a personal experience I had.

232
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 I was hanging out with my little brother at the Jack-in-the-Box in the Dows.

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And I never go out there. I go out there, like, once a year, right?

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Because it's like 30 miles away, which to me might as well be on the moon,

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 when you don't have a car.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 We're at the Jack-in-the-Box.

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 My brother is a super germ freak, right?

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 He's like anything disgusting.

239
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I'm the complete opposite, obviously.

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And I remember we both got our big sodas, and we got our food, and we sit down,

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 and as he's drinking his soda, and I'm drinking my soda,

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 a repairman walks in, and the Jack-in-the-Box manager,

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 and they're standing over by the soda fountain where we just got our drinks from.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And I actually have really good, like, ability to, like, tune out.

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Tune out my brother's voice so I don't hear anything he's saying.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I'm listening to what's going on.

247
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 The maintenance man is taking apart the soda machine,

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 and I hear the conversation.

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 The maintenance man goes, "Oh, man, look at these nozzles.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Yeah, dude, these are like full of mold.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Like, yeah, you need to clean these every night."

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And the store manager, which means he worked his way up, right?

253
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He was probably working there for about a year or two,

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 and then he became manager, and he's been working there for a year or two.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 His answer, when the guy says he's supposed to clean these every night,

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 the guy goes, "You can clean those?"

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Like, he didn't even know if it was possible to remove that nozzle.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So here we had a machine that I'd say for a year minimum, right?

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Hadn't been cleaned. Full of mold.

260
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Full of disgusting stuff.

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Now, it didn't stop me from drinking my Coca-Cola,

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 but because I figure everything I drink has mold in it.

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 I figure everything I eat has those sort of contaminant in it.

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I not go, "Oh, man, I hope my little brother didn't hear that,"

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 and he didn't, so I let him drink his soda in peace,

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 because otherwise he would have been very upset.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Otherwise he wouldn't have drank a moldy soda.

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I told him afterwards.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Dude, those machines are full of filth and disease.

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 If they're not cleaned every single night, they are full of mold.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 In fact, they have done studies on this.

272
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 When they did this big study, they tested 90 different machines.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I think it was in on the East Coast where they did it, Virginia, yeah.

274
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 They tested 90 different soda machines,

275
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 and 45 of them had mold, like had like E. coli,

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 had traces of fecal matter in the drinks,

277
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 and the ice cubes themselves, like in that little ice maker,

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 had more fecal matter in them than the toilet bowls in the same restaurant.

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And you could go, "Jason, that's cool.

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I don't eat at Taco Bell or eat at El Pollo Loco

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 or Cabbage Head or whatever weird fast food restaurants around the East Coast."

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 They're also in Starbucks.

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Starbucks also has this problem.

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 They have poop ice as well.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So a true conspiracy theory you're like, "Jason,

286
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 that's barely a conspiracy theory.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 You just want to talk about diarrhea and drinking cat water,

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 and you're trying to turn it into some social message of cleanliness."

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Maybe that's true.

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Maybe that's true.

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Maybe I just read about this lunatic online

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 and wanted to talk about it for 20 minutes.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Is that so wrong?

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I mean, it's true.

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 All of this stuff with the contaminants,

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 like doesn't it make you want to like change the world

297
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 or do something good for the environment?

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I don't know.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I was trying to make it a little more topical.

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 But yeah, there's that.

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 There's the gross ice thing,

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 but then also the fact that there's a man in tone-up on Nevada

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 who drinks cat water.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I just can't get over that.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I don't even like having a sink.

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I don't mind drinking sodas that come out of a moldy faucet,

307
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 but if you put a single hair in my drink,

308
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 I won't drink that,

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 even if it's my hair.

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I'll pull my own hair out of food.

311
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I think that's normal.

312
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Like, if my hair falls on my own food,

313
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I will get it out of there.

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 I don't think I'm breaking any boundaries by doing that,

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 but I definitely won't drink hair.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 That's disgusting.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Now, if you gave me a soda and there was mold on the top of it,

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I'm not going to drink that.

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But if it came out of a moldy nozzle

320
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 and I've already drank in it, it tastes fine, whatever.

321
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 But yes, you caught me.

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I just wanted to talk about this guy, this crazy guy,

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 and he may pop back up.

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 He may pop back up.

325
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I found some more crazy posts,

326
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 but we'll see.

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Maybe people are gone before I know too.

328
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Please don't tell us anymore about that guy.

329
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I didn't have some more stuff we'll see in the future,

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 but for now, Jake, top off this 32-ounce Coca-Cola.

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I got to drink it.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I got to drink it.

333
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 We're leaving behind Tonopon, Nevada.

334
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Take us all the way out to Denver, Colorado.

335
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 [imitates car engine]

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Jake, keep flying this carbon helicopter

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 and land us here in Denver, Colorado.

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And as we're walking around, everything becomes sepia-toned

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 because we are now in the year 1875.

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So there's a couple of horses walking down the road.

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 We see like a guy standing there like saying, "Hey, for sale!

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 "Buy all this hay!"

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And no one's buying it.

344
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 The horses are just eating it for free.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And he's too scared to fight the horses off.

346
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 It's October 21st, 1875.

347
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 We're on Lawrence Street.

348
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Specifically, we're at the address 2334 Lawrence Street.

349
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And we see a house.

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Looks like every other house on this busy, horse-filled street.

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Inside this house, there's a man named Gosepe Pacora.

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And he goes by the name Joseph in town.

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Everyone knows him as Joseph Pacora.

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 He's a 48-year-old man who's made his business as an organ grinder.

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 [imitates organ grinder]

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Pulling that crank, cranking it around, music's playing.

357
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Now, usually when you think of an organ grinder,

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 we imagine like a little monkey dancing next to him with a little hat,

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 holding it out, and a kindly old man cranking this thing, right?

360
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 I don't know about the monkey thing,

361
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 but apparently people hated organ grinders back in the past.

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 They were disgusting.

363
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Right now there's an organ grinder drinking cat water.

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 He's like, "Why? Why am I doubly insulted?"

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Organ grinders were considered hobos.

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 They were considered bums who were performing the minimum amount of talent,

367
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 the minimum amount of entertainment.

368
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So they weren't considered panhandlers,

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 because it was against the law to beg for money in a lot of places back then.

370
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 But you would say, "Oh, I'm not begging for money.

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I'm getting paid because I'm an entertainer.

372
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I'm cranking this crank. It's playing this music."

373
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 You'd have this cylinder inside this organ.

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 [imitates organ]

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 They had a bunch of songs.

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I didn't know that. I thought they just had the circus song.

377
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You'd have these organ grinders, and what they would do,

378
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 you're like, "Okay, fine."

379
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 You stand on the street corner, you play your stupid machine,

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 and people walk by if they want to toss you a penny. They can.

381
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 But what the organ grinders would do is these things were mobile for a reason.

382
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 They would follow you down the street.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 They would follow you down the street cranking that thing as fast as they could,

384
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 make it super irritating until you gave them money.

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They were actually harassing people.

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Now, there was probably some purists.

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 There was probably some people who really loved the art form of spinning brass keys

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 against a wax cylinder or whatever it was made out of.

389
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But for the most part, they were considered vagrants

390
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 who were committing the tiniest bit of entertainment so they weren't breaking the law.

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 But it was a racket, right?

392
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 It was a racket.

393
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And like any racket, you're going to make more money if you can expand your empire.

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So Joseph isn't just keying on cranking his own crank, right?

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 He wants to start seeing, he imagines these little organs all over Denver.

396
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 He's like basically the Heisenberg of wax cylinders.

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I don't know what they're made of.

398
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I'm easily going to look that up.

399
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 But anyways, he's sitting there and he's like, "I'm building an empire."

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 So he gets his son, he gets one of his kids to start cranking these boxes.

401
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And that is Giovanni Picori.

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So his son, he's 12 years old and he's out there on another part of town cranking that box.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 People are throwing pennies and they don't donate to him.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 If they don't give him any money, he'd walk down the street.

405
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 [singing]

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And they're like, "Oh, they're all freaking out."

407
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 They had a horrible time at the circus.

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They're like, "Oh, the tickets cost too much."

409
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And my wife cost them to mine elephant.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 "No, here's more money. Go away, go away."

411
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And Joseph was like, "Dude, this is totally working out."

412
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Like now I have two people cranking that thing.

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 So what's better than two?

414
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Anything higher, anything literally higher than two is better.

415
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He ends up though kidnapping two other kids.

416
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 He kidnaps two other kids and makes them be organ grinders.

417
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So I don't know how you kidnap somebody and then give them a box and say,

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 "Go get money for me and you got to come back here."

419
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I mean, I guess that's what pimps do, right?

420
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 But like, if you kidnap someone from their family,

421
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 you kidnap a kid from their family and say,

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 "You're going to go into the city, you're going to crank this box,

423
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 you're going to get enough money for a bus ticket or enough money for anything,

424
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 and then you got to come back to me and give me that money

425
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and I'm going to send you back out the next day."

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Like, I would be like, "That is a terrible plan."

427
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Oh, I want to tell him that.

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I'd be like, "Gee, Willikers!"

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And then he would take me down there and I would crank the box

430
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 and get a bunch of money.

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I'm like, "You're going to become a star?"

432
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I'm on Broadway cranking it.

433
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 They're like, "Oh, you're so amazing at it.

434
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I'd get money and then I would just go back home."

435
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 I guess they didn't have bus tickets,

436
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 they'd just get money and like throw, you know,

437
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 get a horse, ride a horse home or something like that.

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Anyways, he did whether or not I faved my fantasy would work,

439
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 whether or not my dream of being the first Broadway organ grinder would work.

440
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 His plan worked.

441
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 He did kidnap children and make them be organ grinders.

442
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 So he now has these four people working around town cranking that box.

443
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Well, what happens is, you know,

444
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 the organ grinder community was actually considered like,

445
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 if they weren't outright criminals themselves,

446
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 they were criminal adjacent.

447
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 They actually at one point banned all organ grinders in New York.

448
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And they say actually like, originally that was one of the only ways

449
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 that music was recorded was on those cylinders.

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 So we, as like a society, we lost a lot of early recordings of music

451
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 because in New York they were just smashing the boxes.

452
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 They just go away, box, you're done.

453
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 The guy standing next to it and he's like,

454
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 "Oh, I guess I'll just be another type of beggar now."

455
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Pulls a switchblade and mugs the cops.

456
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 But they did, they shut it down in New York.

457
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 There's certain places that you can have these because they were,

458
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 if not outright criminal, criminal adjacent.

459
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 So Joseph Pakora ran, most likely ran with some seedy people.

460
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 So October 21st, 1875 is when we're standing outside this house.

461
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And that's the same night that three acquaintances of Joseph broke into his house.

462
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They had heard that he had money in there.

463
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And they were gonna get that money.

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Basically this was a home invasion, a robbery.

465
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 So they break into the house and they robbed him.

466
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 But when they break into the house, they find Joseph there and the three boys.

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Leave no witnesses, has long been a motto of robbers.

468
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 They killed Joseph, they slit his throat,

469
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 and then they slit the throats of the three boys that were there as well.

470
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And left the house.

471
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 A terrible true crime story, but that's not where the story ends.

472
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Because it was only just a few weeks later

473
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 that the neighbors began to sense there was something wrong with this house.

474
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Now obviously there should be kind of a given, there's a brutal, quadruple homicide in this house.

475
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 But even then, even in a city that probably was immune to this level of crime at a certain point,

476
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 at least this neighborhood, this house, there was something wrong with it.

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It seemed to be infused with not just the energy of murdered children,

478
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 but something even darker than that.

479
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 You begin to get reports of dark shadows moving through the house.

480
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 You walk in by it and you look through the window and you'd see just a shadow standing there.

481
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 A shadow darker than the darkness inside the home.

482
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And then the music started playing.

483
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Neighbors said during the night you would start to hear this chaotic sounding harp music.

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Echo from the empty house.

485
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Nobody was here, not even squatters were going to this place.

486
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But you would hear this chaotic harp music coming from the house.

487
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Mixed in with the screaming of tortured children.

488
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 This became so awful.

489
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Imagine if this happened for one night in your neighborhood.

490
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 You might be like, "Oh, that was weird."

491
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 But this was going, this was happening so often.

492
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And it would be something like, you knew no one was in there.

493
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 It doesn't say that the cops were being called to investigate.

494
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I'm sure they were.

495
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Obviously, if you hear children screaming, you're not like,

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 "Nah, people, a bunch of kids were killed there recently,

497
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 but what's the chance of that happening again?"

498
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Obviously, they probably went and checked it out.

499
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 There's no one in there.

500
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 But you would hear this doodlulululululululululu harp music.

501
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And these kids.

502
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I'm not going to imitate the sound of a bunch of screaming tortured children.

503
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I think you can imagine that.

504
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Coming from this house at night, and it got so bad that people were leaving.

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Not for a day trip, not for the summer.

506
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 They were selling their house.

507
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 They're like, "I'm done.

508
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I cannot live next to the house.

509
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 That's full of tortured children screaming for eternity.

510
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Call me a prude, but that's just too much."

511
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 So people were selling their property,

512
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and the neighborhood started to basically empty out.

513
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And yet the phenomenon was still going on.

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 You'd see dark shadows walking through the house,

515
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 and you'd hear this screaming coming from it.

516
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Until one night, probably too late, right?

517
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 They could have done this on day four of this activity.

518
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 One night, a mysterious figure set the house on fire.

519
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Probably not that mysterious.

520
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 It was probably one of the remaining neighbors.

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 One of the people, who just got so tired of it,

522
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 they're like, "I really got to work tomorrow."

523
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 The screaming tortured children have been keeping me up for the past couple of weeks.

524
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 They torched the house.

525
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 It burned to the ground.

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 They never caught the person who set it on fire.

527
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 But the screaming stopped.

528
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 The shadows stopped.

529
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 The music stopped.

530
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 The house no longer stands where it once stood.

531
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 2334 Lawrence Street is the address.

532
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I read the story in my favorite book, Haunted Places, The National Directory.

533
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 We cover a ton of stories from it.

534
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I've read this book so many times.

535
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It is such a great resource.

536
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Check it out.

537
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 It's in the show notes.

538
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I don't get any money.

539
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 It's no YouTube or Amazon affiliate link or whatever.

540
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I just want you guys to buy the book.

541
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 It's an amazing book.

542
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I get nothing from it.

543
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I found this story.

544
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 It's maybe a paragraph long, right?

545
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And I love it, right?

546
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I mean, I don't know if the fact that kids are getting brutally tortured.

547
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 But creepy story.

548
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And then I'm thinking, is it true?

549
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Is it true?

550
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 I mean, we know the story of Bun-Hine is 100% authentic.

551
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 But is this story true?

552
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So I actually started looking into this and this is what I found.

553
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 This story could only be located in two places.

554
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 One, Haunted Places, The National Directory.

555
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And he got it from a book called Ghost and Hauntings by Dennis Bartons.

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 That was published in 1968.

557
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 There was no other place on the internet that references this story that tells this story.

558
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 So again, I couldn't go back and get the book from 1968 in time for this episode.

559
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 So I thought, okay, you know, is this story true?

560
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 This is so fascinating.

561
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 This is one of the things I love about doing this show.

562
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 I was looking up these people.

563
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Gisepi Pakora was his name.

564
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 I'm looking up the address.

565
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 What we know is true.

566
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 This is so interesting.

567
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 What we know for a fact is true because I found this on genealogy websites is there was a man named Gisepi Pakora.

568
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 And it says this is from this website, this website called sarleyjournal.blogspot.com,

569
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 which is a collection of this one guy's Rocco Vincenzo Sarley's ancestors.

570
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And it says this according to Denver Court documents quote,

571
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 "It is undisputed that Gisepi Pakora was killed on October 21st, 1875

572
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 in the Ramshekel House on Lawrence Street in Denver by mostly Italian perpetrators.

573
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 The other three victims were youths."

574
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 So that's a co-

575
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 So we know that that actually did happen.

576
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 This website talks nothing about ghosts.

577
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Doesn't mention anything else, but it does give the names.

578
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 The original story says he kidnapped three kids to run this operation,

579
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 but looking at the other three victims in the house,

580
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 one of the names was Giovanni Pakora, which was his son.

581
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 The other two were older.

582
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 A Domenico Finelli was 19 and then Domenico D'Onofrio was 18.

583
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 So youths, they weren't these little kids, kind of how the ghost story had it out.

584
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 But those were the three people who were killed in the house plus Gisepi.

585
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And then yeah, sure enough, I continue to look up.

586
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I found another genealogy website and it does have Gisepi, quote unquote, Joseph Pakora.

587
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 His date of death is listed as October 1875.

588
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 It also states that two of his sons died that year as well in Denver, Colorado, him and two other sons.

589
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Gisepi and Giovanni.

590
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 So Giovanni now and he's 12 in both of those.

591
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 So there's a Gisepi who died that same year, who may have also died in the house.

592
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Absolutely. You know, again, when you read these stories, it's so old, you think, is there some sort of urban legend, the house burned down?

593
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 There's no proof of anything.

594
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And yet when you're able to find genealogy records, right, where they're mentioning Denver court documents, the murders took place.

595
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 That's a fact.

596
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 So the family was there.

597
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 That's huge, even when you're just researching ghost stuff.

598
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 A lot of times you can't reference anything.

599
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 What I love, fascinated about this story, right?

600
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Like that right there, that we know that the true crime element is 100% true.

601
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 And this ghost story is really only two other places that first book Ghost and Hauntings, and then my favorite book Haunted Places and National Jructery.

602
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 What's interesting is you can look up 233-4 Lawrence Avenue.

603
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And it's in the heart of Denver.

604
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Denver is a major city right now.

605
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 There's no horses.

606
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 There's no hay.

607
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 There's streets.

608
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 There's no posh bookstores and coffee shops and things like that.

609
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And you're driving through Google Earth, you're looking through all this stuff, and you see like just buildings, right?

610
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Just buildings with retail stores, Gap or whatever, and there are local businesses and all that stuff.

611
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 233-4 Lawrence Street, because I was driving down Lawrence Street on Google Earth.

612
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Everything else is a building.

613
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Everything else is some sort of, this is so interesting, everything else is some sort of residence.

614
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 233-4 Lawrence Street doesn't exist.

615
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Like you see 233-5 and over here is 233-2 and you're looking all this stuff.

616
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 So you kind of got to figure out where it would have been.

617
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Where 233-4 Lawrence Street used to be now stands a community park.

618
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 So that makes sense, right?

619
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Even when they were rebuilding the city, they never built another building here.

620
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Because the people, there was a neighborhood there of houses, of suburbs.

621
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 People started moving out, this house got burned down.

622
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 People, I'm assuming, moved back into the other houses, but they would not build a new house on this location.

623
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Because of its curse.

624
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And then as the city of Denver grew and the residential district got pushed further out from the heart of the city,

625
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 even then when they were thinking, "Well, what can we do with, look at, we got this huge piece of property."

626
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 "You would still have people who would remember this story."

627
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 You're like, "You don't want to put anything there."

628
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 First you had people who experienced the stories of the murders.

629
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Then you had people who experienced the demons inside the house.

630
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And then eventually you started having urban legends kind of wash over it, right?

631
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 You had children and their children and their children.

632
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Start to hear just tales of this, but people still didn't dare to build anything on that.

633
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 But eventually even the urban legends got lost.

634
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Which means the truth got lost.

635
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Where you could probably walk through that area of Denver, Colorado.

636
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 You could walk into any of those businesses on Lawrence Street and ask them if they've ever heard the story about Joseph Pacora.

637
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And the terrible murders that took place just a few yards away.

638
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 I would be shocked if any of them knew it.

639
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Because the only place that you can find it is in two books.

640
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 It's not something you're finding on the Shadowlands.

641
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 It's not something you're finding on hauntedplaces.org.

642
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And it's creepy to think that you have this little community park here, that even after all these years,

643
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 it's been 150 years at this point, no one's ever built another building on there.

644
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 It's a little community park. It's not in memory of Joseph Pacora, it's just a little park.

645
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 People drive by it all the time, people probably sit in this park and enjoy the flowers, enjoy the beauty.

646
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And I would be shocked if any of them knew this story.

647
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Knew that where they are sitting on that bench, four people were brutally slaughtered there.

648
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And not even their spirits found rest.

649
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Even in death, they were being tortured.

650
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And it makes me think how many other horrific events have happened in these just seemingly mundane, if not peaceful locations.

651
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And there was a time where everyone knew the story.

652
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 And then a time where just some people remembered it.

653
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And then a time where only some people continued to tell it.

654
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 To a point where the story was a memory, it wasn't even a memory.

655
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 It was lost to time and now it's just a little parcel of land that you sit down on when your feet get kind of tired,

656
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 when you're walking between your job and headed home, listen into the bird's chirp.

657
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 How many other places has this happened where the stories got completely erased?

658
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 There's just enough things online that still point to a truth.

659
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 But there are these genealogy websites, they just confirmed that these people lived and died in those locations.

660
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 On that date, I mean, that's really accurate stuff.

661
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 When you can compare it to this ghost story.

662
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 So the next time you're enjoying your place of beauty, your place of zen,

663
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 the location you go to to help balance yourself or maybe just enjoy a nice morning breeze on your face as you sit on a bench contemplating your life.

664
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 We've seen it back in Jesus, it doesn't have to be that deep.

665
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 I think it's good to remember that the place where you find pleasure is a place where someone else may have found pain.

666
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Who knows what blood has been spilled on that land that you enjoy so much?

667
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Who knows how many children were killed on your favorite bike trail?

668
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 So the next time you're at that location and you think you're finding peace, just remember, someone else may have been brutally murdered.

669
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I've ruined soft drinks for you and now I'm ruining everything that you like to do.

670
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Just remember though, just remember, just because you can't like look it up online, if you can't find any proof that a child wasn't murdered there, who knows?

671
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Check the genealogy website so you just don't know.

672
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 The point is, is that beauty can hide brutality.

673
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Even in the most perfect of places, blood may have been spilled.

674
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 And just because the dark spirits seem to be gone doesn't mean they've left.

675
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 They could just be waiting, waiting to gather new souls to join them in their eternal symphony of pain.

676
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
