1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 You thought you were just going to listen to a podcast. Instead, I'm about to save your life.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,600
 Then we travel to Tanzania to meet a man who pays the ultimate price, well not the ultimate price,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,880
 but a pretty steep price for stealing stuff. And finally we travel to Marriold England

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,120
 to take a look at an old newspaper account. Is there any truth to the story of a haunted taxi

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,320
 that if you walk near it at night, it moans with the sounds of the dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I often say you got a bunch of

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
 stuff to cover. We don't have a lot of time, but we don't have a lot of time tonight. I just took

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,280
 some melatonin. So there is a literal biological clock ticking while I record this episode. We

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,720
 do have a ton of stuff to cover. First off, let's introduce today's supporter of the show,

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,320
 riding in on a custom roller coaster. It's Kate in MKate. Kate and MKate are just kind of struggling

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
 to shoulder their leg. Are you sure that's the name? I'm like, I don't know. Kate and MKate,

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,440
 everyone give Kate a round of applause. Wee! Going on this roller coaster, there's a lot of ways you

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,200
 guys can support the show. You can support it through the Patreon. We have a merch store. Both

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
 of those are in the show notes. And if you can't do either of those, just help spread the word about

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,480
 the show really helps out a lot guys. So Kate, go ahead and hop off that roller coaster. Take

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,640
 some melatonin. We're all getting ready for sleepy time. I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,400
 Jalopy, but leave it in the garage. We're just going to slightly walk a few feet over to a microwave.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,600
 Guys, I'm about to save your life. You probably, some of you may wish this episode came out,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,440
 came out like when the show first started. You're like, dang it, how did I not know this?

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,320
 I just found this out a couple months ago. I probably should have shared it with you a

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,800
 couple months ago when I found out. So let's say we want to boil some water. So you start the stove

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 and I slap your hand. I'm like, what? Are you a barbarian? Why don't you use a stove? Why don't

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 you just start off like a fire in the middle of the floor with sticks and twigs? No, you use a

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,440
 microwave to boil water. I use microwaves to make spaghetti by the way. I use microwaves for everything.

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,880
 So if you're like me, if you're a homo superior and you like to boil your water in the space age,

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,040
 like the Jetsons, you use a microwave, but you can kill you. You can actually cause massive injuries

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
 if you do this. And I read about this a couple months ago and I've been like, I should share that

29
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,760
 on my show. And here we are in February of 2021. What this is so weird and creepy. What happens is

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,280
 a traditional pot. Let's say you have AUG, he's using his caveman stove and then you have me,

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,000
 man of the future, using a microwave. The pot that AUG is using on his stove because of the way it's

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,240
 the coils work, it's super safe. It won't explode. But when you boil water in a microwave, the radiator,

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,200
 you're like, what is this all of a sudden? Bill Knight, the science guy, but scary? Radiation or

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,080
 whatever works in a microwave. I'm not entirely for sure. Some people say radiation, but I think

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,880
 it's magic. The beams are going into the water and what happens is the water actually gets hotter

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:31,120
 than the bowl. And the water can actually, if it gets one degree above boiling, it becomes super

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,480
 heated, which is not good, which is not good at all. They said when you're using pots and pans,

38
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,600
 a lot of times there's abrasions on them. The way that they work in the stove top warms it up

39
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,560
 differently. Everything's kind of warmed together. The microwave, you can have like a brand new bowl.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,920
 There's no scratches on it. It's completely perfect. Glass bowls do this a lot. You boil the water.

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,800
 The water becomes super heated. And what can happen is one liter of water that is super heated.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,000
 The second anything touches that water, it said you could like pour instant coffee in there,

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,360
 put a spaghetti noodle in there, even put a spoon in to stir it up. If it is super heated and you do

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,040
 that one liter of water will turn to three liters of steam and horribly, horribly scald you. Now,

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
 if your steaming is a goal on a cruise ship and you're trying to like set a bomb and right when

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,760
 the terrorists come in, perfect. Do the terrorists here, the ding. They look over at the microwave

47
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,960
 and they're like, oh, my instant coffee is ready. They're like, no, oh, no, we didn't make that.

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,720
 And he starts stirring it and blows up. That's perfect. But if you're not steaming to a goal

49
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,080
 and you're not in the 1990s diehard ripoff, it can horribly burn you. So I've known this for months

50
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
 and again, I apologize that I haven't shared this information with you. What I tend to do is I'll

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,240
 either sprinkle some salt in there because basically anything to break up the consistency or whatever

52
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,760
 of the water will help. They recommend taking like a wooden spoon and putting it in there,

53
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,240
 but that sounds kind of lame. I don't want people to live alone. I totally live alone,

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
 but I don't want the ghost man in the closet being like, why are you cooking all those wooden

55
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,920
 spoons? Let's say I imagine that would interfere with the taste. You can spit in it as well,

56
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,200
 because you're just sitting in your own spit. You're always eating your own spit,

57
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,320
 so that doesn't matter. And it gets cooked anyways. So do that. Do that. You're like,

58
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,040
 Jason, I do not boil water in the microwave. The last six minutes have been completely useless.

59
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,000
 But if you ever do, if you ever do evolve and start boiling water in the microwave,

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
 you will remember. Today it's so funny. Today I did that. I've been making a bunch of mashed potatoes,

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,320
 instant mashed potatoes. You're like, Jason, grow up. You eat adult food. Hey, I live in

62
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,760
 instant potatoes. I was making instant potatoes and I did that to the water. And when I took it out,

63
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,200
 it was boiling. So it wasn't super hot. And the fact that I'm not recording this from an ER

64
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,440
 shows that I did it right. So I might have just saved your life if you microwave spaghetti like me.

65
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,120
 If you cook like you're a 10 year old boy whose parents have left you home alone,

66
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,160
 then I've just saved your life otherwise. Otherwise, you're just tapping your fingers,

67
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,440
 waiting for the next story, which is where we're headed. Kate in M. Kate. I'm going to go ahead

68
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,640
 and give you the keys. You already had them. Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind my

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:24,240
 microwave, leaving behind my kitchen clutch. And we are headed out to Niamh Byro, Tanzania.

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,640
 Kate, go ahead and hit that fly button on the Jason Jalopy, chitty-chitty, bang-bang, this car

71
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,040
 out. We're flying out to Tanzania. Almost all this information I got from an article written by

72
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:45,120
 Renee Otinga for tuco.co.ke. So I want to give credit where I get my information if most of my

73
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,720
 information is taken from one source. So thank you for that, Renee. Kate, drive us on through

74
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,040
 Niamh Byro, which is completely different from what we've announced before, but hey, what are you

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,080
 going to do? I'll blame it on the melatonin tonight. And as we're driving through town, we see a man.

76
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:11,680
 His name is Frank Jappett. And Frank is a man with a plan. He has decided to steal corn, steal maize.

77
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,320
 Now, he's not just going through the harvest and stealing ears of corn. That's just called having a

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,560
 job, having a job and not stealing it given to the boss. Then you get paycheck. He doesn't want to

79
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,000
 do that. He wants to take the corn itself. Now, it's fun. Now that I'm telling the story and the

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 photos that are involved in the story, I don't know if he had corn cobs on him or if somehow he

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,720
 got a bag of kernels, like popcorn kernels. I don't know. I think it's because you only eat corn.

82
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,600
 You can eat corn on a cob and then you can eat just like loose corn. So maybe it was a loose

83
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,600
 corn. It was maize, but I think that's just a style of corn. I don't think that's the way you eat it.

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,120
 Anyways, the point is that there's photos that accompany this, but they're useless on a podcast,

85
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,960
 but later on you can solve this debate. Frank goes, "You know what? I really want that corn,

86
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,640
 but I don't want to pay for it. I don't want to harvest it. I don't want to grow it. Nothing.

87
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,000
 I just want it." And we're talking about a 45 pound bag of corn. Corn kernels, I believe.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,600
 It doesn't matter. It's not like it weighs more if it's in kernel form, but there's more of it.

89
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,480
 So he walks over. He grabs this bag of corn. He throws it over his shoulder and he runs away.

90
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,600
 45 pounds isn't that heavy. He runs away. He gets to his friend's house and he goes, "Hey man,

91
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,080
 I got that corn we were talking about." The friend's like, "What? We were never talking about corn?

92
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
 What are you talking about?" And the guy's like, "No, I don't remember that corn heist."

93
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,560
 No, nobody steals corn around here or anywhere. Crows maybe? So anyways, Frank's like, "Oh man."

94
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,160
 So he goes to unload the corn. He goes to throw the bag off of his shoulder onto the ground because

95
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,680
 he goes, "There's another 45 pound bag out there. I couldn't carry both of them. Who do you think I am?

96
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,520
 Jason Carbiner?" But when he goes to throw it off of his shoulder, "Ugh, uh,

97
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,840
 sounds like he's having fun. He's not. Uh, uh, the bag is stuck to him."

98
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,120
 This friend's like, "Dude, quit messing around. First off, I don't, first off, you're barely a

99
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,520
 friend. I'm pretty sure you're an acquaintance. Two, what do you do with 45 pounds of corn in my

100
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,160
 ass? Three, quit joking around. It's stuck, man. I can't get this corn off of my shoulder."

101
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,640
 And it's not like the bag was covered in superglue and he ran all this way and then like the glue

102
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,560
 hardened. It's not stuck by any sort of earthly means. It's magically stuck. He has 45 pounds of

103
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,520
 corn on his back for hours. He's just getting sore. His knees are given out. He's like, "Oh man,

104
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,320
 he's eating corn. He's like, at least the bag opens, right? Um, num, num, num, num. Maybe I'll get

105
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,360
 carbs. Maybe I'll get energy from all this corn." Then he just has to go to the bathroom. He does

106
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,720
 have to go to the police and this is where the, there's actual photos of this. There is a man

107
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,360
 surrounded by people in town and the police and it's, he's just holding this massive bag of corn.

108
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,760
 He's, "Ugh." It's like, has him hunched over. So you think, is it like, here's the thing, like

109
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:18,000
 obviously, does magic exist? Like, is that what the story is saying? Is actually reported in the

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
 news over there and then coast to coast did a write up on it as well. That's how I found out about it.

111
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,040
 But the cops are like, "Hey, put the bag down." Like, yeah, you'd admit to stealing this, put the

112
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,400
 bag down. He's like, "I can't." It's magically stuck to my back and the cops are like, "Oh,

113
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,040
 come on, man." The cops couldn't get it off his back either. It was magically stuck. A bunch of

114
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,920
 townspeople came out. He couldn't get it off his back. There's photos of him with this thing of

115
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,520
 corn on his back and the cops go, "Listen, we've actually dealt with this before." And they have.

116
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,680
 We'll get into that in a second when the cops are like, they bring out Louis. He's on the magic

117
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,240
 sticking beat. He comes out, everything's stuck to him. He's like, "I swear to God, I swear to God,

118
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,720
 I didn't get into the evidence locker." He walks out, he goes, "Hey, here's what you gotta do.

119
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 You gotta go back to the person who you stole it from and ask for forgiveness and then the bag

120
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,080
 will fall off your back." And so that's what happened. It turns out that the woman whose farm

121
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,200
 he stole the corn from was afraid it was going to get stolen so asked the magician. This is a real

122
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:23,440
 story, by the way. This isn't from some fantasy novel. She asked the magician, "Can you magically

123
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,520
 put something on my corn so if you steal it you'll get stuck?" And the magician's like, "Alla

124
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:36,240
 Kazam." And then that happened. This story, this story is real. Now obviously, you have to ask

125
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,360
 yourself, is magic real? On all the 10 episodes we've done on this show, when I was reading this,

126
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,280
 I'm like, this, I'm not saying that because there's a photo of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker

127
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,600
 having a lightsaber duel. Just because there's a photo doesn't mean it's real. But it's like,

128
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,920
 it's not like a Snapchat photo. It's not like a TikTok video or something like that.

129
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,200
 It's a guy surrounded by police with a giant bag on his shoulder. Who's faking it? Is he faking it

130
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,840
 for internet clout? Were the police faking it? Was it supposed to be a PSA don't steal corn and

131
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,320
 maybe stuck to you? None of it makes sense. So either here's the only options. It's fake.

132
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,880
 And it was this whole, everyone in town was in on it. Or magic room. Magic is real. Those

133
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,320
 are the only two options. Magic actually exists. Or this was all fake. Now there is a third one.

134
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,720
 The guy could have had some sort of mass hysteria, panic attack. I know all you guys are not

135
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,880
 even answering. Yeah, that's what I was about to write in the YouTube comments. You could have been

136
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,040
 having some sort of panic attack and like guilt. Wouldn't let him get rid of it. But once other

137
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,200
 people were trying to get it off of them, were they also like suddenly wrapped with guilt over

138
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,360
 like when they pushed their little brother down off of his tricycle when he was three, they're

139
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,600
 like, "Oh, I'm so sorry, Johnny." And why couldn't they move it? And this isn't the first time that

140
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,800
 this has happened. This article written by Renee points out there's photos of this as well.

141
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,080
 There's photos of this as well. That happened May 2nd, 2018. I don't know if I said that earlier.

142
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:23,760
 Super recent. These aren't Polaroid photos. These are like modern day photos. A year earlier in 2017,

143
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,680
 a man stole a DVD player and a stereo. Remember when those, remember when either of those were

144
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,240
 worth stealing? There's a photo of this guy holding like a Sony stereo where like the speakers detach

145
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,120
 and he has this DVD player. He's surrounded by townspeople and the police are there and you're

146
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,560
 like, "Wait, so is he just like stuck to a stereo? That's actually kind of cool. He just comes to

147
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,960
 be playing music. He had to be the life of the party. Who doesn't want to have a stereo stuck to

148
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,160
 them?" No, the stereo is not stuck to him. The DVD player is not stuck to him. There's a photo of a

149
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:11,600
 man holding a CD player, a CD stereo, and a DVD player covered in bees. Covered in honey bees,

150
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,800
 apparently. There's like a fake beard of bees and he's standing there in front of the cops and

151
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,640
 it was the same thing. It happened a year earlier and the cops are like, "Well, we're not magicians

152
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,760
 ourselves. We're not magicians ourselves. However, we can assume that because you stole these things,

153
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,040
 the person you stole them from must know a magician who is cursed, whoever steals them,

154
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:42,960
 to be surrounded by bees." So does magic exist? Have we been lied to this whole time? Because I

155
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,040
 get it. We've covered stories about superstitions and things like that. The dude is covered in bees.

156
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,920
 There's a photo of him covered in bees. This isn't a tall tale. I mean, it could be fake.

157
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,920
 We fake CGI bees, but magic's not real, right? You want it to be real. It would make things more

158
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,520
 interesting, but it's not. I have to question it. Out of all the stories I've covered on this show,

159
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,800
 this is the one that makes me go, "What is magic real?" So yeah, check out the photos. Check out

160
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,600
 the photos if you don't believe me. They're not CGI. They could be staged, but I don't know what the

161
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,520
 point of them, who's staging them and why. The guy could pretend to have a bag stuck on his

162
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,840
 back for whatever reason, but why would a man? I know people have the beard of bees and stuff like

163
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:45,040
 that, but why would you do that and telecom you're a thief? What's the end game there? Normally when

164
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,720
 they have men who go, "Hey, I'm gonna have a beard of bees, honey," and they're like, "Great,

165
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,600
 I'll fill out the divorce papers later." You do that. And then they take the queen bee and they put

166
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,720
 it in their neck or they swallow it or something and then the other bees around them make a beard

167
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,680
 of bees. That's totally fine. They don't then walk up to a police officer and say, "I just killed five

168
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,800
 people." That's not part of the gimmick. The gimmick is they just have a beard of bees, not,

169
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,960
 they're also a thief and they're confessing it or a murderer in my example. So does magic exist?

170
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:25,120
 Maybe. Do you heard it here first? The exasperated tone of a paranormal podcast host who is

171
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,840
 confronted with the idea that as much as he loves magic and loves the idea that it exists,

172
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,400
 it might be super, super real. It may not be theoretical. So don't steal anything, guys.

173
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,000
 There's that's that. That's that moral. And the moral is the laws of physics do not apply.

174
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,840
 Magic is real. That's another lesson. Kate and them. Kate, I'm going to toss you the keys to the

175
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,520
 carbonicopter. We are leaving behind Tanzania before any magicians find out that I stole that I stole

176
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,920
 a bunch of corn from that guy. I cut a hole in the back of his bag and was taking some so I can

177
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,600
 microwave some popcorn. Kate, fly us out of here and take us to jolly old England.

178
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:16,400
 Specifically, we're going to Kensington, which is in London. So right there, I pointed out to you.

179
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:24,000
 We're going back in time. We're going so far back in time that the mist of time clouds everything.

180
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,160
 We're going past the year 1897. Kate's like, what? There's a lot of years before 1897. Yeah,

181
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,760
 not too far back, not caveman times, but you know, somewhere between King Arthur and 1897,

182
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,160
 she's like, okay, it's the button. We're perfectly there. Great pilot job.

183
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,800
 And I want to give a shout out to dead rabbit radio listener Nicholas. He sent this to me via gmail.

184
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,480
 Really, really appreciate this stories. Now, we don't have a firm date on the events of this story,

185
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:02,080
 but we do know it was revealed to the public on June 10th, 1897 in the Shields Daily Gazette.

186
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,960
 And the story starts off like this. There's an old taxi sitting in a lot,

187
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:17,680
 fog sweeping around it. It's all like dusty. There's rats walking in it,

188
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,920
 making rat noises. There's spiders too. Spiders, I don't know what noises spiders make.

189
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,080
 There's a bunch of bees. There's a bunch of bees stuck to it. No one wants to use it.

190
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,440
 It's no one wants to use it, but it can't be used either. It's all broken down. There's like a hole

191
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,960
 in the roof. There's the rats. The rats making that weird rat noise. But regardless of whether or

192
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:55,120
 not you wanted to use it, nobody did. At night, if you walked by that old cab, the reason why

193
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,320
 this is being reported in the news, because cabbies had a legend about this broke down disgusting

194
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:07,520
 cab full of rats, at night time, if you walked by that cab, you would hear moaning.

195
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,160
 Sounds like I'm waking up in the morning. You hear moaning like "Nuuuuhhhhhh" and you would hear

196
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:26,400
 like muffled screams. So you wouldn't want to go by there, right? Like any one of those is creepy

197
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
 enough. I'm sure my neighbors are creeped out because I'm making those sounds so late at night.

198
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,120
 They're like, "Oh, he's probably just recording this podcast." This cab, there's a quote from

199
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,200
 this article. This should really set us down a path we're going to be on. I won't try to

200
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,240
 diverge too much while we're telling the story, but in this article there's a line that says,

201
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:54,080
 "This cab is said to be the oldest four-wheeler in existence." Think about that for a second.

202
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:02,080
 Okay, I can't continue past that line. That's not true, right? It can't be the oldest

203
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:10,400
 four-wheel vehicle in existence. That's a bold claim. Those catapults? Nope. They had four wheels,

204
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,720
 this thing is older. Chariots had two wheels, but the Pharaoh's chariot had four wheels. It was

205
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,520
 this advanced model. It's older than those. How do you have the old... How would you even know that?

206
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,920
 There's like Sanskrit. The Vinn number is in hieroglyphics. Anyways, so there's a little bit

207
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:34,400
 of hyperbole when this article's starting off right away. And also, I'll tell you this right now,

208
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,560
 it took me about four or five paragraphs until a certain event. I thought this was like a yellow

209
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:48,880
 taxi cab, and you might have too. Maybe you caught on before I did. The story does take place before

210
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,360
 the year 1897, so cars were not invented. So as much fun as it would be to imagine a yellow

211
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,040
 taxi cab, even though that's what I imagined almost my entire time researching this, it's an

212
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,360
 old horse-drawn wagon. So you have like the little seat for the dude sitting down top,

213
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,040
 and then you have like a horse, and then there was like, you're like Jason, Jason, please,

214
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,960
 don't insult my intelligence. I know what a horse-drawn carriage looks like. I've seen Cinderella.

215
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,120
 It's a horse-drawn carriage, but it's like there's a cabbie. So anyways, here's the story behind the

216
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:33,680
 moaning carriage at night. Long, long time ago, there was a dude driving the cab, as was his job,

217
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:42,320
 and he's going down the street, horse-hitting the pavement with little horseshoes, and as he's

218
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,280
 clip-clopping down the road, a man runs from around the corner, and he jumps into the cab

219
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,200
 and slams the door shut and sticks his head out the window and goes, "Drive for your life!" This

220
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:03,600
 is an actual quote. I don't do these voices for no reason. "Drive for your life! Drive like the devil!

221
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,640
 I've got gold here!" It didn't sound like a leprechaun. "I've got gold here. You shall have

222
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,600
 whatever you ask!" Maybe he was half leprechaun, but the point is is that he carries gold with

223
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,960
 him, and he's like, "Dude, just get out of here, man. I'll pay you whatever you want. You just gotta

224
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,480
 book it." So the cabby looks back, and he makes the horse go forward. That's his job, right?

225
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,680
 So the horse is now galloping. This is where I realized it was actually a horse-drawn carriage,

226
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,440
 when he starts whipping the horse. And he goes, and the cab driver goes, "He didn't really tell

227
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,200
 me where to go, so I just picked the random direction and started going. Imagine all the

228
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,280
 things I could buy with my money, and if I capture this leprechaun, I'll get three wishes!"

229
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,440
 He's taken the cab through the streets of Kensington, and the fare, the dude in the back,

230
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,400
 begins yelling. Here's another quote from him, "For heaven's sake, on! Don't you hear them?

231
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,920
 They'll catch us you fool!" And the cabby's like, "Okay, this is getting a little weird. I don't mind

232
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,160
 taking this guy's money to get him out of the area." Maybe he owed the tooth fairy, tooth fairy's

233
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,640
 after him for child support? But now the guy's like saying they're still pursuing him. The cabby

234
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,880
 looks back, the streets are empty. He's looking around, he doesn't see anything. But you know,

235
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,160
 money's money. Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, making the horse go faster.

236
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:34,320
 The man sticks his head out the window yet again. It says, quote, "They're behind us! I can hear them.

237
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,520
 Confound you, man! You want to hang after all!" Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop. Cabby's like,

238
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,880
 "What is going on, dude? This guy's trippin', dude. This horse is moving as fast as he can. I'm

239
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:53,280
 turning around. I'm not seeing nothing." And then the cabby starts to feel utter fear take over his body.

240
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,680
 And he like, tunes in his senses. He can't see anything when he looks back.

241
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,720
 But he starts to hear something. The street is empty behind him.

242
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,000
 But he hears the sound of a stagecoach following them. Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.

243
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,880
 Those are the wheels. That's not some alarm going off. He freaks out at this point. He

244
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,960
 starts whipping that horse super hard. And he's like, "Get out of here! Get out of here! I want

245
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,080
 you anymore! Go back home, Harry!" The horse is taking him and the dude as far as they can. They

246
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,000
 leave the city of Kensington. They ride for hours and hours and hours. This isn't some battle horse

247
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,200
 that took Charlemagne into the field. This is a cab horse, man. It was at the end of its shift.

248
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,160
 He's all super tired. So, hoping to eat some corn. And this dude is just whipping it.

249
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:56,240
 And they ride for hours to the point that eventually the horse is like, clip-clop,

250
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,960
 clip-clop. And the cabbie is done pushing it forward and they're just kind of clip-clopping

251
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,200
 way out of town. They're in the forest at this point. And the cabbie goes, "Oh, okay. Well,

252
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,680
 that's over with." Right in the horse's leg. The horse is like, "You better call me a cab,

253
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,440
 because I'm super exhausted." The cabbie goes, "Oh, there's... find out what's going on with that

254
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,280
 leprechaun bloke in the back." He goes, he gets off the cab. And the horse is just like chilling.

255
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,960
 And then the cab driver walks and he looks into the cab and he sees the dude laying down.

256
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,000
 He's like, "Oh, well, that's cool. That's cool. He got a nap. I was wondering why he stopped screaming

257
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:44,080
 out me." Cab driver opens the door. The man is laying there, his eyes glazed over, staring up at

258
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:53,760
 the roof of the cab. And his throat slid open, because it sounds like Play-Doh, right? His

259
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,120
 throat slid open. There's blood everywhere. And the cabbie's like, "Oh." And before he can process

260
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,320
 what's going on, he's looking at the eyes of this dead man who killed himself in the back of his

261
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:17,200
 cab. The dead man's looking at the roof of the cab and then the dead man's eyes focus on the cab driver.

262
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:27,040
 The cabbie jumps back in to the seat thing of the cab. He probably should have looked at these

263
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,680
 terms. But anyways, you know the place where the guy sat on the pumpkin thing with Cinderella,

264
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,800
 he's sitting up there and he begins to spur the horse forward. The next morning, some people are

265
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,720
 traveling. They're stuns up, birds and like chipmunks are hanging out. And people are coming down the

266
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:53,360
 road far, far out of Kensington and they see a man sitting in a cab, a motionless cab. His face is

267
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:02,400
 completely drained of blood. He's almost catatonic and he's whipping his horse, but the horse is dead.

268
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:16,560
 He's just sitting there on the cab. So they call the cops. They didn't have phones back then,

269
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,040
 so they had to send like the youngest fastest of the kids. What is their phones back then? It

270
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,280
 doesn't matter. It has no Baron on the story. Telegraph, kites, whatever, smoke signals.

271
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,880
 The point is the police show up and they go, "Well, okay, that's pretty gross that you like ran that

272
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,720
 horse to death. What happened?" Oh, and the fact that there's a dead human body in the back of your

273
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,520
 cab, it takes him a while to come out of shock and he explains what happened. And the cops go,

274
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,400
 "Well, that's not true. Magic isn't real. What do you think? Why would you think magic was real?"

275
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,400
 And he's like, "But the corn, the corn." They're like, "Okay, let's lock this guy up." And they do.

276
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,320
 They actually lock him up for just a couple days. He didn't kill the guy. The guy committed suicide.

277
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,760
 He did ride the horse to death, but they go, "You know, you look in the back of your car,

278
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,560
 you see a man who committed suicide. Look at you after he's been dead for a while,

279
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,360
 his eyes fixed on you." That's pretty creepy. The police officers are telling each other that

280
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,600
 story at night. They're like, "Please, Officer Davis, stop. I have to go home after this shift."

281
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,120
 So the cab driver is eventually like let go. He didn't really commit any crimes.

282
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:26,400
 And so he does what I wouldn't do. He goes back to work. He goes back to work and he gets in the

283
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,120
 same cab. He's like, "Oh, good old number 25. My favorite cab, all those years spent together.

284
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,760
 I'm not going to let one horrible night of a suicide in a dead horse ruin our love."

285
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:46,400
 He takes that cab. He's doing his job two nights later. The cab is once again found

286
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,040
 abandoned on a city street. It's just sitting there. Horse is just hanging out.

287
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,200
 People go up and they peer in the cab. What's going on? Why isn't there anyone sitting up there?

288
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:07,360
 And they see the cab driver, dead, strangled to death. Now obviously the passers-byers,

289
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,920
 they weren't all corners. They're like, "Oh, I can tell his cause of death and I can even

290
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,160
 mark it down on the hour based on the maggots wiggling under his skin." They took the body

291
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:22,400
 into the corner. They didn't tell the passers-byers. They were like, "Hey everyone, he was strangled.

292
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,520
 Possibly by a ghost." Everyone was like, "Ah." The coroner said that he was strangled. This is

293
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,080
 where the story starts to diverge. Some versions of it was that he was strangled. And so the idea

294
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,440
 is that he was strangled to death by the ghost of the man who killed himself because they couldn't

295
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,320
 outrun a ghostly presence. Other people say, and what the actual medical report is, I kept

296
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,400
 saying the coroner said he was strangled. That's not the case at all. The coroner's about to come

297
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,560
 back and haunt me. The coroner goes, "Listen, what we think happened, it's actually equally ridiculous.

298
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,040
 He was a heavy drinker because of this. You're going to be after you see someone's head get chopped off

299
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,360
 by themselves and their eyeballs are rolling around." That he was drinking heavily after the

300
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,360
 event and he died of fright. So he was drinking a bunch and he figured he'd take his break in

301
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,080
 the back of his cab and then he just went, "Oh!" and died. That doesn't work, right? That doesn't

302
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,320
 happen. That doesn't happen either. I mean, you can be so scared, I guess, like your heart can start

303
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,600
 beating fast, but it's not- you're not going to like have a- it's funny. We covered that episode.

304
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,520
 I'll put in the show notes about the- about Freddy Krueger and I'm Here on All the Streets based on

305
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,480
 a true story. That- they were, and it is based on a true story, but they were kind of dying of

306
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,880
 fright, but there were so many other factors involved in those young kids who were dying because

307
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,440
 of their nightmares in LA that I don't think it's comparable to so much as drinking and dying of fright.

308
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,080
 But the myth of the story is that he- the ghost came back and killed him. So it was basically

309
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,640
 the story in a nutshell. A total stranger picked his cab out of nowhere, was being pursued by some

310
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,760
 sort of unseen presence, and it's possible that he didn't kill himself. That the presence caught up to

311
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,920
 him/his throat, and the whole time he's like, "Dude, go faster. This thing's gonna get us! Confound you,

312
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,920
 man. You want it to come after us?" That it's cut his throat, and then it came back for the cab driver.

313
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:25,920
 Or you could say that the man's ghost came back and killed the cab driver because he failed in his

314
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,040
 mission. But to be fair, the cabbie, one, didn't want to get involved, two, never got paid,

315
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,280
 what happened to that gold. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe he took it. I think this

316
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,040
 story is interesting for multiple reasons. One, it's a classic ghost story that I actually haven't

317
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,720
 heard before, but it has the elements of a classic ghost story, and it has elements of

318
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,600
 just like spooky revenge spirits and things like that. It has- first off, despite what you see in

319
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,960
 the movies, ghost killing people is extremely, extremely rare. There is a handful of cases.

320
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:07,360
 We've covered out of what, 624, 25 episodes? We've covered maybe three or four murders by ghosts.

321
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,960
 Movies that happens all the time, it's super, super rare. This would be one of those.

322
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,280
 So it's fascinating as a narrative device. I think it's important, and we're gonna wrap it up like

323
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,200
 this. And I'm not gonna go on too long about this because I've touched on it a hundred times,

324
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,560
 and I'll put it in the show notes about the Smithsonian Giants. A ton of times in the

325
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,880
 conspiracy theory community, they'll talk about giants being found, and they'll be like,

326
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,040
 "There was this newspaper article back in 1910. There was this newspaper article in 1872 that

327
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,880
 had a photo of a giant, and they said, 'Look at these miners. They found the giant.' So giants

328
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,000
 existed in the Smithsonian covered it up." They were also publishing stories about haunted cabs.

329
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,120
 They were also publishing stories about people being pursued by a phantom that slid a guy's

330
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,960
 throat and his eyeballs are moving afterwards, and then the cab driver died two days later.

331
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,320
 This stuff was being printed in 1897. This stuff was being printed in 1925. This stuff was being

332
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,200
 printed for a long time. Super entertaining, super fun story to tell, and I'm sure there are elements

333
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,960
 that are true to it. I believe in ghosts. I don't necessarily know if a ghost murdered these people.

334
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,640
 We don't have any names of anybody. There probably is an old cab that on the lot,

335
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,640
 the cab drivers would tell each other stories about. I'm sure that part of it's true. I'm sure

336
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:32,320
 that someone spun this tale. I'm sure there was this really old decrepit cab. And when a new cab

337
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,960
 driver joined, they're like, "Hey, Billy, why don't you go over to number 25?" And they're like,

338
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,120
 "What's wrong with number 25?" They're like, "Oh, let me tell you a story." You know, just hazing

339
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:49,360
 people. I think that part of it's true. But when we look at news, old news articles were garbage.

340
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,240
 They're super entertaining garbage, but they were just full on lies. So when you look at these old

341
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,200
 news articles about giants, we come across them all the time in conspiracy theory and paranormal

342
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,120
 land. Think about it. Remember articles like this, super fun, super entertaining, love the story,

343
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,960
 but this is what they were publishing back then. So when we look at stories about giants,

344
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,720
 there it was made up to sell newspapers and to back the biblical event of creation as well,

345
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,240
 because giants play a part in the beginning of the Bible. So you have that. So you got to think

346
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,880
 about that. But I don't want to end it on a note like that. We're saying this whole episode for

347
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,680
 the full context, but I didn't want to mention that. I think we got to go back to the actual ghost story.

348
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:43,760
 We're going to end it like this. That old cab sitting in the cab lot, it can only decay so much.

349
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,320
 Eventually, the ghost stories get old, people don't believe them anymore,

350
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:59,680
 and they sell the cab for scrap. They take the cab body down to the wrecking yard, begin to smelt it,

351
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,920
 refine it, sounds like when you enter an ice cream shop, and they begin to

352
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:19,360
 remould it, reuse those metals and those wood and that nails and the whip. They use that too.

353
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:27,280
 They recycle that into a belt. My point is, is that I don't know if that's what they do,

354
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,760
 too old cabs from the 1890s, but just go with me on this. They use pieces of it, they take wood off

355
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,480
 it, they put it on a boat or something. I didn't think this, I thought this through, I actually

356
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,000
 thought this was a good ending, but I don't know if they can about it. It's not an automobile that

357
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,240
 can smelt it down in a junkyard. It's just a bunch of rotten wood. Anyways, imagine this.

358
00:35:53,360 --> 00:36:00,720
 Imagine this. All that stuff, that rotten wood and those nails that they pull out because they

359
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,680
 gotta recycle them. The huge nail shortage of 1910, they had to recycle all those nails.

360
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,600
 Each piece of that cab could be haunted as well. It could be used in all sorts of things across the

361
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:20,960
 ages. The point is this, the point is this. Imagine that you buy a belt today, you buy a belt,

362
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,360
 and it's a leather belt, and you don't know that that leather is actually recycled from a whip

363
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:37,920
 from this cab and the metal part of the belt. The little hook, the little thing is actually an old,

364
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,760
 it's an old nail. It's an old nail and the buckle actually looks like a leprechaun buckle,

365
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,640
 and you're like, "Hmm, this is a weird belt. What does it look like, a whip?"

366
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,920
 But the nail attached to it. But you know, you bought a hot topic and figure it's what kids

367
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,520
 are wearing today. You buy this belt. You don't know the story of the haunted cab. You don't know

368
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,760
 any of this stuff. You just really like this belt and you wear it. And as you're walking out of your

369
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:16,160
 house, show off your brand new belt. There's a ghost of a man standing behind you with a slit

370
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,880
 throat, a wide smile, his eyes staring up at the ceiling as he follows you down the hallway.

371
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:34,320
 And then they look directly at the back of your head. You thought you were just buying

372
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:48,400
 a brand new belt. Instead, you bought yourself a seat in a cab, headed directly to the twilight zone.

373
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,360
 I tried. I thought I had a good ending, but once I thought the physics, I'm actually recycling

374
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,080
 an old cab. But I hope you guys enjoyed that ending. I definitely enjoyed telling it.
