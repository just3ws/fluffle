1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 An entire island of Girl Scouts sounds like probably the most uninteresting place most

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,680
 of us could ever imagine to be trapped, but to the spirit of one woman, it's her only

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,080
 hope of finding some sort of peace.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,880
 And then we travel to Ashland, Oregon to take a look at the story of a young woman who was

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,020
 out walking her dog late at night.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:35,360
 This young woman always considered herself a very practical, pragmatic, logical person,

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:44,480
 but when she senses an unknowable danger staring at her from the darkness, she has no idea

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
 what's coming next.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:01:01,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,900
 I'm your host Jason Garvin here, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,100
 great day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

13
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,380
 The birthday presents are still rolling in for your favorite podcast host.

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,180
 I'm sure Mark Marin might be his birthday too, but I'm talking about me.

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,180
 I'm still getting them in and someone who just sent me a very deadly birthday present

16
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,240
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,240
 Everyone give it up for Christina Belk.

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
 Woohoo!

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,800
 Yeah, come on in Christina, she's sitting there, she's juggling knives.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,480
 This person who listens to my podcast, she says she's been listening to my podcast for

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,760
 quite a while now, a couple years.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,060
 She started to buy me a knife, she's buying me a Smith and Wesson combat blade now, we

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,820
 shouldn't blame Christina for my upcoming injury, okay, no one's blaming her.

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,860
 I did put it on my Amazon wish list and she sent me this amazing note saying that her

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,820
 roommate, Dirk Groberman, that's a long time listener, I remember Dirk Groberman back

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,140
 in the day, introduced me to your show a couple years ago and I've been listening every day

27
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,700
 since.

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,880
 Christina Belk decided to buy me the knife that I one day just put on my Amazon wish

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,120
 list and didn't think anyone would ever get it's a wish, right?

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,840
 I already dropped it and I almost impaled my foot.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,880
 So thank you Christina Belk for buying me the weapon of my upcoming massive injury.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,340
 Christina you're gonna be the captain of the pilot this episode, she also said she

33
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,980
 loved the vehicles.

34
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,520
 You guys can't swear to Patreon, you don't have to buy me a weapon that'll injure myself

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,900
 no it's not, I put it on my wish list.

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,500
 You can't swear to Patreon if you can't buy me deadly weapons that's fine too, just

37
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,540
 help spread the word about the show.

38
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,700
 That really, really really helps out a lot.

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,340
 Now before we get started I do want to say this too, I don't like having a lot of intro

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,900
 stuff in the beginning but this is super important.

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,740
 The Dead Rabbit Radio YouTube channel has once again been suspended and listen, it's

42
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,980
 YouTube's thing, they can do what they want, they really wanted this video down.

43
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:17,560
 It was the episode I did about Aquarium Gate and originally they said I was promoting violence

44
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,680
 and so I appealed it and then they said I was being a cyber bully.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,000
 So they just didn't want the video out.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,560
 I have a one week suspension, I can't upload anything anyways but going forward we will

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,600
 not be uploading the podcast to the YouTube channel.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,080
 We're gonna keep all the past content there, that was an old episode, that episode came

49
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,840
 out probably about two months ago.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,540
 All of a sudden their AI didn't want that episode up there.

51
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,940
 I can't also say I think it was a lot about AI control conspiracy theories but they don't

52
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,700
 want it up there, fine, they took it down, I got a strike, I can't upload for a week,

53
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,580
 fine, whatever, that's their right.

54
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,140
 But I don't, I'm just not gonna upload to YouTube anymore, it's going to be strictly

55
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,020
 a podcast and what we're gonna do, we're gonna see how this works is I'm gonna put up a note

56
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,940
 each time an episode comes out because I still want to talk to you guys, that's why I like

57
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,320
 the, that's really the main reason why I uploaded to YouTube.

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,560
 So we can talk about the episodes so I can see your comments and get your feedback and

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,520
 I can talk to you guys about stuff.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,400
 So we're gonna see how that goes but no more episodes are gonna be uploaded, I'm gonna

61
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,240
 lean more into the TikTok as far as anything and then I'll probably upload shorts but

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,600
 YouTube may nuke it because of the shorts as well, I really want to keep it up to do

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,680
 live streams but I'm not going to, it would suck if it went, I'll be honest, it would

64
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,920
 suck if the YouTube channel got taken down completely because that's four years of conversation

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
 between us.

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,340
 Right, that's the episodes you can find anywhere but the comments and the conversations we've

67
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,260
 had and the laughs and everything like that, that'll be gone.

68
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,500
 That'll bum me out if the YouTube channel gets taken down completely but going forward,

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,540
 no more full episodes on YouTube but they'll still be available everywhere else to hear

70
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,580
 them, hopefully we can get a little community post that we can comment on, we'll see how

71
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,180
 it goes but I can't play by the YouTube rules because YouTube rules are super strict, we

72
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,440
 can't talk about blood, we can't talk about killing or murder, that's all you ever talk

73
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,320
 about that in diarrhea.

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,000
 A lot of true crime YouTube to avoid the filter, they'll say stuff like he unalived her.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,040
 I'm not gonna do that dude, I'm not gonna do that, I'm not gonna do that, I'm not gonna

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,760
 do that people will say he "graped" her, just say "raped dude."

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,720
 I mean like if you're gonna talk about the subject, say kill, say rape, I won't play

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,060
 by that and I'm not a cyber bully.

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,380
 Okay there might be a couple of episodes that you can say well Jason.

80
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,520
 Anyways, I'm not gonna play by the YouTube rules, those rules are set up, those are valid

81
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,260
 rules for them and many many other content creators, we're not gonna do that.

82
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,820
 I don't wanna water down the podcast so I can just be on YouTube.

83
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,500
 I wanna be a podcast, I wanna be a podcast talking about what we talk about.

84
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,220
 So sorry about that long intro but I can tell Christina's getting bored, she is getting

85
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,720
 ready to throw that knife at me.

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,800
 Christina let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason jet.

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:23,040
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Ravica Man and take us all the way out to Lake Yosemite.

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,320
 Jason jet is rumbling across the west coast, splitting the blue sky in half.

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,040
 Leaving Kimtrails, you didn't know that?

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,400
 You didn't know that the Jason jet, we also lease out to the US government to drop Kimtrails.

91
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,060
 We're headed all the way out to Lake Yosemite which is in Merced, California.

92
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,580
 Beautiful lakes, like all lakes are, I don't ever think there's like an ugly lake.

93
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,220
 Right, am I gonna be able to prove me wrong?

94
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,460
 They're like oh here's a lake of raw sewage.

95
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,540
 Okay you're right, a lake of nothing but raw sewage would prove me wrong but this, I

96
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,460
 think that's a fair thing to say that Lake Yosemite is beautiful, I've never seen it,

97
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,460
 I'm sure it's beautiful.

98
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,700
 But anyways, it was many decades ago, many many decades ago.

99
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,240
 Like 50s, 60s probably.

100
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
 It was a hot summer.

101
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,400
 But people are like running along the beach in slow motion.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,480
 They think that they're sick, they're like why can't we run fast?

103
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,800
 They're running along the beach in slow motion, there's probably like a dude sitting there,

104
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,200
 I'm assuming at any beach you'll find a guy sitting there.

105
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,360
 And then you have a mother and her two young children enjoying the hot summer air and then

106
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,180
 jumping in the cool water.

107
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,220
 And that real kind of combining of the elements.

108
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,220
 Splash, look at me, mommy I'm swimming.

109
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,580
 One of the kids says, the mom goes that's the best swim I've ever seen and then the other

110
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,900
 kid goes I can swim better than that.

111
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
 Splash.

112
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,340
 The mom's like yeah the first one was better.

113
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,780
 A mom and her two kids go swimming and these two kids they kind of like, they're adventurous

114
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
 right?

115
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,780
 Super adventurous, they go why don't we climb to the top of that boat tower and jump off

116
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,640
 of it into the water.

117
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,440
 No I don't think it was like a, I don't know how tall this thing was right, I think a boat

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,360
 tower would try to stretch the key detail in the story, I don't look it up but.

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,920
 A boat tower I'm assuming is some sort of tower, you guys can't correct me in the YouTube

120
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,280
 comments on this one so I can say whatever I want.

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,960
 A boat tower I believe is probably some sort of structure near a pier, right?

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,800
 So anyways it doesn't matter, these two kids climb up a boat tower and they go mom look

123
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
 at us we're king and queen of the world.

124
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,460
 One of them's a girl and they both jump off of the boat tower but they didn't realize

125
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,060
 the key detail.

126
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,540
 The water was really shallow where they were at.

127
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:50,660
 So when they jumped off the boat tower the first kid smashes his head into the rocks

128
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,140
 and instantly breaks his neck like that's how shallow the water is, I don't know how

129
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,660
 they didn't see this.

130
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,100
 Maybe the boat tower is pretty tall or maybe they're idiots.

131
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,400
 And the second kid, this would suck right, you're at the top of a structure and you see

132
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 a dude jump off, you know a couple seconds before you do right and you're jumping off

133
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,800
 too and now you're seeing him fall, now at this point he's probably like four or five

134
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,800
 feet ahead of you and you watch him splash into the water and then see his neck snap.

135
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,520
 And you have about .8 seconds before the same thing happens to you, that would be the worst

136
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
 right?

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,020
 I've always said being eaten by a cannibal isn't the worst thing, the second person to

138
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,220
 be eaten by a cannibal is the worst thing.

139
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,020
 Cause you can watch the first guy get pooped out of the cannibal, that was a very specific

140
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,660
 cannibal related episode.

141
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,180
 I can't believe YouTube doesn't want this show up there.

142
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,580
 It would be bad enough to smash into the water and break your neck but to be the second person

143
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,460
 like watching that guy break his neck and be like oh no.

144
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,120
 Anyways, no matter what the order was, the mother was, besides herself obviously right,

145
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,120
 she just saw her two children jump into the water and snap both their necks.

146
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:18,440
 Well she is like totally freaking out, people see this and the authorities are alerted.

147
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,880
 This is decades ago so someone had to go find a pay phone, I'm sure there was one nearby,

148
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,340
 I don't think they were on their speed boat and went back to shore but the authorities

149
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:35,220
 showed up and by that time the kids had floated away due to the current of the river or the

150
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,300
 lake that we're in, I don't know why the mom didn't scoop them up immediately, maybe

151
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,820
 she was so terrified.

152
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,180
 Anyways, the kids floated away and the authorities get there and they never found the bodies.

153
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,760
 They never found the bodies of these two kids who broke their necks in the lake.

154
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,640
 So for years, the mother, the spondan, she watched her two children die in front of her

155
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,000
 every day they say.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,440
 She would go to this lake and she would walk around being like kids where are you?

157
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,000
 Kids, kids and she would walk around the beach not expecting her kids to say something back

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,100
 and she just wanted to find their bodies, she wanted to put their bodies to rest but she

159
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,020
 could never find them and people say to this day as you're driving down Old Lake Road late

160
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:35,300
 at night you may see the phantom of a young mother walking down the street crying out

161
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:45,660
 for her children crying out for children she couldn't even find in death.

162
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,760
 Which is a creepy component to the story.

163
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,080
 That's not all, we're still going to hang out at the lake because there's another even

164
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,840
 creepier ghost story here.

165
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,880
 But obviously there's an element of urban legend to this, we don't have specific names,

166
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,760
 it's like we don't know when this took place, la la la la la.

167
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,840
 We've covered these, these are the ghost stories that kind of border into urban legends but

168
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,320
 there is something particularly terrifying if you think like the children, and this seems

169
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,440
 to be, I never thought about this before because I come across this a lot in Ghost Lore where

170
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,740
 you have a lover die or the children die whatever in this area and then the forlorn woman is

171
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,620
 walking around looking for her lost lover, his head got blown off during the Civil War

172
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,140
 and she went to the battlefield and she couldn't find him and now her spirit still walks around

173
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,340
 or in this case and this is a very popular trope as well, the kids dying, the mother still

174
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,300
 walking around the house or walking through the forest or at this point walking down the

175
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,320
 shore looking for her lost children and you think it's terrifying that they don't even

176
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,680
 find the spirits in death because the kids died, it's not like the kids are still alive,

177
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,080
 they just swam to the other shore and they're like we're gonna have a new life together,

178
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,560
 the children died in this location, the mom's looking for them in this location but she

179
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,440
 still can't find them even though at this point they're all dead.

180
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,500
 And obviously this is that type of ghost that could be just a recording, right someone's

181
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,900
 in so much misery, someone has so much heartache that they soaked the environment with their

182
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,740
 psychic residue so it's not a ghost you could interact with, it's just a ghost walking on

183
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,140
 the street screaming for her children.

184
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,140
 But then there's also the option, this one's a little scary or I think in Ghost Lore there's

185
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,400
 that idea of not having a fullfiled your mission on earth, having something you've always wanted

186
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
 to achieve and not being able to achieve it.

187
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,400
 The children didn't have that, right the children broke their necks and they're like well that's

188
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,040
 sucked, I'm supposed to go to Tommy's birthday party tomorrow but whatever I have a broken

189
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,740
 neck what am I gonna do?

190
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,600
 And then they go to heaven, they don't have these long drawn out heartaches and I don't

191
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,240
 know what to do without my kids blah blah blah because they are the kids right?

192
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,880
 So they both break their necks and they have a race to heaven look at me I'm the fastest

193
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,860
 angel around come back Bobby I'm the fastest they go to heaven.

194
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,140
 But the mom never went to the afterlife right?

195
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:15,260
 The mom is so torn up about losing her kids that had she, this isn't her therapy podcast

196
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
 right?

197
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:22,180
 But had she accepted the loss and moved on maybe she would have gone to heaven that's

198
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,100
 super not nice I'm trying to think of the right word for it right?

199
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,080
 It's super not nice but you know like the fact that Callis was the word I was looking

200
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,280
 for she could have accepted that they had moved on and then when she died she had moved

201
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,780
 on herself.

202
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,320
 You know what I mean like had she accepted it maybe her spirit would have moved on as

203
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,040
 well that's actually now that I'm saying that's super Callis right?

204
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,800
 It's super Callis but in this particular event not in any other event not in anything you

205
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,360
 might be going through it is like had she accepted that and moved on not like found

206
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
 other kids.

207
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,180
 Actually that's a good segue for our next one.

208
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,020
 Let's go ahead before I take myself into a bigger hole with my brand new knife.

209
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,540
 Christina let's hop in the dead rabbit row boat we're gonna row row row on out we're

210
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:15,260
 still at Lake Yosemite out to Girl Scout Island.

211
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:23,300
 Splashy splashy rowing those oars all the way out to Girl Scouts Island now it's called

212
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,100
 Scouts Island.

213
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,640
 Now it's no longer Girl Scouts so I don't know if the Boy Scouts are finally allowed

214
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,360
 there I don't know if the war has ceased they have made peace on this island but Scouts

215
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,560
 Island if you want to check it out now again we have a story that goes back very urban legend

216
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,240
 as far as the lore goes we don't know when this took place we don't know the names of

217
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,480
 people but this one this one has an interesting twist to it.

218
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,400
 Back on back in the let's say the let's let's update this one let's say this back in the

219
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,040
 90s right back in the 1990s a mother and her daughter were at.

220
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,980
 Girl Scout Island and while all the other Girl Scouts were asleep and I'm assuming

221
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:05,500
 the scout masters is that what they're called Girl Scout Masters when the Girl Scouts and

222
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,060
 their masters are asleep this mom she goes hey you know what you know what dear daughter

223
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,420
 of mine you've done so good raising yourself without breaking your neck I'm going to reward

224
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,260
 you with a trip a moonlight stroll in this row boat I happen to have so the mother and

225
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:30,760
 the daughter get on the row boat and she's rowing out into Lake Yosemite and a whirlpool

226
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,240
 appears and the water starts going around and around and the boat starts spinning around

227
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,200
 and around they didn't see this apparently this is something that can happen naturally

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:47,480
 or not a whirlpool just appears Ursula's down there she's like ah yes more kelp more kelp

229
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,700
 for my army a whirlpool a whirlpool appears and the boat starts spinning around and the

230
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:00,620
 daughter fly like falls out of the boat ah and she gets sucked in by the whirlpool now

231
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,980
 this whirlpool is so like strong it actually flips the boat as well so now the mom is swimming

232
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,220
 in the darkness she's screaming for help her daughter is underwater there's no there's

233
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,840
 no married badge for how to survive a whirlpool right and she's trying to rescue her daughter

234
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:26,240
 but she can't in the darkness of the lake she can't even find her but eventually she

235
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,360
 does this is one where the she didn't she didn't turn into kelp she didn't turn into

236
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,400
 a piece of seaweed her dead body simply floated to the surface but the mother also was still

237
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,700
 completely freaked out about this and through the rest of her life was always looking for

238
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,540
 her daughter right I mean she knew where she was she was buried in some sort of cemetery

239
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,900
 but I think she was quite the point where she was crazy no one was like hey I know you're

240
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,400
 really looking for Margaret you might want to go down to clear valley green the cemetery

241
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,340
 she's buried at no she would walk around Girl Scouts Island looking for her daughter until

242
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:14,000
 she died and now she's a ghost on Girl Scout Island so today this is how the ghost story

243
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,240
 goes in modern times what will happen is you will be sleeping in your tent this you can

244
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,000
 rent out this island for like 50 bucks a night but it says you have to be a kid like kids

245
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,980
 you have a credit card it has to only be for like kid slash scouting events so we couldn't

246
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,380
 do it that would be dope to rent out an island that seems pretty reasonable 50 bucks to own

247
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,020
 an island for a night like Jason you don't get to own it you don't get to build a house

248
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,100
 build a house in one night but you know like just camp on an island for 50 bucks it's cheaper

249
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,940
 than a hotel anyways I'm not a scout so I can't do it but the scouts can 50 bucks a night

250
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,460
 that sounds super reasonable now that you think about it because you pay 50 bucks and

251
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,080
 then you fill it with as many scouts as you can like you have just all standing up you

252
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,680
 could have hundreds of them on this island anyways I put my master plan into the side

253
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,720
 you have Scout Island and they'll say late at night when the Girl Scouts are sleeping

254
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,680
 in their tent the zipper of their tent this is so terrifying the zipper of their tent

255
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 will go zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

256
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,340
 I can't imagine if you were a kid if you were an adult and your tent unzipped and a ghost

257
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,500
 stuck their head in your tent I imagine just everyone immediately would run out through

258
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,180
 the ghost get ectoplasm all over you I don't think you'd be like I'm gonna see where this

259
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,740
 goes and then she crawls in she's brushing her hair singing songs you're like Jason that

260
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,300
 sounds way more pleasant than running through a ghost woman and getting covered in ectoplasm

261
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:23,600
 here's my theory with this story there is a real issue in the ghost community where

262
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,360
 I believe because we have seen this we've seen psychics make this mistake a lot as well

263
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,680
 you'll have an actual haunting you'll have an actual ghost in an area and then people

264
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:41,440
 go where did this ghost come from who is this ghost and they will make up a story they will

265
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,940
 fill in the details so they'll say well this ghost looks like dressed in pioneer woman's

266
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:54,580
 clothes in the middle of Nebraska she's in this old house let's see what we can find

267
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:01,340
 in the family records oh a woman died in this house back in the period of close that I say

268
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,940
 I already forgot pioneers that what I said pilgrim walks in big old hat buckled shoes

269
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,160
 and you go oh that he must have died on Thanksgiving Eve he didn't even get a slice of that turkey

270
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,240
 we make up the details and we'll put together kind of like shoddy research and things like

271
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,120
 that we tell a story so when this ghost woman is sticking her head in the tent we don't have

272
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,520
 the name of the woman who this happened to we don't have a year we don't know when this

273
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,120
 kid died all this stuff so it's possible that there is a ghost on Girl Scout this also possible

274
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,720
 this is a made up story to scare Girl Scouts into going to sleep but if there is a ghost

275
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,700
 on Girl Scout Island unzipping your tent and sticking their head inside the idea of her

276
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,460
 being a mother who lost her kid we don't know if any of that's true we've seen this before

277
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,820
 in ghost stories where people make up the past this might be some crazy perverted woman ghost

278
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,060
 like who has some horrible hair fetish and a singing fetish they always wanted to be

279
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,860
 on American Idol who knows like this you think it's like oh a loving mother who lost her

280
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,400
 daughter so now she's going to play with your daughter's hair but if if you were like walking

281
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,400
 down the street and somebody walked up to your daughter and started brushing her hair you

282
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,680
 would be like dude get away and you're like whoa my daughter died I just want to brush

283
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,800
 your daughter's hair you'd be like okay that's horrible and also your maniac stay away from

284
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,000
 my kid like even if the origin story is real it's kind of creepy but what if this ghost

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,560
 just has like this weird like Girl Scout hair fetish or something like that like who's to

286
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:39,780
 say that that's the actual backstory and they either don't know or you want to tell a kid

287
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,820
 that right so I was like hey I saw a ghost in my tent last night and I brushed my hair

288
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,260
 in the cub of master or whatever they're called will be like that was a friendly ghost that

289
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,180
 was a friendly ghost and just listen I'm not talking about it anymore because they would

290
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:01,140
 know it was a big old pervert ghost who knows right it's probably the first one it's probably

291
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,960
 a mother who lost her daughter but I read that and I go who knows like isn't that creepy

292
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,760
 like your tent gets zipped up and a woman sticks her head in and she's looking around

293
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:17,800
 your tent and like what if she just really has like some insidious backstory like some

294
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,840
 horribly dark origin and you don't know you go oh that's just the kindly mother who lost

295
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,360
 her daughter and you're like do you want to come in our tent and she like slowly walks

296
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:37,460
 in I mean I guess despite what her creepy origin story may be the worst she does is brush

297
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,660
 your hair but maybe she does a bad job maybe have all these knots in your hair you're like

298
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:49,180
 ah and she sings terrible songs you're like oh no no more clay aching please Christina

299
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,100
 let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carbonicopter we are leaving

300
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,680
 behind Girl Scout Island bumping a little clay ache in ourselves as we're flying out

301
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:12,240
 take us all the way out to Ashland Oregon hi the friend long time listeners of the show

302
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,400
 know I have a friend named Sabine we hang out a lot but it's funny because we couldn't

303
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:27,420
 be more different as far as this subject matter goes for this podcast right she is super pragmatic

304
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:35,800
 to the point that I think she completely ignores things like evidence evidence stuff I imagine

305
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,100
 when Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were doing like assignments he Fox Mulder probably got

306
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:47,600
 really really irritated at Scully a lot because like an alien would be shooting him with lasers

307
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,000
 and she's like I don't know they could just be mirrors and it could be the sun bouncing

308
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,640
 off the mirrors and the sun could have put a baby in my stomach and then abducted the

309
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,360
 baby Scully come on like obviously there's aliens and ghosts and stuff like that you

310
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,560
 see it every night now I'm not that irritated at Sabine but it's so interesting we went

311
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,480
 to go see that movie the Northman together which is like a fantasy film I expected it

312
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,660
 to be like a historical drama like 300 but no it's a fantasy film where the characters

313
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,340
 like the great Norse gods actually have their fingers in the plot they're doing things and

314
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,780
 at one point this old woman gets wrapped up in the intestines of a man like she's literally

315
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,500
 like suspended from the ceiling like a yo-yo and I was like oh dude Odin doesn't mess around

316
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,060
 he really wanted to wrap up that old witch it was a witch with organs and she's like

317
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,520
 oh must have been a guy who did what I'm gonna possibly have done that there was no one around

318
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:52,240
 to do that the star the Northman Charles North he also had a sword that he got from a zombie

319
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,280
 that could only be pulled out of its sheath at night I go well how did you didn't you

320
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,200
 think it was weird that every time someone tried to pull it out during the day it wouldn't

321
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,800
 pull out but then at night he could pull it out kill a bunch of people she's like I can

322
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,100
 she didn't pay attention to that part apparently she's like oh I don't remember that I don't

323
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,980
 remember that key line so she's super pragmatic and but that's the type of person Sabine is

324
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,420
 super pragmatic super practical now she also says her house is haunted so she believes

325
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:29,220
 in ghosts and she doesn't take like human medicine she takes like thorn whistle and like peacock

326
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,820
 juice or whatever you know like all that hippie-dippy homeopathic stuff as well so she believes

327
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,220
 that hippies can apparently cure pain even though western medicine can she believes in

328
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,880
 ghosts but she doesn't believe in monsters she doesn't believe in wizards she's like

329
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,520
 chasing animal even that stuff in her now you're on the further extreme super pragmatic

330
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,400
 person and really throughout her life you know she says I live in a haunted house better

331
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,920
 than that other than that insane claim now I didn't think about it she's I guess she's

332
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:12,860
 not that practical but out of her entire life there is one story that she simply can't explain

333
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:22,260
 and very very terrifying experience let's go back to the year roughly we're back in

334
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:34,040
 the year 1998 Sabine is a 22 year old woman and she decides to take her dog Sage out for

335
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:41,440
 a walk and where she's going is the Ashland dog park which is located on Briggs Lane

336
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:50,920
 in Ashland Oregon it was a full moon out so the landscape was completely illuminated

337
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:59,460
 and sage was this big giant white dog but she goes she just glowed in the moonlight

338
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,060
 this big giant white dog she told me the breed but I don't remember it's like a yellow lab

339
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,920
 and mixed with the similarian or mixed with something else she's mixed with the one ring

340
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,580
 I forgot what she was mixed with but she's this big giant white dog and Sabine and sage

341
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,660
 go out to this dog park they have to climb over a fence she rode her bike out there and

342
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,080
 they climb over this little fence and I wasn't there but they're at this dog park and sage

343
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:32,240
 is out just kind of doing what dogs do having fun in the middle of the night now Sabine

344
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,380
 was out there for a little bit right 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes she's not entirely for

345
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,080
 sure but she was out there for a while right sage is running around and then all of a sudden

346
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:53,980
 Sabine feels something and she's standing there in the darkness but the full moon is

347
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:03,960
 completely lighting up the entire area she feels something out there Sabine begins to

348
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,900
 feel that her life is in danger it's a full on from like 0 to 12 right away she's standing

349
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:19,040
 out there just enjoying some time with her dog and then all of a sudden she 100% is under

350
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:27,360
 the impression that something is watching her with the intent of doing her harm it's

351
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,280
 a full on I'm about to be attacked the landscape is completely illuminated she's turning and

352
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,760
 she's looking everywhere and she can't see any movement she can't see any silhouette

353
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,880
 out of place the only location where she can't clearly get a good view is there's a creek

354
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,640
 nearby there's like a little goalie and there's a creek and she immediately goes whatever wants

355
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:00,120
 me is down there it's down there because it's the only place that I can't see and I clearly

356
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:09,840
 know that something is in this area that wants to do me harm I feel the caveman like instinct

357
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:17,520
 of survival against some sort of unknown predator I feel it I know this is going to happen and

358
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:29,480
 while she is processing all of this sage begins to feel it too a sage is a good guard dog sage

359
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:38,640
 has always been there it's getting in between Sabine and some sort of threat brave dog that

360
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,800
 if it sense something was wrong it was right there before the threat could even get close

361
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:54,760
 to Sabine so when sage picks up on this threat full guard dog mode activated she watches sage

362
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:06,720
 as he begins to snarl showing off those massive mighty dog fangs canines actually is what

363
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:15,040
 they're called but what strikes her is odd is that sage doesn't immediately run out

364
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,280
 towards the creek because that's where the threats coming from there have been times

365
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,240
 where Sabine is walking with her dog and sage will take off go to a bend in a trail so means

366
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,320
 like what I want to sage come back come back and then eventually two hikers walked by and

367
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,840
 were coming in the opposite direction and sage ran off to be able to eyeball them before

368
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,840
 they could present a threat like sage will go to head off an assault but sage didn't

369
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,240
 immediately run off towards the creek and that struck her is odd because she knew that's

370
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,760
 where the threat had to be coming from there was nowhere else around her where someone

371
00:31:50,760 --> 00:32:01,560
 could be hiding or an animal could be hiding or anything what sage begins to do is patrol

372
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:14,000
 he begins to walk in this very very wide circle around her growling snarling the entire way

373
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,840
 Sabine's watching him walk in this giant circle and that's when she realizes this isn't coming

374
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,000
 from the creek he would have been out there he would have put a stock to this or he would

375
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,920
 have made sure he was there between whatever it was in her but he's on this large circular

376
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:44,280
 patrol she realizes whatever this is this isn't at the creek whatever this is sage doesn't

377
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:51,000
 know where it's at either Sabine's watching sage make this large patrol and she's thinking

378
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,960
 could it be a group of people like what could this possibly be like why does he keep moving

379
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,800
 around me like this is there a group of people a pack of animals but at this point there's

380
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:08,920
 still no visual on this threat obviously have a giant white dog may kind of make someone

381
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,360
 a little more cautious about coming out to you but where's it coming from if it was a

382
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,920
 human sage would have been right there it was an animal sage would have been right there

383
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:30,160
 but he's walking this patrol and then Sabine begins to notice that this circle is getting

384
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:44,560
 smaller and smaller and smaller sage is still ready for war snarling and growling and gnashing

385
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,360
 its teeth ready to scare off anything that comes too close and if it keeps coming to

386
00:33:50,360 --> 00:34:03,200
 rend flesh but the circle is getting smaller and smaller and smaller sage is worried sage

387
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:11,880
 has no idea where this threat is coming from she's getting as close as he can to his master

388
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:20,200
 Sabine's still standing there trying to make sense of this until eventually her great protector

389
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,000
 this dog who was stood between her and many threats throughout the years is rubbing up

390
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,720
 against her legs the circle has become so tight he's literally just turning a quick

391
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,200
 circle right around her legs he's rubbing up against her and the snarling has turned

392
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:44,280
 to whimpering sage is terrified he doesn't know what it is he doesn't know where it

393
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:55,040
 is but he does know he can't protect Sabine so Sabine realizes this situation has completely

394
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,040
 gotten out of control and yet she doesn't know what the situation is and she stands

395
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:13,560
 there and she says to sage when I say run buddy we run Sabine yells out run and within

396
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,960
 an instant both her and her dog are barreling full force towards that fence she has to open

397
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:31,320
 it up sage runs out she hops on her bike and they both head home as fast as they can I

398
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,440
 talked to Sabine about the story I find this so fascinating because other than the fact

399
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,940
 that she says there's ghosts in her house she is super practical I mean like if you ask

400
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,280
 her about aliens she'll be like yeah sure universe is a big place or anything like that

401
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,840
 but as far as like alien abductions as far as monsters or wizards or anything else that

402
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,560
 I talk about on a daily basis she's like she enjoys the stories right she enjoys the stories

403
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,920
 she enjoys the weirdness but she doesn't really believe it and she's a very practical logical

404
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,280
 person and she grew up in a very practical logical family so when she experienced this

405
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,720
 I've at like what do you think it was and she goes I don't know she goes but I know

406
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:14,120
 this it wasn't flesh and blood it was not flesh and blood I don't know what it was

407
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,840
 but if it was something that was alive sage wouldn't have reacted like that now I could

408
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,760
 keep throwing out stuff as like do you think it was a ghost or demon she's like just and

409
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,240
 I don't know I don't know what it was this is very telling though because even though

410
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,560
 when she went into that moment and when it was going on she was still thinking this is

411
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,480
 some sort of physical threat i.e. a human or an animal but as sage's behavior got more

412
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,400
 and more odd and she started me and able to check off every possible thing it could be

413
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:53,280
 and it came to what it as far as her logical brain would say couldn't be I said I go you

414
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,480
 were looking around to see if you could see anything and go at any point did you look

415
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,480
 up and she says I mean almost I don't want to say like ashamed ashamed but there was

416
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:11,440
 kind of like a an odd emotion when she said this I go did you look up and she kind of

417
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:21,600
 paused and she's like yeah at a certain point I looked up because obviously a logical person

418
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:28,520
 wouldn't think there was a UFO floating overhead right but when she had run out of options

419
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,120
 of what it could realistically be at a certain point she looked up to see I go what did you

420
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:41,240
 expect to see she was I don't know but I looked up it's a fascinating story it's a fascinating

421
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,880
 story of an event of someone who really doesn't believe in any of this stuff ghosts sure but

422
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,040
 some sort of like demonic force or some sort of creature cryptid something hunting you

423
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,960
 through the darkness right aliens this kind of second day but most people believe in ghosts

424
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
 is like 70% of America believes in ghosts but when you start talking about aliens visiting

425
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,920
 earth the the percentages get much lower or cryptids monsters really existing against

426
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,400
 very low especially monsters that can do you harm Loch Ness monster people be like sure

427
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,560
 bigfoot maybe but when you're talking about some sort of creature in the darkness that

428
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,760
 can hurt you it's far percentage wise far less likely that people believe in that so

429
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,560
 it's like that would be where I was at it's funny because I've you know I'm a friend of

430
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,880
 her so I'm able to ask her these questions I said what would you have done if sage wasn't

431
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:36,320
 there she goes you know it's interesting because do you listen to that gut feeling that you're

432
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,040
 in a dangerous situation some people do and some people don't and she goes there's the

433
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,960
 chance that I would have had this overwhelming sense of fear that gripped her from the moment

434
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,720
 she first sensed this until she was on her bike racing away from the dog park like it

435
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,280
 never abated she was always felt like she was under threat she goes if I wasn't there

436
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,680
 with sage I might have just written that off right if I have there'd be no reason for me

437
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,360
 to be a she actually said she goes why would I go to a dog park and late at night by myself

438
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,480
 Jason I go well just saying she goes but wasn't there was sage there's a chance that I would

439
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:16,920
 have just ignored that feeling but when she saw the dog also having such weird behavior

440
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,320
 now it's definitely real dogs don't have a sense of imagination they don't have a sense

441
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,400
 of wonderment or fear of the unknown the dogs reacting to a definite real sensation it's

442
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,680
 not an anxiety attack it's not paranoia the dogs reacting to it so what was that in the

443
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:46,360
 darkness who knows but the story may not end there November 19th 2011 about three miles

444
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:54,200
 away from this dog park there's a bike path and really they kind of intersected a lot

445
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,720
 of points like you have the creek that kind of cuts through this entire area and the bike

446
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,480
 path is along the creek at one point and the dog path is by the creek and you just kind

447
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,440
 of have this creek moving through this area November 19th 2011 there was a young man named

448
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:14,760
 David Grubbs a 23 year old retail employee walking along this bike path late at night

449
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:24,040
 near this same creek was attacked by something so viciously it almost completely severed

450
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:33,480
 his head there were no defensive wounds he was found the next morning by someone also

451
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,400
 going down this bike path he was laying down and they thought maybe he had fallen down and

452
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,920
 gone to sleep until they got close enough to realize that his head was almost completely

453
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,640
 removed from his body he had no defensive wounds they have no idea what the murder weapon

454
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,040
 was they say it was something longer than a knife originally they thought it might have

455
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,960
 been a sword they've also thought it was a machete possibly they just don't know what

456
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:06,000
 the murder weapon was to this day this murder has never been solved now if you're in a big

457
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,640
 city you're like that doesn't even make the newspaper anymore big cities have multiple

458
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:16,160
 murders a week 2011 this guy was murdered in Ashland the previous murders there was two

459
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,400
 of them they were both like tied to these people going insane Ashland had two previous

460
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:30,160
 murders in 2004 and the murder before that was in 96 so Ashland Oregon is not a place

461
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,240
 that has a ton of murders it's where the Shakespeare festival is the murders normally

462
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,360
 only take place on stage and the police they don't know who murdered David Grubbs and they've

463
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,840
 actually looked at someone who took the Rennesfair you know the Renaissance fair too seriously

464
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,280
 and attacked David with a sword with a medieval sword or it was some crazy actor right killed

465
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,320
 him with a sword or they don't even know it's a sword they keep saying it was a long blade

466
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,920
 they were even looking into a link that he was a big part of the online gaming community

467
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,280
 surrounding Assassin's Creed I was like I didn't know there was a thing I know Assassin's

468
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,160
 Creed is a thing but I didn't know there was a gaming community around it's not really

469
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:20,400
 a multiplayer but they're trying to figure out what who killed this guy it's an 11 year

470
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,560
 old case they don't know who killed him they don't know how he was killed and they say

471
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,320
 he was a big dude they go this wasn't someone you would think would be picked for just a

472
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:37,040
 random murder but yet here it is this young man nearly decapitated by what coordinate

473
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:47,480
 news report seems like just one swipe didn't even know it was coming now some might say

474
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:56,640
 it's some say it's tasteless to combine a real world true crime story with a bizarre event

475
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,080
 that happened a decade earlier two decades earlier almost right some might find that

476
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:09,040
 insensitive some might find that cyber bullying but that's not the point the point is is that

477
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,720
 what is in this area like I guess it isn't sensitive because I'm going to start saying

478
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:23,440
 a ghoul attack Tim put is it the same thing is there something in this area that kills

479
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,880
 right that it's not a guy with a sword it's not a guy with a machete but it's something

480
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:34,560
 far darker and really even more unexplainable than that like what what what happened to

481
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,160
 Sabine what was something that could scare such a logical person what could be out there

482
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,360
 like what could be what what could scare a logical person and it's not even that remember

483
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,200
 the dog was reacting to it as well it's such a terrifying story and I don't know if the

484
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,840
 two are related but if they very well could be they very well couldn't be very well couldn't

485
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:06,400
 be but the fact that you had someone experience such a dramatic feeling of dread and doom

486
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,600
 and fear and the dog felt it too and the dog didn't know where the energy was coming from

487
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,880
 didn't know where the threat was coming from to the point that eventually it laid down its

488
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:27,520
 mantle as protector and just wanted to leave what could possibly do that is it the same

489
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:35,440
 thing that could decapitate a man in one surprise strike I'm curious if there's other events

490
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,640
 like this out I don't know what else has gone their head chopped off but I wonder if other

491
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,440
 people have also sensed this dark energy in this area and have maybe told the story to

492
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,040
 their friends and their family right Sabine doesn't have a podcast or newsletter nothing

493
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,980
 like that she would just tell this story to people she's never reported this to any ghost

494
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:00,240
 hunting organization or anything like that so are there multiple stories are there multiple

495
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,240
 encounters of something like that out there I would love to find out and is it possible

496
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,760
 that when Sabine felt that terror and she had that dog with her and she could see the dog

497
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,680
 was also sensing that terror that got her to leave but David walking alone when he felt

498
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,800
 that fear he just said I'm just being paranoid I've walked this bike trail a hundred times

499
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:38,920
 all be fine what hides in the darkness along the Ashland bike path who knows but this is

500
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:52,480
