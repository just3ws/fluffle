00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 Today we take a look at a trio of stories all involving myself. I'm not egotistical.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,760
 These are actually interesting stories. First off, what happens when I come face to face

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,640
 with a victim of a notorious true crime case? Two weeks ago I was house sitting for a friend.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
 I thought I was just going to have a fun time wrestling with her cat.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,080
 Instead I saw the shadow people. And then while I was house sitting,

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,520
 something came to my house to pay for this. Something from out of this world. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:45,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,880
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had an

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,360
 awesome weekend. We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away. First

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,240
 off, let's give a shout out to today's supporter Cameron. Everyone give a round of applause to

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,120
 Cameron. He is driving a tank into Dead Rabbit Command. He's running over a bunch of stuff.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,360
 Move out of the way. Tanks coming. Cameron actually made a very generous donation during a recent

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
 live stream. So Cameron, today you're going to be our captain, our pilot. We're not taking the tank.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,400
 We should have a tank though, but we'll figure that out. We're not taking your tank, but you can

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
 park it here. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
 Patreon or can't make a donation during a live stream, I totally understand. Just helps to

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,920
 rid the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. We also have a merch store. I always

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
 forget that. Merch store in the show notes. So everyone, let's take a walk through Dead Rabbit

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,800
 Command. We're all wearing our Dead Rabbit uniforms. It's just pajamas. We're very casual here. We're

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,760
 wearing really cool pajamas. And before we go anywhere, the stories I'm going to talk about,

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,120
 I talked about during a live stream I did recently, the one that Cameron donated on so generously.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,400
 But if you watched that live stream, this episode is going to have more information. This isn't a

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,440
 repeat. I'm not replaying the audio from that episode or anything. It's not a clip show. Even if

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,040
 you did hear the live stream this episode, I implore you guys to stick around because there's a ton

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,320
 of new information involving all the stories. I talked about two of them on the live stream. We're

26
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,480
 going to go in a more detail now. And then the ending is definitely something that wasn't on the

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,640
 live stream. So Cameron, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,880
 leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. I want you to hit that back in time button. We are traveling

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,120
 back in time to the early 2000s. We're specifically going to one of my favorite places in the world,

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:42,080
 Cameron make a left here. We're now in Orangevale, California. So the Jason Jalopy is pulling into

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,960
 Orangevale, California, a suburb of Sacramento, California. I spent a lot of my life there.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,360
 Some of my happiest memories are there. Not all of them. I'm having happy memories here as well,

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,520
 but Orangevale, California is dope. If you can stand all of the meth and the hardcore white

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,160
 supremacists openly just walking around, just walking around a super bizarre, super bizarre

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,240
 little suburb. You're just like, what? Did I just see that? Well, I remember once I was driving on

36
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,760
 the road and a gangfight broke out between two rival groups of white supremacists and blocked

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,040
 traffic and people were like honking their horns and then the fight just kind of ended and then

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
 we just got in their cars and drove away. It wasn't spectacular. I remember being like, oh,

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,400
 come on man. I'm trying to get to my ground loss house. These guys are picking each other up and

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 throwing each other into the concrete and then they all got in their cars and drove away and then

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,200
 everyone just went about their business. People went to the jack in the box. That's Orangevale

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,640
 for you. You watch a gang war of two white supremacist gangs beat the crap out of each

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,960
 other at three in the afternoon and then you're like, can I get a grande frappuccino please?

44
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,320
 We're in this area. We're in this area. Okay. But it is a really nice area other than that stuff.

45
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,640
 Other than the white supremacist gangs and the meth. It's great. It's totally great. You should

46
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,760
 live there. We're there. It's the early 2000s. I was staying with my grandma. My grandma,

47
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,400
 miss her dearly. She's an amazing woman. My great-grandma, my grandpa and all that. Really,

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,040
 really awesome family. I would visit my grandma all the time. I used to live with her and then

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,960
 even when I got my own place, I'd be over there all the time. Free food man. Free food dude.

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,840
 Chili and spaghetti and all sorts of stuff. But anyways, I remember once I was there and I was

51
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
 spending the night and I'm sitting there on the couch and my uncle's there, my grandma, because

52
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,040
 my uncle did live there. My grandma's there. My grandpa's there. There's always a really crowded

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 house and it's probably like eight o'clock at night. I don't remember the specifics. I remember it

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,640
 being nighttime and this guy comes over. Super drunk. Now again, not like Rodney Dangerfield,

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,440
 lampshade on head, drunk. Not wild and crazy guy drunk. Depressingly alcoholic drunk.

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,920
 And I'm thinking, uh, this guy drove here. This guy drove here. Because he's just like,

57
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,360
 "Hey, what's up?" Again, that makes him sound funny. Hey! No, he was one of the drunkest people

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,360
 I'd ever seen in my life. And I remember sitting on, I don't like being around drunk people or

59
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
 really, I don't like being around. It's different like when you're kind of at a party and people

60
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,080
 are buzzed, but I don't like being around drunk people. I don't like being around people who are

61
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,320
 high because they're just too unpredictable. Like someone who's stoned, sure, I can deal with that.

62
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,360
 I can deal with someone with a buzz. But once they start getting into the mind altering, like they're

63
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,760
 super rip and stoned or they're drunk, you just can't predict what they're going to do.

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,680
 And so I'm always on edge around these people. Because you could say the wrong thing, right?

65
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,640
 They're going to snap. And I've had that happen. So I'm super nervous, this dude that I don't know

66
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,200
 comes out of my grandma house and my uncle's like, "Hey, what's up man? My uncle."

67
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,080
 I mean, that's a whole different story as well. That's a whole different story as well.

68
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,000
 So the fact that he knew this dude wasn't helping, wasn't helping me relax. My grandma's like, "Oh,

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,840
 hi." Whatever his name was, Jerry actually looked his name up, but I don't want to give it.

70
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,480
 It's in court documents, but my grandma's like, "Hey Jerry, how you doing?" Haven't seen you in a

71
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:15,440
 while and he's like, "Uhhh." Like, unintelligibly drunk. He was barely able to stay. Again, he drove

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,960
 here and he was like swaying back and forth in the living room. And I'm sitting on the couch and

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,160
 I'm like, "Oh dude, I'm going to have to beat this drunk dude up because I'm going to like move my

74
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,400
 left arm." And he's like, "No one moves their left arm when I'm around because he's that drunk."

75
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,000
 And I was like, super ready to just fight this guy. My grandma's talking to him and he's like,

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,920
 "Hey Ida, how you doing?" And I think she made him some food because that's what grandma's do.

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,080
 The grandma's have unlimited food to give to people. My uncle's talking to him for a bit and

78
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,000
 I'm just super stressed out. Dude, just leave. Like, sure, you're drinking and driving, but

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
 just go. Like, I just remembered basically I was sitting like Liam Neeson the whole time,

80
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,280
 which he sits like a normal person, especially the actor Liam Neeson. I'm sure he drinks orange

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,720
 juice all the time. I was just, I was a coiled spring. But after, I mean, after an ungodly amount

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,760
 of time, I'm surprised I didn't get an ulcer. It had to have been a couple hours, I think.

83
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:19,200
 He ends up leaving and I was like, "Uhhh, finally I can relax and I can drink orange juice." Just

84
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:27,040
 like Liam Neeson. I go, "What, what was that? Dude, that was the drunkest human being I've ever

85
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:34,560
 seen. He was 50% alcohol and he drove away. You guys let him drive away." And I think it was a little

86
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,920
 bit more sober at that point, but again, I wasn't really, I was looking for things I could use as

87
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,720
 a weapon, which at my grandma's house is literally everything. Everything was either sharp or heavy.

88
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,240
 And she goes, "Oh, Jason. Oh, Jason. Yeah, he does have a drinking problem. He's serious alcoholic.

89
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,760
 His marriage is in the shambles, but he has a good reason to drink. He has a good, good reason

90
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,320
 to drink." And I was like, "What the heck? What's a good reason to be that drunk?" And she goes,

91
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,920
 "He was there when Michelle Montoya died." So let's go back a little bit farther in time.

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:19,040
 The year is 1997. It's May 16th, 1997, to be exact. And we're standing outside Real

93
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,800
 Linda High School, which is another suburb of Sacramento. It's probably 10 miles west or north

94
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,160
 or south or east. One of those, it's actually west of Orangeville, because I remember always claiming

95
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,440
 I was east side. But Real Linda, it's a real hick area. It's a literal one-stop light town. They

96
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,520
 might have more infrastructure now, but back when I was there, it was in my stomping grounds. They had

97
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,040
 the one-stop light. It's funny, for someone from Orangeville to be making fun of Real Linda,

98
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,840
 they're just like shaking their heads. They had a huge math problem as well. But yeah.

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,560
 I really can't cast stones. But anyway, Real Linda, it's this real rural community.

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,040
 Real Linda High School, it's May 16th, 1997. There is a senior. Her name is Michelle Montoya.

101
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,000
 She's 18 years old. And her teacher says, "Hey, can you stay after school? I want to have a meeting,

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,920
 a school meeting with you." Now, this meeting was supposed to take place at 2.30. It got delayed to

103
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,480
 2.50. Michelle Montoya is just hanging out. So, after the meeting, she needs to make a phone call

104
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,680
 to call her guardian to pick her up. And the teacher says, "Hey, you can use my phone." She had a

105
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,160
 cell phone, but cell phones weren't in wide use back then. And they cost money. They cost per

106
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,760
 minute. Michelle's like, "No, no, no. I'll find a phone." And the teacher thought that was odd.

107
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,720
 She figured Michelle would just go to the office and make a phone call there.

108
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,760
 There was a custodian named Alex Dale Thomas. He had just got hired on May 5th, 1997. He'd only

109
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:54,160
 been working there for three days. Now, back then, California had a stupid rule that a temporary or

110
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,840
 substitute employee of a school could be hired and start working before their background check

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,280
 cleared. So, Alex Dale Thomas definitely needed to have a background check then. He had eight

112
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,880
 felonies before he got the job as this guy. And they were like a tempted murder. I think one of

113
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,720
 them was aggravated manslaughter. He's not Liam Neeson. He was a member of a street gang. He was

114
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,280
 a member of the Crips. I mean, he had, he was like the 107 Crips or something like that. And he had

115
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,520
 107 tattooed on his forehead. He's not a huge fan of the radio station. He's a huge fan of engaging

116
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,760
 in gang activity and to cover it, he just put makeup on his head and went into the job interview

117
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,560
 and they're like, "You seem like a great candidate. It says on your resume, you spilled a lot of blood."

118
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
 He's like, "Yes." And then I cleaned it up to not get caught, but he got caught anyway, so it

119
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,480
 didn't matter. There's two custodians working in the school as well. And I gave them the fake names

120
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,040
 of Joey and Kevin. I don't remember what did I call the guy earlier? I don't remember what the fake

121
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,000
 name, but in my notes. So just to make things, just to make things logical, Kevin is the one I was

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,680
 talking about earlier, whatever that guy's name was. What I just called Kevin from here on out. So

123
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,240
 Kevin is the guy that I ran into in my grandma's house. So what happens is he's walking around the

124
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,520
 school, he hears a loud noise, and Alex comes running out of a room and he's like, "Oh my god.

125
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,560
 Oh my god. Oh dude." And he's like rubbing his hands on the ground with paper towels. And Kevin

126
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,960
 and Joey are looking and they're like, "What?" They're like, "Alex, what's going on?" He's wiping

127
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,440
 his forehead. He's like, "Man, it sure is hot in here." They see the gang tattoo. No, he stands up

128
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,480
 and he's like, "Oh dude, dude, I'm so glad I found you guys. Do you know how to clean this room?"

129
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,480
 I'm like, "What? Why are we just all sweaty running around? Because you don't know how to

130
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,280
 clean this room." And Kevin goes, "That's weird." Because he cleaned that room just the other day.

131
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,440
 So he knows how to clean it. It was like a shop room. He's like, "Fine, Alex, I'll show you."

132
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,560
 Alex and Kevin go into the room and it's like this shop room. And Kevin's like, "Yeah, this is how

133
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,320
 you do this, Alex. You know, here's how you move all this stuff around and everything like that."

134
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,840
 Then Kevin goes, "I'm going to go into this closet and get more supplies." And Alex goes,

135
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,040
 "Okay, you do that. I'm going to stand right here." And then Kevin, as he's coming back into the room,

136
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,120
 here's horrible screaming. It's like, "What's going on?" And Alex comes running out of yet another

137
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,880
 room all sweaty. And he goes, "Kevin, Kevin, you got to see this. You got to see this." And he basically

138
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,960
 grabs Kevin and pulls him into the wood shop room. You got to see this. You got to see this.

139
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,600
 And Kevin, even from a distance, can tell what he's looking at. It's the

140
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:47,520
 body of a young woman laying on a table. And Alex is basically pushing Kevin towards this body.

141
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,040
 "What is this? What is this? I just came and I just saw this. What's going on? What's going on?"

142
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,320
 And Kevin is getting pushed closer and closer to this woman and he's starting to see the extent

143
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:04,880
 of her injuries. Her throat is slit. She has stab wounds in her body. And as he gets closer to her,

144
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,040
 he realizes the full extent of her injuries. Now, I normally don't get gruesome on this show,

145
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,240
 but I'm going to, so you can skip ahead a minute or two if you want.

146
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,000
 She was hit so hard with a blunt object, which police later realized was a crowbar,

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:32,480
 that it shattered her skull. It smashed into her to the point that her brains came out of the other

148
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,440
 side. When the EMTs got there, they thought she had been shot in the head. That's how powerful

149
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,040
 this blunt object impacted into her. It wasn't just a little trickle of blood coming out,

150
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,720
 someone goes bonk with a bat. She got hit so hard, her skull basically disintegrated and

151
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,440
 brains are coming out of the back of her head. And Kevin is watching this. And he's basically

152
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,000
 being held there by the, he doesn't really know this at this point, but the murderer of her is

153
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 holding him there. The police are called, they come out very, very shortly. Alex just kind of

154
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,040
 becomes flippant and he's like, yeah, yeah, whatever. And he does get arrested. He gets charged with

155
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,200
 the rape and the murder of her. He said, listen, I didn't know who murdered her, but I didn't rape her.

156
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,320
 And then he goes, okay, I might have murdered her, but I still didn't rape her. Because that would

157
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,400
 mean the death penalty. Well, in the end, he did get the death penalty. He's currently sitting on

158
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:38,880
 death row to this day. And Kevin, Kevin's life fell apart after that. Like from what my grandmother

159
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,720
 told me, because she knew him as a kid, my uncle knew him, they were friends growing up. It ruined

160
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,680
 his life seeing this. Now you could go, Jason, I watch gory videos all the day. Trust me, it's not

161
00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:00,080
 the same thing. And to make matters even more grim, she was still alive. She died on the way to the

162
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,480
 hospital. She was still alive when Kevin was pushed towards her. There was still a spark of life in

163
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,920
 her despite that massive injury. There's a difference when you see it in real life versus when you see

164
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,040
 it in footage. I've seen a bunch of gory, like faces of death type stuff. And then I've seen people

165
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,400
 die in real life, like right in front of me die. And it does affect you. I know probably if you're

166
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,480
 doing it all the time like an EMT or a cop or a soldier, it's different. But for people who aren't

167
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,680
 those things, it's unsettling to say the least. And I've never seen a murder, I've never seen a

168
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,960
 murder victim die. I've seen people die in car accidents, like you get there, you're watching

169
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,560
 them, you're trying to help them and they die. I've had that happen to me a couple times. And I've

170
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,760
 lost count of how many just dead bodies I've seen. Because I used to work at a crematory. And you get

171
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,600
 used to those. Totally different seeing a dead body versus seeing somebody who's still alive die.

172
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,320
 But it ruined his life. He actually, after that, he developed a obviously serious drinking problem,

173
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,920
 serious, serious drinking problem. His marriage has fallen apart. And that's really the last I

174
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,040
 ever heard of him. I think it's interesting, it's a tragic story. But it's the story of all the

175
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,240
 effects that happen with true crime. You know, when we read about him in books, when we watch the news,

176
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,360
 it's always so sanitary. Sanitary is true crime can get where you always think, you know, the victim

177
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,560
 obviously has suffered. And then you think about the family members around them having to suffer,

178
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,120
 even the perpetrator's family member. Maybe the person was mentally ill and they wanted to get

179
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,880
 help for their son or their daughter and they didn't. And then they ended up doing something

180
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,520
 awful. But yeah, I never thought about those even side victims. That story went longer than I thought,

181
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,960
 but I think it's an interesting story. We're going to keep moving forward. We got to say goodbye

182
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,600
 to Orangevale, California. Wave goodbye to my grandma, my grandpa, my great grandma.

183
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,440
 Wave and Adam, they're four ghosts now, but they're still watching over us. Everyone give them a

184
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,560
 good wave. Cameron, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Carbitercopter. We're leaving behind

185
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,280
 Orangevale, California. We are headed back home. Carbitercopter is flying up north. We're going

186
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,160
 to land at a little house in the middle of the town of Hood River. This happened, it's funny,

187
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,840
 I probably should have looked up the dates. It wouldn't be too hard. I actually, this happened,

188
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,840
 I believe, on the 15th or the 22nd, one of the two. It happened very recently and I talked about it

189
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,440
 in the live stream. I was house sitting for a friend. I went over there to stay there for a

190
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,560
 couple of days to keep an eye on her cat and to beat him up. To beat up cats. I love wrestling

191
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,120
 with cats, taking a little pause. I mean, like, no, no, don't claw me in the wrestling. And, you

192
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,560
 know, we had a good time. I had a good time hanging out with Jenny, little cat person.

193
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,320
 But the house is weird. The house is really weird. At one point they had to do renovations

194
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,120
 in the house because the floor was falling apart. The floor was disintegrating. So they crawled under

195
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,880
 the house and right underneath where the bedroom is, underneath the house, they found a cat skull

196
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,160
 and a wand. The cat skull is the cat skull, but you go, the wand was it just like a stick? No,

197
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,960
 apparently it was like wrapped with leather. It was made to be a wand. It wasn't just like a cat

198
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,200
 walked in there with a branch and then died. And then every other bone disappeared except the skull.

199
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,040
 It was a cat skull and a wand were right underneath the bedroom. I hang out there a lot. And I remember

200
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,640
 at one point I turned to my friend. I was there really late one night and I turned to my friend and

201
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,800
 I go, "Have you ever saged this place?" She goes, "What?" And I go, "You need to sage this place.

202
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:52,320
 You need to sage it." I felt negativity there. Like as much fun as I had with my friend hanging

203
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,120
 out there, I could feel a negative presence there. And she did sage it. And she said that she felt

204
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,360
 like something was fighting back. After she had saged it, she had woke up the next day, she had

205
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,440
 scratches on her back. But that was it. You're like, "Jason, that's it?" She got assaulted by this

206
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,400
 interdimensional creature. That was the end of it. Like I went over there. I didn't feel negative,

207
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,880
 nothing anymore. But I'm house sitting. I'm someone who leaves the lights on all the time

208
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,520
 because I'm scared of the dark because I've just seen too much stuff. When you meet people who are

209
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,760
 scared of the dark, they're either not, they're all they're nine years old, or they're people who

210
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,200
 have had pretty bizarre experiences and they know what's in the dark. Because they're stuck, guys,

211
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,080
 I'm gonna be honest with you. They're stuck in the dark. They're stuck in the dark. Like I sometimes

212
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,600
 I don't really hit that hard enough. But they're stuck in the dark. They're stuck in the light

213
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,720
 that's not too pleasant either. But there's definitely stuff in the dark. So I sleep with

214
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,800
 lights on and if I'm a nine-year-old boy, if I'm at a place that's not my home, I do sleep with a

215
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,000
 nightlight here as well. But I get a lot of moonlight, so I'm good most of the time. But if I'm at

216
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,640
 someone else's house, oh, I'll house it for you, but your electric bill is gonna be much higher.

217
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,080
 Have the lights on. The first two days went fine. I'm laying there on the ground doing research

218
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,200
 for the show. It was a nice research weekend. I just spent the whole weekend pulling up information.

219
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:30,080
 And I'm kind of, I'm laying on the ground. I have my laptop there and I see, I feel something to the

220
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,440
 left of me. I keep feeling myself kind of get drawn to look towards the left. And there's like,

221
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,520
 it's a very open home plan. It's a very nice little home. It's a very open home plan. And I feel like

222
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,400
 I'm, my eyes keep getting drawn to the left of me. Now there is a cat. There is an open sliding

223
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,480
 glass door. At this point, it's probably like around 7 p.m. There's an open sliding glass door.

224
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,000
 And there is a drape kind of blowing in a slight wind. But there's maybe a good six or seven feet

225
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,280
 between the curtain and the sliding glass door and this bookshelf full of plates, full of these

226
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,320
 really nice plates and doll houses and stuff like that. And I'm looking over, I keep, my

227
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
 attention keeps getting drawn over there. I don't see anything. And at one point I'm looking over

228
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:26,160
 there and I see a shadow move. A figure move. A shadow person. Now it wasn't super distinct.

229
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,320
 It was like just simply movement, but it was tall. This bookshelf is probably a round as tall as I

230
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:41,280
 am. So close to six feet. And I just see something move out. I see a shadow move out of the shadow.

231
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,320
 Now I was not standing up. I was laying down. Jenny is not giant. There was nothing that could

232
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,600
 project her shadow that way. The drape couldn't make that motion. Couldn't blow that much because

233
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,120
 I tried all that stuff on the live stream. Now at the top of this bookshelf, there's this elephant.

234
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,640
 So it actually gives the, because you normally a bookshelf just has a shadow, like a rectangular

235
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
 or kind of a diffused shadow. But because there's an elephant at the top of it and the way that

236
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,520
 the light was hitting it, it did make it have a unique form. There's this elephant at the top.

237
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:21,360
 I see this shadow move and it catches my attention obviously. That's unusual. It's been years since

238
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,040
 I've seen a shadow person, years. So now my attention is fully drawn to the corner of this house.

239
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,480
 And I know that I saw something. I know that I absolutely saw something and I'm kind of looking,

240
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:43,360
 now I'm laying and I'm looking to my left and then maybe a couple feet from the shadow cabinet.

241
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,480
 Because at this point I'm thinking maybe I should do a live stream. Like this would be really

242
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,200
 interesting. I know this house has a history of it. The owner says she's never seen a ghost there.

243
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,440
 Like she did. She didn't get scratched by a ghost. But she figured maybe there's just like

244
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
 negative energy. I'm looking over in the corner and I'm thinking should I live stream this? Like

245
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,080
 this might be interesting. Also I'm scared and I want other people to talk to. I'm looking at the

246
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,680
 corner here and I see closer to me a couple feet from the wall where this shadow was. I see

247
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:23,840
 what could only be described as from the knees down a shadow child. I see two legs from the knees

248
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,720
 down. It was like a grayish shadow. Now normally the shadow people I've seen are pitch black.

249
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,560
 They're darker than reality. You can see them at night. It's very, very bizarre. You can see a

250
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,560
 shadow person in a pitch black room. They're darker than the absence of light. It's very bizarre

251
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:53,600
 phenomenon. Now I've seen them in fields. I've seen them in dark rooms. They're beyond black.

252
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,640
 Very, very bizarre phenomenon. This was a diffused gray. It was almost like a...

253
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,960
 You know what's funny now that I think about it? Didn't we cover recently a shadow person that was

254
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:12,080
 staticky? Did we do that? Did I cover that story? This seemed like it was a diffused shadow,

255
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,360
 like a shadow that wasn't fully formed. It matched the type of shadow that was being projected from

256
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,880
 the wall, but now we're feet away. We're now three or four feet away from the wall. In the middle of

257
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:34,240
 the room, this wasn't against the wall. This was a 3D shadow walking not necessarily towards me,

258
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,960
 but in my direction. I see just the movement of two legs go doot, doot, doot. But I did the

259
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,440
 livestream. There was actually some confusion of when the livestream was actually aired, because I

260
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,120
 wasn't really paying attention to it, but it's going to play a part in our next story. So I posted

261
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,840
 this on YouTube. When did the livestream go up? And I want to give a shout out to FreeEXP,

262
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,800
 Cthulhu, and Alejandro News. They were able to actually figure out the time that the livestream

263
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,880
 was going on. A lot of people were giving helpful suggestions, but they're the ones who actually

264
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,760
 were able to nail down when the livestream was going on. So thank you so much for figuring that

265
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,040
 out. We did the livestream. Now I asked her later, I texted her that night and said, "By the way,

266
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,000
 your house is haunted. Your electric bill is even going to be higher." And I talked to her when she

267
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,760
 came back and I go, "Did you get anything new recently? Did you get any?" Now I hadn't really

268
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,000
 told her much about what I'd seen, because she's on vacation and I didn't really want to go over it

269
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,880
 on text. I go, "Did you guys get anything new in the house recently?" And it's so funny,

270
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,600
 because when I said that I already knew the answer, I knew that I just knew the answer. It was the

271
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,280
 elephant. And she goes, "Yeah, I got a couple little elephant toys." And I was like, "Yep." That's

272
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,560
 exactly where I saw this figure coming from was the bookcase with the elephant on it. It was all

273
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,680
 seemed to be in that area. And I asked, I go, "Where did you get it from?" And basically she got it

274
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,120
 from a friend and the friend found these elephant toys. Are the toys themselves haunted? Are they

275
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,680
 some sort of conduit? Who knows? The first two nights, it was there all by myself with Jenny,

276
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,760
 and there was nothing weird at all. Stand-up plate, researching spooky stuff, nothing weird at all.

277
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,720
 It wasn't until that night where, again, it was like 7 p.m. It was around 7, 7.30 p.m. that this

278
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,040
 was going on and then I start the livestream. So you think that's the end of it? I thought it was

279
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:32,640
 the end of it. A nice little cool livestream that we did in a possibly haunted house. But then I come

280
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:41,200
 back home. I'm house-sitting in my own house. And one night, I get a message from my neighbor, Erica.

281
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,880
 She texts me on the phone and she goes, "Hey, what's up? How you doing?" And I say, "Hey,

282
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,800
 she goes, "Hey, did you hear that noise the other night? Was that you?" I said, "What?" No, I don't

283
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,800
 think so. I mean, what noise? And she sends me this audio clip that I'm about to play for you in a

284
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,560
 second. But this noise, we figured out because she goes, "I wasn't even home that day. I was

285
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:09,040
 house-sitting across town." She told me this happened around 7.45. She said it happened four times.

286
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,880
 And that's why I needed to find out when the livestream was going on. While I was live streaming,

287
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,200
 this noise was happening at my place. So I'm going to play it for you. I'm going to play

288
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:28,480
 two different versions of it. The first version is the raw, completely unedited file. It's going

289
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,880
 to be hard to hear. So you might want to turn your headphones up and then I'll give you a warning

290
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,080
 when we're going to play another version. But here's the original raw audio file from Erica.

 The stories are real.

493
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,080
 And as we continue to investigate the world of the paranormal,

494
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
 they're going to become even more real.

495
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
 They won't just be glimpses

496
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,080
 and faint whispers in a hallway.

497
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
 We may come face to face

498
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,080
 with the truth

499
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,080
 we were never ready to see.
