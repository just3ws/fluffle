1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
 Do imaginary friends have very real feelings?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,440
 Then we travel to Dyer Lane, a road in Alberta, California, to take a look at the story of

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,920
 a demonic cult and the day they successfully opened the gateway to hell.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:31,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,720

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,520
 day too, you guys didn't see my little dance I was doing, but I'm sure you can imagine

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,480
 it, someone who we don't need to imagine because they actually exist.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,720
 Let's introduce one of our Thanksgiving live stream supporters, give it up for Saleh Grockhanon.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,200
 Woo everyone give a round of applause for shaking their head, I know I didn't pronounce

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,120
 the name right, but Saleh, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode, thank you

 show financially, please just spread the word about the show, that helps out so much.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,480
 Saleh let's go ahead and toss you a shovel and get out some coal, we're gonna hop aboard

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,360
 the carpenter caboose.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,280
 Saleh let's go ahead and we are gonna shovel some coal into this engine, we are headed

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,760
 all the way out to a little boys bedroom, Chug Chug Chug Chug Chug Chug Chug Chug Chug

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,840
 Carbenter caboose, we're all sitting and getting out, super dusty, we're walking around this

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,760
 kids room, the mom's like "I just cleaned that room you weirdos, also why are a bunch of

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,400
 adults in my kids room, I get out of here lady."

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,960
 This story was posted online by someone known as KTB Kitten, so we're gonna go ahead and

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,480
 call this dude Chuck.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,240
 So when Chuck was a little boy, when he was about three years old, he'd be sleeping in

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,520
 his room, little baby pajamas, little three year old pajamas right with the footies on

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,400
 it, has little pictures of Darth Maul or whatever, and he would wake up in the middle

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,440
 of the night and his room would be like lit up, he's like "what, what's going on, I'm

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,120
 trying to get some sleep here, right, I'm a little baby, I need my sleep."

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,280
 And what would happen is he would notice the white blinds in his room on his windows would

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,480
 turn pale green and purple.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,800
 The whole wall in total, so that's what the white blinds look like, but his entire wall

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
 started to look like someone was projecting an old film on the wall.

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,640
 He goes "it was so authentic to what an old film looked like, he'd even have like the

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,980
 spots, like the cigarette burns in the corner and it looked like it was just this ratty

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,280
 old film, like some 1970's snuff film you're watching at Charlie Sheen's house."

35
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,840
 And he's looking at it and he'd be watching this old film strip.

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,080
 And then he'd watch a boy walk onto frame and the boy would look at Chuck and just kind

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,520
 of stare at him.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,600
 But eventually he would stop staring, eventually he started to have a conversation with Chuck.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 This little boy on the film reel that was being projected on the wall, he introduced himself

40
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:10,280
 as Mark and Mark said that he was a 7 year old boy was being the operative word because

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,720
 he's no longer alive.

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,160
 And Chuck would be watching this film and this happened all the time, he'd be watching

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,920
 this film strip projected on and I just to be clear, there is no real camera in his room,

44
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,060
 it's not like his mom's like nighty night and then she puts in this old creepy film.

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,440
 This looks like a projected film but there's no film anywhere, there's no film camera anywhere,

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
 there's no camera.

47
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,240
 Chuck is talking to Mark and Mark can talk to him as well and he described Mark as having

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,640
 dark hair and he was wearing a long sleeved striped shirt with a collar.

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,720
 Doesn't describe the pants, I'm assuming Mark was wearing pants, we'll just put them

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,760
 in brown corduroy pants.

51
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,520
 And Mark would converse with Chuck and he said, "Yeah, I used to be alive just like you

52
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,640
 but I died in a car accident."

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,240
 And then the car accident would appear in the movie.

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,400
 So like Chuck had actually been able to talk to Mark and Chuck like, "Please don't bring

55
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,920
 up the car accident again."

56
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,280
 Because he would see the cars actually collide and he would watch Mark die.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,120
 And he goes, "It wasn't gory, it wasn't super violent but it was watching a 7 year old boy

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,840
 die over and over again."

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,480
 And Mark goes, "You know why I'm here, I'm actually your guardian angel."

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,800
 And Chuck and Mark would talk.

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,120
 They'd talk about everything he said, all sorts of stuff, they would talk to him and

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,720
 Chuck kind of felt that this boy in the film, this Mark kid, was like a big brother to him.

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,560
 I mean he was older than him, he wanted to have the eternal knowledge of the dead, right?

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,840
 And so he felt like he had this rapport with Mark and talking to him was so comforting.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
 Now it's interesting, he doesn't say that he told his parents any of this stuff.

66
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,120
 And if a child was three and was like, "Mommy, tonight the dead kid's talking on my wall."

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,160
 I don't imagine, I imagine parents wouldn't believe them.

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,800
 I'm not a parent myself.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,400
 I don't know, I would believe my kids, I believe my kids because I believe in all this ghost

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 stuff, right?

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,840
 I'd be like, "Okay, we're camping out in your room tonight, I'm all super scared."

72
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,080
 But they don't mention that he talks to his dad.

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,120
 So anyways, he says that, this went on long enough that he like looked forward to it.

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,920
 He found it very comforting, this was someone very important in his life, he would appear

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,960
 every night, or if not every night, super common, but it was very comforting and fun

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,200
 and familiar.

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,040
 These are all words that Chuck used to describe his conversations.

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,960
 This goes on for years, this goes on for three years to be precise and at a certain point

79
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
 Chuck is now six years old.

80
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,560
 One night he's laying in bed and the blinds turn purpleish green.

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,680
 And the film image appears on the wall and Mark is standing there and being like, "Hey,

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,800
 Chuck, ready for a conversation?"

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
 Chuck's like, "Oh, not tonight."

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,360
 "Man, I got a big map test due tomorrow, one plus one, how am I supposed to know what

85
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
 that is?

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
 I'm only six."

87
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,960
 And Mark's like, "Come on buddy, I thought we were gonna play catch, I thought we were

88
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
 gonna play catch."

89
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,480
 He's just throwing the ball at the camera.

90
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,640
 And Chuck goes, "No, no, no, I don't want to talk tonight, I'm just so tired."

91
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,960
 And he actually rolls over so now his back is facing the wall and he's ignoring him.

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,720
 Chuck is totally ignoring Mark and Mark is continuing to talk to me like, "Hey, I thought

93
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
 we were gonna hang out tonight."

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 You know?

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
 Chuck, are you asleep?

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,000
 Are you actually asleep?

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
 Chuck, are you...

98
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,640
 I guess you're really asleep, yeah?

99
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,560
 And Chuck rolls over and goes, "Listen, I'm super, super tired, I was trying to fall asleep,

100
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,600
 but when he asked anyone if they were asleep, he's gonna wake him up.

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
 I'm super tired, bro."

102
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,200
 And to be honest, you're being kind of annoying right now.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,400
 Just leave me alone.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,920
 Oh, okay.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,760
 Chuck, you know, maybe, you know, 'cause I pierced the veil of life and death, maybe we

106
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,840
 could like have a conversation, but yeah, I got someone else, I got something else to

107
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 do.

108
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,320
 I'll see you later, Chuck, I'll see you later.

109
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,640
 Mark never returned after that night.

110
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,840
 He never showed back up at Chuck's house.

111
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,360
 And Chuck, to this day, to this day, he's 36 years old now.

112
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
 It's been 30 years since that time that he told Mark to beat it and he goes, "I feel

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,840
 to this day that I'm missing something in my life, missing someone in my life."

114
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:55,040
 Like I deeply regret treating him that way, but he never came back.

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,560
 Really interesting, really, really interesting story.

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,480
 I mean, obviously, this would fall into the ghost lore, right?

117
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 Someone who died and come back.

118
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,560
 But the fact that he identifies himself as a guardian angel is very interesting.

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,040
 And the fact that his feelings got hurt is bizarre.

120
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,560
 I'm a su-, I mean, you can unpack it all sorts of ways, but I'm assuming if you're a guardian

121
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,040
 angel, you're actually a scientist, so to protect someone, whether or not they like you,

122
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,400
 whether or not you're a jerk.

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
 But who knows?

124
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,160
 I mean, it's one of those like, was it a ghost?

125
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,880
 Was it an imaginary friend, right?

126
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,760
 Was he growing out of that imaginary friend stage?

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,000
 Was it a ghost that took the guise of an imaginary friend?

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,640
 I don't know, it's such an interesting story, but as far as what it is, it's hard to define,

129
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,080
 but it's interesting that it has feelings, right?

130
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,160
 We don't really think of that so much, do we, when we talk about the paranormal.

131
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,680
 We don't really think about it.

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,920
 I've talked before, I'll put the episode in the show notes, but the closet that I'm recording

133
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,880
 this podcast in is haunted.

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,440
 It's haunted by the spirit of an old man who, and I've talked about this before, I remember

135
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,480
 when I first moved in, I would see him, not in a physical sense, I would sense him, and

136
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:21,840
 he was an old man in his underwear that I had the idea that he had hung himself in the

137
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
 closet.

138
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,520
 And I remember I was gonna sage the place, and I went and I was hanging out with my friend

139
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,400
 Alana, and she sold sage at her store, and I bought some sage, and I never sage the place.

140
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,680
 I kept telling myself, I'll sage it later, I'll sage it later, sage it later.

141
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,680
 And I remember the house was getting real creepy, I was seeing some other stuff, and

142
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,600
 I remember I'd go, "Okay, this week, and I'm gonna sage the place."

143
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,520
 Now if you don't know what's "saging" is, it's smudging, it's where you burn sage, and

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,640
 you actually create a protective barrier from stuff getting in your house, and it kind

145
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
 of purifies the things that are already in the house.

146
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,080
 And I remember I'd finally made up my mind after like a year, finally made up my mind,

147
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,040
 this weekend I'm going to sage the place, because it's a process, right?

148
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,160
 It's not just a one and done thing, you kind of gotta do this stuff.

149
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,360
 And that night, I was sleeping on my couch, that night I woke up and through like blurry

150
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,840
 eyes, half asleep, right, for any skeptics out there, half asleep, the old man was now

151
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,640
 standing in my kitchen, and he, I think he had on a little more than his underwear, I

152
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,280
 think he was a little more comfortable at this point, but he was standing in the kitchen,

153
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,840
 and he basically, what I got from him was, "Oh dude, I'm sorry, like I didn't know I

154
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,240
 was making you that uncomfortable.

155
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,560
 Like please don't sage the place.

156
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,920
 Like I'll back off.

157
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
 Like I honestly didn't know I was making you feel that bad."

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
 And I never did sage the place, when I woke up I took that as a, "Oh, okay, cool, like

159
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 that's a truce, right?"

160
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,800
 And it's so funny, because I bought the sage, he didn't appear when I bought the sage, he

161
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
 didn't appear all those other times I was kind of half thinking about it, it was when

162
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,160
 I actually made the mental decision to do it is when he appeared, and I haven't had any

163
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,680
 issue, it's funny because the idea of him scared me more than him scaring himself, but

164
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,040
 now I lock myself in this closet and the only light's coming from the laptop, and it is

165
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,800
 haunted, you'll hear weird noises sometimes, a lot of times I head into the mouth because

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,560
 it does interfere with the recording process, and sometimes I don't know if it's me squeaking

167
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,680
 my chair, but there's been episodes where you can hear, when I'm talking about certain

168
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,920
 subjects, you can hear what sound like footsteps in this very small closet, and sometimes I'll

169
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,600
 hear stuff coming from the roof when there's no one on the roof, and all sorts of stuff.

170
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,560
 So I assume that he, I know that he's still in here, but anyway, so yeah, it's funny because

171
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,960
 I do think he has feelings, like he's like, "Oh man, I don't want to get smudged out."

172
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,640
 And then this little guy, right, was he a ghost?

173
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,840
 Maybe, I think it falls more into the ghost category, and maybe he saw himself as a guardian

174
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
 angel.

175
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,800
 And he says whatever you want to classify him as, it hurt his feelings that his buddy

176
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 didn't want to talk to him.

177
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 It's such a sad story, and we are so careless with our words sometimes, aren't we?

178
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,520
 Like we say stuff.

179
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,840
 Not everyone has the power that I do to edit, right?

180
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,880
 Not everyone has the ability to talk for a half hour, 45 minutes an hour, and then edit

181
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,480
 it down so it sounds really, really good and concise, and then there's a bunch of stuff

182
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,920
 gone, that'd be nice if we could do that in real life.

183
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,320
 Sometimes we say stuff and it hurts people's feelings, and sometimes they don't want to

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,000
 be our friends anymore, and sometimes it's not someone that you can call up a couple

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 weeks later and be like, "Hey man, I'm really sorry I said that, let's hug it out."

186
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,480
 This kid just kind of floated away into the ether.

187
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
 Did he go visit another kid's house?

188
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,200
 Who knows?

189
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,560
 An interesting story, the feelings of the paranormal, how they feel is often left undiscussed, and

190
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,040
 so I really, really love this story.

191
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,560
 So KTB Kitten, thanks for sharing it with us, and hopefully you do find, maybe Mark will

192
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
 come back.

193
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,240
 Now that we've recorded this, Mark is rising from the grave right now, crawling from the

194
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,560
 junkyard out of the car he died in, walking towards your house right now with revenge on

195
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
 his mind.

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,440
 Or 30 years of conversations he wants to talk to you about, either or.

197
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,160
 So Lee, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coptor.

198
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,100
 We're leaving behind this little boy's bedroom.

199
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:19,600
 We are headed all the way out to Dyer Lane.

200
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,440
 As we're headed out there, I wanted to do a really quick Dead Wrap Recommends, and this

201
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,400
 one is weird, not just for the movie-wise, but you're gonna have to dig for this movie.

202
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,320
 You're gonna have to dig around for this movie, but it's worth it.

203
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,920
 I reached out to the director to see if I could find a way to get it to you guys, uh,

204
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,100
 legit, and I haven't heard back, and I'm not condoning you to go to pirating websites.

205
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,780
 I'm not linking to any pirating websites.

206
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,900
 However, watch the movie.

207
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,500
 It sucks because this movie's really good.

208
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 You can't buy it.

209
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,100
 You can't stream it on Amazon or Hulu or anything like that.

210
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,380
 I'm sure you can find it online if you looked hard enough.

211
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,380
 It is called There Are Monsters.

212
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
 There Are Monsters.

213
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,540
 It came out in 2013, and even the trailer, even the trailer is hard to find for it, because

214
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,840
 when you type in There Are Monsters 2013, you'll see a bunch of reviews for it.

215
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,280
 This movie is on the verge of becoming lost media.

216
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
 It really is.

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,480
 And it's actually really good, and I like the setup, and I like the story behind it.

218
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,440
 It's the story of a demonic invasion?

219
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
 Alien invasion?

220
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,640
 They don't really tell you what's going on, but J. Dahl basically shot like 20 short films

221
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,440
 with the same actors.

222
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,860
 Like every weekend or two, they would go out and shoot a scene, and that scene itself could

223
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,220
 be just a short film.

224
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,660
 Each set up really, really well.

225
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,140
 He shot it over the course of three years.

226
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,580
 Parts of it have been released as short films, and it's basically a documentary crew.

227
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,580
 It's a found footage film.

228
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,060
 A documentary crew is going around town.

229
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,020
 They're interviewing local business people.

230
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,540
 It's just like this mundane day for this documentary crew.

231
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,360
 And they keep finding themselves in these really, really, really creepy situations.

232
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,920
 The reason why it's so effective, it's so slice of life.

233
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,480
 One of the segments is, "Oh, I want to go get a snack from the grocery store."

234
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,160
 So that whole scene is you walk into a grocery store, and there's no one else in there but

235
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,560
 one person behind the counter.

236
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
 And you feel the loneliness.

237
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,120
 There's a lot of liminal space in this movie.

238
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,020
 If you're into that, I know that's the new thing you kids are into, the liminal space

239
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,260
 horror.

240
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,460
 And it's like looking down the empty aisles, and then you look down an empty aisle, and

241
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,540
 it's where the storage bay is, and you see movement.

242
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,780
 And then you turn back to the cashier, and the cashier's acting weird, has some blood

243
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
 on their fingers.

244
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,820
 It's really, really, really cool.

245
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,100
 What's cool is because it's a lot of short films, it's viewed as one narrative.

246
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,300
 It's not an anthology.

247
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,780
 It's one long story.

248
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,640
 But there's a lot of really cool setups, suspense building, and then that is parts over.

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,320
 And then you move to the next little short film, and the dentist's office.

250
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,880
 The dentist's office scene is really, really cool.

251
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,040
 And you're following with these characters, they're getting super paranoid.

252
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
 And when they run into other people who are like, "We're being invaded," are they telling

253
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 the truth?

254
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,880
 They are, actually, because they know.

255
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,080
 It's really good.

256
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 Go watch "There Are Monsters."

257
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,960
 You can find it places online, but you can't buy it.

258
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,600
 It's unavailable.

259
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,460
 I'm thinking the company who owns the rights have stopped distributing it for some reason.

260
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
 Which sucks.

261
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,860
 I actually want more people to watch this movie, so they will start producing more copies

262
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,860
 of this.

263
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,360
 This is something that I think you'll really, really enjoy.

264
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,540
 Watch "There Are Monsters."

265
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,620
 Dead Rabbit Radio recommends "There Are Monsters."

266
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,940
 And let's get them to start making these DVD again, or very least put it on streaming.

267
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,100
 Yeah, it's on the verge of just disappearing, though, so really, really is lost to media.

268
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,880
 I actually saw it years ago and forgot what it was called.

269
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,000
 It took me a while just to find the title, because it's fairly generic, but really, really,

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,480
 really fun horror movie to watch.

271
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,000
 Okay, Sally, go ahead.

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,040
 I want you to land this Carbenter Coptor on this patch of rural land.

273
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,480
 Out of the countryside, that's what I mean when I say rural.

274
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,280
 We are now at Dyer Lane.

275
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,840
 Now I actually have been to this location.

276
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,740
 I used to do, on the ground, ghost hunting here, a lot.

277
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,100
 This is NL Verde, California.

278
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,940
 We did a whole episode about Dyer Lane in the past, but it was basically an overview.

279
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,300
 I was trying to get to the story about how I found a pair of burnt pants, and apparently

280
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,180
 almost slaughtered my friends.

281
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,340
 They thought I was going to murder them.

282
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,140
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

283
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
 There's a lot of fun.

284
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,340
 Not for my friends who they thought I was going to kill them, but it was a lot of fun.

285
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,020
 But it's popping back up.

286
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,960
 Dyer Lane, as much as I spent time out there, I started seeing more and more information

287
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,040
 about Dyer Lane being haunted.

288
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,160
 So Dyer Lane is in L Verde, California.

289
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,680
 It's this road out in the middle of nowhere.

290
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,440
 It has these hairpin turns.

291
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
 So there are stories of people racing out there and getting in horrible car accidents

292
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
 and dying.

293
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
 That totally makes sense.

294
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,000
 I'm sure that's happened.

295
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,440
 And we did an overview on the burnt pants episode, but as a quick review, there's a

296
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
 bunch of stuff.

297
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,560
 There are stories about the Ku Klux Klan.

298
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,260
 I used to hold ceremonies out there.

299
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
 That makes sense.

300
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,300
 If you know the area, that would totally jive with what's going on out there.

301
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,580
 But the story's a worry that you could actually see the ghost of the Klan out there.

302
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,340
 You could see the ghost of their victims when they were lynching black men out there.

303
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,660
 Horrible horrible stuff, obviously.

304
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,540
 And then you have stories of people dying in car accidents because there's no street

305
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,540
 lights.

306
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,180
 Ghost, just general ghost.

307
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,700
 Apparently there's a ghost cop out there that will follow you and then it'll disappear.

308
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
 Get a ghost stick.

309
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,960
 You have to go to ghost court.

310
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
 And it's interesting because that's all stuff that I knew.

311
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,640
 Those are all stories that I heard when I was out there.

312
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,880
 But there's actually some more information that's popping out.

313
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,720
 And let's take a look at this.

314
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,200
 This is really awesome.

315
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:05,040
 Apparently back in 1857, there was a couple named John and Julie Dyer.

316
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 They had a ranch.

317
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,720
 They had a couple houses built and they had a slaughterhouse there as well.

318
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,840
 And I've checked this.

319
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,260
 Probably this part, at least is true.

320
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,780
 There were people named John and Julie Dyer.

321
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,260
 The legend begins where John was a serial cheat.

322
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,300
 He was always out in town, banging the local girls.

323
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,700
 And Julie couldn't stand that.

324
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,300
 Julie was super jealous.

325
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,500
 She was hating on her husband's game.

326
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,380
 So instead of just leaving her husband and being like, "Oh, I can find someone else,"

327
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,420
 she kills all of her children.

328
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,220
 It's quite the escalation.

329
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,080
 She kills all of her children and then she kills him and then she kills herself.

330
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,440
 And actually, I misspoke, she didn't kill all of her children.

331
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,600
 One of her sons wasn't home at the time.

332
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,880
 So this other son comes home, the one who wasn't there.

333
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,000
 And he sees that his mom had killed his entire family and then killed herself.

334
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,280
 And in a fit of rage, how dare my mom killed the whole family.

335
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,220
 He burns everything to the ground.

336
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,240
 He burns down all the homes in the slaughterhouses.

337
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,740
 And then he shows up and he's like, "Oh, the police.

338
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,860
 You won't believe what happened.

339
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,800
 My mom killed everybody.

340
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,260
 I burned all the evidence.

341
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
 That was me.

342
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,980
 But trust me, my mom did it."

343
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,880
 And apparently the authorities are like, "Oh, well, murderers, suicides do happen.

344
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,860
 So you're generally not followed up by arson by another person, but we'll let you go."

345
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,620
 I don't know if that part of the story is true.

346
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,140
 I will say there was a couple named John and Julie Dyer.

347
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,900
 So that was the beginning of the legend of Dyer Lane.

348
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,120
 Urban legend, possibly.

349
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
 I don't know if that actually happened.

350
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,240
 I think the police would be super suspect.

351
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,040
 Back in 1857, the police weren't idiots, right?

352
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,540
 I know they didn't have DNA.

353
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,040
 They didn't have all this stuff.

354
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,040
 But they would be super suspicious that one survivor of the family destroyed all the evidence

355
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,640
 and said someone else did it.

356
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,000
 There's also more recent stories that we know are true, where someone dumped a body.

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,600
 Some dude killed his roommate and dumped her body on Dyer Lane.

358
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,720
 So we have that stuff.

359
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,200
 We have it connected to real life incidents.

360
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,500
 Apparently there was a huge gang fight between Real Linda and Encina High.

361
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,340
 I really hope Encina High won.

362
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,420
 Real Linda is a trash heap.

363
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,980
 Real Linda, but out of that, apparently there was like a bunch of kids fighting there.

364
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,380
 Some guy got stabbed to death.

365
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,980
 I 100% believe that story happened.

366
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,540
 100% because of the area.

367
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,540
 But really the most interesting story to come out of Dyer Lane, next to the burnt pants

368
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,380
 one, next to the story that I was fired on, because I'm an egatist, is this one.

369
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,780
 This story, this story is actually way cooler.

370
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,400
 But a Dyer Lane Satanic Colt story.

371
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,240
 Now again, when I lived in the area, I had heard about Satanic Colts and witches, covens

372
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
 and all this stuff out there.

373
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,800
 But it was always spoken in such general terms.

374
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,920
 Don't go out there too late at night.

375
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,680
 You might run into a bunch of people killing a black cat.

376
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,480
 Don't run out too late at night because they may grab you and try to do some sort of sacrificial

377
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
 thing.

378
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,520
 But this story I'm about to tell you is really cool just because of the specifics.

379
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,700
 This is where it stops being something that someone tells you when you're all sitting

380
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,620
 around getting stoned versus this one might be a little true.

381
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,500
 The year is 1967.

382
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,740
 And there's a group that is meeting out on Dyer Lane.

383
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,220
 There's a group called the Satanic Order of Amduceus.

384
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,660
 The Satanic Order of Amduceus, they worship Amduceus.

385
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,900
 This is an interesting demon.

386
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,980
 I looked this dude up.

387
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,720
 He's a unicorn.

388
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,880
 He's actually a demon that takes the shape of the unicorn.

389
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,880
 Now you can request for him to appear as a human, but in true demonic fashion he can't

390
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,200
 be truly human.

391
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,880
 His feet and his hands are claws.

392
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:54,480
 Amduceus is the Grand Duke of Jinnistan, which is a huge region of hell that is also known

393
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,280
 as the City of the Jinn.

394
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,140
 So we're going to do a whole different episode on that.

395
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,940
 I was looking at that and I was like, okay, that's the story in and of itself.

396
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,020
 The City of Jinn in hell and this guy is a part of that.

397
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,820
 But let's go back to more terrestrial matters.

398
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,260
 He's the Grand Duke of Jinnistan.

399
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,340
 What's interesting is when people summon demons, generally you summon demons who can do things

400
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,340
 for you.

401
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
 They give you unlimited knowledge.

402
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
 They can give you treasure.

403
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,940
 They can give you powers during war or love.

404
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,160
 This guy gives concerts.

405
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,280
 This guy, when you look at his power level, even though he's a Grand Duke, he doesn't

406
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,240
 reward humans with anything.

407
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
 This is what he does.

408
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,040
 When he shows up, he's associated with thunder.

409
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,440
 And when he shows up, you hear thunder.

410
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,280
 When you go to Jason, you can just go and summon him right before a storm, right?

411
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,920
 And then when the storm rolls in, you're like, we did it.

412
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 It's correct.

413
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,380
 He's also associated with the sound of trumpets playing as he appears.

414
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,380
 And that's what he does.

415
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,580
 He shows up and he can give you, he puts on a little show for you.

416
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,700
 You don't see the instruments.

417
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,740
 He just stands there and you hear this music.

418
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
 I don't know.

419
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,980
 It doesn't even say if it's good music.

420
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,180
 It could be really bad.

421
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,180
 You don't know.

422
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,980
 It's just music and his other power, right?

423
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:22,860
 So if you don't want to hear music, his other power is he can make trees bend.

424
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,600
 They bend towards Amduceus.

425
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:32,800
 Again, not something, I mean, when you are summoning a dark lord, treasure or love or

426
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,440
 war, not trees bending.

427
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,680
 But anyway, so this group, I mean, apparently this guy had a bunch of groupies because they

428
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,560
 say Tannock Order of Amduceus is trying to summon him out in dire lane and they would

429
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,840
 show up on really dark cloudy nights to summon him.

430
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,600
 They were doing it over and over again and they couldn't get the ritual right.

431
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,620
 So they started sacrificing animals and they're going out on these dark cloudy nights trying

432
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,660
 to summon him and the thunder may roll in but they don't hear the trumpets.

433
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,160
 He doesn't appear.

434
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:07,940
 And then they decide, okay, listen, either this is all made up, demons aren't real, or

435
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,280
 we're doing something wrong.

436
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,140
 We got the ritual wrong somehow.

437
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:20,220
 Or what we're sacrificing to him is not worthy of Amduceus' time.

438
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:27,680
 So they decide to move on to the ultimate sacrifice, a human sacrifice.

439
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:37,360
 One of the members of this cult offers up his own sister, a girl named Lynn and they

440
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,040
 canapher and drag her out to dire lane.

441
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:53,300
 They hold her down on the dry soil, reeds rustling nearby, dark clouds overhead.

442
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:00,940
 The leader of the cult reveals his ceremonial dagger and holds it up.

443
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:08,060
 The followers of Amduceus are wearing heavy red robes and they're watching this ceremony

444
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,960
 with baited breath.

445
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,700
 This is the time Amduceus must appear.

446
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:23,540
 The group begins to chant to Amduceus as the leader holds that dagger high and then drives

447
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,220
 it straight into Lynn's chest.

448
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:38,980
 The sound of thunder erupts from the sky.

449
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:55,680
 It's a glare from the heavens and then the trees begin to bend.

450
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,520
 The cult members look around.

451
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:10,620
 All the trees are bending right towards the body of this young dead girl.

452
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,780
 Ceremony was a success.

453
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,740
 But Amduceus did not appear in a physical form, at least to these reports.

454
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,140
 But he did arrive.

455
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,560
 A few of the cult members actually met very mysterious deaths.

456
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,220
 Violent deaths.

457
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:38,540
 One of them in particular was found with his throat slid sitting on a park bench one night.

458
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:46,340
 They say today if you go out to dire lane and you walk through one of the empty fields,

459
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,560
 you can hear the sound of ghostly chanting.

460
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:59,980
 And if you follow these chanting voices, you'll end up in the spot where Lynn lost her life.

461
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,940
 And then SHRRRR!

462
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,780
 Three deep painful scratches will just appear on your body.

463
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:18,420
 Almost as if a clawed hand reached from beyond and sliced your flesh.

464
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,520
 All the hallmarks of an urban legend.

465
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,840
 I was actually only able to find one source of this.

466
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,120
 It's a guy named Paul Dale Roberts.

467
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
 I'm actually surprised I've never come across this guy before.

468
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,600
 And he is quite the character.

469
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,440
 I actually want to cover him more on another episode as well.

470
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,440
 But he's actually a boots on the ground ghost hunter.

471
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,680
 He's been doing it for decades.

472
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,620
 And he has a book called HPI.

473
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,680
 It's a book called HPI's Very Own Acashic Records.

474
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,320
 Acashic means collection of all thoughts ever.

475
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
 Even non-human thoughts.

476
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,860
 But HPI's Very Own Acashic Records is the name of this book.

477
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,720
 And I got some more stuff coming up about him.

478
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
 But yeah, he's local.

479
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,520
 He's a Sacramento guy.

480
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,660
 I'm surprised I've never heard of him before.

481
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,540
 That we never crossed paths when I was doing ghost hunting stuff down there.

482
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,380
 Because he's been doing it longer than me.

483
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,840
 There's an interesting story though.

484
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,680
 So urban legend, maybe.

485
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,240
 He's done a lot of investigations.

486
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,440
 He's done a lot of research on it.

487
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,160
 He could have been fed a line.

488
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,560
 Somebody could have made the story up and gave it to him.

489
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,800
 But in the world of paranormal, we keep an open mind with this stuff.

490
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,560
 If this story is true, I think I believe the basic parts of it.

491
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,080
 And that is the idea of opening a portal to hell.

492
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,360
 I do believe that you can do that.

493
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,880
 I do believe that you can summon demons.

494
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,360
 I don't think you should.

495
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,740
 I think it's a very, very bad idea, even if you do want riches and power and love.

496
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,460
 I think it's a terrible idea.

497
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,900
 You're basically making a deal with not the devil, but the devil's assistant.

498
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,820
 And I think a lot of times when you make a deal with the devil or you make a deal with

499
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,660
 the demon, what have watched demons?

500
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,300
 Don't attack me because I'm going to reveal their secrets.

501
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,420
 You could do this stuff anyways.

502
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,380
 Let's say you want to make a deal with the devil to become the most rich and famous actor.

503
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,160
 You could do that legitimately through other ways, through hard work.

504
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,160
 But let's say you want to do that, you could use stuff like the law of attraction to get

505
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
 the same thing.

506
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,440
 The process may take a little bit longer, but you can get the same thing.

507
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,960
 And I think basically demons, they trick you.

508
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
 They make it sound like you have a deal with them when really it was the universe giving

509
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
 you that.

510
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,000
 Maybe even God was giving you that.

511
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,120
 And it was on its way, and you were so impatient you made a deal with the devil and you sold

512
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,720
 your soul when you would have gotten it anyways.

513
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,520
 And so I think that that's part of the trick.

514
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,080
 And then you thank you've sold your soul.

515
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,820
 Well, you did sell your soul.

516
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,220
 And I know I've read accounts of people who have sold their soul, legitimately sold their

517
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
 soul.

518
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,260
 And you have these horrible nightmares, and basically it's these nightmares of God abandoning

519
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,580
 you and how you won't, he won't even answer you if you pray.

520
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,860
 And if you pray, things are going to get worse.

521
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,540
 And it's like talking to someone who you owe money to and how embarrassing, how embarrassing,

522
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,700
 how shameful you are.

523
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,660
 So they basically will not ask God for forgiveness.

524
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,340
 A lot of people go, well, I'll sell my soul to the devil and then rip for it, die.

525
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,080
 All except Jesus Christ, or I'll believe in God, I'll ask for forgiveness and all this

526
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
 stuff.

527
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,440
 And they don't because it's so weird.

528
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,200
 Like I think we've talked about this on another episode, I'm trying not to cram it in here.

529
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,320
 But it's so weird the way deals with the devil's work.

530
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,360
 And I believe that you can do that stuff.

531
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,680
 I believe that you can open these gateways.

532
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,440
 The problem is, as imagine this, if I had a virus in a jar and I was walking through

533
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,600
 downtown Sacramento and I, CIA, FBI, this is just an example.

534
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 I'm not actually going to do this.

535
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,500
 But I was walking downtown with a virus in a jar and I dropped it on K Street and I kept

536
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 on walking.

537
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,100
 And I don't warn anyone that I've just dropped this jar full of viruses.

538
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,380
 Other people are going to walk by it.

539
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,740
 Now the people are walking on the opposite side of the street.

540
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,700
 Some people are walking on the opposite side of the city.

541
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,180
 They don't have to worry about it really.

542
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,260
 But the person who's walking over it is going to get the virus.

543
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,720
 And there would be other than broken glass and a man running away super fast wearing

544
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,140
 a gas mask, you'd have no idea what was going on.

545
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,420
 It's just a place.

546
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,940
 And there's viruses here now.

547
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,400
 That's the problem with people summoning demons in the middle of nowhere.

548
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,080
 Because that's where you would do it, right?

549
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,320
 There's a lot of stories about people goofing off and trying to summon demons in their houses

550
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
 or on their property.

551
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,560
 They're like, "How about that abandoned barn in the backyard?"

552
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,240
 Don't do that either.

553
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,900
 Because now you've basically lowered the property value.

554
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
 It's haunted.

555
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,380
 It's not only haunted, it's possessed.

556
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,700
 So that is why you go out into the middle of nowhere.

557
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,220
 Obviously, if you're part of this demonic cult, you guys can pool your money together

558
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,300
 and buy a nice ranch house, right?

559
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,980
 You guys can get something nice.

560
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,300
 You don't want to do it there.

561
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,260
 You don't want to do it in a property because it's not going to leave.

562
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:50,340
 So you summon a demon in the middle of nowhere and then you leave and that portal still open.

563
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,640
 These demonic time bombs are out there and you're just strolling through the field.

564
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,080
 But think about national parks where you can do this type of thing, right?

565
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,960
 Yeah, out in the middle of nowhere you're opening these portals.

566
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,720
 We're just regular parks, right?

567
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,560
 Swing sets.

568
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
 Things like that.

569
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,880
 You go out in the middle of nowhere and you're doing these things and you're opening these

570
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,200
 portals and demons are coming out of them.

571
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,360
 And you've now created a demonic landmine that nobody knows about.

572
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,200
 There might be legends that you've walked by there.

573
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,580
 Oh, you're going to get scratched, bro.

574
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,300
 Or not, right?

575
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,980
 It took 40, 50 years.

576
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,020
 I actually, again, I've never heard the story and I've done boots on the ground investigating

577
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,100
 here.

578
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,740
 I have been out in the middle of those fields.

579
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,860
 That's the creepy part, right?

580
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,140
 We can identify the haunted house.

581
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
 We can identify the spooky graveyard.

582
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,700
 But if people who are doing this and I do believe people do this and I do believe they are successful,

583
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,260
 they're creating these places where no man should tread.

584
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,200
 And yet we do because we don't know any better.

585
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,600
 Terrifying, terrifying story.

586
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,000
 The very least, right?

587
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,800
 They murdered a girl on a patch of land and you're like, "Let's have a picnic here."

588
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,760
 And you don't even know that happened.

589
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,320
 But the very most, you could be sitting there with your loved ones having a delicious snack

590
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
 eating your sandwich.

591
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
 "Mum, num, num, num."

592
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,240
 And you look over at your girl and she looks at you.

593
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,600
 "Mum, num, num, num."

594
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,360
 You're eating your sandwiches and everything's just, it's a beautiful day out, right?

595
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,580
 And then it starts to rain, a little bit of rain.

596
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,500
 It's time to pack up the picnic.

597
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,020
 If you're getting everything into your picnic basket and you're throwing in your blanket

598
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
 and all that stuff.

599
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,220
 And there's some chips on the ground when she's not looking.

600
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
 You eat some more chips.

601
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,220
 "Mum, num, num, num."

602
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,220
 Two minute rule.

603
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,620
 "Mum, num, num, num."

604
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,540
 And then as you're walking back to the car, you hear a clap of thunder.

605
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,420
 "That's okay, right?

606
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,500
 You're headed towards your car.

607
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 You're getting in your car.

608
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 You're driving away."

609
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,820
 If you'd been a little more astute, if you really knew what the signs were, maybe you

610
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,120
 heard the faint sound of trumpets playing along with that thunderstorm.

611
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:53,120
 Maybe if you had looked up, you would have seen the trees starting to bend just slightly

612
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,840
 as the first wave of thunder rolled in.

613
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,280
 And if you really knew what to look for, maybe you would have looked deeply into your girlfriend's

614
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,400
 eyes before you put the car in reverse and started driving away.

615
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,940
 You thought you were just having a wonderful picnic with your little lady.

616
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:20,380
 Instead, you're now driving back home with a demonically possessed woman in your car.

617
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:26,220
 The old her is trapped somewhere deep within her psyche, screaming to be let free from

618
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:31,140
 this eternal darkness within her own head.

619
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:39,320
 While a demon older than the universe itself is taking up residence in her young flesh.

620
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:46,480
 You drive down dire lane, turn on to Watt Avenue, and head home.

621
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:54,080
 But really, you're falling head first into a world of madness, a world of violence, a

622
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:04,060
 world drenched in blood, all because you chose the wrong spot to have a picnic.

623
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:17,060
 All because you decided to spin the day on dire lane.

624
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,660
