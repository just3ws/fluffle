 Today we meet a group of people who believe the more rotten the meat the sweeter the treat
 Then we take a look at some bizarre statistics that show what people really think about conspiracy theories
 Now we travel to Australia to take a look at a bizarre UFO story when Amy Rylance is abducted in front of a witness and
 Beamed aboard a UFO. She's only gone for three hours
 But how did her hair grow so long in such a short time?
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio

 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna head out to a
 Tropical little paradise no one as the middle of nowhere
 splash
 splash
 Splash rowing all the way over there's a dude you guys may have seen this this is popped up on the news recently
 if you guys
 Have seen it. I apologize for bringing it back up. I apologize for these bad memories
 There's a guy who got his name on YouTube. He goes by severage
 Severage is a man and he has a unique idea
 Severage is what's known as an
 Anti-vegan now it's different than a non-vegan. I'm non-vegan. I don't eat vegan food if you eat vegan food fine
 I don't care right as long as you're not trying to eat my food. We're square
 Non-vegan is people who aren't vegan and anti-vegan is
 Someone who is against veganism who thinks that it's wrong and you you eat funny cuz you may go well Jason
 I actually think veganism is unhealthy or I think it's kind of highfalutin. I think it's pretentious whatever
 You're still not an anti-vegan in the way that severages
 Because you still eat I'm assuming you still eat vegetables
 You may not agree with the vegan lifestyle again. I really don't care
 I used to be vegetarian for moral reasons and then it got too expensive and morals went out the window
 I was like, I'll eat a cow you may not like the vegan lifestyle
 You may think it's pretentious or it's not super healthy, but you're not still not anti-vegan anti-vegan is someone who consumes no vegetables
 at all
 Not even the carnivore diet is considered anti-vegan because see anti-vegan
 They're like what you cook your food you disgusting man
 Anti-vegan is the consumption of raw meat
 Surprisingly, there's more than one person who does this they consume raw meat
 Now as I'm telling this story, I'm gonna keep having visuals of this video. I watched of
 Severage he had a jar. Okay, hold on a second. I can't be gagging the whole story. There's this video. It's on YouTube
 He has a jar of meat that he has let sit in this jar for a year
 Never cooked it
 Not like it would matter if it was cooked first and then he left over a year
 He sticks his fork and he pulls out what looks like hard
 clam chowder
 It's dripping white goo
 Sorry, my apologies if you're eating clam chatter tuna casserole my apologies if you're eating anything right now
 It's basically like a giant meatball of rotten meat and he goes I'm gonna eat the whole thing right now like that's supposed
 to be in the impressive part
 And he begins to he begins to devour this piece of rotten meat
 It's funny because I've never eaten rotten meat. I've eaten undercooked meat
 I've never eaten rotten meat. I assume most of you guys have never
 Severage turns out to be a
 Severage is Dean Ryan. This is the episode he's supporting. He's like, oh no trapped in a mirror and he's making fun of me
 We've never eaten rotten meat, but just you there's an instinctual thing
 That kicks in when you talk about it and you look at it
 It's not like I can even like if someone was eating poop
 I've never eaten poop, but because I spend a lot of time around poop myself
 I'm not like a poop connoisseur that I know like the smell and the texture. I don't want anything to do with it
 So when Cece I can't watch people eat poop
 I don't feel bad about that. I'm not like oh man, I really should I really should start doing that
 But watching someone eat rotten meat
 I've never really been around rotten meat more than once or twice especially not year old meat watching him do it
 It makes you physically ill. I could barely watch it and he's eating this raw meat this year old raw meat
 And they do it for a couple reasons one because they're anti-vegan and this is all they can consume. They're so hungry
 They're like, oh when will dinner be ready? Oh three more months. Oh, no
 They're eating I'm sure they have to eat other meat in the meantime, but
 They're they're anti-vegans. They eat this raw meat and it also gets them high
 That's what I found out about it
 There was recently some news articles in the Sun and Newsweek
 Where they were like this new trend some people on the internet quote-unquote some people on internet
 Which is usually like three or four weirdos and then all of a sudden eight people tweet about it
 And then some lazy journalists will write an entire story about it
 And then some lazy podcaster will cover it the difference is is I know the game
 I know the game when Newsweek or Huffington Post or God forbid the New York Times runs a whole article about three tweets
 It blows my mind have my degree in journalism. It absolutely rattles my cage when
 Anyways, I'm part of the problem because I reported on a podcast this podcast is goofy and it covers weird stuff
 It's not the gray lady. Anyways, some people on the internet a couple people are eating raw meat
 It's become this viral storm viral because of the worms in their stomachs
 apparently if you eat it it gets you high and
 The articles they're like well, I really don't know the articles like IFL science commas like we really don't know the mechanism
 Of why it would make you high it could be that the bacteria
 Hit your stomach it could be that you're definitely ill it could be the side effects of these diseases
 I watched this video a severage and as he was eating it like before the video was like five six minutes long after he gets
 Then eating and he goes yep
 I already feel high already feel high and I thought oh
 That's how he gets high they make it up
 It's all in their head
 There's very few drugs that you can ingest that you get high immediately
 Like within five minutes of taking the drug so it's it has to be just psychosomatic
 IFL science. There's your answer. I almost feel like it's just a way to attract people to their disgusting lifestyle
 If you eat rotten meat, you'll get high you may get some sort of rush from the fact that you're doing something
 That's been forbidden by nature
 But I don't think you could actually classify it as a high if you're saying it was a high after two or three minutes of eating it
 I think it's in your head or
 It's similar to that high that endorphin rush which again
 Is it really a high when you eat salsa when you eat really really hot salsa?
 It makes you feel high
 But it's not like you're sitting next to the stoner and the guy's dropping acid and be like dude
 I can see the elves too. You're just faking it
 You're trying to get just eating bell peppers the whole time
 But you want to get in with the cool kids
 But if you want to get illegal high and you want to be the most disgusting person in your neighborhood
 Try raw meat so the very least you can pretend like it does something so bizarre
 Subculture internet fad whatever it is the media could be hyping this up right now
 I did watch a man eat rotten meat
 I did watch a man eat meat that was a year old and if you look at a couple of his other videos
 This guy might be moving into Hans territory. He has a video where he's eating a lump of meat
 That's a year old Hans never did that Hans never did that
 He also has a whole video about how time doesn't exist and he uses as an example
 Proving time does not exist
 The movie back to the future
 So
 I'm gonna be following this guy for a bit. He basically says there is no past. There is no future
 We are hanging out with Jesus right now
 Maybe he is getting high off that meat
 He believes the grass is the seed the blade and the decayed remains all at the same time interesting quantum philosophy
 You kind of lost me when you started talking about back to the future
 I have a lot of bad memories of conspiracy theories connected to back to the future and the fact that while you're explaining this conspiracy theory to me
 Your breath smells like Salmonella
 I'm gonna take a pass on this one, but I will continue to look into them. We might have a new Hans on our hands
 Dean Ryan, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind the anti-vegan movement
 We are headed out to
 Canada
 Cars driving underwater because we are on an island, but eventually we reach America's North Cousin Canada
 We pull up to a research laboratory. We all got on our lab coats
 We walk in in Canada. I found this so fascinating when I saw this the other day in Canada. They recently did this survey
 It was done by Insight's West polling company and I can't remember a survey done recently
 That's given us this kind of breadth of information
 This poll was done very recently between March 31st and April 5th. These questions were all conspiracy questions
 Do UFOs exist?
 53% of Canadians and we're actually gonna I think these would match up pretty much to most places in the Western world
 Do UFOs exist 53% of the population says yes
 18% of them absolutely believe they exist. That's kind of what I expected that one didn't surprise me that much
 But then we look at this
 COVID-19 created in a lab. It's actually been so long since I've even thought about the COVID-19
 Origin conspiracy theories remember like the official story. It was bat soup when's the last time you even heard the term bat soup
 That was the official story. So I was I totally forgot about this stuff COVID-19 created in a lab
 37% of Canadians believe that's possible
 They believe somewhat and 11% totally believe that it was created in a lab and I go that that's interesting 10% of the population
 Believes that any of the JFK conspiracy theories
 33% believe somewhat in the conspiracy theories 9% totally believe them
 So we start to see this the really the biggest conspiracy theory that people believe in is
 UFOs exist
 I think most people when they think about the scope of the universe they go there has to be aliens out there somewhere
 So I think that that's why that has such a high percentage any JFK conspiracy theory whatever it is
 33% but then we start to get into some conspiracy theories
 That are fairly popular that I didn't think would be
 Scientists have found a cure for cancer
 31% of people believe that scientists have found a cure for cancer, but they're not revealing it to make money
 Dude, that is a conspiracy theory
 I have not heard of in a long time that used to be really popular in the 80s and the 90s and
 I also heard it about AIDS that they had a cure for AIDS, but they weren't revealing it
 But Magic Johnson got it. That was the conspiracy theory
 Also, there was a conspiracy theory that he didn't get AIDS in the first place or HIV
 He didn't have HIV in the first place that it was some like
 Way for him they basically some bookie or someone says you owe money say they it was a weird conspiracy theory
 But there was one conspiracy theory that Magic Johnson didn't have HIV in the first place
 The other one was that he got the cure because he's still around. He's doing great HIV is not the death sentence
 It was when I was growing up, which is good
 But that scientists have found a cure for cancer that one is actually they took this poll in 2014 and then they did another one in
 2021 that's dropped 17 points that has almost been cut in half
 Since the last time it was pulled so very very fascinating
 There's a couple other conspiracy theories that took total tanks in the past couple years, but that's one of them
 29% of people somewhat believe
 That humans have been cloned
 That at least one and it's so funny because I joke about like when we talk about all the Hillary Clinton weird stories and
 Obama's a clone Hillary Clinton's a clone Nancy Pelosi's clone doppelganger, whatever I make fun of that
 I 100% believe that a human has been cloned. I don't think it's cloned and then growing to look exactly like
 68 or 78 hour old Hillary Clinton is I don't think we're anywhere near that
 Nor do we want to be why would you want to clone you?
 Make you super old
 But I do believe there's at least one person walking around today who by definition would be a cloned person. I
 100% believe that that technology is there. I would be in that 29%
 I just don't think they're like lifelike
 lookalikes I
 Think that you they have probably taken genetic samples from people and cloned them
 But they would be little little baby Barack Obama little baby Hillary Clinton eating herself
 I think that she's taking a bite out of her arm to like Hillary. We have to grow you a new arm again
 Bigfoot exists
 20% I don't know if that's higher or lower than I thought honestly one in five
 Canadians again this is the poll you have to extrapolate everything and I'm extrapolating this to a lot of the Western world is where well
 But one in five adults believe bigfoot exists
 I live in an area where a lot of people believe bigfoot exists because I live up in kind of the home of bigfoot
 I live up in the Pacific Northwest, but in California. No, I wasn't even interested in bigfoot
 I thought it was kind of lame you wouldn't run into a lot of people who believed in bigfoot
 So overall see that's the thing like I'm around more people now who believe bigfoot exists
 But growing up it was just something goofy it was on the level of the Loch Ness monster and
 They don't ask specifically if Loch Ness monster exists in this poll they ask if oh go go go
 Exists which is the Canadian Loch Ness monster only nine percent of people exist
 And I think you could extrapolate that to say maybe a little bit more maybe
 10% 11% believe Loch Ness monster exists 20% one in five people believe bigfoot exists
 This is what I found bizarre because I had not really heard this conspiracy theory
 I didn't know was a conspiracy theory
 Out of all my years of research. I've my great-grandma. I think believed it to a certain extent
 But I just figured it was my great-grandma being a sore loser
 I and I know people would believe this but I didn't think it was this high or that this was considered a conspiracy theory
 20% of people
 Somewhat and five percent of those absolutely believe the lottery is rigged
 Fascinating I honestly didn't know there was that high of a percentage of people who believed that I
 Know there have been
 Lotteries state lotteries things like that that have been rigged
 I know that crimes have been committed where it's been rigged, but to think one in five of
 Adult Canadians believe that the lottery is rigged. It's the same amount of people who believe in bigfoot
 That's weird to me. I that kind of threw me for a loop. That's actually bigger than
 Stuff like global warming as a hoax the pharmaceutical industry has something to do with cova 19 that it was engineered
 It's twice as big as the cova 19 vaccine has a microchip
 Like that's a huge level conspiracy theory and what I think is so interesting about that is conspiracy theories so often
 You can use to make money. There are whole industries that popped up
 Relatively overnight off of people's fears about cova 19 and the vaccine
 There's whole YouTube channels podcast
 There's stuff you can buy to help suck up the stuff that the vaccine people are shedding all this stuff all this nonsense
 Who's making money off the lottery thing that almost seems like if you guys if you guys have some money and you're looking for
 Something to spend it on I bet you you could honestly get a pretty good following if you started a
 Podcast or YouTube channel that focus specifically on the lottery is rigged
 Because I think that is an empty lane
 I don't think anyone else is doing that all these other
 Conspiracy theories we talked about are very very well populated UFO people. I got a tweet today on my phone
 Did you know UFO disclosures happening tomorrow? I mean it's non-stop. It's non-stop
 But the lottery thing I don't think anyone is pushing that conspiracy theory
 9/11 the 9/11 was a conspiracy set in fourth by the United States government
 And this is in Canada that they're doing this it may be a little higher in the United States
 17% that's a still a huge amount that is almost one in five Canadians believe that 9/11 was an inside job
 But that actually dropped 12% from 2014 so that's also taken a sizable hit in
 The last six seven years people have gone. Maybe that's not accurate. So that's another one that's on its way out
 That one in the scientists the cure for cancer those ones are going to be much smaller
 Conspiracy theories cross the political boundary. It does not matter what side of the political spectrum is on it
 Honestly does not matter what your education level is it doesn't matter what your religious background is a lot of people think it's a bunch of yokels a
 Bunch of like fundamentalist yokels up in the woods who believe this stuff about 5g and COVID it cuts across all barriers
 It's just different conspiracy theories different groups believe in different conspiracy theories
 And the general consensus is that more men believe in conspiracy theories than women that can be correct
 That can be correct what this poll realized was that does happen for
 Specific conspiracy theories there are two conspiracies in this list that more women believe in than men
 One that the Princess Diana car accident
 Was not an accident. It was either an assassination or there was something else going on
 It wasn't an accident more women believe that than men and
 The lottery is red
 By a wide margin of 23% of women believe that versus 16% of men
 So fascinating we I hope you guys enjoyed this. I hope I didn't bore you with these numbers. I find this stuff absolutely
 Fun to talk about because it's these raw numbers. We don't really get to see this much stuff
 We live in a realm of paranormal. I'm all it's so funny because I'm
 Whenever I meet someone and they're like, I don't believe in ghosts or any of that stuff
 It always takes me a back because I spend so much time in this sphere
 I'm just spending time in this pair of dimensional sphere. I'm rolling through the city
 It's been so much time in this world and I know that people don't believe in UFOs. I know people don't believe in ghosts
 I guess when I'm saying when I meet people who don't believe in anything
 Any of it because some people don't believe in ghosts, but they're like, oh, yeah, UFOs are real or they don't believe in ghosts
 You're your foes, but they'll be like, oh, no, I swear I saw bigfoot ones
 But I'll run into people who don't believe in anything and it's always odd to me
 It's always weird to me. So it's nice to look at these numbers and see
 How how they break down how they break down and to see that some of the conspiracy theories like the coven 19 5g internet connection
 That is only 6% of people believe that we have nothing to compare it against in 2014 because it didn't exist
 But oh 6% of people believe in that which is still a sizable amount when you're talking about, you know
 Nations of millions and millions of people but like the UFOs I could see it being a 50/50 split
 So I hope you guys enjoyed that. I really had a lot of fun reading that to you
 It's nice to see the total picture of
 Paranormal belief, but we've done enough number crunching with these nerds and then now we're all ripping up their notes
 I'm like, sir, we need that for the next day. We're like get out of our way retired being nerds are messing all this stuff up
 We retired of learning stuff. It's time to go investigate a real life
 UFO abduction. We don't need no numbers for this Dean Ryan
 I'm gonna toss you the keys of that carbonicopter you go ahead and signal that bad boy to land we're leaving behind egghead central
 We're headed out to
 Australia
 I
 Got most of this information from a website called howan wise.com. We've actually been to this website a lot
 And I wanted to give him a shout out. They actually did a really good write up on this story
 I had some other sources as well, but that's a great website. You guys should check it out Dean Ryan
 We're headed to Australia specifically. We're headed to gun dia. That's in Queensland, Australia. It's 9 30 p.m
 October 4th
 2001 longtime listeners of the show know that is my birthday
 Not 2001 that would make me 20 years old. I was 25 when this story took place
 I was 25 years old we're in gun dia
 we're actually at a
 Construction site a site where they're about to build a winery known as whispering winds
 Now there's a little house a little structure there where we have Keith Rylance 39
 Amy Rylance his 22 year old wife and their business partner Petra Heller who's 35
 And what's great about this story is they have gone on video talking about this. We have names
 We have specific dates. We have faces. This is a very very verifiable story at least from their point of view a lot of times
 On this show and just paranormal stuff in general like yesterday's episode all the alleged hauntings at the university
 It's nice to actually have names and faces and proof that people are coming forward and telling these stories
 But this night October 4th
 2001
 Keith has already called it a night. He's already gone to bed pretty early Petra is in her room and
 Amy is in the living room. She's up watching television. The rooms are fairly connected
 So it's not like this sprawling house something happens in one room. You're gonna be able to hear it in the next a
 Huge storm rolls into the area
 Amy's still just watching television. She's watching the storm channel. She's like whoa surround sound. It's amazing
 But by 1115 she is also dozed off so everyone in the house is asleep
 The storm is gliding over the Australian landscape and then all of a sudden it's something wakes Petra up
 It's 1115 she's the only one awake now
 She's walking through the house and she gets into the living room and that's when she sees a
 rectangular beam of light shining in from outside the house
 In the middle of this beam of light is Amy. It's like the light is aimed directly at her and
 It takes Petra a second to realize what's going on here. Amy is in the beam of light, but she's no longer laying on the couch
 She's hovering off of it
 Petra is terrified. She's speechless as Amy is floating through the rectangle of light
 she then
 Flies out the window and as she's going out the window the window was opened at this point
 But the window screen was still there. She actually pushed through the window screen and tore open as she flew through it
 Petra faints at this site. She can't even really get anything out. She faints and almost immediately comes to and
 Begins screaming
 This is when Keith wakes up and he runs out in the living room and Petra is screaming
 She can't get a word out. She can't even comprehend what she just saw
 All Keith knows is there's woman. It's on the ground screaming. There's a rainstorm outside
 His wife is gone and the window has a huge tear in it
 So he goes to run outside to see what had happened your first instinct would be kidnapping
 Second instinct wild boar you're in the house back after all kangaroo mob. Who knows?
 As he goes to run outside Petra starts saying don't go out there. Don't go out there
 They got her they got her which of course is going to make him even more want to go out there
 She tries to convince him of what happened that she got sucked up in this beam of light Keith does not believe her
 He runs out. He begins running through the wilderness around the house calling out for his wife's name. No answer
 He goes back in and Petra again is pleading with him what I saw you got to believe me what I saw
 She was abducted at this bright light came in she floated out the window Keith still can't believe it
 But in the back of his mind, he's trying to figure out like what could it have been? Where could she have gone?
 They call the authorities
 They call the police at 1140 so it's about 25 minutes later. They make the phone call now because it's Australia
 It takes them until 1 a.m. To get there because there's a police station down the road
 There's a police station maybe in the nearest town might even be the town past that
 Keith is still out looking for her and as time goes on he starts to believe that maybe Petra is telling the truth
 Because what else could it have been? The police show up and they you have to imagine they were extremely suspicious of what's going on
 Young woman goes missing man with his female business partner are there
 Female business partner is saying she was abducted by aliens the man kind of seems to be going along with it
 The cops are probably thinking like did they murder her is this some sort of weird cover story? Is this the worst alibi ever?
 Police are kind of searching the area around the house as well
 Ring ring
 Their phone starts ringing Keith answers it and there's a woman on the phone
 And she goes
 Is this the home of Amy Rylance?
 Keith is like yeah
 The woman goes she's safe
 She's safe. She's here
 Where's here?
 Where's here Keith asks?
 So this is what the second side of this story is
 500 miles away. It's an eight-hour drive. There's a town called Mackay
 It's it's around 1 a.m. And a young woman comes stumbling out of the wilderness headed towards a gas station
 She's disheveled
 She's dehydrated. She's barely coherent. She stumbles into the gas station
 She's not really making any sense. They can tell that she's in distress. They give her some water. They charge you for it
 They're like you have money on you right? She's like oh
 They give her some water and there's a woman there who was gasping her car up. She actually says
 I think this woman needs to go to the hospital
 So her and her friend who was traveling with her they put the young woman in the car
 They can't figure out who it is. She can't really say what her name is
 They drive her to a local hospital and at that point when they get to the hospital, she's getting more fluid in her
 She's becoming a little more lucid and apparently the woman who took her down there was going through her personal items
 found her
 Certification was able to get the phone number of her husband so on and so forth and that is how she's placed in this phone call
 McKay is
 500 miles away from where she was abducted. It's an eight-hour drive
 But remember she was abducted at 1115 and now we're sitting a little bit past 1 a.m
 How did she get so far away?
 Now if you believe in UFOs we know how she got so far away
 But the detectives are trying to figure this out the detectives
 Don't really believe the story and if we've talked about this before on the show
 There is a totally different view of aliens today than there was when I was growing up from the 60s until the early
 2000s really it was a huge joke if you watch and I'll be in the show notes. There's
 The news segment about this story in Australia and when they're interviewing one of the detectives when they're interviewing
 Detective senior sergeant leaf Lindsey. He's laughing on camera at these people
 He's laughing at them
 Because it was a big joke for the longest time. It was a big joke now people take it a little bit seriously
 But it's he doesn't seem to believe this story and that's fine, but he's like oh my god
 I'm so sorry. I'm giggling and he's like trying to keep a straight face and he starts laughing again
 He's like oh my goodness is this on is the camera on and it's super disrespectful
 But he's openly mocking these people in their story
 So the cops don't believe it, but they can't really figure it out. They actually are investigating
 When they start looking at the story they go with the idea that this was staged and they begin asking people
 In the town of McKay if she was seen before this happened if she was actually waiting there for the signal
 But if you believe in UFOs
 This is the story she tells she's on the couch. She's watching television. She doesn't fall asleep
 She's just sitting there on the couch
 Watching TV and then all of a sudden she's standing on a metal bench in a room full of lights
 She immediately knows she is someplace other than where she should be and
 The fear sets in
 That's when she hears a male voice say don't be afraid
 We're not gonna hurt you. Please be calm and
 Then a door
 Opens up a six foot tall man
 Wearing a suit that covers him literally head to toe
 There are some drawings with the story
 It almost seemed like a full biohazard suit and the person wore a black mask underneath it to cover like their mouth and nose
 So definitely humanoid, but they were covered in in a giant suit
 She could see his eyes, but she couldn't see his mouth or his nose. He comes out and
 Some sort of procedure was done
 She doesn't remember what was done when they did pick her up from the hospital and they do show this in the video as well
 She has these small triangle marks on her thighs and on her
 Heels on the bottom of her feet and the reporter asks what happened and she goes I don't remember
 I think they were just taking some sort of skin samples
 But she says she was standing on the bench the guy entered something happened
 She doesn't recall and then she said that the man said he was going to drop her off
 Not far from where they picked her up
 and
 The next thing she knows she's walking through the bushes in the middle of nowhere and she sees the lights of a gas station off in the distance
 And she finally gets there and basically collapses and is brought to the hospital
 They do end up calling some local UFO researchers
 They come out start interviewing them and then the trio of them Petra Keith and Amy disappear not mysteriously disappeared
 They just stopped returning phone calls. They couldn't be they didn't want to go back to that house
 They told the UFO researchers that they believed a car tried running them off the road
 They believed that possibly the men in black were after them. They didn't feel comfortable telling their story anymore an
 Interesting detail to note as well
 When she is reunited with the people who know her they noticed a couple things one she recently dyed her hair
 But her roots were showing much more than they should be in that amount of time that had passed
 She dyed her hair a week ago her roots shouldn't be showing that early
 And that could just be a bad job right though. She might need to get her money back
 But it was also her legs. She normally shaved her legs
 Her legs had several days worth of hair growth on them
 So that's another outside factor now to the cops
 They just go well, she's just not shaving her legs
 It's a
 Interesting hoax that they're trying to pull off and that was kind of the way the cops are going with it
 But was she
 This is what I find absolutely fascinating
 We talk about lost time, but technically should be able to work both ways if you have vegan
 You have to have anti-vegan if you can exist in our timeline if you can disappear
 For an hour and then be dropped back off into you. It seems like a minute, but really an hour has passed
 It could work in reverse where you are gone for three hours. You are measurably gone for three hours
 But where you're at four eight ten days go by and
 I think we'll wrap it up like this. I think the story is an interesting clue
 to
 other phenomenon
 Stuff like missing people even stuff like missing 411
 Because you have people being abducted and then dropped off quote-unquote nearby
 To a starship
 500 miles is nothing right something that's built to cross the galaxy
 500 miles is nothing
 To us five feet is nothing, but to an aunt that's its whole day. It's like damn it
 You gotta get the sugars way over there
 So to the alien who picked her up and dropped her off that could have simply been nothing
 500 miles it's eight-hour trip
 Just get on your eye on teleporter and you'll be fine
 It'd be interesting to think like these people who mysteriously go missing they walk into the backyard they disappear
 They're walking through the woods. They walk me on a shrub. They disappear. Maybe they aren't missing forever. They're just deposited in a place
 So far away
 No one thinks to look for them there and even then they didn't drop her off the gas station
 They dropped her off in the wilderness near the gas station if it had been a young child or someone who was drunk
 Someone who was frail
 They would have just died in the wilderness
 She could have ended up going the wrong direction and in her dehydrated confused state instead of walking towards the well-lit
 Gas station. What if she had walked in the opposite direction? She'd be bleached bones in the Australian wilderness
 And Petra and Keith would probably be on trial for murder
 It could even happen to you tonight
 As you're falling to sleep hoping to find some peace some comfort in your dreams
 You close your eyes
 And then you open them
 You're no longer in your bedroom
 You don't remember how you got here
 Your limbs are trembling you can barely stand up
 Your thoughts are racing your throat is dry
 Your skin feels singed and sore a
 Memory comes back a
 Kindly alien telling you to just be calm everything will be okay
 And you did what they said
 You work home
 You didn't panic is the laser scalpel singed to your skin
 You did what they said you did everything that they said
 But you can't understand why you're here now
 You're crawling on all fours across the mossy forest floor
 it seems
 Devoid of all wildlife almost as if the beasts of the forest were scared away by whatever deposited you here
 As you crawl across the forest floor
 You hope you're crawling in the right direction
 You hope you will find civilization
 But you won't
 You will just be another missing person
 Seriously vanished from their own home
 Did they run away?
 Were they kidnapped where they murdered these are questions people always ask when your name is brought up
 But they won't ever think to look a thousand miles away at that soft lump of vegetation
 Underneath that oak tree that vaguely makes out the shape of
 you
