1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 A tiny hole leads the way to a massive underground man-made chamber.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,840
 And then we take a look at the story of Luz, a woman who said that one day she woke up in another reality.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,240
 Is it possible to willingly or unwillingly

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,440
 jump dimensions today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,400
 [Music]

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,280
 Garbender. I'm having a great day. I hope you are having a great day too.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,320
 So let's go ahead and get started here. Now, the first story was a request that I had actually

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,720
 lost in the shuffle and I was looking for something else on YouTube. I was looking through my comments

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,960
 and I found this one and I thought this is an interesting story. However, I got stymied a

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,080
 couple different times. This is a request from Ramro on YouTube. And Ramro sent me information

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,360
 on something known as "It's in another country." So you know where this is gonna go? It's in the

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:10,320
 Cabardino Bacaria Republic. The Carbino Bacaria Republic. And what's there? So it's by the

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,280
 the Caucas Mountains, the Caucasic Mountains. Sorry guys. It's in this area and there's this tiny

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
 little hole that you have to be relatively slim to be able to slide through. I wouldn't be able to

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,480
 make it in there. But people had and it's completely obscured simply by the landscape. There's not like

17
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,560
 a holographic door covering it up. It doesn't look like there's a giant boulder there. It's just like

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,120
 a field and then there's a hole. And down in this hole is basically an 800 meter deep megalith.

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,720
 It's a massive building under the ground. And you'd think, "Okay, well is it just like a straight

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,960
 drop and then like an opening like a natural system?" And the people who have been there say no.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,200
 You actually have to go down a bit and then turn, crawl left for a bit, and then go down.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,800
 Eventually you hit this massive rectangular chamber and the walls are smooth and it appears

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,400
 to be man-made. Now there's a couple different problems going on here. One, every article I found

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,480
 on this was translated from another language. And it's not like I was running a translator on it.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,920
 It would appear to be written in English, but you could tell from the numerous grammatical mistakes

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,840
 and that's I'm not insulting them, but you could tell from the simple grammatical mistakes

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
 that English wasn't their native language. It looks like at some point someone tried writing it

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,200
 in English or they ran it through translator and posted it online. So there's not a lot. Reading

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,560
 these articles was very maddening because I was coming across terms and a lot of weird grammar

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,800
 errors that had, I had a hard time following this. And even the YouTube videos about it,

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,240
 they're from someone who's speaking with an Eastern European accent. So it's a very, very

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,640
 unknown place. And so there's a lot of dispute about it. Some people say, some, one of the theories

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,600
 is that it's one of the places that Hitler was looking for the Holy Grail. It is a man-made

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,200
 place to hide the artifact, the cup that Jesus drank out of, and Hitler believed with the Holy

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,560
 Grail and the spirit of destiny he could control the world. That's the conspiracy theory. Locals

36
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,400
 say that's absolutely not true. That's absolutely not true. Now, they'll say that, yes, there were

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,680
 Nazi troops in the area, but they weren't specifically looking for that place. There's the

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,680
 theory that the Russians built it as a base. They somehow carved out all this stone underground

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,520
 and built this huge underground base that only a few people could wiggle in and out of. So that

40
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,280
 theory's kind of weird, but it would be a perfect hiding spot. With the technology back then,

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
 you wouldn't be able to bomb it because it's so deep underground. And then we go back to another

42
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,080
 conspiracy theory that this place is a thousand, if not more, years old, and the underground construction

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,840
 itself is modeled after the construction of the pyramids. So a lot of different theories about

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,600
 what's going on here. And again, thanks, Ramrow, for pointing this out to me. I had never heard of it.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,680
 I don't think most English speakers have ever heard of it. I don't think most people outside of that

46
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,480
 region have really ever heard of it. But it's not just all speculation. It's not like we think,

47
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,240
 we used remote viewing and we went down the tunnel. No, there's lots of photos of people

48
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,520
 climbing down there with their rigs. You can see how smooth the walls are. Lots of drawings of what

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,120
 it looks like inside, but you know, drawings can be faked, but there's lots of photos can be faked

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,520
 too. But you know what I mean? There's a lot of photo of teams going down there. But that's it

51
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:29,280
 for a 800 meter underground megalith complex that really anyone can visit if you're the right

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,160
 body type. You're a tiny little guy. You can squeeze on in there. And that's it though. We don't

53
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,840
 have any archaeologists going out there. There seems to be a bit of a problem with archaeologists

54
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
 saying, no, no, no, culture wasn't that advanced in that area. Therefore, they couldn't have done

55
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,880
 that. Therefore, it's not worth my time to go out there. But even then, you think archaeologists in

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
 the area would be visiting it. And maybe they are, and the articles just aren't in English.

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,320
 So it's kind of weird. And I've run into that a couple times. I've run into,

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,120
 did aliens cause the Black Plague? That is a conspiracy theory that's almost always

59
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
 in Italian. Not many English resources on that either. So I'm sure there's more of them out

60
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,920
 there. And you know, I'm going to go ahead and jump into another story. I didn't announce in

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,520
 the beginning, but I think it's kind of an interesting story on how two people can view

62
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,200
 things differently, especially when it comes to the paranormal. I've been having a hard time

63
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,440
 waking up recently. And technically, I've always had a hard time waking up. At one point, when I

64
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,120
 was in college, I took a regular alarm clock radio and wired in a house speaker to it. So it was

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
 super loud. It just like, "Baaah!" And it would wake me up. And I was like, "Oh, I would just get

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,200
 up and go about my day." Anyone else who was over would totally freak out because I'd forget to

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,160
 tell them the alarm clock sounds like a house speaker. But even recently, I've been having a

68
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
 really hard time waking up more so than normal. I've been sleeping through my alarm clocks. And

69
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,720
 I'd wake up and it would, I would see that my alarm clock was shut off. So what was happening is

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,760
 I'd wake up, my alarm clock would be going, and I would shut it off, crawl back into my bed,

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,720
 and fall asleep. Now, I don't remember ever doing that, but I set two alarm clocks on my phone,

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,360
 and I just would never wake me up. Recently, recently it's been really bad. So I was like,

73
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
 "Maybe my phone's not working." I go out and buy an alarm clock radio, brand new alarm clock radio,

74
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,720
 take it home. It has never once woken me up. Every morning I wake up, the alarm is shut off.

75
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,160
 Now, obviously, because I've talked about my haunted apartment, in the way, way, way, way,

76
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,800
 back behind of my head, I go, "Maybe there's a ghost doing it." But I immediately dismiss that,

77
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,840
 and I think it has to be a technological issue, or I'm simply waking up, shutting the alarm clock

78
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
 off, because I always put my alarm clocks far away, so I actually have to get up out of bed to

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,480
 shut it off. I never put it in an arm's reach. There's the rational explanation, technological

80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,720
 issue. Or I'm waking up, I'm shutting it off, crawling back into bed. And so I've been setting

81
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,800
 basically four alarm clocks recently, two on one phone, one on another phone, and then two on my

82
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,200
 alarm clock. So what is that? Five? Is that what I said? I've been setting five alarm clocks recently,

83
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,360
 and I'm getting up now. But I've noticed that my brand new alarm clock still has never woken me up.

84
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,200
 So I'm going to return the alarm clock, and I totally scratched the whole thing off

85
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,920
 to me sleeping through stuff. My friend, on the other hand, texted me the other day and said she

86
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,960
 woke up with sand in her hair, and said, "I don't know what happened." And she starts kind of giving

87
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,480
 these theories about like, was it a ghost? Did she like go somewhere in the middle of the night?

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,560
 Like somewhere like mystical, like disappear out of her bed? Was it the sand man? Was it leprechauns?

89
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,320
 Now obviously sand man and leprechauns were more joking. But she perceived waking up with sand,

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,080
 which is bizarre. Don't get me wrong, it is bizarre to wake up with sand in your hair.

91
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,600
 But she immediately jumps towards the paranormal. My first thing was she had spent the night in

92
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,240
 my house previous, and I said, "Are you sure you didn't get it from my bed?" Because my bed can

93
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,400
 be quite messy. Now, some people can have messy beds where like their bed's not made. My bed

94
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,440
 may or may not have sand in it at any given time. I can make no guarantees if you come over,

95
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:07,600
 you will not pick up sand or grass or not crabs like the sex disease, but some sort of seahorses,

96
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,440
 I guess is a better example. There's no guarantee what is going to be found in my bed,

97
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,920
 but no crabs. There are no crabs. So she immediately leapt to a paranormal answer of why

98
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,160
 there was sand in her hair. And I have problems over and over again with my alarm clocks and

99
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,080
 immediately leap to the idea that it's a technological issue. It's interesting because I

100
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,920
 think that that does a lot to how we see the world, to how we view things in the world.

101
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,880
 And that actually is a good segue to our last story. Now our last story, we're going to be talking

102
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,640
 about a phenomenon or mental delusion, pick your poison, called dimensional jumping. There's been

103
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,120
 a lot of talk about alternate realities lately. There's been a lot of talk about alternate realities

104
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,520
 for a long time, but it seems to become a more and more popular theory every day, in this reality,

105
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,840
 at least. And a lot of times they hang their hat on things like quantum reality and they're like,

106
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,840
 "Well, you know, there's like 12 dimensions and there's multiple dimensions." And scientists said

107
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,640
 there's... But generally when science is talking about multiple dimensions, they're not necessarily

108
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,120
 talking about alternate realities. They're talking about dimensions that gravity is stronger in and

109
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,960
 things like that. But a lot of times you're just taking little bits and pieces out of these scientific

110
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,120
 headlines and making you think that magic is real. Now there may be alternate dimensions out there.

111
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,880
 And there's a group of people who are determined to jump between dimensions, be able to move from

112
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,240
 one to the other. And most of the time it's because they're not satisfied with their life in this

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,600
 dimension. There's a whole subreddit called dimension jumping that gives you all sorts of

114
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,720
 tricks and tools and personal experiences of jumping from one reality to the next. Now you think,

115
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,240
 "What? Is it some sort of device? Is it some sort of portal you build? Is it some sort of black

116
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,120
 magic?" Actually no. They have ways to change your life for the better. One, you take two cups and

117
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,920
 we've learned from experience that any ritual, any invention that involves two cups, it's gotta be

118
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,480
 gold. It's got to be gold. So you take two cups and you put water in both of them and you label

119
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
 them. Or you can label them before the water's in. I don't really think it matters, but you label

120
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,400
 the cups. And in one cup you put where you're at today and on the other cup you write down what you

121
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,080
 want. The reality you want to jump into. So I guess I should explain this first too. The idea is that

122
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,320
 there's millions of versions of you and you want to go into the reality where you're better than

123
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,400
 you are now. So it's really kind of a downer philosophy. It's basically saying that you suck now,

124
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,960
 but there's a bunch of other versions of you that are way better. You're in the sucky universe.

125
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,400
 They got it good. So in one cup, let's say for example, I would put "Pour, my job sucks." And on

126
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,920
 the other cup I would put "Multimillionaire, married to Scarlett Johansson." So I'm going to

127
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,400
 take these two cups and I'm going to concentrate on them for an indeterminate amount of time. I'm

128
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,360
 going to look at the cup where I'm at right now and I'm like, "Man, I am poor and my job does suck."

129
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,400
 And then I look at the other cup and I'm like, "I want to be a millionaire married to Scarlett

130
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,800
 Johansson. Oh, that would be so sweet. Her nice, curvy body. That perfect face. Actually, have you

131
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,240
 ever seen a picture of her without her makeup on? It's weird. She doesn't look anything like

132
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,160
 Scarlett Johansson at all. There's something still very, very attractive about her, even though she

133
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,640
 looks like she could pump your gas at a gas. She looks super, super normal. She doesn't look like

134
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,720
 a bombshell starlet anymore. Any woman can look like Scarlett Johansson with a $10,000 makeup team

135
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,240
 behind her. That's the key. I always use Scarlett Johansson as a model, but I mean, it's mostly

136
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,560
 movie magic, but she does seem like a sweet person overall. But anyway, so I'm sure she can take care

137
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,680
 of me. We have these two cups. We have the Scarlett Johansson cup and we have the "My job,

138
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,520
 my life sucks" cup. You concentrate on them and then you pour the Scarlett Johansson cup into

139
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,400
 your cup of "How much your life sucks?" and then you drink it. Magic. Now you can jump into the

140
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,480
 dimension where you're married to Scarlett Johansson. Now you think that's foolish, Jason. That's so

141
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,760
 stupid that would never work in a million years. And you're right. It absolutely would not work.

142
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,240
 But there's a hidden component to it and we'll get to it in a second. Now I actually found someone

143
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,240
 on the dimension jumping reddit who did this, who did this and had success. They jumped into

144
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
 another alternate universe. And the reason why they know they jumped into an alternate universe

145
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,800
 is because they went to their local target a few days later and an aisle had changed location.

146
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,600
 That's straight up Twilight Zone stuff. It's not like retail establishments normally move their

147
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,080
 goods around for better placement or because they don't have a certain room for it in an aisle,

148
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,520
 they move. It's not like retail stores ever change the geography. And to be fair, even he says,

149
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,640
 "I don't know. I could have just forgotten where was that normally." Then don't use that as your

150
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,720
 proof that you might have jumped dimensions. The dimensional jumpers on reddit specifically,

151
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,720
 they look for tiny changes. The reddit page actually has a number attached to it. And this

152
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,280
 is the number in this universe. I think right now it's like 962 or 982 or something like that.

153
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,160
 So if you jumped into another universe, you could go to that reddit and see if the number is the

154
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,600
 same. If all of a sudden that number is 749, you know you've jumped into an alternate reality

155
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,120
 where they chose that number. Now the obvious problem with that is that what's to say that

156
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,320
 if you did successfully jump into another reality that they didn't choose out of the millions of

157
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,520
 numbers out there that you jumped into reality that everything was different but that subreddit

158
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,600
 number was the same. It's very, very likely when you're talking about infinity. That number would

159
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,640
 be repeated billions of times. But anyways, they have that number in case you get lost,

160
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,760
 you can go, "Oh, I am in an alternate reality." And really also that's an easy thing to fake. Anyone

161
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,080
 in who's in control of that subreddit can change that just to be a troll, but that's one of the

162
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,920
 techniques you can use is the two-cut method. The other one is staring in the mirror. That's it.

163
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,640
 You stare in the mirror and you imagine the better you. You go, "My life sucks. I imagine the better

164
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,840
 you." Now there's an example to this and I'm not making fun of the circumstance this guy was in

165
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,360
 because it's not particularly funny, but the consequence is absolutely bizarre. So there is

166
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,480
 this guy who came up with the idea of mirror jumping and he said that when he was a kid,

167
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,040
 his dad used to beat him up all the time. And he would go and hide in the closet and somehow this

168
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,680
 is where the so that is absolutely tragic. Then he tells the story though that he goes and he hides

169
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,680
 in his closet and on the inside of his closet is a mirror. If you ever want a Bloody Mary or any

170
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,880
 mirror demon to hide in your closet, put a mirror in there. Who wants a mirror that most of the time

171
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,000
 is just an eternal darkness? That's terrifying. But anyways, he says that he hides in his closet.

172
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,760
 There's a mirror on the inside of his closet. I'm assuming the closet door and he would stare at

173
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,960
 the mirror and he would imagine his life where his dad wasn't a total raging douchebag. And he

174
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,280
 said one day he was staring in the mirror and he's watching, he's seeing his reflection and he's

175
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,560
 imagining that there's a world where his dad doesn't beat him all the time. And he could hear

176
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,800
 his dad coming to the closet door and he goes right before he got to the door. I saw him open

177
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,200
 the door through the mirror. So now he basically shifted. So now he's looking at his reflection,

178
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,160
 but then all of a sudden he jumps to another reality and in the reflection he sees himself

179
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,400
 dragged off by his violent father and he's safe in the closet. And then when he gets out of the

180
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,280
 closet he goes downstairs and his dad's the most loving person ever and they had a great

181
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,400
 relationship until his father eventually passed away. And so he was like, "I did. I jumped dimensions.

182
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:11,600
 It can work for you too, guys." The obvious problem with that is now there was an alternate version

183
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,360
 of him who grew up with a loving father who one day was just sitting there and then all of a sudden

184
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,840
 his dad just started beating the crap out of him and he never knew why. So that almost seems

185
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,920
 extraordinarily cruel. If there's a better you out, because you have to switch places. If there's a

186
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,360
 better you out there, the idea of you thrusting them into the world that the kid obviously was

187
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,960
 in a world where he didn't create. But let's say that I'm in a reality and let's say in this reality

188
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,080
 all I want to do is eat Taco Bell all day long. I eat Taco Bell. I play video games. I never move

189
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,080
 off the couch. I never do anything with my life. And when I'm 52 I say, "You know what? I want to run

190
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,520
 a marathon." And in another reality a guy is running a marathon. He has a wife. He has kids. He's

191
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,840
 super fit. His heart is good. He's never even been in a Taco Bell. His diarrhea level is zero.

192
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:12,560
 And he's running the marathon and then all of a sudden you're in his body and there's this

193
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,320
 super fit dude who just magically appears on a couch and then has to immediately run to the toilet

194
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,320
 because he notices Taco Bell wrappers everywhere. And you've put him in that dimension. That dimension

195
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:32,320
 you created for the rest of his very short life. So I mean obviously that's not good. You're basically

196
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,440
 punishing yourself and technically the guy who teleported to the universe where he's running

197
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,680
 the marathon. He wins the marathon. Guess where he stops to celebrate? Taco Bell. So it's a never

198
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:51,040
 ending cycle. Eventually the guy that you put in your body, in the loser body, he finally gets

199
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,680
 over diarrhea. Takes him about four or five days, stops eating the Taco Bell, goes out for a run,

200
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:01,200
 loses a bunch of weight, gets his life back together again and then when he's on his honeymoon with

201
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,360
 his wife you switch back because you've ruined his old body. And it's your body. You're punishing

202
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,760
 yourself or other versions of yourself. The weird thing is this, is that I think what a lot of this

203
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:24,560
 comes down to is creative visualization, like the power of the secrets and things like that, mixed

204
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:33,360
 with self-jealousy. It's this idea that you're jealous of who you could have been. So you almost

205
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,560
 want to wreck their life and take it without any of the work. Now again, the child abuse thing,

206
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,680
 I totally understand that. And I guess I should say right now, I don't think any of this is real.

207
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,720
 I don't think any of this is real, but it could be and we'll get into one final example of the

208
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,960
 ending of someone unwillingly doing this. But this, it's almost a bit of like self-hatred.

209
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,680
 I think the best way to go about life is to imagine yourself as the best you and maybe you

210
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,880
 want to be more rich, maybe you want to be more famous, maybe you do want to get married to

211
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
 Scarlett Johansson or any other beautiful Hollywood starlet. But you should still imagine

212
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,680
 yourself as the best you out there. Because if you imagine yourself as the best you out there,

213
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,440
 you will become the best you out there. I honestly believe if this stuff's real,

214
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
 people would try to jump into my reality. I had a friend over the other night, the girl with the

215
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
 sand in her hair, and I was telling her, I go, you look at this apartment and you're like,

216
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,080
 this apartment's small and it's cluttered and all that. Some people might use the word messy, but

217
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,480
 it's cluttered. I go, to me, this place is a mansion. To me, this place is exactly where I

218
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,200
 want to be. I love this place. I come home and I think of this place as a mansion. And that informs

219
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,680
 every other decision I'm making. A messy mansion, sure, but a mansion nonetheless. I feel like I'm

220
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,680
 in the best reality and I think that's the best thing that people can do. Obviously, if you're

221
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,520
 in the Sudan and you're being hunted by some horrible militia group, that's a little difficult.

222
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:08,000
 But I don't think anyone would look at my life and say, you got it made, man. No one's doing that,

223
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 but me. And so when I come home, I'm not dismal. I can see people coming home to a place like this

224
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,640
 and being like, ugh. And it helps nobody. Helps nobody at all, especially doesn't help you.

225
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,040
 So I could have the crappiest job in the world and I'm like, dude, yeah, this is awesome. I'll

226
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,440
 find something good about it. Maybe not the crappiest job in the world. Maybe not working

227
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,720
 a Taco Bell. But the thing is, is that if it was, if it was the crappiest job in the world,

228
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,280
 I would immediately, I would work it just as long as I had to before I can move on and better

229
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,240
 myself, even if bettering myself is simply stepping up to working at Dairy Queen or something like

230
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,720
 that. Moving up the fast food chain. You're the best you. You got to have that in your head. And

231
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,560
 that's where I think the creative visualization comes from. You got to stem that jealousy of

232
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,800
 yourself being better. Really, it plays into this. I know I'm kind of preaching right now,

233
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,160
 but it plays into this idea that you know you're supposed to be better than you are.

234
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,240
 That's why you want to jump dimensions in the first place. But if you believe you're the best

235
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,960
 you can be, even though your situation may not be ideal, maybe it's not what you see in television

236
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,920
 or magazines, maybe it's not even how your friends live their lives. If you truly believe that you

237
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,640
 are the best version of you, you can still use those powers of creative visualization.

238
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,400
 And believing something contrary to what you actually see, which is actually considered

239
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,440
 probably one of the greatest mental tricks you can do. If you're going to look at something and

240
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,880
 believe the exact opposite, you have truly mastered your mind. And if you've mastered your mind,

241
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,480
 you can master reality. I believe that. I absolutely believe that. But let's talk about Luz.

242
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,600
 Now, there was a threat, there was a not, we're moving away from Reddit, thankfully,

243
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,320
 we're moving far away from Reddit. And we're going to a website where someone wrote an article about

244
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,000
 something similar to this about dimension jumping and how reality is based on where you're at. And

245
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,560
 there could be many versions of you out there and things like that. Spanish website that was

246
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,920
 translated to English. And it's very odd. Some people have said that this is a troll. And it very

247
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,760
 well could be. But if it's a troll, it's an interesting spot. Because if you go to this article

248
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,520
 about dimensional jumping in Spanish, maybe about 20 comments in, it's not even in the article,

249
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:32,080
 you go 20 comments in, there is a person who is asking for help. She goes by the username Luz,

250
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,240
 or Luz. And she's been named as someone called Lorena Garcia Gordo. And what happened is one day

251
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,600
 she woke up and there were different bedsheets on her bed. She could have figured out. She wakes up,

252
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,520
 it's a normal morning, her alarm clocks work, and her bedsheets are different. So that's weird.

253
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,960
 But she doesn't really think much of it. Like it's a little concerning to her, but she doesn't

254
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,760
 think so much of it. She does her normal procedure to get ready for work. She gets dressed, she goes out,

255
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,080
 and her car is in a different location than where she parked it. And she's like, now that's really

256
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,720
 weird. Because she had started dating this guy. She had broke up with her old boyfriend. She started

257
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,240
 dating this new guy and he parked his car in one spot and she parked her car in the other.

258
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,680
 But his car was gone and her car was in his spot. And she's like, again, like, what is going on?

259
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,840
 Maybe someone moved it, maybe my boyfriend moved it somewhere. She drives her car, she goes to work.

260
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,680
 She goes to her office and there's another name on the office door. At this point she's getting

261
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,360
 really, really nervous. She goes and she checks the directory of where she should be, like the

262
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,120
 employee directory. She has an office on another floor working for a boss she's never actually

263
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,520
 even met, a completely other division. At that point she says, you know, guys, I'm not feeling good.

264
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,240
 I'm going to go home. And they're like, okay, you sure? You sure you need to go see someone?

265
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
 Because they could tell she was distressed and she's like, no, no, no, no, I just need to go home.

266
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,000
 She goes home and calls her boyfriend. This happened, I think, about 2011, if I remember

267
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,520
 correctly. She goes and she goes home, she calls her boyfriend. No answer. Her boyfriend lived in

268
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,480
 the same apartment complex. He doesn't live there anymore. As far as she can tell, he never existed

269
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
 at all. She's still with her old boyfriend who she had broken up with months before. He acts like

270
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,880
 nothing had changed at all. He has no idea what she's talking about. She even said she hired a

271
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,000
 private investigator to find her new now missing boyfriend. Nothing, they could find no trace of

272
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,400
 this guy. And she ends it by pleading for help. I don't know if anyone else has ever gone through

273
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,760
 this. I didn't know how to reach out to anybody. If you know what happened to me, please let me know.

274
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,640
 That's it. There's quite a few articles on this. I found this forum post because I was reading

275
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,760
 articles about her and there's quite a few articles and they all end at the spot where she's like,

276
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,240
 she's asking for help. Is it possible she jumped realities without knowing? Is it possible that

277
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,800
 she suffered some sort of mental breakdown or some sort of minor brain damage that

278
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,400
 her, all that stuff was like a quick dream in her head. The boyfriend and everything like that. It

279
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,760
 was just like a spark, a flash, the job where she worked. It overwrote previous memories, so it kind

280
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,720
 of threw her off. She did buy those sheets. She did work for that boss. She never broke up their

281
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,280
 boyfriend, all of that stuff. What's interesting is I tried looking for this person because we have

282
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,880
 a full name. I tried looking for her online. There's a bunch of people with that name. That

283
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,080
 didn't really help. There's no interviews with her. There's no follow-ups that I could find. It's

284
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,160
 just this forum post. I saw another post on another website. Someone says it was fake. I know her. She

285
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,840
 made it up. I don't necessarily believe that or disbelieve that. It's just someone else saying that.

286
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,360
 They didn't give any proof that it was fake other than saying I know her when you can say you know

287
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:51,040
 anybody. So did she swap dimensions or was it some sort of brain damage? Despite all the jokes about

288
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,920
 drinking the water and staring in a mirror, is it possible to shift into another reality?

289
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:05,200
 I remember once when I wasn't so happy, when I wasn't so positive and didn't discover the powers

290
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,040
 of positive thinking and hadn't read some of the great works on visualization, and I was just sitting

291
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,080
 in my house. I was super depressed. This is around the solar plexus clown gliders that time period,

292
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,640
 where I was just really, really down. And I remember I was sitting on my couch. I was completely

293
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,600
 unfulfilled with my life. I felt I could be better than who I was, and I was mad at myself because

294
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,080
 I wasn't who I thought I should be. And I remember once I was sitting on my couch, and then the next

295
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:42,400
 thing I knew, I was standing backstage of an award show. I remember fully well the sensation of like

296
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,840
 the tuxedo I was wearing, of the people walking around me with headsets, of looking out onto the

297
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,240
 stage. I'm backstage and I see a podium with the mic and I hear the audience clapping for the

298
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,000
 former presenter or award winner or something, and I'm standing there dressed up. And someone came up

299
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,280
 to me, tapped me on the shoulder and says, "You're on." And I kind of looked around and I realized

300
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:12,480
 that something was off, and I immediately appeared back in my living room watching whatever I was

301
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,080
 watching, probably Deep Space Nine or something like that. The lights were low, my place looked

302
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:26,080
 dismal, and I was there by myself again. Now to be fair, I was incredibly stoned at the time,

303
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:35,520
 super stoned, and so I brushed it all off as marijuana induced psychosis, or I was falling

304
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:44,000
 asleep and started to dream, or I was daydreaming and the marijuana made the sensation even stronger.

305
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,960
 Those are the rational explanations. But sometimes it's hard to believe the rational

306
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,000
 explanations, sometimes that they don't tell the whole story. Sometimes you do just wake up
