00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
 The movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind features a man who tries to have his memory erased via sci-fi contraption,

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:16,240
 but you can actually do it at home, and then we take a look at an urban legend that is spread around all over the world.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,400
 But the origins of it are frighteningly real, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,080
 [Music]

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,560
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,960
 Don't have a lot of time to record this episode. I actually have to go do some grocery shopping for one of my jobs.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,160
 Have to run out, go do grocery shopping, then run off to another job and then come back to this other job.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,360
 It is the plight of someone who works three part-time jobs, but what are you going to do?

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,240
 And I got to put out a daily podcast, so you just kind of got to bite down.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,920
 It didn't help that I spent the last half hour listening to Kimbra songs. I've never really listened to her before.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,680
 I've always thought she was pretty cute. She was in that Goatier song, and I was like, "Oh, she actually has some pretty good music."

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
 So I've been getting all that. I walk a lot, so I need as much music as I can.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,440
 So I was listening to a bunch of her songs and downloading them and all that.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,120
 But anyways, so for the rest of the day, I'll be listening to Kimbra and walking around doing grocery shopping, running errands, and so on and so forth.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,040
 But before I do all that, I've got to cover two stories for you guys.

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
 So the first story we're going to look at, I said in the intro,

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,440
 so there is that movie called Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and I think Frodo was in it too.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,280
 But I didn't like that movie. I wasn't a huge fan of it. I heard a lot of hype about it.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,760
 But it was really, I think you can almost like that movie was Frodo hipster movie.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,920
 I think it kind of preceded the hipster movement.

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,000
 But I ended up watching it and I shut it off halfway through. I just wasn't that entertained by it.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,040
 And I appreciate Jim Carrey's early stuff.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,200
 And he has he done anything? I'll see him in the Sonic movie. I'll watch that.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,680
 I mean, he he's a little weird in real life, but his movies are decent, good to decent movies.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,480
 He hasn't made anything really terrible. I never saw him number 23.

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,040
 I actually should watch that because that really is kind of the conspiracy type movie.

28
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
 And it's kind of what the show is about. But maybe I'll give it a shot.

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,880
 Anyways, so it had Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet who's super hot and then Frodo Backends was in it.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,040
 He was looking for the ring and he didn't find it in that movie, but he found it in another movie.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,000
 So the the concept is this, this guy is a horrible breakup of the girl and there's this device that allows your memory.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,600
 I think there's a musical number in it. Maybe I maybe I'm getting a confused.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
 There were some other hot chicken and who's Mary Jane from Spiderman?

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,400
 She was also a cheerleader and bring it on. My depth of movie knowledge is what the actors have been in before.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
 So I'm like, oh, it's the movie starring the mask and Rose from Titanic.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,520
 They meet Frodo and Mary Jane Watson and they go on this crazy adventure and if your mind's erased,

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,560
 this machine allows you to erase your mind.

38
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,240
 One of the interesting things, the only interesting thing about the movie is that

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,880
 would you want to have memories erased? Would you want bad memories to be erased?

40
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,440
 You know, one of the weird things, I know I'm digressing here, but one of the weird things about like dying and going to heaven,

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,880
 I've always felt is that you're supposed to go to heaven and you're a total peace and joy,

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,440
 but part of what's informed me, part of what's created me as a human is my bad memories,

43
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,080
 is the sorrow I've gone through and I feel like that is baked into the cake that is Jason Carpenter.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,240
 So can you take out the bad memories and still be the same person?

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,800
 Or would you want to take out the bad memories knowing that you wouldn't even remember the good stuff?

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,640
 But as much as that is a sci-fi/philosophical argument, you can actually do it at home.

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,880
 Here's a disclaimer, don't do this, don't do this, but it's possible, but don't do it,

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
 because it's actually quite dangerous.

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,480
 I came across this article recently and what it is, is this man in China posted on the net.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,800
 So right there, it's super vague. We don't have a lot of resources, but other scientists,

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,160
 other doctors have chimed in on this. A man on the internet in China said his mom was really

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,480
 constipated for like two weeks, going to go to the bathroom at all. And then one time she went

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,880
 into the bathroom and she was in there for a long time and she finally had a bowel movement,

54
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,920
 and when she came out of the bathroom, she didn't remember the past 10 years of her life.

55
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,040
 They couldn't figure out what was going on. She had no idea what happened the past 10 years of

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
 her life. She's like, "Hey, you want to go to the World Trade Center?" They're like, "Mom,

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
 mom, sit down. We have something to tell you." Actually, that would have been farther back

58
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,800
 than 10 years, but anyways, the family had to sit her down and tell her like, "What's going on?"

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,040
 And she's like, "No, no, I got all this money invested in Enron. We're rich. We're millionaires."

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,760
 And they're like, "Mom, mom, we think we need to go to the doctor." So they took her to the doctor,

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,960
 and what happened was the doctor diagnosed her with amnesia, but it only lasted for eight hours.

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,240
 So for eight hours, she couldn't remember the past 10 years of her life.

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,520
 Now, this was reported in the media and the news article in China, there's two versions of this

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,920
 article. One is from the China Times, and we'll get to that in a second. And then one is in this

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,760
 website called The Week of Buzz, which seemed to really click baity. So I had to go to the

66
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,080
 China Times to find out if it was actually published or true or anything like that.

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
 And in the China Times, they quoted this neurosurgeon who says, "Yes, it is possible,

68
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
 because when you're having a big bowel movement, you can actually start to cut off blood flow to

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,720
 your jugular vein, which will interfere with your brain, which you're not getting enough blood flow

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
 to your brain, so it will begin to wipe out memories if the bowel movement is big enough."

71
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,960
 So yes, it is possible, and it does happen. It's not incredibly common, but it does happen. I had

72
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,080
 a cousin one day who, one day her husband came home and she was laying on the floor and she thought

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,640
 she was still in high school. She didn't remember anything. And they never could, and after about

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,080
 a year or two, she regained her memories, but she ended up going to the doctor. The doctor was

75
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
 like, "We don't know what it is," but she appears to have lost her memory. Now, there were people in

76
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,880
 the family who thought she was faking it. I actually ran into her shortly after this happened,

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,360
 and I remember looking at her, and she looked different. There was something about her eyes.

78
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
 I go, "I don't think she's faking it, because just by looking at her eyes, you could tell there

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,320
 was something different about her." And she might have just suffered mild brain damage. She may have

80
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,000
 made the whole thing up, but I think she probably did suffer some mild brain damage, and she actually

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
 did lose her memory. But I don't know if she was super constipated before that. They just found

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,160
 her on the floor. So let's go to the ch-- So it is a legit thing. It actually can happen to people,

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,640
 but now this next segment you might think is a little culturally insensitive, but the next story

84
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,760
 we're going to cover is quite grim, so I figured let's pack as many as funny moments into this

85
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,120
 next couple minutes, because what we're going to get into is pretty dark. So I go to the China Times.

86
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,280
 Now I have to run the translate option, obviously, because I don't speak Chinese. Now I actually do

87
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,720
 have a lot of Chinese members of my family. A lot of members of my family, my stepmom, and my stepbrother,

88
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,000
 and sisters, and stuff like that, are Chinese. Step-grandpa, all that stuff. Are there such a

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 thing as a step-grandpa, or at a certain point you just go, "Ah, that's my grandpa." But anyways,

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,560
 I have a lot of family members who are from China, so I don't speak Chinese myself, they probably

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,280
 could, but the translation errors when I'm running this translate-- and I don't get these a lot when

92
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,680
 I'm running translation from English to, like, on Spanish websites, which I have to go to a lot.

93
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,000
 There's some great gems here. Again, you might go, "Jason, that's kind of rude, but

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,800
 we're going to get into some dark stuff." The headline of the China Times article-- so for

95
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,040
 comparison, this is the headline of the World Buzz article. "Women loses 10 years of memories

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,400
 after she pooped with excessive force." I'm like, "Oh, it's very clicky, very clickbaity," and I was

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,040
 like, "Oh, it's an interesting story for the podcast." Go to China Times, here's the headline.

98
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,880
 "Constipation. The toilet came out and lost 10 years of memory."

99
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,880
 Now, other than it grammatically being incorrect, the toilet didn't lose memory, and the toilet

100
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,400
 didn't come out. Quite an odd phrasing for it. You poop and another toilet comes out, and then you

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,680
 poop into that toilet, and another smaller toilet comes out. It's a-- I forgot what that name was.

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,920
 We covered our past episode, but when people keep looking into mirrors, they see multiple versions

103
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,320
 of themselves, it's that, but just toilets coming out of your butthole. And then they had these other

104
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,480
 great headlines, here. "Paper folding 103 times as big as the universe."

105
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:22,720
 What? What does that even mean? "He hasn't cut his hair for 50 years. He took his head gear like a

106
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,040
 giant clam." Oh, man, that guy's such a good dude. He took it like a giant clam. I'm assuming--

107
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,040
 now, I clicked on that one, because I was like, "What does that even mean?" And apparently,

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,000
 he hadn't cut his hair in 50 years, and they just cut it, and apparently looked like a giant clam.

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,680
 It didn't. It just looked like a giant pile of hair on the ground. But this headline actually had

110
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
 to click on, because I was like, "What in the world?" I understand the paper folding thing. It's

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,920
 probably saying you can't fold a piece of paper 103 times. I've heard that before, but you can't

112
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
 fold a piece of paper in half so many times, sort of. But this next headline I had to click on,

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,360
 do some research on, "Under the flashlight, the white light is actually suffering from this disease."

114
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,920
 Like, what could that even possibly mean? So I guess this article is a girl, a mother,

115
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
 took a photo of her son, and when the white light flashed, his eyes looked really weird

116
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
 under the flash. And he actually suffered from some sort of eye cancer, and they caught it very

117
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,720
 early and were able to treat it. But, yeah. So that's what that headline means. "Under the flashlight,

118
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,960
 the white light is actually suffering from this disease." Again, the white light's not suffering

119
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,600
 from anything. The toilet is not losing 10 years of memory, and you're not the toilet come- the

120
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
 toilet doesn't come out of anything. It's there. It's in place. So thank you, China Times, and thank

121
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,320
 you, Google Translate for these great headlines. And again, I don't recommend giving yourself

122
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,360
 constipation so you interfere with the blood flow to your brain. I highly don't recommend that,

123
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,480
 because you could probably just give yourself a stroke. But it's still just an odd thing how

124
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,920
 balanced our bodies are and how easily it is to interfere with them. This is obviously a

125
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
 temporary thing, even if you did have a bad breakup within the past 10 years. You'll only buy

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,960
 yourself about eight hours of solace, but then you're like, "Now I just have to make myself

127
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,840
 constipated all the time. Yeah, don't do that. Don't do that at all." I actually don't even know how

128
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,240
 an eternal sunshine ended. I don't know if he decided to remember her or not. I just gave up

129
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,640
 halfway through the movie. I'm pretty sure there's a musical number, though. I'm almost pretty sure

130
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,160
 there's a musical number with Kirsten Dunst. That was it. Dude, if you want to watch a great movie,

131
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,800
 Melancholy. I know there's a lot of people who aren't big fans of Lars von Trier,

132
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,400
 but that movie's great. And I know why people aren't good fans of his, because he made all those

133
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,240
 Nazi jokes during a press conference, and he's just cracking these jokes about Hitler. And Kirsten

134
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
 Dunst, star of Bring It On and the Spider-Man franchise, is sitting next to him and she's like,

135
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,800
 "Oh my god." And he's cracking jokes about Hitler and Nazis in front of a bunch of posh

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,720
 film critics. But Lars von Trier, Melancholia. Melancholia, that was the name of the movie.

137
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,680
 The first half of the movie is an examination of a young woman's descent into depression.

138
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
 Kirsten Dunst has a nude scene in it as well, if you're not into the depression angle.

139
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,080
 The second half of the movie is one of the best end-of-the-world sci-fi films ever.

140
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,680
 Top 5. I would honestly say ever, because it just shows the futility of mankind in the face of the

141
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,360
 entire universe. And I remember reading an article about Melancholia and Lars von Trier, goes,

142
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,800
 "That's one of my least favorite movies. It's one of my least favorite movies." One,

143
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,440
 because I was going through terrible depression while I was watching it, hence the point of the

144
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,240
 movie. And he goes, "2, it's too good." He goes, "I like my movies to have lots of flaws in them. I like

145
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,720
 to have, like my movies to have mistakes in them." He goes, "And I used a lot of tripods in this film,

146
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,360
 and I just don't like the way it came out." Beautiful movie. Very, very tragic film. And I

147
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,640
 would tell, I've told people too, just skip, just skip the first hour. If you're not into the examination

148
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,800
 of depression and loss, and I don't even think she loses anything. I think she's just going through

149
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,120
 a chemical depression. Yeah, I go, "If you're not into that, the first hour is pretty slow." I would,

150
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,520
 I loved it, but I love all of his stuff. Lars, and this is my last thing I'm going to talk about

151
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:23,040
 is, Lars Von Trier is great because he is a very, he's like an art house movie maker who makes,

152
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,200
 takes schlocky genres. And he's done that, he's done that with his past, I wouldn't say past

153
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,680
 two movies, but Melancholia and Antichrist are both, Antichrist is a Cabin in the Woods Horror

154
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,880
 movie made by an artistic genius. A lot of people don't like the way he portrays women either,

155
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:50,480
 and I totally get that. But it is a art house take on a straight to DVD horror movie. It's,

156
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,600
 it's brilliant. It's a man and a woman in a cabin in the woods. Absolutely terrifying film,

157
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,560
 very, very grotesque. William Defoe was in that one, love that movie. And then Melancholia is

158
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,280
 basically Armageddon made by an amazing filmmaker, not whoever made Armageddon. I think it might have

159
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,680
 been Michael Bayer, Jerry Bruckheimer, but it was, he does these, he picks these genres

160
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,360
 that normally aren't touched by the arty artsy community and makes it makes these crazy films.

161
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,400
 I would love to see him do an action film. I would love to see him get Scott Atkins and Jean-Claude

162
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,040
 Van Damme and do an artistic take on a action film. Actually, his last movie was the house that Jack

163
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,920
 built, which I haven't seen yet, but it is a serial killer film done in an art house. I've

164
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,440
 seen clips from it and it's quite ridiculous, but it's that same type of thing. So hats off to

165
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,640
 you Lars von Trier and hats off to the my audience, half of my audience that left because they absolutely

166
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,520
 hate that person, but I like them. Dogville, great movie. So anyways, let's go ahead and move on.

167
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,200
 Dogville is amazing actually, but let's go ahead and move on. I never saw the sequel. Let's go

168
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:04,800
 ahead and move on to our next story. So there is this old urban legend. It's probably one of the

169
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,680
 biggest urban legends really. You have Bloody Mary, which is probably the top one, but the second

170
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,240
 urban legend is the babysitter in the house. And the story is this, she's at home babysitting the

171
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,760
 kid. There's a lot of versions of this, but really the main one that I always heard was there's a

172
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,800
 babysitter at home babysitting two kids, a kid, whatever. It doesn't matter how many kids there

173
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,320
 are. They're basically cannon fodder for this story. This babysitter is in this house and

174
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,240
 she's getting crank calls to her phone and then she calls up the police and she says,

175
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,480
 can you track the phone call? And then the cops call her back and say, we tracked the phone call,

176
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,400
 the phone calls coming from within the house. And then the version I heard was then she went,

177
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,320
 this totally disturbed me as a kid. I think I first heard this one. I was like eight or nine.

178
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,560
 The babysitter then goes upstairs and the kids are all chopped up and I remember being specifically

179
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,960
 told their faces looked like spaghettios and that really disturbed me because I loved spaghettios

180
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,440
 and it really creeped me out because it took something that I enjoyed eating. And for the

181
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
 longest time when I looked at bowl of spaghettios, I just would see like chopped up people because

182
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,920
 spaghettios, not just spaghettios, spaghettios with hot dogs in them is very specific. Now,

183
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,000
 of course, you could not ever chop up a human body and make it look like spaghettios with hot dogs

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,520
 in them, but totally creeped me out. Now, that version of the story where the cops are tracing

185
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,000
 the phone call back and it's inside the house, that we've heard all sorts of versions of that,

186
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,920
 but basically the idea is the killer is in the house with the babysitter. We don't always get

187
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,400
 the traced phone call, but that's a common thing. Now, the story we're going to cover is actually

188
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,480
 something I had never heard of until about two or three weeks ago and it's very, very chilling,

189
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,120
 very chilling story. So we're going back in time. We're going back to the year 1950. We're in the

190
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,520
 city of Columbia, Missouri and it's March 18th. There is a young babysitter. This is a 100%

191
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,360
 true story. There's a young babysitter named Janet Christman and she's 13 years old. She turns 14

192
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,960
 in three days. So you guys can already kind of know where this is going. You guys want to tune

193
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,080
 in tomorrow? It's totally fine. Janet is 13. She turns 14 in three days. She's trying to save up

194
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,360
 money to get a new dress for Easter and she generally babysits for two different families.

195
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,720
 She babysits for the Romax and she babysits for the Mollars. So this particular night,

196
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,880
 the Mollars and the Romax and a couple other families are going to go hang out and play cards

197
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,440
 and Janet picks the job to go to the Romax house and the Mollars have to find another babysitter

198
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,000
 and she's at the Romax house and they said, "Okay, listen, here's the thing. We have this little

199
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,360
 three-year-old boy named Gregory. I want you to take care of him." And she's like, "I know how to do

200
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,280
 my job, guys. They're like, "No, we're just adding details. We're adding details for the story." And

201
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,120
 she's like, "That's weird. Details for who?" So they say, "Our little son Gregory is three years old.

202
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,120
 The house is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but let me show you some stuff." So Ed Romax,

203
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:11,440
 the dad of the Romax, says, "Here's my shotgun. Again, this is 1950s, so you would have no problem

204
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,600
 handling a shotgun to a 13-year-old girl. He showed her how to load it, unload it, and said,

205
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,120
 'Keep it by the door.' If anyone knocks on the door, anyone at all, you lock the door,

206
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,320
 you turn on the porch light. Do not open the door for anybody." Puts the shotgun by the door,

207
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,600
 pats her on the head, says goodbye to his son. The Romax leaves. That night, a massive rainstorm

208
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:45,600
 hits the area. Mid-20 degrees. So it's just ice and sleet everywhere. And Janet is just sitting at

209
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:53,440
 home doing her babysitting thing. Now, at 1035, the police station in Columbia gets a phone call.

210
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,480
 Phone rings. Columbia Police. This is, and they just hear a young girl go, "Come quick!"

211
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,080
 And the phone line goes dead. Cop's sitting there, looking out the window.

212
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:14,160
 Seeing the rain and the ice, the wind whip across the street outside the police station.

213
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,200
 And the officer just sits there waiting for another phone call. They can't trace the phone call.

214
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,040
 I don't even know if they had the ability to trace phone calls back then, but the phone call was so

215
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:31,600
 short with no information they just had to hope they get another phone call. Now, while the Romax

216
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,640
 and the Mollers are out having this big party, Ann Romac, the wife, calls home to see how everything

217
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,240
 is going. But it's really early in the morning. It's like around midnight. She calls home, no

218
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,600
 answer. So she goes, "Baby sitter must be asleep. Gregory's probably asleep. Probably no big deal."

219
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,440
 At 1.35, the Romax pull up to their house. Rain still just pouring down. They see in their

220
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,840
 headlights as their cars pulling up. They see that the porch light is on. They don't really think

221
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,160
 anything of it. Maybe she turned it on because she was scared, because it was dark and it was stormy.

222
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,560
 Maybe not. But when Ed walks up to the house and he goes to unlock the door, the door is unlocked.

223
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,200
 And right when they walk into the house, they see the body of Janet on the ground.

224
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,880
 The carpet is soaked with her blood. They see, just in the brief time that they're looking before

225
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,440
 they start totally freaking out, she's obviously dead. She suffered some major head wounds and she's

226
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,440
 been stabbed multiple times. Ann sees that and she freaks out and then immediately runs upstairs to

227
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,440
 check on her son. Totally safe. Asleep. Not even aware of what was going on downstairs. Ed then goes

228
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,160
 to call the police and the phone is off the hook. Picks the phone up, dials the police.

229
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,200
 We need someone out here right away. Massive police presence shows up. They all show up.

230
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,360
 You just can't believe that this would happen anywhere, but it's happening in their town.

231
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,120
 The police show up. Now, part of the problem is that their house is kind of in the middle of nowhere.

232
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
 It's almost on the border of two different police jurisdictions. And so, the Columbia police get

233
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,840
 involved and the police in the neighboring area get involved and they start vying for control over

234
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,640
 who gets to control this crime scene, who's in charge of this murder. You have a bunch of cops

235
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,400
 walking around. You have conflicting orders between the police. All sorts of stuff. And that is kind

236
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,440
 of indicative of what's going to happen with this. This is what they start to put together.

237
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,040
 She seemed to have been stabbed with a mechanical pencil. She was strangled with a power cord from

238
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,800
 an iron. That's what eventually did her in. But she was pummeled in the head. She was stabbed

239
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,600
 multiple times with what appears to be a mechanical pencil, which weren't super common back then.

240
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,760
 They're not even super common now. They actually quite suck. I've never seen the advantage of a

241
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,680
 mechanical pencil. But she suffered head wounds. She suffered stab wounds. Unfortunately, she had been

242
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,720
 sexually assaulted as well. The police are fighting over control of the crime scene. They're

243
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,200
 fighting for control of the case. And they're looking into this and they don't have any immediate

244
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,680
 leads. There is a back window that is busted open and there's some mud by like the back kitchen door.

245
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,480
 And so some cops are saying someone must have busted their way into the house. Got in, assaulted her,

246
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,360
 killed her. Other people are saying the fact that the porch light is on makes us think that someone

247
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,200
 came to the front door. And since the door was unlocked, it was probably somebody she knew.

248
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,920
 But in the midst of all this, is there trying to work this crime scene, trying to work this case?

249
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,920
 Eventually, one of the officers turns to someone else and says,

250
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,840
 "Do you think this is related to the Mary Lou Jenkins case?"

251
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:54,240
 Four years earlier, February 5th, 1946, Mary Lou Jenkins, 20 years old. She was staying at home

252
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,440
 alone. Her father was out of town and her mother was down the street, taking care of an elderly

253
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,920
 couple. This is in the same town. The mom says, "Listen, if you run into any problems, open the

254
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,320
 shades, turn the light on, and call me." Later that night, the mom looks out the window, she's in the

255
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,160
 house with the elderly people. She looks out the window, she looks down the street and she sees her

256
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,400
 house with the blinds open and the light on, but she didn't receive a phone call. So she thinks

257
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,480
 everything is fine. That seems like a weird warning system if you only, of all three things,

258
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,120
 have to happen. Blinds have to be open, lights on and a phone call. Like you figured just two

259
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,800
 of the three would work, but she doesn't think anything's wrong. When she goes home later that

260
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,520
 night, she sees that her daughter was raped and strangled with an extension cord. There was a guy

261
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,400
 who around the same time murdered his own wife and during a rather brutal police interrogation,

262
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,760
 he confessed to the rape and murder of Mary Lou Jenkins. So he was executed for that. He was

263
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,800
 executed for the murder of his wife and on the date of his execution, he says, "Listen, I murdered

264
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,280
 my wife, but I didn't murder Mary Lou Jenkins and no one believes him because he's a murderer and

265
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,120
 he's about to die. So, you know, it's not like he has the best credibility ever." But there were

266
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,920
 issues in this town. There were creepers. Now, she was killed in 1946, but there was kind of this

267
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,240
 underlying current of odd activity in this town. Now, three years after Mary Lou Jenkins' murder,

268
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,320
 there was a spate of peeping Tom activity in the town. Now, that makes me think the fact that the

269
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
 mom was so paranoid saying, "If anything went wrong, do these things." It makes me think that

270
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 people are already a little on edge. Maybe they hadn't bubbled to the surface. Maybe people weren't

271
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,680
 aware of it. But in 1949, they had a bunch of peeping Tom activity that actually escalated into

272
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,760
 rape. A few days before Halloween in 1949, a 16-year-old girl was raped by a man wearing a white

273
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,680
 mask. Almost a month later, on November 29th, there was an attempted rape and then the next day,

274
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,400
 a man, when a white mask finds a couple in a car, robs the man, rapes the girl. So then a couple

275
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,480
 days later, on November 4th, a man was caught peeping outside of a house. He was subject to a

276
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,800
 rather brutal police interrogation and he confesses to the rape and the attempted rape. Doesn't confess

277
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,520
 to the rape of the couple, but confesses to the rape and the attempted rape that happened just

278
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,240
 a couple months earlier. So, the police in this town were kind of known for using extra judicial

279
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
 interrogation methods. They weren't doing stuff by the book and that would come to bite them in the

280
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,600
 butt in the end. So, they've, at this point, they have solved all these other crimes they believe.

281
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,360
 The police believe that they know who's done these other crimes. So in 1950, though, they're

282
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,760
 looking at the body of Janet on the autopsy table. It appears she's been stabbed with a mechanical

283
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,800
 pencil several times. And so then the police are discussing it and they go, "Do you know anyone

284
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:53,600
 who uses a mechanical pencil?" And the answer is yes. Yes. I do know someone who's using mechanical

285
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,840
 pencil. Not only do I know someone who often uses a mechanical pencil, they know Janet. In fact,

286
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:07,680
 Janet is one of their babysitters. Robert Mueller, which is a bizarre name that this hasn't popped

287
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,440
 up more often because Robert Mueller is now such a famous name, but Robert Mueller was a tailor in

288
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,640
 town, a very, very successful man. He was always known to carry a mechanical pencil. Now, that's

289
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,400
 not enough to make you a suspect, but he was also known to have lewd conversations about young girls.

290
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,720
 And Romak said that Robert Mueller was the type of guy who used his hands, not his words, when

291
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,120
 dealing with women. Very, very gropey type of guy. Ed Romak said, "Not only had he made lewd

292
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,280
 comments about young women, he would make comments about wanting to take a young girl's virginity,

293
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,480
 and he would make comments about how curvy Janet was becoming. The kind of comments that were

294
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,160
 making Ed a little nervous, which makes me think that when Ed was saying, "Don't open the door for

295
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,400
 anyone," and here's where the shotgun is, almost makes me think he is saying, "Don't even open it

296
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,800
 for Robert Mueller. Just leave the door locked. Even if you know him, just leave it locked during

297
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,640
 the porch light on." But they're all out at a card game together. So, Robert Mueller has a perfect

298
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,200
 alibi, right? As the cops started looking into him and started questioning, once he became the

299
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,760
 focus of this investigation, they interviewed the people at the party. And the people at the party

300
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,880
 say, "Yes, Robert Mueller was at the party for us, except for a few hours." And the cops were like,

301
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,120
 "What?" And they're like, "Yeah, he was gone for a few hours." He said he had a doctor's appointment

302
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,400
 or something, and they're like, "Really? Late at night?" And they're like, "Yeah." During a rainstorm,

303
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,600
 he had a doctor's appointment. They're like, "Yeah, we didn't really think anything of it now." But

304
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
 now that you're mentioning him, it is a little suspicious, isn't it? The cops are like, "Yes,

305
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,080
 you could have told us that weeks ago." So they contacted Robert Mueller's doctor, and the doctor

306
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,400
 goes, "I never saw him that night. He never stopped by." Now, his alibi starts falling apart.

307
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,120
 But not only that, the police are putting together that this guy's fairly creepy, and

308
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,760
 at one point he's talking to Ed, and he goes, "You know, I don't know who killed Janet, but I know

309
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,440
 how I would have done it. I would have just walked up to the front door and said, 'Hey, Ed sent me

310
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,040
 here to pick up some poker chips,' and she would have let me right inside." And Ed's like, "What the

311
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:16,240
 hell are you talking about?" So there actually was an interrogation. But again, not by the book.

312
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,320
 They took him out of the city jurisdiction. They take Robert Mueller to this abandoned barn

313
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,360
 out of police jurisdiction and interview him for hours. Doesn't break. Doesn't break at all.

314
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,280
 He offers to take a polygraph. He takes a polygraph. He passes the polygraph. So at that

315
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,920
 point the cops are like, "Well, he didn't do it." Now, we know now that polygraph technology isn't

316
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,840
 100%. They're like, "Hey, man, he passed the polygraph and he didn't break during our basic

317
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,040
 torture session, so he's most likely innocent." But a judge disagreed and said, "You know what,

318
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,000
 I don't agree with that decision, police. I'm going to convene a grand jury. We're going to look at

319
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,600
 all the evidence and we're going to see if we can indict this guy." Goes to a grand jury. But when

320
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,960
 all the police evidence is presented to the grand jury, they say, "Too much problem with these

321
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,920
 different police forces trying to investigate this. We have all this different stuff because one police

322
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,400
 force straight up says it was a stranger who broke in the back window." And then you have this other

323
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:22,240
 police force saying, "No, it's someone she knew." So despite all of the weirdness with his alibi

324
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:34,880
 and his statements and his creepy behavior, he's never prosecuted. He ends up leaving, dies at

325
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:43,360
 the age of 83 in Arizona. The Romacs and the Mollers go about their business. Janet had a little

326
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,800
 sister who ended up going off into college and just kind of moving on with her life. The parents,

327
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,160
 obviously when I say moving on with their life, obviously they mourned the loss of their daughter

328
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,640
 and sister. But things just kind of faded away. To this day, no one has ever been successfully

329
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,120
 prosecuted in any way for the death of Janet Christman. Just a 13-year-old girl, three-day

330
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,680
 shy of her 14th birthday, raped and murdered on a cold, rainy Missouri night.

331
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:20,480
 It doesn't have all of the extra creepy details that the urban legend has.

332
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,800
 But the idea of a lone babysitter, a young woman trapped in a house, being confronted with the

333
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:35,840
 ultimate evil, is creepy enough. Whoever did this got away with it. Whoever did this most likely

334
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,920
 was responsible for the other crimes. And because of the way the police were interacting with these

335
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,840
 suspects in the past, people were confessing most likely to crimes they did not commit. The guy

336
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,360
 who was convicted of Mary Lou Jenkins was a murderer. The guy who was peeping outside the

337
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,560
 window was a peeping tom. But was he a rapist? Were all of these crimes connected? Nobody knows.

338
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:08,160
 And I don't really know if anyone really cares. You think this story would still be floating

339
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:15,520
 around out there as one of the big unsolved cases. But it's not. It's been swept away into a sea

340
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:24,160
 of unsolved mysteries. What really happened that cold, rainy night? Was she confronted by a man

341
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,240
 she knew who had always lusted after her, who had a friendly demeanor and walked through the front

342
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,960
 door before committing the ultimate evil? Or was it a stranger skulking about the house who saw a

343
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:48,960
 young girl alone and decided to do something truly despicable? Either way, that person went on

344
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:57,280
 with their lives. Someone truly evil continued to live, function, and walk among the rest of the

345
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:06,480
 world. And that is scarier than any urban legend. DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be our
