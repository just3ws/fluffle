1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Can an online test truly tell you if you are a vampire?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we take a look at one of my favorite conspiracy theories.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,840
 Not necessarily that I believe in it, but I think it might be probably the best constructed

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,340
 conspiracy theory I've ever come across.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,000
 Who is the nobody today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Yeah, that was pretty energetic intro.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Actually, I think I pulled a muscle.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I think I pulled a muscle in my chest.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Dude, my left pack, man.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I did something to it in jujitsu months ago, dude.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And I just, ugh.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Anyways, that's enough talking about my amazing body.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Let's go ahead and say hello to our newest Patreon, Bonkelman.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Bonkelman, thank you so much for supporting this show.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Really, really appreciate it.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 You will be our guide this episode.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 That really helps a lot.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Also, if you want to help support this show, maybe give me some muscle rub.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Ugh.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Bonkelman, fire up that carboner copter.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We are headed out to Transylvania.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 No, we're headed out to New York.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 That's where the vampire lord, Stefan, lives in his massive dark castle.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And that is where he overlooks the website, vampirewebsite.net.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 [laughs]

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 The black background blue-lettered website we all know and love.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I just discovered it a couple of days ago, and I talked about it on yesterday's episode as well.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I wish there was more content.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Like, I probably got a couple segments out of it, but oh man, I could have spent a long time on that.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I could have spent a long time on that website.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 But now, we're not talking about that.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Bonkelman, I want you to land right in this dark garden.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 All the roses are wilted.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 No, no, no.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 All the roses are blood red.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 The trees are all weeping willows.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And the grass is crabgrass, right?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 But covered in blood.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 So, we're walking around the estates of the vampire lord, I think his name's Steven.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Again, I'm not entirely for sure that might have just been a name I pulled out of my head.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And we are going to be given a quiz to tell whether or not we are vampires.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 This is, this is gold, guys.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Okay, question, this is literally question number one.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 This is the number one question they want to ask you to find out if you are a vampire.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Question number one, quote, do you have unusually pale skin?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Now, on a normal quiz that like, say you're reading Teen Vogue and it's like, Halloween issue, are you a vampire?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 That'd be question number, that would be the whole question, right?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Do you have unusually pale skin?

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Number two would be like, do you ever chase your little brother around with a hypodermic needle and you're like, hmm,

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 that's not enough for, this is a real vampire quiz.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 This is no Teen Vogue vampire.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 This is the real deal.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So, that's not the whole question.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Do you have unusually pale skin?

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It continues.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Your skin doesn't need to be pale to be a vampire.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 It just needs to pale in comparison to what your skin tone should be.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 That's a nice dodge for black vampires, right?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Because basically, if the Teen Vogue says is your skin pale,

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 and some black dudes are reading and he's like, ugh, no.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 But I did drain the blood of several people last night.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I think I know I'm a vampire.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 So, nice dodge.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Vampire website.net.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 You're not saying that you can't be a black vampire,

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 but you should be more pale than a normal black person,

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 which I actually think might even be more racist.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 But anyways, that's not even the whole question yet.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 We're not done.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 If yes, so if you are more pale than you should normally be, right?

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 If yes, this is 100% legit.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'm not making any of this up.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 If yes, cook up one or two, depending on the size.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 It specifically says, depending on the size.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 If yes, then cook up one or two, depending on the size, medium rare stakes.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 If, by the time you're done enjoying the second one,

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 you have a new pinkish color throughout your body

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 that you haven't had in a while.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Read no further.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You are a real vampire.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Humans can't digest blood, let alone get color from it.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Real vampires do.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Unquote.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So, you thought, you homo sapien thought,

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 that the only way to tell if you're a vampire is,

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 do you enjoy the taste of blood?

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Can you stand the sunlight for more than a minute?

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Were you recently bitten by a vampire?

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Now what?

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 The way to find out if you're a vampire, according to vampirewebsite.net,

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 one to two medium, which I am more than willing to take this challenge.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Any challenge that involves me eating steak.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Oh, I'm down.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 One to two medium rare stakes, depending on the size.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So, you can get one big one.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Anyways, the point is, is that after you're done eating it,

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 if your skin is more flesh than it normally is,

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 stop reading no further, you are a vampire.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 No joke, though. No joke.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 This is literally the next pair.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So, I don't know anything about, this is my first foray into whether or not I'm a vampire, right?

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I'm reading this and I go, "Okay, so, because you can digest blood, basically."

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 This is the next paragraph.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Okay, you just found out.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And it's so funny, it actually says, now think about it, it says,

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 "Read no further, you are a vampire."

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And it goes very clear to say, "You are now a vampire."

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Don't even read anymore.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But if you read the next paragraph, it says,

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 "Note, the extra work involved in trying to eat medium rare or rare meat

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 can cause a temporary pink color to the skin, which is otherwise known as being flushed.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Temporarily being flushed is not the color that is being referred to when a vampire gets color from the blood and the steak."

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Okay, and then this is nice.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So, basically, you look, you think you're a vampire.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You read no further.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 You think you're a creature of the night, but it turns out,

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 while you're out trying to jump off a building to turn him a bat,

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 it turns out actually that you should have read further.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Because sometimes, simply the act of eating medium rare to rare meat

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 makes you flush, because you're putting so much energy into chewing it.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So, that's, why is that, why is that number one?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Also, why did you tell me to read no further when the most important part was after that paragraph?

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I actually, when I read this quote, I stopped reading, bought two steaks,

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 broke quarantine, bought two steaks, came home, ate them, got flushed,

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 went out, attacked three people, and then it came home and finished reading the paragraph.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 So, that is negligence on your part, vampirewebsite.net.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 That's on you.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Someday I will gain my vampire powers and I will take vengeance against you all.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 But, you read further, I read further, you're halfway through eating that medium rare steak.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Let's keep looking, because that's not the only question.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 If that was the only, well, they did tell us to not read any further.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 That should have been the only question, but there are more.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Another question, I don't know really how this plays into it.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 He tries to explain it, but the explanation makes less sense.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Did your dad disappear from your life when you were at a young age?

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 If you were raised by a single mother, you might be a vampire.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Did you know that?

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Did you know, according to vampirewebsite.net, 52% of vampires...

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 52% of vampires surveyed were raised by single mothers.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Oh my God, I mean, I don't even know, I don't even know how to process that.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Legitimately, there's a lot of single moms out there, so that might just be...

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 You might just be playing the averages, right?

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 You could also say that people who are raised by single parent households

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 might have issues with getting other people's attention,

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and might lead to attention seeking behavior.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So, maybe telling people you're a vampire,

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 and you're special and unique, and a damned creature of darkness,

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 might just be because your one parent who raised you

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 and also had to work to put food on the table and a roof over your head,

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 didn't have enough time to pay attention to you.

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 But now, whenever you go to your local denny's in your cloak,

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 and you're slicked back hair, and everyone's paying attention to you,

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 and you finally get that validation that mother could never give you,

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 or that the father who left you in that pitch black fog bank,

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 near the bog, "Oh, father, I hate you."

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 But now, the people who eat at denny's, they all know who is truly in charge,

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Kregor the Magnificent.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 I think it's probably the second one, right?

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I think it's probably just people who raised by single parents.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They want to be loved.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And I'm not knocking single parents.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I'm not knocking single parents. They do the best they can.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Here's another one.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 "Are you extremely energetic at night?"

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 So, you know, when you're hanging out at denny's with...

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I used to do that. That's why I keep bringing that up.

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I used to hang out at denny's all night long with my friends.

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 It's the perfect late teenager, early college experience.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And, you know, I did wear a black trench coat everywhere.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So, I'm mocking myself with this too.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But see, the difference was, because I looked good in that trench coat.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Here's... Let's go back to this.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 "Are you extremely energetic at night,

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 but around the time the sun comes up, become extremely tired?"

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Now, yes, that's a typical vampire behavior.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 That's also a typical behavior if you're up all night.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Right? That's just logic.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 If you stay up all night, oh man, I've been up all night, but it's so weird.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I start to fall asleep.

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 No matter how late I stay up, eventually by 5 or 6 in the morning,

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 my body gets... What do you humans call this?

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Tie-erred?

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And I must return to my crypt, aka the loft in my stepdad's garage.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I mean, that's just normal human biology.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But, if you stay up all night and eventually get tired at some point,

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 and during that night when you were at denny's, you ate a medium rare steak,

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 you might be a vampire.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I love this next one.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I hope I'm not spending too much time on this one.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 People who are new to the show, they're like,

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 "Dude, is this guy ever gonna get to the nobody story?

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 That's why I'm listening to this episode."

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Hold on.

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Let me do this next one here.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I love this.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Do you have an unusually high tolerance to alcohol?

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 That should be enough, right?

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Because you figure aliens, not aliens,

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 because you figure vampires have a high tolerance to stuff, right?

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They're undead creatures of damnation.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 They can have that whole carofa wine at denny's all by themselves.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 But we continue.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Do you have an unusually high tolerance to alcohol?

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And other poisons or toxins?

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I don't drink many poisons or toxins.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 So for all I know, I'd be the most powerful vampire on the planet.

213
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But because I've never drank, you know, hemlock, I'll never know.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Now, when you have a list of stuff like, "Is your skin pale? Does your dad love you?"

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 When one of them is, "Do you drink poison?"

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I think that one could have been left off, right?

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 That one, that basically, it should have been like,

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 when people shoot bullets at you, can you dodge them and then rip their throat out?

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Because that's the same level.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 I'm not going to test that, and I'm definitely not drinking any poison

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 to find out whether or not I'm a vampire.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 This next one is number 16.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 There's like 20 of them.

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I'm not reading them all.

225
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 But number 16.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Number 16, here we go.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 We've found out whether or not our papa loves us.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 We've eaten some steaks.

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Number 16, after all of that, here's number 16.

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 "Do you tend to get a high from drinking human blood?"

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 That should have been number one, right?

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Like, isn't that the main thing?

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You walk into someone on the street and go,

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 "What's the first thing you think of when you think of vampire?"

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 They're going to say they drink blood.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 That should have been not eat.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 This guy works for the meat industry.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Vampire website.net owns stock and Omaha Steaks.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 People are like, "I want to find out if I'm a vampire."

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Everyone's buying steaks.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Everyone's eating stuff.

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 The first question should be, are you a vampire?

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 The first question should be, do you like to drink human blood?

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Because if you do, you might be a vampire.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Read no further.

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 You may be a vampire if you enjoy drinking human blood.

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And this one specifically is saying, do you get high drinking blood?

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 So not that you just enjoy the taste of copper in your mouth.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 It actually makes you feel good.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That should be question number one.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 That definitely should be before whether or not your dad left your mom.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Because tons and tons of dads leave moms.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 We'd be a vampire nation if that was more important than do you drink human blood?

254
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 It goes on to say, though, that...

255
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Talk about poisons and toxins.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 This is where you go from it being a funny website where guys listen off these questions about whether or not you're a vampire.

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 This is outright dangerous because there are people who believe in this nonsense.

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And this is absolutely deadly.

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 A legitimate vampire, this is "for your reasons, this is not me saying this."

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Do not say Dead Rabbit Radio recommends doing this.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 According to vampirewebsite.net,

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 a legitimate vampire is able to safely digest more than 600% of the daily recommended amount of iron.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 When...

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 This is the caveat here, because they don't want people rating the vitamin cabinet and overdosing.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But when in the form of blood,

266
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 and then it has a warning link that you click on it,

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 and it says, "If you decide to do this test, be damn sure you are a real vampire,

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 or else this will either make you extremely sick, put you in a hospital, or potentially kill you."

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 The recommended daily dose of iron is 18 milligrams.

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 60 milligrams can rot your stomach out, cause stomach scarring.

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Above that can kill you.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 He's recommending you drink almost double the amount of iron.

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 As long as it's in human blood.

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And I love this because remember, we're taking this test to find out if we are vampires, right?

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 But it says in the warning, "You better make sure you're a vampire before you do this test."

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I'm doing that, that's catch 22.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Catch 22 victims, cause you're a vampire, uh-uh, uh-uh, okay anyways.

278
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 You think you're a vampire, it tells you to drink 180 milligrams of iron.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You can't do that unless you know you're a vampire, you won't know you're a vampire until you drink 180 milligrams of it.

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Oh, the circle, the circle of death, cause you're vampires.

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They go on to say that there's a sound that only people-

282
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 This is so- there's a sound, I'll play it.

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 There's a sound that only-

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 [laughs]

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 This is such an amazing website.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 There's a sound that only two types of beings can hear.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 One is a legitimate vampire.

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 A vampire can hear this sound.

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And the other is-

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 [laughs]

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I mean, think about the thought process that went through not only thinking this was true,

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 but typing this out on the internet.

293
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 There is a sound-

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Okay, hold on.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 [laughs]

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 There is a sound that I will play for you, and you will know for sure.

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 There is a sound that you can hear if you're a vampire, if you are a real life vampire.

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Put down that bottle of iron.

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Listen to the sound first.

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 You will hear something if you are either a vampire or anyone under the age of 36.

301
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So basically, like, 40% of the population of the planet.

302
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 If you are a bloodthirsty creature of murder,

303
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 or between the ages of zero and 36 years old, you will hear this.

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 [silence]

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So, you're either- [laughs]

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 As you're rubbing your ear with your finger, you're like, "Ow, Jason, you jerk."

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You know now. You will know now and forevermore that from this moment on, you are either a vampire,

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 or you are under the age of 36.

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Now, you know what's weird. I always talk about my age,

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 because I don't think it should be something you're embarrassed about.

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I'm 43 years old.

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I heard the noise.

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Does that mean I'm a bloodthirsty revenant?

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 No, probably not. I'm thinking that that's not a perfect test to figure that out.

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Finally, we are wrapping this up, people- new listeners who just want to hear about the nobody,

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 as I wrap my cape around my face and go, "Ahh!"

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Because maybe I'm a vampire.

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 So, there you go. Now you may have-

319
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 You just thought you were listening to a podcast, listening to some funny stories.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 You just wanted to hear about the nobody.

321
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Instead, now you know you may actually be a vampire.

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 How's that for a PSA? How's that for a little public service announcement?

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I have now let you know your true fate in the world.

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Let's talk about fate, though, for real.

325
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Because this next story- again, this might be one of my favorite conspiracy theories.

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 "Bankleman." Let's fire up that- let's hop into Jason Jalopy, actually.

327
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 We are leaving behind- wherever we are at- where we're just at New York.

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 We're leaving behind New York. We're leaving behind this garden of misery and darkness.

329
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And we're going to drive out into the literal middle of nowhere.

330
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 My God, a couple lawn chairs set up and we're going to sit down.

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Suns slowly setting. Stars are starting to appear in the sky.

332
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Let's- let's have a little chat. Let's have a little talk here.

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Let's talk about the nobody. The nobody is a conspiracy theory that is really taking off.

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And I find this one absolutely fascinating. I have a long- long history with this one.

335
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And the other day I was doing a live stream and Big Boss was like,

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 "Hey, when are you going to talk about the nobody?" So I want to give a shout out to Big Boss for recommending this story.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So we're sitting out here in the dark. And let's talk about the nobody.

338
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 So the nobody is extremely popular nowadays. It's a really popular conspiracy theory.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 You see it all over the place. It's gaining a lot of attractions.

340
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And the nobody is this theory that there is a person out there who has special abilities.

341
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Extraordinary spiritual powers. Has the ability to control reality with their conscious and unconscious mind.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 That's an exact quote from the nobody general thread that pops up.

343
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I mean, I'd say almost every day on 4chan. There's usually multiple threads on the paranormal board on 4chan about the nobody a day.

344
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 There's almost always at least one. But the idea is that this person has some sort of mental abilities.

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And they're going through anguish. And their emotional turmoil is having an effect on the real world.

346
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 There's a woman. It's either an ex-girlfriend or a spiritually immature woman that's kind of toying with his feelings.

347
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And it's funny because they'll say that nobody can be a male or a female.

348
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 But we'll get into all that in a second.

349
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But anyway, so you have this figure that's the nobody who's extremely powerful.

350
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And the turmoil that this person is going through is affected in the real world.

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 This person, if they only knew the true scope of their power, could change the world for the better.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 There's a woman that's constantly kind of toying with his emotion.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Toying with his emotion, causing this turmoil. We're seeing the effects of this in our normal life.

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 So this popped up on 4chan, I think, in early 2019, late 2018, maybe.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And when I saw it pop up, I go, "Oh, it's about time. It's about time."

356
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 The reason why I find this conspiracy theory absolutely fascinating, I think it's one...

357
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I think it honestly can be one of the biggest conspiracy theories of our time.

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Because it's a blank slate conspiracy theory.

359
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 The idea is the person reading about the nobody can be the nobody.

360
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 That's the concept of it, right? That's the ego... It's an ego-driven conspiracy theory.

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 9/11 had nothing to do with me. I wasn't a player on either side of it.

362
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 But the conspiracy theory of exposing the truth, I've talked about this a lot on the show, it used to be 9/11 Truth.

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 The idea of having secret knowledge that most people don't have, that sheeple don't have, that I knew the answers.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 That's the ego-driven part. Conspiracy theory has a lot of ego in it.

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 If we want to be honest about it, we want to be honest about it.

366
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Here's a big drive for knowing secrets, for knowing the truth.

367
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And you have... And that's fine, everyone wants to know the truth, but it's this idea that you're smarter than other people,

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 or that you have access to some sort of hidden knowledge, which occult means hidden knowledge.

369
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 That's what that word means. You're separated from the masses.

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So I think that conspiracy theory does have an ego-driven element to it.

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Not all, I'm not saying every conspiracy theory is ego-driven, but you guys know what I'm talking about.

372
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 There's a certain type of conspiracy theory that really believes they're better than everyone else because they don't believe the lies.

373
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 They know the truth, stuff like that.

374
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Nobody takes that, and I think that's one of the reasons why conspiracy theory is so attractive in the first place.

375
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It's that you know more than other people. That guy may be better looking than me, that guy may make more money than me.

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 These people may have all of these things, but I know how the world's really run.

377
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So you can take all your material possessions, but I know more than you do.

378
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 But the nobody turns that part of the conspiracy theorist, I know more than you do, that little ego thing, turns it up to a thousand.

379
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Because you could be the nobody.

380
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 The nobody is written to be so vague.

381
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And when I say there's a lot of nobody threads on 4chan, most of them are "I am the nobody."

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I know I'm the nobody.

383
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Here's one actually I found when I was looking at this the other day.

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I'm not trying to blast this dude or anything like that, but this is pretty typical for what these normally say.

385
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Why me? This is someone saying why they think through the nobody.

386
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I'm a recluse, live alone, so no distractions.

387
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I have no commitments, no familial bonds, don't have nor need to get a typical 9-5 job.

388
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I've been almost all my time researching and attempting to make sense of things, and occasionally I attempt to directly influence others.

389
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 If you expect the nobody to be a grand arch wizard with an ancient bloodline or a mega gigachat, then you've little reason to entertain this.

390
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And that's the typical, I'm not putting that particular guy in blast, but that's very typical.

391
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 The reason why I believe I'm the nobody is because I do X.

392
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I sit around and I research this stuff.

393
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And I'll tell you this right now, like, research and conspiracy theory stuff is extremely solitary business.

394
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Like, paranormal researchers normally run in a pack, Sasquatch hunters run in a pack.

395
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Conspiracy theorists, it's very, very lonely business, so it's very easy to get into the mindset where you sit at home,

396
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 because I used to do it. I'd sit at home and be on god-like productions.

397
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 All these other conspiracy forums for 3-4 hours a day, learning the truth, learning how the world really works.

398
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And so you start to think that because you know how the mechanisms of power are turned and all this stuff,

399
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 that you have this hidden knowledge and then that nobody is turning it into, because you have this hidden knowledge,

400
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 because you've gathered all this stuff, the turmoil you're going through is controlling the world.

401
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 That's one of the most ego-driven conspiracy theories I've ever seen, and the component of the woman who's manipulating your emotions.

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I don't know how well that part of the conspiracy theory translates to women believing they're part of the nobody,

403
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 or that they're the nobody themselves. I've always come across the nobody being a male figure because of this woman figure.

404
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 But that's the idea, right? That a true nobody could be the most important person in the world.

405
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And that is the plot of Star Wars. Luke Skywalker was a nobody.

406
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Well, I mean, before the prequels. You're just a dude.

407
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Right? So there's something very attractive about that story, and it's even more attractive is that's you.

408
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But that's only half the story. This is what I find so fascinating about the nobody.

409
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 When it popped up on 4chan, I was like, "Eh, it's about time."

410
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Because the story goes back to 2010. Not a lot of people know this part of it.

411
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 This is really what I think is fascinating about this.

412
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Back in 2010, this is when I discovered it. July 1st, 2010.

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 There's a website called GodlikeProductions. It's still in operation.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 It's a forum for conspiracy theorists. Really bizarre stuff, right?

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 July 1st, 2010, there was a user named Thirteen. They created a forum post.

416
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 It was called "The Illuminati was made an offer they couldn't refuse."

417
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 This went on for 2,067 pages of responses.

418
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 It lasted all the way from July 1st, 2010 until they finally locked it in July of 2014.

419
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And this is how it started off. This is the origin of this thing that's taking over 4chan.

420
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It had already taken over Godlike Productions and basically became a meme way back then.

421
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 People just got tired of talking about it and now it's moved somewhere else.

422
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Because it's so powerful. Imagine you could...

423
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 We just spent 20 minutes talking about the guy who thought he was a vampire.

424
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "Well, I'm not a vampire. They're not real, but you come across this and you go, 'Maybe I am the nobody.'"

425
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 It all comes from this original forum post. Here we go.

426
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "Don't ask me how I know this, but the lack of doom lately is caused by a wild card."

427
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 "Someone who the Illuminati did not expect."

428
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 "This person apparently came out of nowhere."

429
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 "He is a nothing, a nobody, yet much hangs in the balance because of him."

430
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And then it goes on with the rest of that post.

431
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 It'll be in the show notes. You can take a look at it.

432
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 It was a throwaway line. He's a nothing. He's a nobody.

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And from that, people started to craft this character.

434
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Over the course of 2067 pages of forum posts,

435
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 they began to craft this character of who the nobody is.

436
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 See, the original version, it was tied to the Illuminati.

437
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And I followed this for years.

438
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And to be honest, there was a time period where I thought, "Maybe I'm the nobody."

439
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 But what's interesting about it is that's how blank-slated it is.

440
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Or at least that's how blank-slated started off,

441
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 because originally the nobody could have been anybody.

442
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 But you gotta be a man.

443
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Nowadays, they're kind of trying to say that nobody could be a woman as well.

444
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 But originally, the setup was this.

445
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 This is the story that was crafted over the course of, again, 2067 pages of forum posts.

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 The Illuminati back in 2010 was getting ready to make a big move.

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Remember, this is before 2012.

448
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 This is, of course, you guys know how to do math, but this is before the supposed end of the world.

449
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 The Illuminati was getting ready to make some big move.

450
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And God, the origins of this very religious tied in the Illuminati,

451
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 a lot of that's been lost in the current version that people are talking about.

452
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 God tells the Illuminati, "I have a deal.

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I'm going to take this nobody, and I'm going to have him affect your plans in some way or the other."

454
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And how you react to that will determine how badly I punish you.

455
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 There's other...that's the...that was kind of the main theory that was crafted.

456
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 You'll find other variations of that.

457
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 But that was the main theory of this craft.

458
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So now, not only are you a person whose inner turmoil can affect the metaphysical realities of the world,

459
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 you are God's appointed soldier against the Illuminati.

460
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 That is addictive ego juice.

461
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And again, you saw this evolution of it.

462
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 First off, the nobody was a literal nobody.

463
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 He could have been anyone reading that form post July 1st, 2010, when I was reading it.

464
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Could have been me.

465
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Could have been an out of work dude sitting at his grandma's house,

466
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 stoned reading paranoid conspiracy theory stuff all the time.

467
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Could have been that guy.

468
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And this idea that there were these ultra powerful elite people

469
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 who now knew that little Jason guy, little guy hanging out in Orangevale, California,

470
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 they knew about him and they were stewing over him.

471
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 "Oh, we gotta stop him."

472
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And I didn't know my destiny.

473
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I didn't know what was coming.

474
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 That's how the theory...that's how the conspiracy started off.

475
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 But then it started to change.

476
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And it's funny because each time it changed, you lost people.

477
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 People stopped believing it.

478
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Then it became this thing and the guy said, he goes, "It's not some high wizard or some mega gigachad."

479
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Which is basically just like an alpha, a super alpha male is what he means.

480
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 It started off that it's literally nobody who does not know what his destiny is.

481
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Oh, and the woman they keep talking about, the spiritually immature woman,

482
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 is known as the woman of scars.

483
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 She was another character that was added late into the myth building of this.

484
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 At some point, somebody talked about the woman of scars.

485
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 She was a woman who was going to either tempt the nobody away,

486
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 get the nobody to serve the Illuminati, or end up teaming up with the nobody to take down the Illuminati.

487
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Again, you were seeing competing mythologies fighting.

488
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 So first off, the nobody could have been anybody.

489
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Then it came to this thing where the nobody could be anybody.

490
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 The Illuminati doesn't know who the nobody is either and they're looking for him.

491
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 That would be exciting because your life is going nowhere, but now you're reading this stuff

492
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 and you honestly believe that powerful people are trying to find you.

493
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And while that may be terrifying, at the same time, if you're reading this in your 65,

494
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 that'd be super spooky, right? Because you're not really going to be able to run anywhere.

495
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 But if you're 25, if you're 19, you're reading this stuff, you don't have anything to run away from.

496
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Like you leave and it's fine, you have a dead-end job.

497
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 You can imagine the Illuminati coming after you.

498
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 So that was very attractive. But then it started to morph again.

499
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And as the myth morphed, because what happened was the guy who made this up, or the guy who...

500
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 He says he exposed it. He said he uncovered Illuminati plans.

501
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He found out about all this stuff.

502
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Of course, people are going to want more information.

503
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 So he's providing more information, which would be canon information from the guy who created the conspiracy theory.

504
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Other people adding into.

505
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Eventually, the conspiracy theory became that nobody knows who he is.

506
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 He actually is a chosen person.

507
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And at this point in the mythology, he is having meetings with the Illuminati.

508
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And he's like, "I won't allow you to do that to humanity."

509
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And at that point, thousands of people stopped paying attention to the conspiracy theory.

510
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Myself included. Because the ego was gone.

511
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 I've never had a meeting with the Illuminati.

512
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 It was built up so expertly in the beginning that it could be any of us.

513
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Every day I could wake up, but out of work, out of shape, pot smoker,

514
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 logging into these conspiracy theories, and thinking in my head,

515
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 "Oh, I wonder if today is the day that the Illuminati is going to kick down my door."

516
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But when it came about that, "Oh, no, he's having these..."

517
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Don't worry, guys.

518
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 The nobody met with the Illuminati over the weekend, and I was like, "Oh, this is dumb."

519
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 But once it came out that the nobody...

520
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Once the myth... Once basically the author of the story had to push it forward.

521
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And... and continue the narrative of the nobody meeting with the Illuminati,

522
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and the Illuminati being like, "Oh, the chosen one is here! How dare you to file our fortress!"

523
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Oh, that stuff... thousands of people dropped off.

524
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Because it wasn't them.

525
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Now, that doesn't mean that that's killed it on the spot.

526
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Like, it did continue, but it was definitely less popular then.

527
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And it continued... the narrative continued for a while.

528
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 I still read about it. I still looked into it, but I go, "Well, I know I'm not the nobody now."

529
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 The narrative continued, and he was saving the day, and he met the woman of scars,

530
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 and the woman of scars.

531
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 I think they did end up like she did end up helping them at the end.

532
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 It was just like poorly written Wattpad story at this point.

533
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 It goes on and on.

534
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 So, expertly designed, though.

535
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 At the beginning, it really hooked you, because it makes you think you could be the nobody.

536
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And the thread basically gets locked in 2014.

537
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 You'll still see nobody references on god-like productions.

538
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 A lot of times they're just jokes.

539
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It's like their big meme.

540
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 It's the biggest thing, really, that's ever come out of god-like productions.

541
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 But it didn't shock me.

542
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I guess it kind of shocked me, because as far as I concerned, it was a dead-and-buried conspiracy theory.

543
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 It was fun while it lasted.

544
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 But then we see we go from 2014 and get locked down to about 20...

545
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And it may have popped up, I'm sure it popped up on 4chan in between there,

546
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 but it really got popular around 2018, 2019.

547
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And it started from the beginning.

548
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 But the developers doing it now learned the lesson.

549
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Keep it vague for as long as possible.

550
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Keep it vague.

551
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Keep it so every time someone logs on, looks for that nobody general,

552
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 they really feel like it still could be them.

553
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Because they're not a nobody, they're a somebody.

554
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 They're the most important person in the world.

555
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 I love that.

556
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 I mean, I love that conspiracy theory, absolutely.

557
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Because it's one of those ones that's fascinating to talk about,

558
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 and the psychology behind it.

559
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 This conspiracy theory is genetically modified to stroke your ego.

560
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And I think it's going to be one of the biggest conspiracy theories in the next couple years.

561
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I honestly think it will be as big as 9/11 conspiracy theories.

562
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 It's one conspiracy theory that it doesn't matter...

563
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 It does depend...

564
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 They're changing it so it doesn't matter if you're male or female,

565
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 it doesn't depend when you're born, it doesn't depend on your race, your religion, anything like that.

566
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It is a conspiracy theory that is created to make you feel like the most powerful person on Earth.

567
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And who doesn't want to feel that way?

568
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Who doesn't want to feel that way?

569
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Some people think they're their vampires, other people think that they can control reality.

570
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 It's the same mental mechanism.

571
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 It's this idea that we are left out, we are alone, we are sad.

572
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 But if only someone knew who we really were, if only we knew who we really were,

573
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 and we could discover who we really were, everything would be better.

574
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 But you know at a certain point I had to, I mean, and I think everyone comes to this,

575
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 you may not be able to save the world, but you can save yourself.

576
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Like being out of shape, being out of work, smoking weed all the time.

577
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Those weren't healthy things for me, those weren't healthy behaviors.

578
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And so I had to go, well maybe I'm not the nobody, but I definitely am somebody who can get their life together a little bit better than it is right now.

579
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 And it's funny, I think a lot of times people get lost a lot of times,

580
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 and we see a lot in the conspiracy theory community, but I think it happens everywhere,

581
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 we get lost in these big ideas, we know the truth, we know the secrets,

582
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 and all of that, just work on yourself first.

583
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 I know it's a meme, clean your room, but you can totally indulge in all the conspiracy theory stuff.

584
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 As long as it's safe, that's my thing.

585
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 I look at it as fun research, like this conspiracy theory, I find absolutely fascinating.

586
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I've come a long way, again in my journey, I used to not be skeptical about anything, I used to believe it all.

587
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And now I'm more skeptical, but I still find enjoyment in it too.

588
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I'm not so skeptical, I don't believe in any conspiracy theories.

589
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 But yeah, at a certain point I realized that nobody or somebody or just Jason Carpenter,

590
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I needed to take care of myself first.

591
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 And you definitely need to take care of yourself first, because if I was the nobody and I was his out of shape,

592
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 and the Illuminati came kicking in my door, things aren't going to go well,

593
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 then nobody would have been taking off the game board like that.

594
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 So it's okay to have those ego-driven dreams, I mean there's just day dreams, right?

595
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 It's okay to have those day dreams, it's okay, and it's even okay to think you know more than other people.

596
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 That's just, again, I think part of the human condition, but when you have a conspiracy theory that is designed to take advantage of the human condition,

597
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 you almost got to think, who designed it in the first place?

598
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 I'm sure a lot of really good conspiracy researchers who otherwise were on the right track about some real conspiracies,

599
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I'm sure a lot of them got distracted by this, and may still be distracted by this.

600
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 You may have someone who was this close to uncovering some corporate conspiracy,

601
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 and instead now they're running around with a wizard cape on thinking that the Illuminati's looking for them.

602
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 And if they have two more weeks, they can bring the whole system down.

603
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 You got to be careful what rabbit holes you go down, because you go down the wrong one,

604
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 you're wasting your time, and the right rabbit hole is getting covered up, buried, and you'll never find it again.
