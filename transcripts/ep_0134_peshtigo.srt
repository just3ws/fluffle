1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 Giant rats terrorize Iran. A couple brings their kids to church and things do not go well.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 And then we talk about the great fires of 1871. You know about the Chicago fire.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,500
 It's a nursery rhyme, I think. But do you know about the other fires in America?

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
 That same day. That's important. That is the same day.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 More death, more destruction, and all the fires may have been caused by something out of this world.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,500
 [music]

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I'm putting together some stuff for our New Year's Eve episode.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And I know most people will be listening to this one on New Year's Eve. So technically it's the New Year's Day episode.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But we will be having some stuff come out.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Now, other than that little note, oh and I have a special episode. I have a regular episode coming out for New Year's Day.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And then I have a special episode. It's actually, it's a behind the scenes story of the creation of Dead Rabbit.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,500
 You're thinking, "Jason, that's a little ridiculous. You've only been around for six months."

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,000
 However, I want to know that type of stuff. I love director's commentaries and stuff like that.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,500
 It'll be a bonus episode. Just be sitting there for you if you want to listen to it.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,500
 I really go into depth about how the show was created. Some of the obstacles I've overcome.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,000
 My least favorite episode. The episode that almost made me quit the show. I talk about that.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,500
 I talk about my favorite episodes. The episodes that I think have had the most impact on the growth of the show.

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,000
 And then I talk about a controversy. And the time the podcast was almost canceled.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Not because of me, but because of some issues going on behind the scenes.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So all of that stuff will be in our bonus episode. You'll get your regular one and then you'll get a special bonus one as well.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So, let's go ahead and get started here. So first off, let's go ahead and start talking about Iran.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So, right now, so apparently, I didn't know this, but apparently Iran has always had a rat problem.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Rodents. Giant rodents. And they've constantly been poisoning them.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,500
 And eventually when you poison a rat so many times, it stops working after a certain point.

28
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,000
 I guess 75% of the rats in Britain are immune to what would it be called?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Well, rat poison, obviously, but I'm sure it has a technical name like raticide or mouseicide or whatever their genus is.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 That's probably listed in there as well.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But anyway, so Iran has been trying to poison the rats and is, you know, fairly successful, but rats develop an immunity to poison.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That's just something that happens, apparently.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,500
 So then they began, no joke, they began irradiating them.

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,000
 They're like, well, if the poison doesn't work, no one's immune to radiation.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Let's just basically like irradiate their homes.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,500
 Now, yes, that is the setup for every 1950s movie ever.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,000
 And Iran is now experiencing a 1950s movie because the rats are as big as cats.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 They're giant mutant rats.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And Iran, the government of Iran has said they're mutants.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,500
 They've mutated from the radioactivity and now they're huge.

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,000
 And I guess they're having a lot of snow melt off over there and it's flooding the rats' nest.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 So the country is just awash in rats.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,500
 Big, smelly, all wet because the water came in their homes.

44
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,000
 Rats are disgusting.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I remember once I was walking down the street here in Hood River at like four in the morning.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And I'm walking in between two restaurants.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Well, I'm not like literally like walking in an alley between them, but I'm walking on the street and on one side,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I'm not going to name the restaurants because this is really, I think it's gross.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 On one side of the street's one restaurant, on the other side of the street's this other restaurant,

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,500
 and I'm walking down the sidewalk and I see the biggest rat I've ever seen.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,000
 It was the size, it looked like the size of a 12 pack of soda.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
 It looked, okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,000
 Okay, but an 8 pack of soda.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And it crawls out of the sewer of one restaurant, lazily walks across the street and crawls into the sewer of the next restaurant.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I was like, I'm never eating there again.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 That's disgusting.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Of course I did indeed.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He keep eating at both of those restaurants, but it was pretty gross to see something that large and it was just wet and gross, man.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So anyways, imagine that, but the two restaurants is the entire country of Iran.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Now, the Iranian government is like, they're mutants.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 These rats have been mutated by radiation.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 They're giant.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And scientists have said, you know, because scientists are kind of like, they're party poopers.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 They're like, that's not how mutations work.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 You can't just irradiate an animal and it gets bigger.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 This isn't a 1950s movie.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 It's probably just because they've just gotten big.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 These are survival of the fittest and the biggest rats are the kings.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And you know what a rat king is?

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 This is disgusting.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I know I keep going off on tangents here, but a rat king, some people say they don't exist.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Again, scientists are party poopers, but a rat king is when so many rats get caught in a tunnel, like a sewage tunnel, that their tails get tied together.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You know how like you'll throw like three power cables in a box and then like an hour later you come back and they're all tangled up?

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Imagine that, but 100 rats and their tails get tangled together and they begin just rolling through the sewer because the rats at the bottom are like, I can't breathe underwater.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And so they'll push the ball so they get to the top to catch a breath and the rats on the bottom will be like, so it just goes over and over again.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Basically, it's the real life equivalent of gelatinous ooze from D&D.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 They just roll through the sewers, eating people.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 They don't live very long, but only if they live to be like five minutes old or whatever.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's still quite terrifying.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So back to the story that I'm trying to tell, the rats in Iran are so just like vicious and huge that the Iranian government has said, we don't believe you scientists.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 We believe that these guys are mutants.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And how do you stop a mutant?

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Not with getting your own team of mutants.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 No, they have a team of dedicated snipers that now just hunt giant rats.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Last count that I saw, they had already killed 2,000 rats.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 But these, I mean, that would kind of be a cool job because you're just doing what you love, shooting stuff, and you become a better sniper because of it because they're, you know, smaller than a human.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 A rat the size of a cat is probably a good as a target to get good at shooting people in the head.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So, I mean, that's kind of grim.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 If we ever go to war with Iran, they're going to be like super good at crack shots because they're like, man, I've been shooting Wamp rats in the desert since, okay, that was a stupid joke.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Okay, but anyway, so Iran, I do wish you luck.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I hope you take care of your giant rat problem.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And I'm on your side.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I'm not politically, but I'm on your side.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I think they're mutants.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Don't listen to the scientists.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Scientists say that Pluto is not a planet.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So what do they know?

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I know it's a different branch of science, but it's all the same, really.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Our next story is part of new news.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So this one's going to be a quick one and it's kind of bizarre.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Well, the whole thing's bizarre, but it's also bizarre how it ends.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 So we're in the magical weird year of 2004.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I'm learning, oh, and I looked, my new news folder still has like 200 other stories that I have to go through and find out if they're worth doing anything on.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 2004 was a banner year for weirdness.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It's turning out.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 We're in the city of Rochester, which I believe is in New York, but maybe it's near New York.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I'm pretty sure that's where Professor Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters was.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Was in Rochester, but I could be wrong.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 But we're in the city of Rochester.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's 2004, that magical, magical year.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 This couple comes in to a church, bringing their three kids with them, a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old, and a two-year-old little baby person, right?

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 They walk into church.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It's nighttime.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And, you know, in New York, I think in big cities, you can have churches that are open late, or maybe they're 24 hours a day.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I don't know.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 But usually there's like nuns walking around.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I'm assuming this is a Catholic church.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I've actually never seen a Protestant church open, like, really later than the service, maybe a little bit after.

119
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 But anyways, they walk into a church of a denomination I do not know.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 There are nuns there and the Protestants are like, "Why are you here?

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 This is the Southern Baptist Church."

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And they're like, "Sorry, we're lost and we needed to pray."

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Anyways, the point of the story is that this couple walks in with their kids, and they're kind of looking around, and no one really pays them any mind.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 They don't look like super weird, but they're a little sketchy.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There's something about them that's kind of making people pay attention to them.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Maybe it's just six cents.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So, what happens is one of the workers at the church, one of these nuns who's in the wrong church, is standing there, and she--

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I hope it's nuns.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I have no idea.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 But anyways, it's just, I might not say church workers.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Maybe it was the bingo person.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 They hear the woman say to the husband, "Let's go make the sacrifice."

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And then they kind of mill about the church for a while.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And at this point, the church workers are like, "Okay, they didn't seem super sketchy, but they seemed kind of sketchy."

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And now they're talking about making a sacrifice, so they call the police, which is probably a good thing, especially for what happens next.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 The police show up, they begin questioning the couple, take the couple back to the station.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And when they're talking to the woman, she says, "They were going to sacrifice the kids in the church, the nine, the seven, and the two-year-old.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It was their plan to go there, kind of look around, check the place out, and then sacrifice them."

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 It's interesting because I wonder what their plan was with the other people there.

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I wonder what they-- like, were they going to sacrifice them to?

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Like, was there just going to be this long receiving line of sacrificial offerings?

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Or were they just going to do it so quick and then not worry about it?

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Because her logic was this. This is what she told the police.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 She said, "Jesus sacrificed himself for her, so she was going to sacrifice her boys to free her soul."

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Which, her interpretation of the Bible is a little off, because technically, according to the Bible, when Jesus sacrificed him--

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I always get so funny, I always see a listener drop when I start talking about Jesus, but it'll only be 10 seconds.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 According to the Bible, Jesus sacrificed himself to save your soul, and then he doesn't go, "Hey, man, pay it forward."

148
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Like, there was no collateral added to any part of the Bible as far as that goes.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But for whatever reason, she had it in her head saying, "Well, he sacrificed himself for me, so I'm going to sacrifice my kids for--

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 to free my soul." It's very, very odd.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And what I think is interesting about this type of behavior is that she may have had that delusion, but the husband was going along with it.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So, it's just weird. I don't know if there was, like, drugs involved or something like that.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 So, now we're in the year 2018, 14 years later, and so I'm like, "Well, what happened?"

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 No follow-up to the story, no sentence, no conviction, nothing like that.

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Which makes me think that the charges are revocated, or she went to get mental counseling.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Because technically, she didn't commit a crime. I mean, you could say child endangerment or something like that.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But as far as I could tell, she was never charged.

158
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Now, that doesn't mean she wasn't. It could just be that the news didn't cover it after certain point.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It was just another crazy person in Rochester.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But, yeah, weird story. Weird story.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And it's a good thing those people were paying attention to what was going on, because otherwise, it could have gotten--could have gotten bad.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I mean, understatement, three kids sacrificed, but, yeah, it could have been pretty sucky.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Okay, so the next story we're going to look at today is...

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Oh, yeah, this one was really interesting, because I came assembled across this on accident, really.

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 I don't even know how I found it.

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 But we're in the year--let's hop in the Carpenter copter.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Carpenter copter is actually pretty sturdy. You can handle these time warps.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So 2004 is not really a time jump. We just kind of like turn our heads lightly and we're back in 2004.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 But when we're going way back in time, we want the Carpenter copter. We want to ride in style, and it can handle any sort of time warp.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 So...

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 [imitates carpenter copter]

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I don't know where we found that time warp. We were just at the airport.

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 We slowly lifted off the ground slightly, disappeared back in time.

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 But we are going back in time. We're going back to the year 1871.

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 So when this helicopter appears out of nowhere, everyone's like, "Oh my God, it's a giant demon. It's super loud."

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And the pilot looks like he's really terrible at flying that thing, whatever it is.

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 [imitates carpenter copter]

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And we land and we jump out of it. It's a specific date. It's October 8th, 1871.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Four days after my birthday, which would probably matter if I was born 100 years earlier than I actually was.

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So we're in 1871. It's October 8th.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 We're in the Midwest. I think it's the Midwest. It's like Chicago and Michigan and stuff like that.

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Wisconsin. So that's close.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's Illinois. I think that's more East. But anyways, it doesn't matter. We're in that area.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And we land next to a farm and we go and we see this woman milking a cow.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And you guys all know the story. The Great Chicago Fire rushed through the city.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It destroyed 3.3 square miles of the city.

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It left 100,000 people homeless, which was one-third of the population at that time. 300 people died.

188
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It just raised the city. And the kind of joke explanation was the cow kicked over a lantern in Miss O'Larry's barn and it started the Great Chicago Fire.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That was an old nursery rhyme. And I think most people who hear the term "Great Chicago Fire" are like, "Oh, yeah, the one where the cow kicked it over."

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Now, apparently the fire, they did say started in that barn, but it didn't have nothing to do with the cow kicking it over.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And everyone that got tons of news coverage and they're like, "Oh my God, like 3.3 square miles of a major city burned to the ground.

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 100,000 people homeless. 300 people dead. This is the most horrible fire tragedy that America has faced yet."

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But we're going to travel just a bit, just a little bit over to Michigan.

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Now it's the same day, the Great Michigan Fire. And you know, they're probably like, "They don't have internet or television."

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 But they're like, "Man, I heard something really bad happen in Chicago. I don't know how, but I know it because I don't have a newspaper or a television."

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But I know it. The Great Michigan Fire spread across three cities, three different little townships, raised just...

197
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 That's a machine gun noise, but...

198
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Crackle, log, that's a fire noise.

199
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Crackle, crackle.

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 You're like, "Jason, I get it. You're quitting the sound effects. Something's on fire."

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 In Michigan, 3,900 square miles burn. Now it's not entire city squares, but you would have a city or a town, it's probably a better term for it, just...

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I don't know why I'm doing gunshot noises.

203
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Go up, it would cut swaths through forests, just lighting everything up.

204
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 500 people or more killed across these three communities.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And the reason why they go or more is because the place had...

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 There was a big lumber industry, so you had a lot of lumberjacks there, people moving to that area specifically to cut trees down, and then they would move on.

207
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 So they don't know how many people died in the forest. They're like, "And it could be higher than 500."

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Because we had people there cutting trees down that weren't members of the community, they're just kind of like migrant workers.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So it could be higher than 500. So it definitely a bigger fire than Chicago, as far as square miles, and more people died.

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 But the problem was that everyone was focused on Chicago because it was a big city.

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So people... Well, the people in Michigan were focused on the fire right in front of them.

212
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But nationwide, people were like, "Oh my God, did you hear about Chicago?"

213
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And Michigan's like, "Hey, remember me? They're still covered in soot."

214
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And the people were like, "No, did you visit Chicago? Why do you look like you just walked out of a fire?"

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And they're like, "Ugh."

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But on the same day as the Great Chicago Fire, as the Great Michigan Fire, in Wisconsin, we're going to hop in the Carbenter Copture because we want to go here and visit this place.

217
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 We want a first-hand account of Pestigo Fire.

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Pestigo was a community in Wisconsin, and it was like this town, I think. It was, again, a good word for it.

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And it kind of looped around this bay.

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You had this water thing in the middle of it, a lake, is probably the scientific term.

221
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 The community wrapped around like a horseshoe.

222
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 On October 8th, 1871, Pestigo Fire starts.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Now, starts out in the field and rapidly grows.

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And the reason why is there was a cold front coming in, and it created very, very quickly what's known as a firestorm.

225
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Now, a firestorm is a very specific scientific term, not just the name of a movie starring Howie Long from the '90s.

226
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Firestorm is a very specific scientific term.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Superheated flames at least 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So if it's only 1,999 people are like, "Pfft, go back to school. Get to 2,000." But if it's at least 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and it has winds of 110 miles per hour, or stronger, it doesn't heck and be over that.

230
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 That is what is considered a firestorm.

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So it's moving incredibly fast. You can't out-drive that, especially not like in a, like a Hyundai or something.

232
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 You would, I mean, you're 110 miles an hour, and it's 2,000 degrees, even if you were in a car that say was going 120 miles an hour.

233
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 By the time you started to put distance between you, your tires would melt.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And they didn't have cars back then, so it doesn't matter. They were just totally boned.

235
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 It torched everything.

236
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 A fire tornado appeared and hit a train, knocking the train cars over.

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Now, that might be a little dramatic. The train wasn't moving. It wasn't like, "Keep going, keep going."

238
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 It's like, "Chucka, chucka, chucka, chucka." And there's like this tornado chasing, and they're like, "It went too close."

239
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It was just sitting still. I should have made that specific from the beginning. It was just sitting there.

240
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And fire tornado, pfft, knocked stuff over, knocked over a train car.

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Now, 1,875 square miles burned.

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So, bigger than both of them. Wait, was that bigger than both of them? Now I have to double check the Great Michigan one.

243
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Oh, no, it was smaller than Great Michigan one. Okay, so...

244
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 But still, first is the worst, second is the best. 1,875 square miles burned.

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So many people died. They don't know. They're best guests.

246
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So, in Chicago we had 300, and in Great Michigan we had 500.

247
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The Pashtego fire, between 1,500 and 2,500 people, dead.

248
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It happened within like minutes. You have this huge death toll.

249
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Because the fire was moving super fast, and it was just cutting everyone down.

250
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 And this is the interesting thing. Well, it's not interesting. It's quite dark.

251
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So many people died, and the fire... there weren't enough people left to identify remains.

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So they just started throwing them in a big pit.

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Entire families and neighborhoods and communities... no one was left to say, "Oh, that's Joey, and that's Margaret, and that's Malcolm," or whatever.

254
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 There was nobody left to say, "Oh, yeah, I know that guy," because they all needed someone to go, "Hey, I know that guy," and they were just all burnt to a crisp.

255
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Some people said, because you know there was that water in the middle. Some people go, "Hey, I got an idea. Let's hide in the water."

256
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And that's a good idea, if the flames are coming.

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But it was also October in Wisconsin. So some people jumped in the water and they survived, but other people died of hypothermia.

258
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I talked about that on a previous episode about ghost boats, where the boat was on fire on one end, and it was covered in ice on the other end.

259
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 It was going down the Tagahoochee or whatever. That you had your choice. You could either burn or freeze to death.

260
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And that was the same thing here. You could jump in the water and risk freezing to death, or you could stay on land, and it was 100% chance of burning.

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Now there was one anecdotal story. A young girl saw a cow jump in the water, and so she jumped on the cow and held onto its horn until the fire passed.

262
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 I think that story is totally fake, because I don't know how good swimmer's cows are. Plus I'm a little iffy whether or not cows have horns.

263
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Anyways, they might, but I don't think they're strong swimmers. I don't think that is a skill that cows are normally known for.

264
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Now, this was tragedy, obviously. And there's not a lot of funny stuff and a tragedy.

265
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 However, I did read a story about a man, his neighborhood, went up in flames. His house went up in flames, and he ran into the smoke to save his wife.

266
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 He didn't slip on banana peel. It's not that type of funny, but that actually would be pretty funny too.

267
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 But he runs into the smoke to save his wife. He grabs her, he picks her up, he runs out of the smoke, he runs down the street, he gets away from the fire, looks down.

268
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It's not his wife, it's another random woman, and he began wailing. Wailing, because he knew that meant that his wife died in the fire.

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Now, that sounds like something he would see on a loony tune. Bugs Bunny runs, well there's no loony tunes where a giant fire kills everybody, but Daffy Duck runs into a house to go rescue.

270
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Does he have a girlfriend? Well, it's Danny Duck. And instead he runs out and he's holding Bugs Bunny in a wig, and he hears the horrible cries of Danny Duck dying in the flames.

271
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And then they cut to just a roasted duck sitting on a plate and he's wailing. I call BS on that story too. It sounds horrible, but I call BS because how would that story be related to anybody?

272
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Either the guy is sitting in a bar and he's like "Yeah, you know the biggest regret of my life." One day I ran into a burning building and saved the wrong woman.

273
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 The other people at the bar would be like "Well yeah, that's kind of sad, but you saved a human life." So he wouldn't tell that story.

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 I don't think the woman would tell that story because then she'd be like "Yeah, one day I got saved, but he saved the wrong woman. I should have burned horribly in that fire."

275
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And I don't think a bystander would have known what was going on. So there's really no one to relay that story. I think it's, again, anecdotal.

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 But, another note, before I get on with the conspiracy theory, because I'm not just going to talk about people dying horribly in fires, the government, so everyone was more focused on Chicago, but the US government,

277
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 steadied the Pashtego fire and they said "How can we make this fire happen artificially as a weapon of war?" So they steadied wind patterns and they steadied burn stuff.

278
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They're like rubbing charcoal between their hand and they're like "Yep, okay, now I know how to build a perfect weapon." They're like "Seriously dude, you just rubbed some charcoal between your hands. He's all tasting it."

279
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Yeah, let's go to the lab. So anyways, when they started building incendiary bombs, they looked at the model for Pashtego to see what would be the best environment to drop them in as far as structures and as far as like weather, what would work best.

280
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Because firestorms happen, but they're kind of rare and they're super dangerous, so it's not like you want to be out there in the field steadying them.

281
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So when they started firebombing Dresden and Tokyo during World War II, they modeled the bombing patterns and stuff like that from what they knew from the Pashtego fire.

282
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 If you can take the power of nature and turn that into a weapon, you're nearly unstoppable. That's something Cobra Commander does, but anyways, so the US government did that.

283
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Let's get to the crazy conspiracy thing though. At the time, again, people focused on the Chicago fire and I should also say that Pashtego fire, all of their communication devices burned down, so they weren't able to get out the message that hey, we have this big fire.

284
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 So looking back, researchers, armchair scientists, things like that, came up with a theory. They're like, how could you have these huge fires all happening on the same day, starting on the same day, across such a large geographical area?

285
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 If they were closer, you could say Embers from Chicago went to Michigan and Embers from Michigan went to Pashtego and there was even more fires in America that day, but none of them hit that level.

286
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 So people started to come up with a theory, meteorites. Now, at the same time, there was this comet that used to exist, it's completely dead now, but at the same time, there was a comet that had been flying around, it showed up every six years, it was called Bela's Comet,

287
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 and every time it got back, it got a little more small, broken into two, and then broken even less and stuff like that.

288
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But 1871 was when the comet was supposed to come back. Now, they hadn't seen it the past two times, I believe, that it had come by, and so scientists were like, oh, it must have completely broken up, because we already knew that it was starting to fragment.

289
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 But the theory is, is that chunks of it crashed into Earth, and the pushback, and started these fires. There was basically like a shotgun blast of fires hitting across America.

290
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 The pushback, the scientific community, has said, interesting because there's a lot of dispute, and then the other people have pretty good arguments.

291
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 The debunkers are saying, well, meteorites aren't hot when they hit the ground, you can actually walk up and pick one up.

292
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Now, that's a lie, because I saw the blob, and you can't touch those rocks. Actually, wait, no, that one was super cold.

293
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 That's not right, because I've seen other movies where the rocks come down and they're super hot, and they go, ow, actually no, even those movies, they go, ow, it's so cold.

294
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Anyways, scientists point one, they come down, they're so cold, I saw the blob, it's too cold to touch.

295
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 But the pushback, the other guys were saying, the commentarians will say, they're saying, well, that's true, but it's only cold a millimeter deep,

296
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 and it's only cold if they're of a certain composition, so we don't know for sure that all of them do this,

297
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 but the ones that people run up and touch, or the ones that contain blobs, are cold, however, they could be hotter.

298
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 So the debunkers go, well, comets are ice, so it can't actually fall down and set fires, so another point, debunkers.

299
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 The commentarians said, actually, we know that the Beale Comet passed through an asteroid belt and started bringing asteroids with it,

300
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 and we don't know what those were full of. They said they could have been full of methane, which would be explosive,

301
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 or this other chemical that I don't remember, started with an A-C-E, that is also explosive.

302
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 They said, the comet itself may have disintegrated, it may never have shown up to Earth,

303
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 but it threw these other asteroids at us like a shotgun, and they just hit across America,

304
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and people at the scene of the fires said preceding the fires, you saw fireballs coming down.

305
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Now, I take that with a grain of salt, because they probably had a lot of smoke in their eyes,

306
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and really the chances of them looking up and then seeing a bunch of fireballs coming down,

307
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I think probably stuff was on fire, and they may have seen fire stuff, but who knows?

308
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Because they don't know why so many fires started on that same day,

309
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and what's interesting is a lot of the debunking articles were like, it was really dry, it was a dry season, which is true,

310
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 or is the month of October well known for having a bunch of fires?

311
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I mean, I guess we had all those wildfires in Los Angeles, not more than a couple months ago, but I don't know.

312
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I think about it, it was cold enough in the water that you could die of hypothermia,

313
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 but you could also have a massive fire going on on the shore, so that's where the temperature thing kind of throws me off.

314
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 So did the breakup of a comet cause these massive fires? Can it happen again?

315
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 I don't have the answer for either of those questions, but I think they're interesting questions,

316
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 and I think it's crazy that all these fires, and again, I just highlighted the three of them,

317
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 there were a lot of other minor fires, and in Canada, but there was in multiple states, like I think Iowa had a fire,

318
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 like you had this stuff, this big circle, not close enough that embers could fly from one state to the other,

319
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 but close enough that if nature took a giant shotgun and filled it full of asteroids and comet bits and just went pfft,

320
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 close enough to do some serious damage.

321
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So who knows? We won't know actually until it happens again, and hopefully it never does, but we will see.
