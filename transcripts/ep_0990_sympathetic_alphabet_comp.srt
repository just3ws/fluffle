1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
 America is a nation in decline.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,340
 And if you disagree with that, then please tell me how in a free country a man could

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,080
 be minding his own business sweeping up his kitchen at 1.30 in the morning when the lovable

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,560
 sitcom character Alf kicks down his door and shoves a hose in his throat.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,000
 You got an answer for that?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,920
 America's burning people.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:37,080
 And then we travel to Australia, the alphalist country as it's known, to join a young school

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,640
 teacher on a walk.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,040
 She's just enjoying nature, feeling the warm sunshine on her skin, birds chirping in the

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,640
 trees.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,040
 But everything changes when she found a statue missing an arm.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,520
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing out in the world of

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,000
 being you unless you're a shapeshifter.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,840
 And I hope you're having fun being someone else.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,400
 But someone who I know only shapeshifts twice a year walking into Dead Rabbit Command right

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
 now.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,800
 Everyone give it up for one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 And Idea Guy.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 Woohoo!

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,800
 Yeah, walk on in, walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,040
 Long time supporter of the show.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,480
 And Idea Guy, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,080
 You guys know what I'm going to say.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,520
 You can't support the Patreon if you can't support the show financially.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
 That is okay.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
 You're not a freeloader.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,160
 There's a lot of other podcasters called people who don't give them money.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
 It's ridiculous.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
 It's okay.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,360
 Just help spread the word about the show.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,480
 That helps out so much.

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,080
 I really, really do appreciate that support as well.

38
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,720
 You guys don't have to give me money.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,120
 And Idea Guy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,960
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 Put your seatbelts on.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:18,240
 We're driving all the way out to Texas.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
 And Idea Guy is leading the way.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 Now I got to be honest.

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,720
 When I started this story, I have the vaguest memory of one of you guys suggesting this

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
 story and I don't know who it was.

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,560
 So if that's the case and I forget to name you in this episode, just shoot me an email

48
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,800
 and I'll make it.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,320
 I'll make it up to you somehow.

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,960
 Because I like giving people credit for when they send me these stories.

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
 This story is nuts.

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,280
 And I have a vaguerock election of someone sending it to me and I read it and go, "Oh,

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
 that's just nuts."

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,120
 This is just nuts.

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
 This is just nuts.

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
 And I go, "I don't know.

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,560
 It might honestly be too weird.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,840
 Did this guy make it up?"

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
 But here we go.

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:05,240
 We go journeying into the story that this guy either had one of the most bizarre encounters

61
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:13,200
 or he has some sort of substance abuse problem and undiagnosed or maybe diagnosed but he's

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,080
 not telling us mental problems.

63
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,800
 This is nuts.

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
 It's June 17th, 2015.

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,160
 We're in the town of Red Oak, Texas.

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,560
 It's 1.30 in the morning and this guy posted this.

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,600
 He sent this, I believe, to Lawn Strickler for Bandoms and Monsters.

68
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,760
 They definitely did cover it.

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,160
 He might have sent it to somebody else and then Lawn Strickler picked it up but he doesn't

70
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 give his name.

71
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,960
 We do get an exact date in a location so I'll take that.

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 We don't have his name.

73
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,400
 I'm going to go ahead and call him Tommy.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,440
 Tommy is sweeping up his kitchen at 1.30 in the morning.

75
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,240
 I don't know much about Red Oak, Texas but I know a lot about Orangevale, California.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,680
 If someone's sweeping, if someone is doing any sort of chores at 1.30 in the morning,

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
 meth is probably involved.

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,520
 But now legally, I'm not saying Tommy is a meth user.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,040
 I don't know if he is.

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,120
 I just know in my life.

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,160
 I never used it but I just know a lot of people who have had a lot of family members that

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,680
 have been meth heads.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,360
 I do know that if you're sweeping, if you're doing any sort of chores, you're doing a puzzle.

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,440
 You're doing a puzzle at 1.30 in the morning.

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,800
 Maybe he can't sleep, right?

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,560
 Maybe that's just my own life experiences on my uncle repairing.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,160
 He's attempting to repair a car engine at 1.30 in the morning.

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,520
 He found some springs at a junkyard and he goes, "Oh, this will finally let me soup of

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
 that engine, that half engine block that's in grandma's shed.

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,520
 I'll finally finish building my car."

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
 Tommy's sweeping up his kitchen.

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,960
 It's 1.30 in the morning.

93
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,760
 He's sitting there sweeping, minding his own business.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,800
 And his son, Tommy's son, kicks in the kitchen door.

95
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,160
 But it takes Tommy back, right?

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
 No one expects that.

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,400
 I mean, I guess if there's a lot of meth in the house, you know someone's going to kick

98
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
 in your door eventually.

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
 Sorry, there's the police.

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,960
 There's people going, "Hey, you got some meth?"

101
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
 Someone kicks in his door.

102
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,200
 Again, for legal reasons, I do not know if Tommy is a meth addict or just does meth or

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,480
 is a meth aficionado or even knows how to spell it.

104
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 I don't know.

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
 But somebody kicks in.

106
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,600
 Well, it's not just somebody.

107
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,120
 His kitchen door gets kicked in and standing there now in the kitchen is Tommy's son.

108
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,040
 Well, Tommy's son is dripping wet.

109
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,120
 He's head to toe soaked.

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
 But it wasn't raining outside.

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,240
 Wasn't raining outside.

112
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,880
 So a mystery is afoot.

113
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,600
 Tommy realizes something's wrong whenever he sees a relative and they're dripping wet.

114
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,920
 It's always a problem when one of your relatives is soaking wet.

115
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:04,600
 Tommy looks at his son and figures that this guy totally has to be on something.

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,960
 If you looked at someone who came into your house and they were soaking wet from head to

117
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,200
 toe and it wasn't raining, what would you think?

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,320
 I'd figure maybe someone sprayed him with a hose, an extremely exuberant water balloon

119
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
 fight.

120
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 I don't know.

121
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,040
 He went to SeaWorld and came back just in time to watch Daddy sweep.

122
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,120
 Tommy looks at his son.

123
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
 He's dripping wet.

124
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
 Dripping wet.

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,080
 And goes, "Have you been out jogging?"

126
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
 Even an actual quote.

127
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
 "Have you been jogging?"

128
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,920
 Well, the son doesn't answer him.

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,520
 He simply walks up to Tommy, touches his head.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,320
 Tommy passes out.

131
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:02,360
 Tommy wakes up the next morning and he had slept so deeply that he actually missed work.

132
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,560
 He slept through his entire work shift.

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
 His work shift was not sweeping up the kitchen.

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,800
 His boss called him up and goes, "Tommy, where are you?

135
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
 How come you didn't come to work today?

136
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,840
 You're in no call, no show.

137
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,200
 Not only were you not at work, you didn't tell anyone you wanted to be at work.

138
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,160
 What in the world?"

139
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,760
 And I imagine this one, the boss stopped himself and goes, "You know what?

140
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
 I don't even care.

141
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,480
 I don't even care what stories about to come out of your mouth."

142
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,240
 Because Tommy, the reason why he wasn't able to go to work was because his sweaty son touched

143
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,000
 his head, which I imagine is pretty much what he had told his boss.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,920
 I imagine the boss just hung up.

145
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:53,280
 He was so deeply asleep after he got his forehead touched he slept through his shift.

146
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,360
 Also it turns out that his son came home at seven in the morning.

147
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,240
 He wasn't covered in sweats.

148
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,720
 He wasn't soaking wet.

149
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,560
 So Tommy realizes, "Oh my God, who was that or what was the thing that came into the

150
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,160
 house last night?

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,720
 What was that?"

152
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,640
 Because his son's like, "Dude, no, I got home.

153
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,920
 I got home at seven in the morning.

154
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,600
 I don't know why you're saying that I was all sweaty, Dad.

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,120
 And I don't know why you're saying I got here at 1.30 and I definitely don't know why you

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,080
 think me touching your head made you late for work.

157
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
 This is just getting weird.

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,400
 Could you imagine growing up in this house?

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,360
 Could you imagine having a parent who...

160
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,520
 Well, that's not fair because a lot of people have paranormal events happen to them, right?

161
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
 A lot of people have stuff.

162
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,960
 We cover them all the time on this show.

163
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,720
 The reason why I think I'm going so hard on Tommy is because of what happens next.

164
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,800
 Really what he's doing is he's telling the story, trying to prove that something imitating

165
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,680
 his son came into his house.

166
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,160
 And of course, I mean, obviously I've made a bunch of jokes about...

167
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,040
 You know that lighthearted subject, drug abuse.

168
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,520
 I've made a ton of jokes about that.

169
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,000
 But I will give Tommy credit for this.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,280
 He has proof.

171
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,560
 He has proof.

172
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,080
 He goes, "Listen, I actually...

173
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:33,000
 I don't know how this worked out, but I was calling my son at the exact moment that this

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
 imposter walked into the house.

175
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,000
 I don't remember it.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,080
 But somehow I had called my son.

177
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,440
 So if I had called my son and my son didn't pick up the phone, then there must be an audio

178
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
 recording of what happened.

179
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,520
 You know, because it would go to voicemail and he's holding the phone when this thing

180
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
 came into the house.

181
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,640
 So maybe I'll figure out what happened.

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
 And he said, "Here's the thing.

183
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,400
 I played the voicemail.

184
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,440
 It shows that I sent a voicemail to my son's phone at 1.30 a.m.

185
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,680
 So I got his phone and we played the voicemail and you hear a door crashing open.

186
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,600
 And then you hear Tommy say, "Have you been out jogging?"

187
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,520
 And then you hear the sound of a struggle.

188
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,360
 You hear the sound of two adults struggling and something or someone falling to the ground

189
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,840
 and you hear a dog barking.

190
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:40,000
 As the dog is barking in the background, you hear an entity.

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,120
 You hear some sort of coarse, nearly demonic voice say his name three times.

192
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
 Tommy.

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,160
 Tommy.

194
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,080
 Tommy.

195
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
 And you start to hear the sound.

196
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:13,680
 You said it sounded like a radio frequency, a radio channel being changed.

197
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,440
 Definitely inhuman, right?

198
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,520
 Now the entity quotes, "Said my name three times in a growling, garble voice."

199
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,880
 He says specifically it sounded like the voice from the movie "Fourth Kind."

200
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,600
 Remember that movie with starring Mila Jovovich?

201
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,040
 Or according to him, according to him, "Mia Pultovic."

202
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,160
 Maybe it's Mandela Effect.

203
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,200
 Maybe he just doesn't know actors.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
 I don't know.

205
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
 Mila Jovovich.

206
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
 "Mia Pultovic."

207
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,680
 You know, you're like Jason, now you're just picking on this guy.

208
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,840
 You involve people who can't pronounce states' names.

209
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,640
 You can't even pronounce major geographical places and you're making fun of this guy.

210
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,400
 Mila Jovovich is actually a pretty hard name to pronounce.

211
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,160
 Anyways, garbled voice from that movie "Fourth Kind" starring Mia Pultovic.

212
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,280
 So you go, "Okay, Jason, at least he has evidence."

213
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,000
 Like out of all the stuff you cover, hauntings and UFO, people getting abducted by aliens.

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
 This dude has a voicemail.

215
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
 Like you've been going hard on this guy.

216
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
 Basically, all the time I've met that for the first 10 minutes.

217
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,880
 This guy has probe.

218
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,440
 He has a voicemail.

219
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 And surely he included the voicemail when he wrote out this account.

220
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,880
 Just attached a little voicemail to the email.

221
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
 Well, yeah, he would have.

222
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,360
 He totally would have.

223
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:51,640
 But the aliens got to his voicemail and they changed it.

224
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,600
 So before, the very first time he heard it, he hears a kitchen door getting kicked in.

225
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
 A voice going, "Him?"

226
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,000
 Saying, "Have you been out jogging?"

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,080
 And then the sound of two adults kind of struggling, a dog barking, his voice being growled out

228
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,680
 three times.

229
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,280
 But now, he says, "All right, I'm not even going to bother sending you the voicemail because

230
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
 the aliens got to it."

231
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,640
 And what happens is if you hear the voicemail now, all you hear is Tommy, "Gah, imagine

232
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,240
 the sun getting this email.

233
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,920
 Imagine the sun getting this voicemail."

234
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,800
 I mean, you're like, "What in the world, Dad?

235
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 I don't want to go home.

236
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,040
 Can I just spend the night at one of your guys' house?"

237
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,400
 You have the voicemail at 1.30 in the morning from your dad.

238
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,360
 All it is, this is all that's on the voicemail now, is Tommy, "Gah, your phone rings.

239
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
 Let's put it to you.

240
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,560
 Your phone rings 1.30 in the morning and you avoid the call because it's your dad and he's

241
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
 nuts."

242
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,280
 Then he listened to voicemail and it's your dad saying, "Have you been out jogging?"

243
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,400
 And then you hear like a struggling.

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,120
 Is it the sound of two men struggling around or is it him struggling with the broom or

245
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,840
 struggling to stand up?

246
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
 You don't know.

247
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,000
 You just hear Tommy say, "Have you been out jogging?"

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,520
 And then a little bit of a struggle noise, some sniffling like Tommy had a runny nose

249
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,600
 and a dog barking.

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,840
 And then the voicemail ends.

251
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,560
 I think I need to change my actual voicemail message too.

252
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
 Have you been out jogging?

253
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,160
 Then you can just leave your message.

254
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,720
 So the aliens got to it.

255
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,680
 You can't say that he didn't provide proof.

256
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
 He had proof.

257
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,880
 It just got altered.

258
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,120
 But here's the thing.

259
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,320
 I'll give him credit for this.

260
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
 I'll give him credit for this.

261
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,640
 He has video footage, right?

262
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,920
 That's even better than audio.

263
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,640
 The man with the podcast says he has video footage.

264
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:03,240
 And along with these articles, there are two photographs of what to me looks a lot like

265
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,720
 the demon from Sinister.

266
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 What was his name?

267
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
 Baggule?

268
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 Good movie.

269
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,360
 I mean, I wouldn't want to pick him up on video in my house, especially video for Baggule.

270
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:27,520
 But he says, Tommy goes, "When I look at him, I see Alf, the lovable, huggable character,

271
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
 from the '80s sitcom.

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,720
 Alf, alien life form."

273
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,600
 He says he has a big nose like Alf does.

274
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
 I don't see it.

275
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,520
 But I would have to say, I'd feel like we're quibbling over fallen straws.

276
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,160
 If I'm saying it looks like Baggule, he's saying it looks like Alf, but it might just

277
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,800
 be some sort of interdimensional demon walking around his kitchen.

278
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:03,240
 And he goes on to the video, what he sees is Alf blowing gas into his face or...

279
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,800
 This is a pretty big difference between the two, right?

280
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
 This is a big difference.

281
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:16,560
 Alf was either blowing gas into his face or operating on him.

282
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,720
 Huge difference between the two.

283
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,960
 If someone said, "Hey Jason, can I blow this gas in your face?"

284
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,480
 I mean, I'd probably say no either way, but if someone said, "I'm going to blow some gas

285
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
 in your face," and before I could answer, they started operating on me instead, I'd

286
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
 be like, "This isn't part of the deal.

287
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,680
 Plus, I should probably get new friends if these are the options they give me."

288
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,320
 This entity was either blowing gas in his face or operating on him.

289
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,920
 And in the background of this video, you hear the Devil's Rejects.

290
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
 He was watching the Devil's Rejects.

291
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,640
 Okay, so he's confirmed.

292
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,360
 I like that Devil's Rejects.

293
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,400
 That's like the methiest movie of all time.

294
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,720
 He's watching the Devil's Rejects at 1.30 in the morning while he's cleaning up his

295
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
 kitchen.

296
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,680
 In the video, Alf is blowing gas into his face.

297
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,440
 You can hear the Devil's Rejects laying in the background.

298
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,640
 And then the entity just walks away.

299
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,240
 We unfortunately don't get to see the video, but he did provide two photographs of this.

300
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,800
 I mean, listen, I wouldn't want this thing in my house.

301
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,160
 This thing is absolutely terrifying looking.

302
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,280
 It's possible that he just took photos of the television screen, and he was watching

303
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,640
 Sinister or something like that.

304
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:45,960
 But I mean, it's interesting because this is one of those stories where he absolutely,

305
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,920
 I guess it does kind of look like Alf.

306
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,200
 I pulled the photos back up like you can kind of see what he's talking about.

307
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,600
 But okay, so he originally reported this to Move Fun, which is the mutual UFO network.

308
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 And then Lon Strickler got it from there.

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,040
 Phantoms and Monsters is a great, great resource.

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,880
 You go there all the time.

311
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
 Like here's the thing.

312
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,880
 I mean, obviously if you had to categorize this outside of some sort of meth hallucination,

313
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,520
 it seems alien because it has the medical procedure going on, the gas blowing and/or

314
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
 operating.

315
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,960
 It's a fascinating story.

316
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,360
 This is one of those things, right?

317
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,680
 Like is this guy nuts?

318
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,680
 Was this a real encounter?

319
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,680
 Okay, here's the thing.

320
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,400
 It could have been, right?

321
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
 It totally could have been a real encounter.

322
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,560
 In the world of the paranormal, it's such on the verge of madness.

323
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
 It really is.

324
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,240
 Even stories I know that are 100% authentic because either I experienced them or people

325
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,720
 I truly trust experienced them, they still sound crazy.

326
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
 That's the first thing.

327
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,640
 When I started really experiencing stuff, I thought it was going crazy.

328
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,800
 So there is that border between the real and the unknowable.

329
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,720
 That's where paranormal investigation sits.

330
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,080
 And you do have stuff like this that is just so insane.

331
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,440
 And if you took this story apart and only looked at individual pieces like aliens changing

332
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,960
 voicemails or evidence disappearing, that stuff happens in the world of the paranormal.

333
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,760
 Shapeshifters, that stuff happens in the world of paranormal.

334
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,120
 It's just the character who's telling it.

335
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,520
 It's the person who this happened to.

336
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,320
 When you look at it in total, it seems like the rantings of a madman.

337
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,280
 Did this story actually happen?

338
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
 Did he hallucinate it?

339
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,760
 Was this all a hallucination?

340
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
 And even when he's listening to voicemails, he was still hallucinating stuff.

341
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 Who knows?

342
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,720
 Honestly, I think that's the scarier version of it.

343
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,200
 Because it's the story of a man who's completely lost his mind.

344
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,680
 And I would say if you were some sort of demonic entity, if you were something with nefarious

345
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,800
 intent, you would seek out the mentally ill.

346
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,560
 We did an episode on that.

347
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,760
 We were talking about aliens experimenting on people who can't communicate, right?

348
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
 They can't communicate.

349
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,920
 They're in a medical state where they can't move.

350
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,520
 They can't talk.

351
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
 Would that be the perfect place for aliens to do experimentation?

352
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
 Because they can never tell anyone about it.

353
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
 And this would be the same thing.

354
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,360
 You show up to someone who's insane, blow gas in their face, and they're like, "You

355
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 guys won't believe it.

356
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
 You guys won't believe it.

357
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 Boss, please don't fire me.

358
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 Please don't fire me."

359
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,600
 I got gas blown in my face by Alph.

360
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
 But he's going to believe them.

361
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,480
 It's actually the perfect target.

362
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
 That's what I would do.

363
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,480
 If I was an alien, I would only experiment on hardcore drug users and the mentally ill.

364
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,680
 It shows how inhuman I would be if I was an alien.

365
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
 Because what are you going to do?

366
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,680
 You can't stop me.

367
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,080
 But luckily I'm not an alien.

368
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,880
 Luckily I do have human morals to guide me.

369
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,440
 And idea guy, let's go ahead and leave behind red oak Texas.

370
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,360
 I don't think we have enough time for the statue story.

371
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,840
 Let's go ahead and I'm going to do a swap out here real quick.

372
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,120
 Because this is another story I wanted to talk about.

373
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,760
 And idea guy, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys of the carbonicopter where you're

374
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:24,840
 leaving behind red oak Texas fly us all the way out to a secret doctor's office.

375
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,480
 One of the great things about doing this podcast is I can spend over a half hour calling a

376
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,880
 man mentally ill.

377
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:41,420
 And now I get to spend the remaining minutes talking about how I believe that this might

378
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
 be possible.

379
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,360
 This insane thing I'm about to tell you.

380
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,240
 I read about it and I go, maybe that will work.

381
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,080
 Maybe that will work.

382
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:58,880
 For me it's all about what you can find and what you can't find.

383
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:08,680
 When you come across the conspiracy theory and there are reams and reams of papers, books,

384
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:18,500
 articles, videos, podcasts, whatever it is explaining that conspiracy theory.

385
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,040
 It makes me think that's not true.

386
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,080
 Maybe a little core of it could be true.

387
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,560
 But if it was actually dangerous, if you were actually exposing a group of people or an

388
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:40,240
 ideology or a conspiracy or a cult that was so powerful you would never be able to publish

389
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,320
 it.

390
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:53,540
 You would have gotten stopped in the 1800s.

391
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,540
 Anyone who talked about it would have just disappeared.

392
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,860
 Never heard about it.

393
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,340
 That's always been the thing.

394
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,700
 When people talk about flat earth, everyone knows about flat earth.

395
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,220
 Even if you just have a passing interest in conspiracy theories, especially if you hate

396
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,220
 conspiracy theories, you know about flat earth.

397
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,360
 You may not know how the flat earth people think the world is, where it's just the flat

398
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,360
 disk and the sun and the moon kind of rotate around.

399
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,920
 There's tons of theories about what's beyond the article and things like that, but you

400
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,440
 at least know the topic flat earth.

401
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,320
 So this idea that NASA, the globalists in the most literal form, say that the world

402
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,560
 is a globe because if the world was flat it would be proof that God exists.

403
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,560
 That's really what flat earth theory is.

404
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,580
 If you knew that the earth was flat and either went on forever or had this massive ice wall

405
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,140
 and then you went millions of miles and there was another version of earth with their own

406
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,220
 ice wall, just millions of miles of ice between, you would have to know that God existed.

407
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,380
 The whole idea that planets circle each other and they form these balls and they're like

408
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:05,620
 meteorites and over time all the pressure compresses them into a more circular form.

409
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,980
 That is science and science cannot explain a flat earth.

410
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
 So God must exist.

411
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,320
 So that's the core theory of the flat earth conspiracy theory.

412
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,400
 Now if that was true this never would have been completely crushed by all the groups.

413
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,200
 The second someone started talking about flat earth in the 70s or 80s or even going back

414
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
 to like the 1880s or what have you.

415
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,640
 They would have been shot.

416
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 They would have been killed.

417
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,840
 And we know that because we know of people who talk about conspiracy theories now that

418
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
 get killed.

419
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,600
 People like Karen Silquid who get assassinated.

420
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,640
 People like Gary Webb who get assassinated for exposing the truth.

421
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,500
 So when I come across stuff like this I go maybe there's something to it.

422
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,640
 This would be super valuable.

423
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,580
 This would be a huge thing that you would want to keep secret.

424
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,240
 Back in the 1700s there were two esoteric groups.

425
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:13,920
 One known as the, and I'm probably going to mispronounce this, Rosicrucians.

426
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,120
 They're pretty big in conspiracy theory in and of themselves.

427
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
 You see that.

428
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,480
 You see a lot of mention of them in the Knights Templar and the early Illuminati, right, 17th

429
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
 century.

430
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,560
 The Rosicrucians and the magnetizers were these two big esoteric orders.

431
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,000
 The magnetizers we talked about a long time ago, they were basically founded on the beliefs

432
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,240
 of Franz Mesmer, a man who believed that all living things had this magnetic field around

433
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
 them.

434
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,320
 And that's the reason why we use the term Mesmerism or hypnosis is from Franz Mesmer.

435
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,440
 We did really good episode on that.

436
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,160
 I'll put it in the show notes.

437
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,360
 I learned a lot about hypnosis during that episode and I think about it.

438
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,240
 That's one of those episodes that I still think about from time to time.

439
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:11,440
 Anyways, they developed this thing called the sympathetic alphabet.

440
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,760
 And tell me this would not be world changing, even today, even in everything we have today.

441
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,960
 The sympathetic alphabet, what it is, is you get two people to have the alphabet tattooed

442
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
 onto their arm.

443
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
 Now I would suggest you make it small.

444
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,840
 You don't want to have these giant block letters covering your entire arm.

445
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,200
 But imagine a little patch of skin.

446
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,920
 You can have it done on your hand as well, probably like the back of your hand.

447
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,720
 But you do it on your arm, I think it would be a little bit easier.

448
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,240
 You have the alphabet tattooed on your arm, let's say it's just a couple inches by a

449
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,520
 couple inches, right?

450
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
 Fairly small.

451
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,280
 You get the alphabet tattooed.

452
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,280
 You then slice the skin off of your arm.

453
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,120
 Not all of it, just part of the alphabet.

454
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,440
 You slice it off and it is then removed from your body.

455
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,240
 And then your partner there, he has his alphabet sliced from his arm.

456
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,320
 Preferably you made him the same size, right?

457
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,720
 Probably a lot of planning that goes into this.

458
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,840
 You're not just like, "Oh man, look how tiny my alphabet is.

459
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
 Your alphabet's huge.

460
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,160
 We're going to have these big open wounds."

461
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:33,160
 Because what you do is I take my alphabet flesh and I tear it off and I give it to you

462
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:41,080
 and then I get your alphabet flesh and I put it on my arm and they basically are healed

463
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,320
 into us.

464
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,520
 So you have a patch of my skin and I have a patch of your skin.

465
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:57,080
 And it is now basically fusing into, hold on questions to the end, okay?

466
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,520
 Hold on questions to the end.

467
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,880
 Like, "Jesus, this is so impossible.

468
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
 Who knows?

469
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,600
 I think, okay, let me just keep going.

470
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,920
 Let me keep going."

471
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,960
 So now I have a patch of your skin on my arm and you have a patch of my skin on your arm

472
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,320
 and they're both tattooed with the alphabet.

473
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,600
 And we take these magnetic needles, these magnetic needles that are actually like synchronized

474
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,480
 to each other.

475
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,920
 There's like this lodestone that they touch with the needles.

476
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,240
 So now the needles are in sync.

477
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,360
 The patches of skin on our arm are in sync.

478
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:39,160
 So then you go to Budapest and I'm in Philadelphia and I want to send you a message.

479
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,160
 I take the needle and I then begin to tap out the message.

480
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:51,160
 So I say I want to tell you that I saw Avatar 2.

481
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
 So I go, "I have spilled another whole thing.

482
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
 Way of the water."

483
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
 You're like, "Ahhh!"

484
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,960
 Because that's what it is.

485
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:05,160
 When I'm touching, I saw Avatar 2, Way of the Water, 3PM yesterday.

486
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,840
 You're like, "When I'm poking, really your skin, right?

487
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,440
 Your skin is attached to my arm.

488
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:19,920
 When I'm poking it with this needle on your skin, well now you have my skin, right?

489
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:28,120
 So on your open wound where my skin has healed over it, you'll feel little pinpricks corresponding

490
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,920
 with those letters.

491
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:38,120
 Because I'm poking, okay, now I realize it honestly took me this long to realize that

492
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,600
 how does this work?

493
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,680
 I read this so many times, I was like, "What?

494
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
 This is fantastic!"

495
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,360
 Now that I'm thinking about it, it wouldn't matter if I'm poking your alphabet on my arm.

496
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
 I guess you would...

497
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,480
 Anyways, let me keep explaining it.

498
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,520
 When I'm poking it, it's corresponding, basically it's like Moriskoda.

499
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,160
 It's not Moriskoda, it's like the straight alphabet.

500
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,920
 So I can type out stuff, poke stuff in my arm and you feel it in your arm.

501
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,680
 And because our alphabets are tattooed the same and in the same place, you be feeling

502
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:18,640
 the pinpricks underneath the letter A. V. A. And you'd be like, "Whoa, he saw Avatar

503
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,120
 2, Way of the Water.

504
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,960
 If it's all the information I need to know, quit poking me.

505
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
 I'm doing a full review."

506
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,960
 The CGI was perfection.

507
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,360
 It's funny because now that I'm saying that a lot, I'm realizing that it doesn't make

508
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,480
 a ton of sense, but at the same time, I read that and I was like, "Wow, that's awesome!"

509
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,240
 Like that would be Wi-Fi before the corded phone existed.

510
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,840
 Like in the 1700s, if you were able to send a message across the planet to somebody, you

511
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,680
 need to get a hold of someone, just poke your arm.

512
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,680
 That's awesome!

513
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,480
 And it kind of makes sense when you think of stuff like quantum entanglement, right?

514
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,560
 They say you can take two...

515
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:14,240
 I can't explain quantum entanglement, but the idea is that you take a molecule, you're

516
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
 just shutting it off, you're like, "Oh, great.

517
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,960
 Jason of all people is going to try to explain quantum entanglement.

518
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,080
 What YouTube video did you hear about this room, Jason?"

519
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,120
 You take a molecule or an atom, whatever it was, and it appears in two points at the

520
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,960
 same time.

521
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,240
 And if you interact with this point, they both light up, even though the distance is

522
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
 great.

523
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
 It is a thing.

524
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,240
 I'll try to put a couple videos in the show notes that will explain it in any video, would

525
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
 explain it better than that.

526
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,840
 But quantum entanglement, I'm basically taking your flesh.

527
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 It's your flesh still.

528
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,080
 It's just on my arm now, but it's like all the little capillaries are giving it blood

529
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
 and it's healing.

530
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
 That's the other thing I thought about it.

531
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,480
 I don't know if it would heal well.

532
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,920
 But let's assume that both of those things are correct.

533
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,680
 I can send you a message across the world.

534
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,240
 And I wrote this and I go, "Oh, like this was from the 17th century.

535
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,840
 This was from two fairly big groups, right?

536
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,560
 The Rosicrucians and the mesmerite, or the magnetizers and the magnetizer.

537
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,440
 Clearly, there must be tons of stuff about this.

538
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,320
 There is zero information about this.

539
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,320
 Zero.

540
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,760
 All I could find was a Wikipedia article.

541
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,760
 I think I was looking up something else and it brought this up.

542
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
 I thought, "Wow, that's interesting.

543
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,320
 There must be a ton of stuff about this."

544
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
 Nothing.

545
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,800
 There was a television show.

546
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,960
 I saw on Wikipedia they go, "Oh yeah, this was the plot of a television show.

547
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,080
 It was some French show, I think."

548
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,520
 But other than that, there's nothing on this.

549
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,520
 There's a book where they talk about fact and fable and psychology as a book, extraordinary

550
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,760
 popular delusions and the madness of crowds.

551
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,200
 These are books.

552
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:09,040
 And then it was like a plot in a French television show called The Nose of a Notary.

553
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,400
 I don't know what it's about.

554
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,640
 If it's about people, it's about people exchanging their noses and poking them with needles.

555
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
 I'm in.

556
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,880
 But The Nose of a Notary.

557
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,560
 It looks like it was a movie, a TV movie.

558
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,480
 But other than that, there's nothing.

559
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:36,240
 And this is the type of thing that I could see powerful people wanting to hide.

560
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,800
 This is something that I could totally see the elite wanting to control.

561
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,880
 You can't hack it.

562
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,000
 You can't monitor it.

563
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,240
 You can't eavesdrop on it.

564
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,240
 You can't stop it.

565
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,920
 What's the first thing we see when there's any large-scale uprising in any country nowadays?

566
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,440
 The first thing they do is they go after Twitter and then the internet as a whole.

567
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,640
 We see it time and time again.

568
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,280
 But if everyone just had patches of skin on their arm, you wouldn't be able to stop it.

569
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,720
 Now I'm not saying everyone would engage in this.

570
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,320
 But I think there would be more people doing it.

571
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,520
 Like again, it was interesting.

572
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,920
 I wasn't even able to find like jokie articles explaining how dumb this was.

573
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,040
 Like those books, they're like, "Yeah, back in time people used to believe you could poke

574
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,840
 your arm and send a message."

575
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,360
 And then that was it.

576
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,080
 Like even the books that I was looking at that mentioned it there, it was just like,

577
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
 "Yeah, this is something people used to believe."

578
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,240
 And I'm not saying you have to debunk everything because at the end of the day you don't really

579
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
 have to debunk.

580
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,800
 Well, you know, I think not debunking flat earth more vigorously is what caused it to

581
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
 grow.

582
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,360
 That and the YouTube algorithm.

583
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,760
 It's okay if people want to believe in flat earth.

584
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
 I actually don't have a problem.

585
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 I don't agree with it.

586
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 I don't believe in it.

587
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,400
 But if people want to believe it, I don't care.

588
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,800
 One of those conspiracy theories, whatever.

589
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,880
 So you don't have to necessarily like, "I don't need to see a 10-hour-long video debunking

590
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,560
 this because I think most people could go, 'Ah, that wouldn't work.

591
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,040
 The skin wouldn't heal right.'"

592
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,560
 And it's just, "What are we chasing?

593
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
 It doesn't hurt.

594
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,040
 I mean, it's kind of dumb.

595
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 It wouldn't work."

596
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,600
 But I'm thinking it might.

597
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,680
 Because they're talking about this in the 1700s.

598
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,840
 And now we know about things like quantum entanglement that when you take...

599
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
 Damn it.

600
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
 Damn it.

601
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,320
 I just fast-forwarded to this part.

602
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,600
 I was hoping he was done talking about quantum entanglement.

603
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,880
 He's talking about it again.

604
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,040
 You take two molecules and you spread them apart, right?

605
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,240
 Two atoms from the same thing.

606
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,120
 It's your skin.

607
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,800
 And it's on me.

608
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,240
 So you're getting that signal to your arm.

609
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,080
 I mean, it's basically quantum entanglement at its most base form.

610
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,280
 But they've talked about, like, if you wanted to do long-range communication, if you could

611
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,240
 use quantum entanglement, you could be halfway across the universe and I could send a message

612
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,920
 because I'm talking to this molecule and you're hearing it instantly because it doesn't matter

613
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,040
 how far apart it is, they still react at the same time.

614
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,800
 Because it's the same piece of matter.

615
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
 It doesn't matter how far off it's spread, it's still the same.

616
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
 It's quantum entanglement.

617
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 It's crazy.

618
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
 It's crazy stuff.

619
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 So couldn't you do that?

620
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,640
 Is it funny you do that with arm flesh?

621
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,640
 I know I use the word fascinating at least twice an episode.

622
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,560
 I'm trying to actually stop it.

623
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,080
 It's so interesting.

624
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,600
 And what makes it even more interesting to me is that it's pretty much just out of history.

625
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,200
 It's not even like, look at how dumb this is.

626
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,560
 People aren't talking about it at all.

627
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,520
 I stumbled across it on accident.

628
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,880
 And it's so funny, I threw it in my bookmarks and then I came across it on accident like

629
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,160
 two or three months ago.

630
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,960
 But I kept coming back to it and I kept kind of looking for stuff and I was like, you'll

631
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,960
 find a witchinary entry on it.

632
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,600
 But no one's really done a deep dive into it.

633
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,000
 This is something that I, people are already so tattooed nowadays that why aren't people

634
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 trying this, right?

635
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Swapping these alphabets.

636
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 That would be a cool tattoo.

637
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,400
 If you're looking for an idea, if you're listening to a podcast to get a tattoo idea.

638
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,080
 But this is the type of technology that the powers that be would want to limit us from

639
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
 having.

640
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,520
 They would want to suppress this information.

641
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,800
 So the only information that's out there is like six sources spread across the entire

642
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
 internet.

643
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,480
 Because it might work.

644
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,760
 And if it worked, it would change the way people communicated.

645
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,840
 Nothing is private.

646
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,000
 We did that episode yesterday about how Google is, with the judge's order.

647
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,160
 I don't want to say they're just handing them out, but Google is with the judge's order

648
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,280
 giving police all your search information and not your search information.

649
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,880
 They'll give the information of everyone who looked for a particular subject.

650
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,080
 So a form of communication that you couldn't even be in the other room and listen in on.

651
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,400
 Like it truly is impossible to break.

652
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,480
 It's a code that you could never intercept.

653
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,000
 Because the only two people who know what's going on are the people with the tattoos.

654
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,280
 I mean, sure, I guess you could stand over his shoulder and watch what letters he pokes

655
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,160
 into his arm.

656
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,360
 That would be what you would have to do.

657
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,520
 You couldn't even have someone going, "Hey, did you hear what Charles said the other day?"

658
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
 No.

659
00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:00,160
 It's truly secure conversation that can take place instantly anywhere on the planet.

660
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,360
 And the people in charge can't allow that.

661
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,800
 They can't allow that.

662
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,480
 Do I think it would work?

663
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,800
 The objections I have to it is the healing of the flesh, right?

664
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,600
 And you'd have to like, would you only be able to talk to people who have the same blood

665
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
 type as you?

666
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:23,000
 Like maybe nowadays with skin grafts, it would be like doctors know how to graft skin better

667
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 than they would in the 17th century.

668
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,320
 I mean, any objection I have to this isn't the part where they're poking the arm.

669
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,400
 It's like how the wounds would heal and things like that.

670
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,600
 You got a twig underneath the skin.

671
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,920
 You're like, "Ah!"

672
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,880
 And your buddy just hears like constant screaming as his arm's hurting too.

673
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,520
 That's really my big objection to it.

674
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,880
 As a paranormal researcher, I could see this working in some way.

675
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,080
 But we would never be allowed to know about it.

676
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,640
 We would never be allowed to use it.

677
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,920
 It's just too dangerous.

678
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,680
 Not to us, but to them.

679
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,840
 It's not dangerous because the skin graft may get rejected.

680
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,680
 You might get a twig under your skin.

681
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,480
 It's because the people on top can't allow it.

682
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,320
 You can't have it to the Toletarian government where the people can speak freely.

683
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,040
 You can't have any government where the people can speak freely honestly.

684
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,200
 But you have to have some restrictions, but this would totally avoid all of that.

685
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,600
 You'd be able to send messages.

686
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,040
 It would be incredibly dangerous to have this technology, to have this method out there.

687
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,600
 But the question always is dangerous to who.

688
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,680
 Can I imagine what if you were the commander?

689
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,200
 Would you have 18 different alphabets on your arms?

690
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,440
 Because you're talking to all your generals?

691
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:50,160
 If it was instantaneous communication across the globe, yeah, you would.

692
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,560
 You'd have people with their whole arms, both arms tatted up.

693
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
 They can keep in touch with people.

694
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
 I don't know.

695
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,880
 At the end of the day, it does sound as insane as anything that Tommy's putting out.

696
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,320
 Maybe not. Maybe if I had to choose between this form of communication being crazy from

697
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,160
 the 17th century or alph bursting into your kitchen with a gas canister.

698
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
 That is crazier.

699
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,720
 But I just think I'm glad I was able to pair these two stories together because it does

700
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,200
 show in the world of the paranormal, crazy is a spectrum.

701
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,960
 Because a normal person would have listened to the last 20 minutes of this podcast and

702
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,080
 be like, dude, who is this guy?

703
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
 He's nuts.

704
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,880
 He honestly thinks you can take the skin off your body.

705
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,080
 You went to somebody else and talk to them?

706
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
 That guy's nuts.

707
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,400
 If you just played that segment, they'd be like, this is what you listen to.

708
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,760
 This is what you listen to while you're driving to work.

709
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,480
 You're nuts.

710
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,600
 It's a spectrum.

711
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
 It's a spectrum.

712
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:51,880
 And yeah, I guess the skin, the sympathetic alphabet is pretty insane.

713
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,640
 It does sound insane and I don't think it's as insane as your son shape shifting into

714
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,120
 alph as the devil rejects plays in the living room.

715
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,560
 But again, it's a matter of degrees.

716
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,000
 It really depends on what you think is insane.

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,840
 I think it also depends on how long you've been a paranormal researcher because at that

718
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,880
 point you've seen a lot of stuff.

719
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,240
 Fascinating technology.

720
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
 Is it real?

721
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
 Can you do it?

722
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,360
 Would someone be willing to test it?

723
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
 Other than me?

724
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
 I'm not a tattoo guy myself.

725
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,280
 I'm also not ripping my skin off in an underground doctor's office kind of guy.

726
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,720
 But I would love to see, I'm surprised people aren't trying this with as many tattoos and

727
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,680
 body modifications as they don't know about it.

728
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,240
 That would be my guess.

729
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:45,400
 Or maybe, just maybe, this truly is suppressed dangerous technology.

730
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,200
 And simply by talking about it on Dead Rav radio, I may not make it to episode one

731
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
 thousand.

732
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,960
 Ten episodes from now will be at episode one thousand.

733
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,200
 Will I make it?

734
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:08,800
 Or will the Rosa Crucians and the magnetizers silence this podcast once and for all?

735
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
 That was them driving by.

736
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,680
 That was them driving by in a loud car.

737
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:35,520
 They're letting me know that they're coming.

738
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:49,200
 I'm not a tattoo guy myself.

739
00:43:49,200 --> 00:44:07,880
 I'm not a tattoo guy myself.

740
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:17,880
