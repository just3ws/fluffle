1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 Is it possible that your own brain is trying to make you afraid of yourself?

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:13,600
 Then we take a look at the story of a man who was dead and buried, sitting in a cemetery.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,100
 But as the image of a chain begins to appear on his tombstone, curious townsfolk pay it

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,440
 a visit.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,400
 Little do they know, just six feet in the earth lies the spirit of a vengeful ghost today

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:40,200
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,160
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
 So let's get started.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,960
 First off let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Stefan Walnerstrom.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,840
 Stefan Walnerstrom, thank you so much for supporting the show.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
 Really really helps out a lot.

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,960
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,400
 If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand, just help get the word out about

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
 the show.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,600
 That really really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,080
 I look over at Stefan.

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,160
 So Stefan we're gonna take a brand new vehicle today.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,420
 Point down a little pill sitting on my table.

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,320
 And before you can ask, wait what?

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
 We shrink.

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,400
 I guess I could have made the pill bigger and then shrunk it, but whatever.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
 Cost less energy.

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
 We're tiny.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,600
 We're climbing into this pill.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,580
 It's called the Bio Bunny.

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,040
 This is our new microscopic, it's probably bigger than microscopic, it's the size of

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 a pill.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,760
 This is our device for flying inside the human body and now we have a test subject.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,160
 We have hired this hobo straight off the train tracks to swallow us.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,760
 And he's like, "My pleasure."

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,600
 You know, so we're flying around this dude's esophagus.

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,880
 Stefan's like out running white blood cells.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,040
 They're like, "Oi, oi, oi."

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,520
 They got their little batons.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,120
 We're not going down south.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,160
 We're headed right up to the brain.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,420
 So the reason why we're in the brain, the reason why I had that whole setup is I wanted

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,060
 to talk to you very briefly about a thing called intrusive thoughts.

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,060
 I say very briefly because this is the third time I've recorded this segment.

43
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,740
 I seem to go on a bit because I find this fascinating.

44
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,460
 I don't know if it's 17 minutes fascinating, but here is what intrusive thoughts are.

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,220
 Some of you, almost all of you guys have had them, but most of you probably don't know

46
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,580
 there's a term for it.

47
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,820
 It's an unwanted thought.

48
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,260
 It's a thought that gets stuck in your head.

49
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,300
 It's something that scares you.

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,120
 It's a thought that you would never, ever, ever act on, but it gets stuck in a feedback

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
 loop.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,920
 Hannah Reese wrote an article for Psychology Today, and she talks about her own experience

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,120
 with intrusive thoughts.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,880
 She was a brand new mother.

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,160
 She has a little baby, little baby person in her arms.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
 She's like, "I love my son.

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 He's super cute.

58
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
 He's dope."

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,920
 But when I stood at the top of the stairs with my son in my arms, I'd want to throw

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,860
 him down the stairs and watch his little broken body at the bottom of the stairs.

61
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,660
 And she goes, "Scary thought?

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
 Yes.

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
 Normal?

64
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,260
 Yes."

65
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,700
 Because that is an intrusive thought.

66
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
 She would never do that.

67
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
 She didn't, at least at the time of publishing that article.

68
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,380
 No, her son's much older now.

69
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,380
 He can fight back.

70
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,020
 An intrusive thought is something like that.

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,900
 You're sitting there with your loved one, and they're talking, and you're talking, you

72
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,660
 guys are having a good conversation, and everything like that.

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,680
 And in your head, you just think, "I just want to scream in her face.

74
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
 Shut up.

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
 Shut up.

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 Just shut up."

77
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,120
 And you're like, "Why am I thinking that?

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,840
 Why would I ever think about someone I loved in such angry terms?"

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
 It's a fluke of biology.

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
 We don't know what causes them.

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
 That's what's so bizarre.

82
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,920
 We know how to treat them.

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
 You acknowledge that they're there and just move on.

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
 A lot of people, and I've done this too, a lot of people like when I was having intrusive

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,080
 thoughts and didn't really know what it was.

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,420
 I finally googled, "What is going on in my brain?

87
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,700
 Why am I thinking of being so cruel to my loved ones?"

88
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,660
 And it pops right up, intrusive thoughts.

89
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,780
 I don't know if you Google that exact term, but it pops right up.

90
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,380
 You're having an intrusive thought.

91
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,820
 They're totally normal.

92
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,380
 We don't know what causes them.

93
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,180
 We do know, this is interesting, we do know that intrusive thoughts can lead to obsessive

94
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,260
 compulsive disorder.

95
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,760
 So Hannah Reese, for example, it would become obsessive compulsive disorder if she refused

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,600
 to stand at the top of stairs.

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,280
 I've actually wanted to do this segment for a while because again, I think everyone suffers

98
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
 from them.

99
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,760
 I want to share with you some of my intrusive thoughts because they're actually so stupid.

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,080
 In the moment, they scare me, but when I say them out loud when I was prepping this segment,

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,160
 and that's one of the reasons why I went on for 17 minutes, they're so dumb that you'll

102
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,420
 laugh at them as I'm shivering in the corner.

103
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,980
 And longtime listeners of the show will start to recognize a pattern.

104
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:50,220
 They'll be like, "That's why he does those type of stories," because they trigger my

105
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,940
 intrusive thoughts.

106
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,340
 Stuff I would never, ever do.

107
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,740
 If you listen to the show long enough, you're like, "Op, he's mentioned that one.

108
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,500
 He's mentioned that one."

109
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,020
 Let's take a look at some of the thoughts intrusive, the very personal episode.

110
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
 How do you like this?

111
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,820
 Very, as we're floating around in this hobo's brain, very personal episode.

112
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,140
 I've never committed self-harm.

113
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,140
 I've never cut myself.

114
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,480
 I've never attempted suicide.

115
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,720
 I've never done anything like that.

116
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 I love myself.

117
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
 I love my body.

118
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,620
 I have this weird thing about spoons scooping my eyeballs out.

119
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
 We talked about that on Friday's episode.

120
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,700
 There's a little foreshadowing there for you.

121
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,740
 This weird thing about when I'm...it's only when I'm in the kitchen and I'm preparing

122
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,820
 food and I grab a spoon, I think about scooping my eyeballs out.

123
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,260
 I don't know why not just one of them.

124
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,260
 I mean, I'm not Superman.

125
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,940
 I think the first one would stop me, the amount of pain.

126
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,820
 But I just recently did that episode about that woman pulling her eyeballs out because

127
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,460
 she was on meth.

128
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,700
 "Swallowing rocks" is a weird one.

129
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,380
 Now, not...I know what you guys are thinking.

130
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,620
 I know what you guys are thinking.

131
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,540
 I'm the rockbiter from the Neverending Story with my strong hands.

132
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,580
 I couldn't hold on to my friends.

133
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,620
 Apparently, he's also Vin Diesel now.

134
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,780
 My family couldn't hold on to him.

135
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,780
 No, I'm not the rockbiter.

136
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,100
 I used to go into, like, witch wiccan stores all the time, witch stuff, supply shops.

137
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,420
 You know, it was basically Lowe's hardware, but for the paranormal.

138
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,140
 And they'd have those little polished rocks.

139
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,860
 I'd always want to eat them whenever I'd walk by that...and I wasn't hungry.

140
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,900
 It wasn't like if I went to McDonald's beforehand, I wouldn't have this problem.

141
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,780
 I could walk into a place...specifically, it was a weird thing.

142
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,260
 It was a magic...it had to be a store that was all magical and stuff.

143
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,820
 I'd want to swallow polished rocks.

144
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
 I would never think about it.

145
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,740
 I'd never walk into the street and be like, "Hmm, now that's some quartz.

146
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,380
 That's some quartz that I want to eat."

147
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,380
 Never.

148
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,180
 I've never been on, like, caving and been like, "Hmm, they're sucking on us to lagtight."

149
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:47,220
 No, it was just polished stones in wiccan stores, because I've been to a lot of them.

150
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
 Super weird.

151
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,980
 Super weird intrusive thoughts.

152
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:55,620
 When I'm working out and I'm lifting those weights, those 80 pound weights in each arm

153
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,820
 on each finger.

154
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,140
 When I'm lifting weights and I have them above my head, I think about dropping them on my

155
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
 head.

156
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,860
 Now, it's not like I'm afraid I'm going to drop them.

157
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,380
 It's different than that.

158
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,580
 It's not that I'm afraid I'm going to lose my grip and I'm going to drop them.

159
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,980
 It's the thought that I'm going to do it on purpose.

160
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,340
 It's an unwanted thought.

161
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,100
 I would never want...I, of course, would never want to destroy my brain with a weight.

162
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,620
 But when I'm lifting those weights above my head, I'm not thinking, "What if I drop them?"

163
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,500
 I'm thinking, "Oh, I should drop them right now."

164
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,620
 I've also, and this is something that's popped up a lot on the show, a lot on the show.

165
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,580
 And this, I think, has become OCD.

166
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,860
 I have a fear.

167
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,700
 It really, it's an intrusive thought.

168
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,900
 It's become more than that of becoming a drug addict or an alcoholic, because what I fear

169
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,300
 the most, and I've done tons of stories on this, is losing control.

170
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,460
 What's funny is every single fight I've ever been in, I don't want to use the term premeditated,

171
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,700
 because that's a legal term, but every single fight I've been in, talking to the guy, talking

172
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,660
 to the guy, talking to the guy, and the conversation's over.

173
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
 There's not even a level of anger there.

174
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,300
 It's very...looking at the pros, looking at the cons, calculating it, we're fighting.

175
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,620
 I've never been sitting next to someone and then running their mouth, running their mouth,

176
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,100
 and then I just lose control and just lay in at the dude.

177
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:29,180
 It is always, unless this episode's being played for a trial later on, then maybe in

178
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,100
 one instance, maybe in the instance I'm on trial for, I lost control, your honor, but

179
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:40,900
 for the moat, for every time other than this, jury, jury of my peers, I've never lost control.

180
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,220
 My fear, though, is losing control.

181
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,500
 I'm a big guy.

182
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 I'm strong.

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,180
 I mean very weak, your honor.

184
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,860
 I could never have pummeled that man.

185
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,220
 I've always been a big guy.

186
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,140
 I've always been a strong guy.

187
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,300
 I've been in a lot of fights.

188
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
 I know how to fight.

189
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,860
 My fear is losing control.

190
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,940
 That's never happened.

191
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
 Never happened.

192
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,220
 Ever happened, but I'll have intrusive thoughts about becoming an alcoholic and drinking and

193
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,340
 losing control, becoming a drug addict and drugging and losing control.

194
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,420
 And I really think being an alcoholic and being a drug addict is the ultimate form of losing

195
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,860
 control.

196
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,420
 The drugs drive what you do each day.

197
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,940
 I used to drink and I used to smoke weed back when I was in college.

198
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,820
 I did all that stuff and then I stopped.

199
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:33,740
 Now as an older man, 43 years old, I drink maybe four or five times a year, maybe a little

200
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,020
 more, and I don't use drugs.

201
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,020
 That's OCD level.

202
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,140
 I'm afraid if I drink more than once every two months, I'm going to become an alcoholic.

203
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,300
 And that's simply not true.

204
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:56,660
 I have such an intrusive thought about alcohol equals alcoholism that I can't drink alcohol.

205
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,300
 And the funny thing is, is there will be times when I do drink and I get super nervous.

206
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,660
 It actually has the opposite effect on me at the time, because I'll drink one beer,

207
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,940
 I'm a total lightweight, my vision gets hazy, I get a little stumbly, and I start to have

208
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,740
 anxiety attacks because I'm not in control.

209
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,220
 I feel like my body is doing something that I'm not in control of.

210
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,700
 So the intrusive thoughts, if you really let them get to you, will cause, I don't care

211
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
 about drinking, obviously.

212
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,860
 I used to drink every single day all through college and beyond.

213
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
 Every single day I was drunk and I was stoned.

214
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,380
 And I was fine, dude.

215
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,700
 I mean, it was fine, but it's weird because back then I didn't have intrusive thoughts

216
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,220
 about it, see.

217
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,780
 It's in the time period of, say, when I stopped would have been, I don't know, 27, 26, 27.

218
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,900
 From 27 to 43 when I wasn't doing those things, those intrusive thoughts have developed.

219
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,580
 See, back then I didn't have a problem with it.

220
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,060
 I could get stoned all day.

221
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,300
 Now, now, now I don't even like the idea.

222
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,660
 I don't even like the idea of getting stoned.

223
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,580
 It frightens me, honestly, of me being stoned.

224
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,580
 Why?

225
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,900
 Because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose control.

226
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
 But I never have.

227
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,500
 But I'm afraid I will.

228
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,780
 That's the interesting thing about intrusive thoughts.

229
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,980
 So what I do now is I just acknowledge them.

230
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,980
 I go, "Oh, that's funny.

231
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,140
 You want to swallow rocks?"

232
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,060
 It would be OCD if I said I'm not gonna go into any Wiccan stores that have.

233
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,340
 I mean, there's none that exists up here, but I'm not gonna go into any Wiccan stores

234
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
 with polished rocks.

235
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,340
 I just accept that.

236
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,820
 I hang out with people who do drugs and drink alcohol and I just don't engage with that.

237
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,100
 I don't do it as well.

238
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,780
 But you just kind of have to acknowledge that you have that.

239
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,140
 Don't do that if you're actually suffering with alcoholism or drug abuse.

240
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
 Don't hang out with those people.

241
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,620
 But you have to acknowledge you're having the thought and then just move on.

242
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
 You can't ignore it.

243
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,580
 You don't want to indulge in it.

244
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,820
 You don't want to go, "Oh, maybe I should throw boiling water on my face."

245
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,820
 That's another one.

246
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,700
 I don't know if I've mentioned that one yet, but I'm afraid I'm gonna throw boiling water

247
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,700
 on my face.

248
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,220
 There's a whole host of them.

249
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,380
 There's a whole host of them.

250
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
 Most of them are self-harm.

251
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,500
 I've never, ever hurt myself on purpose.

252
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 Ever.

253
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,980
 But my intrusive thoughts go, "Hey, man, you should look at that spoon.

254
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,820
 Look at that spoon over there.

255
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,420
 Look at that boiling pot of water.

256
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,620
 Look at these delicious rocks."

257
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,100
 I'm like, "No."

258
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,100
 So I have them.

259
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
 You have them.

260
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
 Hannah Reese has them.

261
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
 Everyone has them.

262
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,620
 If you're struggling with them, you're not alone.

263
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,700
 If you've ever thought about doing something horrendous and you never would have ever done

264
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,140
 it, you're just an intrusive thought.

265
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,360
 Just go, "Oh, I heard about that on Dead Ravra Radio."

266
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
 And just move on.

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 Don't try to ignore it.

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,820
 Just acknowledge that it's there.

269
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,140
 Acknowledge that you're having this thought.

270
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,140
 Acknowledge what it is.

271
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,780
 It's an intrusive thought, and it will go away.

272
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,500
 Another one might pop up, but you don't want to get it to the point where you can't have

273
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,620
 a beer with your friends.

274
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,620
 I've had maybe three beers this year.

275
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,620
 Maybe more.

276
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,180
 Maybe six this year.

277
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,140
 So I mean, I'm not saying that's the end all about.

278
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,540
 I'm not saying that my life sucks because it's gonna have beer, but obviously I've let

279
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,300
 that intrusive thought get the best of me.

280
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,000
 Let's go ahead and let's fly this Bio Bunny.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,360
 We're going out of this dude's nose, but we start flying away, and then we're going

282
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
 to grow big.

283
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,200
 And the homeboy was like, "Oh, the voice is in my head.

284
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,560
 The voice is in my head."

285
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,240
 But now he feels relieved, and he actually went and got a job in 15 minutes.

286
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
 That's a thing now.

287
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
 You can get a job in 15 minutes.

288
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,520
 So we wave goodbye to our no longer homeless friend.

289
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,400
 He also got a house in 15 minutes.

290
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 A miracle.

291
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
 The Bio Bunny is a miracle drug.

292
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,580
 So, Stefan, let's fire up that carboner copter.

293
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,620
 We're leaving behind the Sprint store where this man now works.

294
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,020
 We are headed out to Pulaski County, Kentucky.

295
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,020
 It's 1938.

296
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,900
 We're in Pulaski County.

297
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,500
 Stefan, bring that carboner copter nice and low.

298
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,820
 We're going to transform it into a house.

299
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
 It's just a house.

300
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,820
 It just lands.

301
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,660
 It becomes an old, timing 1938 house.

302
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,660
 We walk out of it.

303
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
 We're wearing old, timing clothes.

304
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,480
 We're going to meet a man named Carl Pruitt.

305
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 He's a carpenter.

306
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,840
 That's his job by trade.

307
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,640
 He comes home and his wife is making out with a dude.

308
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,760
 And so he wipes the sweat off his brow and starts running after him.

309
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,560
 And the dude, smartly, jumps out of the window and runs away.

310
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,520
 But this guy, Carl Pruitt, is so enraged about what's going on that he strangles his wife

311
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,160
 to death.

312
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,180
 And then he gets his pistol and he puts it to his brain and he pulls the trigger.

313
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,700
 Now the family goes, when we bury these people, that dude's so disgusting.

314
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,900
 Let's put her, let's put the wife, like in the regular part of the cemetery, the nice

315
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,420
 part where all the good dead bodies are.

316
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,300
 These people are barely decomposed.

317
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,220
 Not like them poor people over there full of worms.

318
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,340
 They take Carl Pruitt's body and they actually put it as far away off in the cemetery as

319
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,640
 possible.

320
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,240
 You have this gravestone, right?

321
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,920
 And it says, like, here lies Carl Pruitt.

322
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,000
 He's a real piece of work.

323
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,040
 And on the gravestone, an image of a chain starts to appear.

324
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,560
 Because you remember the chain earlier in the story?

325
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 Me neither.

326
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
 Me neither.

327
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,680
 I have no idea why a chain is appearing on this gravestone, but it is.

328
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,600
 It had nothing to do with anything else.

329
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 He wasn't a chainer.

330
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,120
 He had the chain growing on his gravestone.

331
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,280
 Now people started going, oh, that's weird.

332
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,540
 I've seen a lot of Tom Fulery in my life, but I ain't never seen no chain grow on a

333
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,700
 gravestone.

334
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,940
 So people go there and they look at it.

335
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,260
 And then they go home.

336
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,260
 But one day there was a kid named James Collins.

337
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,940
 And he's like, come on, guys, let's go on down to Carl Pruitt's gravestone.

338
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,460
 Just look at his gravestone.

339
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,860
 Because everyone in town at this point thought it was super spooky that this chain was appearing

340
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,060
 on his gravestone.

341
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,020
 So James Collins goes down with his friends.

342
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
 They ride their bikes down.

343
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,000
 They have a real goonie-esque adventure.

344
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,800
 They're going out, slip and slide, attacked by an octopus.

345
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,280
 Eventually they get to Carl's gravestone.

346
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,880
 And James Collins goes, what?

347
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,120
 This gravestone's lame.

348
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
 You know what?

349
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,160
 Make it even better if I threw a rock at it.

350
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,920
 So he picks the rock up.

351
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
 There was a rock there, by the way.

352
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,120
 He didn't bring it all the way from Goonie Land.

353
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,920
 He picks a rock up and throws it at the gravestone.

354
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,760
 So hard that a piece of it chips off.

355
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,620
 Now I don't know where they were feeding kids back in the 1930s, but I do know this.

356
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,100
 I do know this.

357
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,780
 There is no boy 50 miles north, south, east or west of Pulaski County, Kentucky that could

358
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,900
 knock a tombstone, a chunk of a tombstone off with a rock.

359
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,500
 And I also have to ask how delicious was that rock as he's throwing it.

360
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 I'm all, "Gulp."

361
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 I'm eating it.

362
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 James Collins throws a rock at the gravestone and part of it chips off.

363
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,180
 Now James Collins goes, what?

364
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
 That gravestone sucked.

365
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,640
 I've thrown rocks at all the gravestones here and no chipping yet.

366
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,280
 So James Collins decides it's time to leave.

367
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
 Everyone's like, "Oh, we're out of here."

368
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,440
 So they're riding their bikes home.

369
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
 And then James, James, look out!

370
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
 One of his friends exclaims and James is like, "What?"

371
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,560
 And the bike starts like twisting and stuff like that.

372
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,920
 He's like, "Oh, oh, oh."

373
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,760
 And then he falls off the bike and the bike like flips up and the bicycle chain wraps around

374
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,540
 his neck and snaps his neck.

375
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,300
 Now hold your questions for the end of the segment, okay?

376
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,220
 Because we're just getting started here.

377
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,940
 So James Collins got his neck broken with the bicycle chain.

378
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,020
 The mom of James Collins, Mrs. Collins finds out about this and she's obviously bereaved.

379
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,140
 That was a pretty new bike!

380
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,300
 I just bought that kid that bike.

381
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,300
 Also boo-hoo-hoo, my son, my son died in a freak accident.

382
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,640
 She decides after James is buried and all that stuff, she's so mad at the gravestone

383
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,160
 of Carl Pruitt that she goes, "This family must have been the inventor of steroids."

384
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,720
 Because first off, we have a kid take a rock and smash a chunk of a gravestone off of it.

385
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,880
 The mom!

386
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,000
 The mom grabs an axe and chops up the tombstone.

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,120
 So at this point, we have three possibilities.

388
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
 One, the story's made up.

389
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,360
 Two, that woman's from Krypton.

390
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,660
 Or the tombstone was made out of real cheap.

391
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,920
 Maybe they really went cheap on the stone for this guy.

392
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,280
 Maybe they just got some salt rock for his gravestone.

393
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,140
 But she chops up the gravestone with an axe.

394
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
 Everything is normal now.

395
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,300
 Her superhuman strength is knowing the world around Lex Luthor.

396
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,580
 Old-timey Lex Luthor is coming after her.

397
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,340
 Anyways, she's doing the laundry a couple days later and she has her cape, her red cape

398
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
 up.

399
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
 She's like, "Oh, I should hide that."

400
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:51,120
 She has all of her clothes up and then people hear like a scuffle.

401
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,880
 And they go and they check on her because that's not normal noise, right?

402
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,640
 That's definitely not a normal noise.

403
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,840
 Any noise that gets louder and louder and then just stops.

404
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,880
 They go over and check on her.

405
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,680
 She's hanging by the clothesline.

406
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,920
 She's got little pins in her.

407
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,480
 She doesn't have any like closed pins and she's hung up.

408
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
 That would be funny, right, if she's hung up.

409
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,260
 But no, the clothesline is wrapped around her neck.

410
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,780
 Suicide maybe?

411
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,900
 Grief of her son?

412
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
 Accident?

413
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,820
 Or murder.

414
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,540
 Because her clothesline was different.

415
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,180
 Her clothesline was different than every other clothesline in existence ever made.

416
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,020
 Because her clothesline, maybe there were more of these.

417
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
 I don't know.

418
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,220
 I'm not a history buff of laundry mat pre-1955, but it was a laundry line, but it wasn't

419
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
 the normal rope.

420
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,720
 It was a little chain.

421
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,280
 Her laundry line was chain link.

422
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,160
 People are like, "Oh, that's weird, right?"

423
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,960
 That's first off, that's weird that she had a chain link clothesline.

424
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,640
 But we have a guy who has a gravestone with a chain appearing on it.

425
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,360
 We have a kid who threw a rock and then he got killed by a bicycle chain.

426
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,560
 We have the mom who chopped up the gravestone.

427
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
 We still don't know how that's possible.

428
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,720
 She's hung by a chain.

429
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,920
 Let's go back to the gravestone and see what's going on.

430
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,940
 Let's go back to where the story started.

431
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
 But it's all rubble.

432
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,020
 Remember, she chopped it up with her axe.

433
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,060
 They go back to Karl Perutz Grave.

434
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,060
 The tombstone is 100% back to normal.

435
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:24,300
 So at this point, you figure the townspeople would be like, "Let's just wall off this

436
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,140
 part of the cemetery."

437
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,780
 You can count those two deaths up to coincidences and things like that.

438
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:35,980
 There's no coincidence for matter reconstructing after it's being destroyed.

439
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,680
 It's impossible and I get it's a ghost story and I'm not saying that the story is totally

440
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,400
 fake because of this detail.

441
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
 I'm not saying that.

442
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,880
 I'm saying in a world where that's possible, you don't allow the following events to happen,

443
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
 right?

444
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,680
 You just kind of put a protective bubble over it or something or a chain.

445
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,200
 Build a little chain around it that keeps people away because what happens is later

446
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,760
 on this dude is riding through town on a stagecoach.

447
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,300
 He had like a horse and buggy.

448
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,620
 It's 1938.

449
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,380
 So get with the times.

450
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,180
 I imagine at this point it's more expensive to feed your horses than it is to buy a car.

451
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,140
 But I don't know, maybe he's a mish.

452
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,980
 Maybe it's a religious decision and I'm just being a total jerk.

453
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,380
 But anyways, this dude is riding by on his horse and buggy with his family and he hears

454
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,380
 about the legend.

455
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,720
 This legend is well known at this point.

456
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,460
 This gravestone has a chain on it.

457
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,780
 It's already killed two people.

458
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,480
 So he's riding through town with his family and he sees this tombstone and he goes, "Ah,

459
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,400
 yes, the famous tombstone."

460
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,040
 He decides to test his luck.

461
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:49,000
 He pulls out his rifle, click, shoot the gravestone, knocks a piece of it off.

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,960
 The horses get scared, which will kind of happen when it's the middle of the day and

463
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,800
 you're firing a long rifle right next to him.

464
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,960
 The horses spook and now the whole stagecoach, I don't know, it's not a stagecoach.

465
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
 It's a horse and buggy.

466
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,380
 They're not going to get robbed at some point.

467
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,060
 The horse and buggy, I'm moving my recliner to make the noise.

468
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:12,940
 He's riding in the horse and buggy and they're getting super freaked out because he's losing

469
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,420
 control of this thing.

470
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
 Two things.

471
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,540
 One, remember his family's in the back, right?

472
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,060
 So we've got two things going on.

473
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,860
 First off, his family jumps off of, which I have written in my notes, jumps off the stagecoach.

474
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,180
 Again, not a stagecoach.

475
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,380
 They're like, "Who's grabbing the whale's fargo?

476
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,760
 He's got bags of money.

477
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,560
 It's a regular horse and buggy."

478
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
 So that's first.

479
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,320
 His family gets away safely.

480
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,240
 Second thing, his horse reigns, you know, like, so he's sitting there and you know where

481
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,800
 I'm going with this, right?

482
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,120
 He's sitting on the top of this horse and buggy and he's holding onto his reigns that

483
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:53,160
 go to the horses and these reigns are made of chains, which I actually looked it up.

484
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,800
 There were some horse reigns made of chains.

485
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,860
 So I don't know about the clothesline thing, but apparently some horses were just too wild

486
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,460
 for just regular old leather and rope.

487
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,540
 So he's riding the buggy and at this point he's looking down at the chains.

488
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
 He's like, "Uh-oh.

489
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,580
 I should have really bought those other ones."

490
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,900
 Or you know, not shot at a haunted tombstone associated with chain murders.

491
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,340
 The horse buggy's going out of control.

492
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,740
 He sees his family in the distance waving goodbye because they know what's happening

493
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
 to them.

494
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,780
 He also knew he shouldn't have shot at that tombstone or bought chain horse reigns.

495
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,720
 Then his head gets underneath the chains.

496
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,360
 The horse reigns things, right?

497
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 Try saying that.

498
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,320
 Try saying that one time fast.

499
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
 And then, "Ugh, ugh!"

500
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
 And the horse turns quickly or just keeps going straight ahead.

501
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
 Doesn't matter.

502
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
 You have chains wrapped around your neck.

503
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,920
 But in the story, the horse veers quickly to the left and snaps his neck.

504
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:55,160
 Now remember, just for a quick refresher, the story of Carl Pruitt is a man who walked

505
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,980
 in and found his wife in the arms of another man, murdered her, strangled her, not with

506
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
 chains, right?

507
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,860
 Just strangled her and then shot himself.

508
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
 No chains were involved.

509
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,380
 His name wasn't "Chain" Pruitt.

510
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,060
 He wasn't a dude who made chains.

511
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,860
 He didn't live in Chinatown.

512
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,460
 You know what I mean?

513
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,140
 None of his origin story had anything to do with chains.

514
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,100
 It was just that a chain appeared on his tombstone.

515
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,900
 So why is he killing people with chains?

516
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
 Who knows?

517
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 It's not over, though.

518
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,600
 At some point, there's a local congressman who finds out his constituents keep getting

519
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,760
 killed by a ghost using chains.

520
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,800
 So there's two things you could do.

521
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,280
 There's a thousand things you could do, but the congressman could easily just ban all

522
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,280
 chains, right?

523
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,360
 Just make it a chain, build down.

524
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,440
 There's little signs outside of schools, chain-free zone.

525
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
 You could do that.

526
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,280
 Or you just send cops.

527
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,520
 Send cops there to investigate it.

528
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,320
 Find out if there's any truth to it.

529
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 Okay?

530
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
 What are they supposed to do?

531
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
 Take fingerprints?

532
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
 They're supposed to dig them up and take fingerprints?

533
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,040
 I don't know why they thought.

534
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,760
 Just start banning chains.

535
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
 Anything that's linked together.

536
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,120
 It's just ban chains.

537
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,520
 You can't even put chains on your car.

538
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,600
 Cars are constantly sliding in the snow.

539
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,980
 They're like, "It is a small price to pay to not be murdered by a chain ghost."

540
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
 But that doesn't happen.

541
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,560
 They send the cops out to investigate.

542
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,200
 And one of the cops goes, "Oh, you know what we should do?

543
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,640
 We should take a photo of this grave."

544
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,280
 We take it back to our congressman and goes, "Look, the stories are true.

545
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 We don't know anything about all the murders."

546
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
 What do you think we are, cops?

547
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,400
 Do you think we can investigate that stuff?

548
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
 We're good at taking photos, though.

549
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,680
 They take a photo of the tombstone.

550
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,080
 And then they walk back to the car.

551
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,120
 The guy who took the photo is driving.

552
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,240
 And the guy who's going to be alive five minutes from now is in the passenger seat.

553
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,760
 And the cop car is driving on the road.

554
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,560
 And the driver looks up in the rear view mirror and sees a light following him.

555
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
 He's like, "What?

556
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
 That's weird."

557
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,160
 The passenger's like, "Wait, what?

558
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
 What's weird?

559
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
 What's weird?"

560
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,160
 He's like, "Nothing.

561
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,680
 Just that ghostly light that's been following us ever since we left the cemetery.

562
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,120
 Just lights chasing him.

563
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,720
 The cop car is going down the road.

564
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,320
 The light going down the road.

565
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,520
 It doesn't make any noise, would you expect?

566
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
 It's just the light.

567
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,040
 The cop car is going, going.

568
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
 And the passenger's like, "Oh, I wish I could jump out of this.

569
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,840
 I wish it was a horse and buggy."

570
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,280
 Stop, stop, slow down, slow down.

571
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,520
 And the driver won't slow down because he knows what's going to happen.

572
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,680
 He's looking at all chain-related things in his car.

573
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,000
 He realizes he's wearing gold chains he just stole from Mr. T. He's like, "Oh, he's driving.

574
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 The road has a turn in it."

575
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,960
 Now if he can make the turn, he's going to be safe, right?

576
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,800
 Because we all know lights can't turn.

577
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,120
 But if he doesn't hit the turn, he'll drive off-road to prevent people from making that

578
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,280
 very same mistake.

579
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:46,040
 To protect the motorist of Pulaski County, they put up two posts and chain, chain to

580
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,280
 keep people from accidentally driving off the road.

581
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,360
 But in the town where everyone's getting killed by chains, a bad idea, the police car drives

582
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,840
 through the two posts, bang, hits the chain, shurrr, and flips over.

583
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,280
 Wait, doesn't flip over?

584
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,640
 Let me check my notes.

585
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:02,640
 The car hits the chain, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

586
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:32,640
 The car hits the chain, rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

587
00:27:32,640 --> 00:28:02,440
 What happened?

588
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,760
 What happened was he was chiseling away, chingling, and they heard him scream.

589
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,040
 That was a to be continued moment.

590
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,280
 And then the next morning they found him, he had a chain raptor on his neck.

591
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,560
 But not any chain, not just any chain.

592
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:23,200
 There's like a chain, again guys, come on, there was a chain gate for the cemetery.

593
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,680
 So to get in and out of the cemetery, like when they woke up in the morning, the grave

594
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,560
 people, what are they called?

595
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,800
 The desiccated bodies?

596
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,840
 No, the morticians.

597
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
 They would move the chain and then you could drive your car through and mourn your loved

598
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,440
 ones and then at night when all the cars left, they'd put the chain back.

599
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,840
 Like it's a drive-in movie theater or something like that.

600
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,720
 Don't have chains in the graveyard with a ghost who murders people with chains.

601
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,080
 So what they think happened was that something scared them.

602
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,400
 Most likely the chain murdering ghost and he was running and got his head wrapped around

603
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,960
 the chain or maybe the chain flew around and wrapped it around.

604
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,480
 The point is, is that they noticed there was no destruction to the tombstone.

605
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,080
 I guess the point is another man died, but eventually they decided to move all the gravestones

606
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,520
 out of the area except for his because they figured this guy, they didn't want to mess

607
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
 with him.

608
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 Like would you dig up this body?

609
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
 Right?

610
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,080
 They're like, okay, we got some construction equipment that can pull his gravestone up.

611
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,840
 You'll never notice he was here and they're like, great.

612
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,600
 And they're like, bring in the chain machine.

613
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,520
 It's a bunch of like rattling chains, the whole machines and other machines.

614
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,280
 They're like, no, no, no, just leave me here.

615
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,240
 Eventually a company decided to build a strip mining location on the property.

616
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,120
 The county gladly sold it to him.

617
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
 Didn't tell him about the curse.

618
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
 They're like, hey, what's this grave stone over here?

619
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,680
 And they're like, oh, nothing.

620
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
 You can just destroy that and get it out of the way.

621
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
 They're like, oh, that's awesome.

622
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,880
 They hated that company anyways.

623
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,200
 So that story has been going around Pulaski County.

624
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,040
 It's a local legend.

625
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,840
 It's very convenient one, isn't it?

626
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,880
 Where the place has been destroyed.

627
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,280
 You can't visit it now.

628
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
 Let's wrap it up like this.

629
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,880
 Jason B. He's a writer for a website called Colt Nation.

630
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,560
 He actually really dug into this story.

631
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
 So I appreciate it.

632
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,760
 He did a lot of the background research on this stuff.

633
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,480
 Is any of this true?

634
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,760
 Obviously destroying the grave and it coming back in a world of magic and ghosts and stuff

635
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
 like that.

636
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,640
 That's something that can happen in a world of physics and real world stuff.

637
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,840
 Like that would obviously be a game changer.

638
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,880
 If you could have documented it, they brought out a bunch of physicists.

639
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,680
 The Albert Einstein was a lie back then.

640
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,280
 They bring him out here and they're like, look, Mr.

641
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,800
 Reigns, first you don't have any gold chain watches on you, do you?

642
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,640
 Okay, thank you.

643
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,040
 There's no West Coast rappers here, right?

644
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
 Okay, good.

645
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,680
 They destroy it and then they're like just sit and watch and it reform.

646
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,240
 That would change the world of science.

647
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,360
 But that is unlikely.

648
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,160
 Parts of the story may be true and parts of the story may not be.

649
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,760
 So there was not a guy named Charles Pruitt ever alive in that area.

650
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,880
 However, there was a guy named, and this was Jason B. Did all this research.

651
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,960
 There was a guy named Enos C. Pruitt.

652
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,880
 So he may have gone by his middle name, right?

653
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,920
 Now we're guessing, but Enos Pruitt, he actually did kill himself with a gun.

654
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,720
 That death took place in 1910.

655
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,840
 Remember the Carl Pruitt story?

656
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,720
 He supposedly killed his wife in 1938.

657
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 So we have that.

658
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,840
 We have the Enos Pruitt.

659
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,680
 But as far as the police, there was no record of police being killed.

660
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,640
 There was no record of anyone named James Collins.

661
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,800
 There's a lot of people that were named.

662
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,240
 The guy who was in the coaching buggy.

663
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
 He was named.

664
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,440
 I just left it out for brevity, but now I have to explain that I left it out now so

665
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,120
 it actually makes it a little bit longer.

666
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,960
 There was a guy by his name who died in like 1917, a couple counties away.

667
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,360
 So you do have some of the names that match up, but he's probably just a shot in the dark.

668
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,040
 Other names like James Collins, the mom, those names didn't exist.

669
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,320
 Arthur Lewis, he was the guy, the last guy who died.

670
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,800
 He didn't exist.

671
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,720
 There's a photo supposedly of Carl Pruitt, but there's no proof that that's an actual

672
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,720
 photo of him.

673
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,000
 And if Carl Pruitt was actually Enos C. Pruitt, that photo would not have been taken to 1910.

674
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,240
 Technology wasn't there yet.

675
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,000
 It's a pretty crisp photo from, you know, of the 40s.

676
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,120
 Jason B. tracked the story back.

677
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,560
 And I actually saw this pop up in my notes as well.

678
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,000
 The earliest version of the story was from a book called "Beyond the Grave" written

679
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,760
 back in 2000, and Jason B. said he contacted the author, Troy Taylor, to try to figure

680
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,560
 out more about the origin of the story, but he never heard back from him.

681
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,600
 So it's possible that it's a fictional story made up by an author to sell a book.

682
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 It's definitely possible.

683
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,680
 It's possible that it is a local legend that's grown over time.

684
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,120
 That there was a man named Enos Pruitt who may have killed his wife with a chain.

685
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
 Right?

686
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
 Wouldn't that make more sense?

687
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
 I'm not giving you murderers tips.

688
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
 I'm like, use a chain.

689
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
 Not your hands.

690
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,640
 You're less cramping in your thumbs.

691
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,960
 And then he killed himself, and then the legend grew, and nobody wants to keep telling a

692
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,560
 ghost story about a guy named Enos, right?

693
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,040
 So they changed it to Carl.

694
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
 That's possible.

695
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,520
 This is one of those interesting stories where whether or not it's true, it's kind of irrelevant.

696
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
 What does this story do?

697
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,080
 It's an invitation to adventure.

698
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,000
 They moved his body.

699
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,720
 The strip mining company, they just didn't start, "Let's start here, boys."

700
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,080
 They just chopped him up.

701
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,520
 They moved his body.

702
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,120
 So what that means is somewhere in Pulaski, which I've mispronounced every single time

703
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,360
 I've said it, I've had a different way of pronouncing it each time, that body is still

704
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,520
 somewhere in that county, hidden, maybe even unmarked.

705
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:29,480
 And it's one of those stories that invites bored teenagers or kids to hop on their bikes

706
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,000
 and explore the countryside, looking for the haunted location of a murderous ghost, one

707
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 of the most rare type of ghosts.

708
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,280
 And it's one of the best ghost stories because you can still go out to try to experience

709
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
 it.

710
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,600
 On those lazy weekends, you can convince your friends, "Hey guys, let's drive around.

711
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,840
 Let's drive around random locations and see somewhere in the brush out in the middle of

712
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
 nowhere.

713
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,440
 Maybe we'll stumble across the faded tombstone with a crystal clear chain emblazoned on it."

714
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,240
 Oh yeah, we should go up to Old Man Hoots place.

715
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,560
 I heard that there's a weird mound in his backyard.

716
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,280
 We should go and check.

717
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,880
 We should go get our buddies together.

718
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
 It's an invitation to adventure.

719
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,400
 It gives you permission to explore.

720
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,400
 I think those are always the most fun ghost stories, really.

721
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,560
 Because again, this one's most likely not true.

722
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,920
 In whole, parts of it may have been.

723
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,120
 But as a full sequence, these murderous ghosts are so rare to have one just start chopping

724
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,280
 people down because they take photographs of it.

725
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
 But who knows?

726
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,960
 I just like to think that somewhere out there in Pulaski County, a bunch of kids are getting

727
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,040
 ready to go on a ghost hunting adventure to see if they can finally prove whether or not

728
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,240
 Carl Pruitt ever existed.

729
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,320
 And more importantly, is he really capable of killing people from beyond the grave?

730
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,160
 Generations of kids have gone in ghost hunts like that.

731
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:14,920
 I guess she can say some things, some things never chain.

732
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
 I was planning on that.

733
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,160
 I was planning on that pun for like 15 minutes as I was recording this.

734
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,000
 I was like, I'm going to end it like that.

735
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,680
