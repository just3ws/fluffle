1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A community police officer makes quite a big mistake at a local elementary school.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,500
 Artificial intelligence programs that you can use today to cause some serious havoc.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a look at the theory of Zermatism.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Has humanity been locked in a daily struggle that has lasted for a millennia against our most hated foe, the Yeti, today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Garfinner.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. I actually have had a really hard time getting started today.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I've just been like messing around all day long, completely no motivation.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 And finally I was like, "Ah, I better do something because I got a lot of stuff to do."

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So here I am. Our first story today.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 What is wrong with my voice? Our first story today.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 We're going back to it, guys. New news. I found this on my new news folder a while back and I haven't really been saving it.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I just haven't gotten around to it. The year of new news, 2004. We're in the city of Houston, Texas.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 This short story, but it's kind of funny.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Elementary school. There's a little elementary school in the middle of Houston, Texas, middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I don't know. I'm sure it's a quite populated area.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 There's a school police officer. It's like a community resource officer.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 He shows up and he's like, "Hey guys, I have this awesome stuff for you. I'm going to do this anti-gang lecture."

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And they're like, "Why are you so surprised? Why are you talking like you're a game show host?"

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 He's like, "No, no, no. I'm sorry. I have an anti-gang lecture to do. I don't want to forget that other intro.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I didn't take a look at my notes. I forgot what he was talking about.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I'm doing an anti-gang lecture, so I'm actually very stern and I'm shaking my finger at you."

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And then this is an elementary school again, but he's like telling, you know, kids stay away from drugs,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 stay away from gangs. He looks at his notes and that's all he has written down.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 "Stay away from drugs, stay away from gangs."

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 How do you talk to elementary school kids about gang violence?

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 He's like, "Well, you know, sometimes they shove crack up their butt so we don't find it at first."

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 But then and then the kids are like, "What? What is going on?"

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Anyways, he's lecturing them anti-gang lecture and he's like, "I have some supplies to hand out.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I have some stuff I'm going to hand out."

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Now again, elementary school.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 So he hands out this, he hands out, like, I don't know, maybe stickers, pictures of like a blood in a crib with like an X through them.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And he hands out a calendar. He gives away 25 calendars to these kids.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 25 anti-gang calendars.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Now, this is where that would normally not be something we cover on this show.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 But this is where it falls into dead rabbit radio territory.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 The calendars that he handed out to these elementary school students,

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 they don't know how he got him, but apparently he went to some gang,

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 he went to some gang, anti-gang lecture of his own, like he was being lectured.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Someone was pointing sternly at him and saying, "Don't do drugs, don't join a gang."

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 They gave him all this material and somehow that material ended up with the stuff he was giving out to the school kids.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Now, Satan worshiping is generally considered a street gang.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And again, I'm not talking about like the church of Satan, Anton LeVe level Satan,

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 but you'll have gangs, you know where this is going now,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 you'll have gangs that get locked up in like gang presentations for police and one of them is saint worshipers.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 They're like, they're generally are like gangs.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 They run in groups of like say three to seven and they may not do as much drug dealing,

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 but they do do other criminal activities like vandalism and loitering and drinking and drug use and stuff like that.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So he got these at some point, the police officer got these at some point and he's handing out these school,

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 he's handing out these calendars to the school kids, elementary school kids,

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 and it's a calendar, just a normal calendar that you look at,

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 but then it has what it basically it was a calendar you would give to a cop.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 So you would look at a date and go, uh-oh, this is a satanic holiday.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 We better have extra patrols on the loose and you're thinking, oh, you know, that's okay, Jason.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 They give out calendars that have Christian holidays on them, right?

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 So what's the problem with giving out a calendar?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 This is what one, okay, you're giving this to a fourth grader or a third grader, whatever the grade was September 20th.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You're like, oh, that's my birthday.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Yay, September 20th, I'm going to look at the calendar and see what the same worshipers do on my birthday.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I'm in third grade.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 This is what it said on the calendar.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 September 20th is a midnight host.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You should have a blood type ritual.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Yeah, okay, I'm not scared of my birthday now.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Okay, next one's going, my birthday's the 23rd.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Let's look at that one.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 This is what it said on this calendar.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Fall Equinox.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Yay!

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 You should have an orgy.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 What?

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Activity.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Group sex.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Any age, any sex.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 That's what it said on this calendar that he handed out to a bunch of kids.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Now, no one was really punished for this.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 The parents were super furious because these kids are coming home with these calendars.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I'm assuming they were all black with red pentagrams on them, like really, really like sexed up.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Not for the kids, but for the cops who were getting them, they're like, "Oh yeah, this looks super spooky. Let's go rest all these sameness."

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 But I don't know, I just thought there was an interest story.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And then you could go with the conspiracy angle that it wasn't a mistake.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 That if you go there and you hand out 25 calendars to 25 different kids, you may get one of them interested in your cult that you already have operating in the city of Houston.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Was it a mistake?

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 I don't know.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Probably a very bad mistake.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I'm sure that cop still gets like pentagrams drawn on his locker at work.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Everyone still makes fun of him for telling kids that September 23rd was orgy night.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Our next story is actually shorter than that one.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 That one I thought was going to be a little bit shorter.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Artificial intelligence.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 I'm not a huge fan of artificial intelligence, not in the sense that I'm afraid like Elon Musk is like, "It's the greatest."

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Elon Musk is like, "It's the worst thing that could ever happen."

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Like a lot of people are really scared of AI. I'm not.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 I don't, I think that AI can never be as smart as we imagine it can be.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 There's just no proof of that.

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 There's absolutely no proof that it can ever do anything that they're afraid it's going to do, whatever.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 But I find AI tools very interesting.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 That's what I'm saying. I don't like houses, but I love hammers.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 But they have two new tools out.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 One of them actually was developed by Elon Musk.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I'm not going to knock on Elon Musk, but they have two new tools out that are incredibly interesting.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 You can check out one you can use right now.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And you've heard a little bit about it, but there's a website called, "This person does not exist."

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So the first time I came across this website, this person does not exist, I was reading something and they're like,

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 "If you ever need to set up a fake profile of someone, if you're ever trying to scam somebody

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 or like get information on someone, basically black hat stuff you're trying to fool somebody,

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 you can go to this website, this person does not exist, and it will generate a random photo of a person who has never existed."

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And I'm like, "What? That's impossible."

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Links, of course, are going to be below.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 You click on this and it just generates really real looking people.

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Now what's interesting is it is true. In Vidya, the video capture card people,

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 I'm sure they do other stuff, but that's how I know them from being a gamer,

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 they invented this program. What they did was they took 7,000 photos from Instagram, I believe,

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 uploaded them into a super computer with, you know, the giant had like,

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 it was so super it had the two reel-to-reels and the tape going,

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 and it was punching and throwing out punch tickets all day long.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You put in the 7,000 photos, it takes elements from all of them,

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 and it can just generate people who have never existed.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 What's weird about it is you go there and the people look real, and everything is consistent.

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 So generally you'll see like an older person with older eyes and older lips and older skin,

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 someone who's black or darker skinned.

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's not like it's a black dude with white guy's eyes and long blonde hair and like Asian lips.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 It can detect what should match to that skin type, what should match to that face.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's very bizarre. Also, the longer you look at the site,

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 the easier it is to realize that what you're looking at is fake,

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 because you start to see faces that are a little uncanny.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Little kids' faces are really creepy, they're really hard to replicate,

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 and it's set up for one face. So there are photos where it's like,

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 it will create a group photo for some reason, or it will take elements from a group photo

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 and transport it into a photo that's only supposed to be one person.

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 So the person in the middle of the frame looks totally unique,

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 but on the side of the frame, the hobgoblins are jumping out trying to eat their face.

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 The face is super distorted because the computer can't make sense of that limited amount of information.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Very, very bizarre. But if you created a Facebook profile with one of those pictures,

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 no one would question it. No one would question it. They'd be like,

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 "Oh, it's Henry. Henry Joe from... This person does not exist.com."

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 That's an interesting thing that you work there.

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 But yeah, they're very easy to fool. However, the longer you keep looking through pictures,

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 the easier it is to realize. But the first 10 or 12, you're going to be a little...

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And honestly, I want to be totally shocked if I found out this was some sort of scam or marketing gimmick,

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 but the news reports... I mean, Nvidia put their name on it, so I don't think they would really be like,

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 "Haha, we fooled you. We don't really have technology that advanced."

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Elon Musk made a program. I'm going to read you this real quick.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 This is a news article. I'm going to read you this news article real quick.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "In a shocking find, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote,

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 previously unexplored valley in the Andes Mountains.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 That paragraph was put into an AI program that was built to write...

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Write news articles. That's all the information they gave it, and then it had to go out and find other information.

150
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So you had that paragraph. Next sentence.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 "The scientists named the population after their distinctive horn, Ovid's unicorn.

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 These four horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved."

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Dr. Jorge Perez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz,

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 goes on for another probably eight paragraphs.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 If I didn't tell you that those following paragraphs were fake, would it sound like a human wrote those?

157
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 It would basically went out and gathered this information from the internet and wrote this article.

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And apparently this AI program is so powerful that Elon Musk said, "We will not release the source code for this.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 We're going to release a more limited version of the source code that consumers can use."

160
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But the problem, you could generate mass...

161
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You could basically generate more fake news in a day than all the real news ever printed.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Those are my words, not his.

163
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 But if you had a supercomputer, again, the two reels running this advanced AI writing these articles,

164
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 you could just flood the internet with fake news and you would never ever be able to tell the difference between a computer-written article that was fake,

165
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 that was just given a few facts in the beginning, or a real article.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I don't necessarily think this story is true.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I think that the elements to it are true, and I think that they did create this program.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 But one thing I've learned a lot, I remember watching this thing on a screen junkies and they're like,

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 "A computer wrote our newest honest trailers."

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And it basically wrote the script and the guy was writing it and it sounded like this nonsense thing.

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And the way that it worked, that one in particular, because they had to break it down and they did like a behind the scenes event,

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 that sounded really impressive that a computer could write that and I think that's what happens here as well.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 The AI actually would spit out multiple guesses and a human had to go and pick which one they wanted in which place.

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 So it really just spit out chains of words and humans went in and made the final editing decisions.

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I'm thinking that's what went on with this.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I'm thinking that it could have said, "Dr. Umbrella Hapman!"

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 An evolutionary biologist and they're like, "No, that doesn't work."

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And it's like, "Dr. Umbrella Perez!"

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And they're like, "Well, we're getting closer, so let's keep the doctor, let's keep the Perez and let the algorithm."

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I think that's how this worked.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I could be wrong on that.

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I think you have to have a human go and it doesn't specify whether, no, no, no, it was 100% or if human, there was...

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 It said limited human interaction, whatever that means.

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So I don't think it's as advanced as they're putting it out to be.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 However, you don't want a computer spitting out fake news all day long.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 I get that.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But again, that's one of the reasons why I'm just not that threatened by AI.

188
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 We'll do an upcoming episode on Roko's Basilic.

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And if you know of that story right now, consider that a warning.

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 If you don't want to listen to that episode, I'll just title it that.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You can skip that episode, but that has to do with AI masters and overlords and simulation theory and all sorts of stuff.

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But again, I think it's an interesting topic.

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I just am not afraid of the AI.

194
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 You hear me, that AI?

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I'm not afraid of you!

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Now let's go to a topic that I'm kind of afraid of.

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But I think I've always kind of had a crush on her at the same time.

198
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Like growing up.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 I don't know.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 I have an odd love-hate relationship with the woman that you all know.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 The woman we all fear, and I might possibly love.

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 I'm still trying to figure that out.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Her name is Bloody Mary.

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 I don't know why I kept you in...

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I don't know why I try to keep you in suspense.

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 That's also going to be the title of this episode.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But Bloody Mary is a game that I think everyone has either played or heard of.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Oh wait, this isn't the Bloody Mary episode.

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Never mind.

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Never mind.

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But I'm going to keep that one in, and we'll consider that a teaser for tomorrow's episode.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Forget Bloody Mary.

213
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 That's how much I want to talk about Bloody Mary.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 This story, though.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I want to talk about this story because I think it's very fascinating on multiple levels.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And it also ties into a story that's coming out next week on this show.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Is it possible that humanity is locked into a secret war?

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 That's always been a question, and I think that's something that pops up in stories of the Illuminati and things like that.

219
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 That there's a secret war going on.

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 But what if the enemy isn't us?

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 There are some theories that we're fighting reptilians, that we're fighting demons.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 But there was a man named Stanislaw Cizukliski.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We're just going to call him Stanislaw, who had another theory.

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Now, Stanislaw was a Polish artist, and not just like a Polish artist.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 He was considered the greatest artist to ever come out of Poland.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 He was a sculptor.

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Sculptor.

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I don't know why I'm saying that like that, but he was a sculpture.

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 He wasn't a sculpture.

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He was a sculptor.

231
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Sculptor, that's what I'm looking for.

232
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And gifted from an early age.

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 He was a master of mold.

234
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Dean Stuff, master of mold, was actually his name in Poland.

235
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 In 1943, he's still young.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 He was born in 1907, okay?

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And he was already like messing around with popsicle sticks, like in the womb.

238
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He comes out, he's building wire structures, messing around with clay.

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He's just like amazing artists.

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So in 1943, sorry, in 1934, Poland says, "We're going to build you a museum."

241
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 You're only in like your, what, late 20s by then?

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 "We're going to build you a museum."

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 To how's your work?

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 He was considered the greatest living artist at that time.

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 But 1934 for Poland wasn't, you know, a banner year for them.

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And it was only going to get worse, because in 1939, the Nazis just plowed into the country,

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 blew up his museum, and all of his works were destroyed.

248
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Nothing remained from that early period of Stanislaw's life.

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Now at the time, he was kind of, he was a famous artist.

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 He was roaming through Europe and traveling to America and stuff like that.

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And he's like, well, there's nothing to go back to there.

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 He just like goes there and he's like, "No, my sculptures."

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And they're like, "No, that's just rubble."

254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And he's like, "I can't tell the difference."

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 He's just holding up giant bricks.

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 So him and his family go to America.

257
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And at that point, he basically becomes like a troll.

258
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He's basically a troll of the art community.

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Like he's constantly arguing with other artists and stuff like that.

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And he doesn't have any money.

261
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 So it's okay if you're a dick, but you're wealthy.

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And if you're poor, you should probably be nice,

263
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 because you probably need more help, but he didn't have that figured out.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But he had something else on his plate.

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 He's like, "You know what? All these artists are terrible people.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And the world is a terrible place.

267
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 But I know something. I know something nobody else knows.

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I know about the war."

269
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Now imagine, this is something that I think is pretty useful in this type of stuff.

270
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Imagine you are a loved one of somebody who is losing their mind.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Stanislaw was a gifted artist, definitely.

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And we have photographs of his work before and after the museum, because he continued to create work.

273
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 But his work then focused on the war.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And not the war that was raging in World War II, but he believed that we were at war with the Yeti.

275
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Which he called the Yeti-syn, which means "sons of Yeti."

276
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And he basically crafted a philosophy, a religion called Zermatism.

277
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So while he continued to do sculpting work, he was also writing a 42-volume book series

278
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 that had 25,000 pages and 14,000 illustrations by him detailing this, by all accounts, a fictional world.

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 But it was the world that we lived in that he saw it, and this is how it was set up.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So this was his story. The mud flood shows up.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 The world is basically flooded and muddy and everything is destroyed.

282
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And an unspecified time period for him.

283
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That I could see specified what the time period was.

284
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 But humanity basically got pushed to Easter Island.

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And the remnants of whatever was here before us made it to Easter Island.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And as the mud began to recede, the water was still there.

287
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 The people said, "We need to leave Easter Island. We need to repopulate the planet."

288
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And depending on how your people left Easter Island is how the indigenous people had lines on their face.

289
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And when I saw that, I just imagined a bunch of wrinkles on people.

290
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 But no, you know how some tribes will have like two red marks on their cheeks?

291
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Like they'll take ink, not like they're physically, but they'll take ink and they'll put two red marks.

292
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 He goes, "That means they went through a deep set of mud and then to a shallow set of mud.

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And the two marks represent the two things of mud."

294
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And he'll show a picture, a drawing of an aborigine guy with two red lines on his face.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Then he goes, "And then in this culture they would paint a wavy line on their face.

296
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 That means the mud flood that they swam through to get to, you know, Bolivia was more like crazy.

297
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Like, whoa kids, this is nuts. Like it was super wavy.

298
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And if they had ones that were in a different angle and meant like maybe they climbed up a mountain through the mud or something like that.

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But that was to signify how they left Easter Island and got to the mud.

300
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So we're basically back to who shot John Lennon territory.

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Where this guy may be a brilliant artist, but he, I'm sure at some point he was looking through Aboriginal face painting patterns.

302
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And he saw something that nobody else could see.

303
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Just like Stephen Lightfoot, who believes that Stephen King killed John Lennon.

304
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He reads these headlines and sees he's, thinks he's seeing a code no one else can see.

305
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Stanislaw is seeing these pictures of aborigine people with face paint.

306
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And he's showing people and he's like, look, no, you see this shows where the mud was.

307
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And as a loved one, you'd have to be like, oh, yeah, sure.

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Like at what point do you say, no, that's not true.

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Because nobody really argued with this guy about this.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Because again, what are you going to say?

311
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Now, this is where a little bit of the ethnocentrism comes in.

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 He believes that the original language, the best language that Earth ever had,

313
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 that was spoke on Easter Island was called Protong.

314
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And that is basically modern day Polish.

315
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So, you know, yeah, you just happened to Stanislaw, you just happened to be lucky enough to be hanging out.

316
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 I mean, that's a little like, you're the one who is able to decipher this and your language is the best language on the planet.

317
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And you know, that's a little bizarre, little bizarre.

318
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It would be interesting if somebody, if somebody was like super racist and they found,

319
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I think, I mean, what if Stanislaw, what if he was researching this and he found out that like,

320
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 all of like the lame people who left Easter Island tried to win other continents and everyone pushed them to Poland.

321
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And they're like, no, I don't want to go somewhere else.

322
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Like it's interesting that, that was a long segue to get to this, but it's interesting that this guy obviously is having some sort of delusion.

323
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And the delusion makes him superior.

324
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It's interesting because delusions, I think, tend to make people feel superior.

325
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I wonder how many people have delusions that make them inferior.

326
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Other than like being a cuckold, that makes you inferior.

327
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But you know what I mean? Like if you're start to hallucinate and lose your mind,

328
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 and then you find out that you are, you're part of the suckiest race on the planet and everyone else is great.

329
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I wonder how often that happens.

330
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But anyway, so he believed that all art and all history was connected because humanity was once on this small island together, surviving.

331
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And they all spoke pro-tongue and Polish speech is the best, the Polish language is the best living representation of how they spoke back then.

332
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But you're like, Jason, Jason, get to the Bigfoot stuff, get to the Bigfoot stuff.

333
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 You're just going off on tangents.

334
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 But so anyways, yeah, now we're at the Bigfoot stuff.

335
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Now he did have an interesting thing about, and I hadn't really thought of this, which is odd.

336
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I know about Bigfoot in America and then you have like the Yeti and the Himalayas and stuff like that.

337
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 But he believed that humanity has been locked in a war with the Yeti for centuries.

338
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And it is a war we are kind of losing according to him.

339
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 This was actually in his book and I thought this was an interesting phrase.

340
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 The Yeti of the Himalayas do not exist in isolation.

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Their legend is spread far across cultural lines, taking on different names in each.

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 The European Woodwows, the Mongolian Almas, the Siberian Chukyonya, the Chinese Yorin, the Japanese Hibagon, the Amazonian Mapagnari, the American Sasquatch or Bigfoot, the Nuklok of the Canadian North.

343
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 They exist in all cultures, these wild, hairy creatures of great strength and power.

344
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And that's true.

345
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Almost every culture does have a story of a beast of end, they tend to match up.

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 They're larger than humans, they're hairier than humans, they're stronger than humans, and they live in the wilderness.

347
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 If you could attribute that to any other living, basically you could say the same thing, you could go "cats here act the same way cats do in Siberia."

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Cats here may have a thinner fur and if they're indoor cats they'll be a little fatter, but they could say for the most part there may be small variables.

349
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 But if you saw a cat in Siberia you would recognize it as a cat, and if you went to Africa and saw a cat it would eat you, but as it was eating you you would recognize it as a cat.

350
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And he's saying the same thing about Bigfoot, so that is definitely true.

351
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 It was funny because I started researching these other ones that I hadn't heard of the Woodwows, of the Almas.

352
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I actually have an Almas story coming up later this week.

353
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 There's a lot of cool ones and we're going to look into these ones as well, the Japanese one, I didn't know there was a Japanese Bigfoot, so he did lock in on that.

354
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 But he believes that the reason why those, they exist everywhere is not only because they're true, but because we are constantly interacting with them.

355
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Not only back then when we were fighting spear to spear with opponents that were 8 feet tall, but today, because today they have infiltrated human society.

356
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Here's a quote from a book about the Stanislaw.

357
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 "Today you might be hard-pressed to recognize a human, Yetisen, among us, but according to the Zermatic theory, they have frequently positioned themselves as our cruelest leaders.

358
00:25:44,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Be they the ancient emperors and tyrants, the medieval conquerors and kings, the Nazis, the Bolsheviks, it seems that wherever the children of the Yeti find themselves able to take the reins of power from man, violence and imperial ambition follow.

359
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 For Susaloski, a highly visual thinker, it was readily apparent which physical characteristics would reveal a Yetisen, long upper lips, sharply angled undercut noses, a certain squatness or roundness in their physique, a short, eight-poied tail, and, always accompanying these physical quirks, are the inescapable mental characteristics.

360
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Unforgiving hatred of man, owing partially to rejection on the basis of their biology, an inborn need to dominate and possess, an almost uniform inclination to communism, a desire to cause violence and provoke terror.

361
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 It's funny because there's not a lot of stuff about Zermatism and this is red meat for people into the conspiracy theory and paranormal beliefs. It was bizarre how little information I could find about this guy.

362
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 That being said, Leonardo DiCaprio's father was a good friend of Stanislaw and Leonardo DiCaprio grew up with Stanislaw, he knew him very well, he loved hearing the stories about this man looking at his art, he's actually making a documentary, he made the documentary but it hasn't come out yet,

363
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Struggle, the Life and Lost Art of Tsukolowski, I think that will bring a lot of attention to this guy because despite his dilute, and it's funny because there's this middle thing where I don't believe in the mud theory and the face painting and the stuff like that, so he kind of lost me in the middle with his theories,

364
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 but he was an amazing artist who had everything destroyed in the war and then he has this interesting Bigfoot Sasquatch, grand unifying theory almost, that I think it's important for his story to be told and again I find it so bizarre that this is not super well known.

365
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And to be honest, I had never heard of this before, I actually found out about this recently, it was a request, I don't have written down who requested it, so I believe that it was a request that I came across, I'll go on 4chan every once in a while and ask for a request, I actually think that Dead Rabbit Radio may be, like I had a thread the other day, someone started, and they're like hey Dead Rabbit Radio is great and they deleted it, I'm starting to think that they might be trying to shadow ban me from there, but I didn't start that thread.

366
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 But yeah, so it's something that is super obscure and again it is perfect for people who are into conspiracy theories and it has everything, it has a racist component because like the bad guys are a separate race but they kind of look like humans but you can tell them apart, so they have that, that's real popular with conspiracy theories, it has the phantom menace, it has this evil that is set up that we don't know it's there, it's all interconnected, they have their own

367
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I don't know why this is more popular, but the core question is, is he really the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's

368
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I'm like he right, like I said I don't buy into the people swimming through the mud and the lines of their faces and the Polish language is the best language in the world, I dismiss that, we all know English is, but here's the question, are we at war with a group of Yeti, the sons of Yeti, so they're the descendants of the Yeti, that's why they look human, is it possible that Hitler and Mao and Stalin all had little eight tails sticking out of there,

369
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 but probably not, probably not, most likely not, but it's an interesting theory because again when we see people do evil things, we always go man how could they do that, and so if you could say well they could do that because they're not human, you're like oh okay then I don't have to worry about being that evil, so that's a little helpful in that, but that philosophical blanket aside that we can cut it up to.

370
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Is it possible that we're at war with a hidden species, not a ethnic group that we don't like or that we think or a religion that is like ruined in the world or nothing like that, I'm talking about is it possible that there is a separate species that has infiltrated our planet, our planet and rule us,

371
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 or was Stanislaw just a madman who was connecting all these threads to weave this story that only he could really believe, who knows, but sometimes you have to be a little mad to be able to see the real truth.

372
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:18,000
