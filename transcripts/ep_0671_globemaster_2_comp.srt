1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Today we meet the hero that we need the most, the Crap Crusader.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,260
 Then we change tone completely to take a look at a medical study that shows that chronic

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,620
 pain may actually make you dumber.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,360
 Then we travel back to the year 1951 to take a look at an airplane crash in the middle

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,880
 of the Atlantic Ocean that seemed miraculous.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,560
 Every single person survived the crash.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,640
 But then the mystery begins.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,560
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:42,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,680
 I hope you guys are going to have some fun stuff this week.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,840
 And first off, let's take a cool look at this fan art we have here for Fan Art Friday.

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 This was done by Rudy Jazz.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,360
 Rudy Jazz, very active member in the Dead Rabbit Radio community.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,600
 Really really appreciate it.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,760
 Thanks for the art.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,560
 Thank you for all of your support.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,000
 Really means a lot Rudy Jazz.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,960
 Really really means a lot.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,040
 Also coming into Dead Rabbit Command holding a little umbrella like Mary Poppins, but they're

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,100
 not flying and just walking and holding the umbrella.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,640
 It's Radio Lunch.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,800
 Everyone give a round of applause for...

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,000
 Oh there they go.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Now they're flying around.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Now they're trying to be impressive flying around the room.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,360
 Radio Lunch, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,760
 the Patreon or if you don't like to show off your levitation powers, that's fine too.

31
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,400
 Just helps rid the word about the show.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,640
 Really really helps out a lot.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,920
 Someone grab Radio Lunch's ankles, you ain't come back down to the ground.

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
 It's enough of that.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,960
 Radio Lunch, I'm going to give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,760
 We're going to go ahead and leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,800
 We are headed out to Multona Ma County or that's not how you pronounce that.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,600
 Let me try that again before you guys try looking it up on a map because you guys are

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
 going to want to investigate this story.

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
 Trust me.

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,120
 Multona Ma County, Oregon.

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,440
 I'll just put in the show notes.

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,080
 I'll just put a map in the show notes, an entire map.

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,200
 Multona Ma County, Oregon is where we're going.

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,280
 Radio Lunch is just shrugging.

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
 Starts flying away in the umbrella again.

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,960
 No no no, we need you to drive the vehicle.

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,560
 You'll have to figure it out.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,880
 Multona Ma County, Oregon.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 Start up at Jason Jalopy.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,040
 It's going down the road out here, but we got to drive really, really slow.

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,480
 In Multona Ma County, Oregon, what's going on is for the past two years, a man, I don't

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 know why I'm being sexist.

54
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,600
 The woman can do this too, right?

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,800
 It's 2021.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
 Somebody, I don't know, I just assume it's a dude.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,040
 Somebody, it doesn't matter.

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,560
 It's not going to make any difference.

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
 Somebody has been throwing their poop out of their car.

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 Well, maybe.

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,080
 How's that a maybe?

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,360
 There's either human feces on the side of the road or not.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,280
 I guess the maybe part is, are they throwing it?

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,280
 They might just be jumping in there.

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 Jason, that doesn't make a difference.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,720
 It doesn't matter how it gets there.

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
 You're telling me that there's human feces in there.

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
 Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,680
 So what's been going on for two years now?

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,880
 The majority has been pooping in bags.

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,960
 A considerable amount of poop, they say, like per bag.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 The people are very impressed.

73
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,720
 They're like, man, this guy must work in a Taco Bell or something.

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,200
 Lots of poop and there's kitty litter in there as well.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,600
 Now you can say whatever you want about this man.

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,840
 Again, shouldn't be sexist women poop too.

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,240
 You can say whatever you want about this person, but at least they're considerate, right?

78
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,480
 They could have just pooped in the bag.

79
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,400
 The fact that they're buying kitty litter to kind of cover it up shows that now that

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,560
 I'm thinking about it, I was thinking maybe they put it in the bag so it doesn't smell

81
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,680
 so bad and throw it out the window.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,480
 Now I'm thinking they probably just do it at home.

83
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,360
 They're probably not trying to make it smell better on the side of the road.

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,040
 They probably have a giant human sized litter box at home.

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 They poop in it.

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,800
 So someone's been throwing out a considerable amount of poop covered in kitty litter out

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,280
 of cars or stopping.

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
 It doesn't matter.

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
 It doesn't matter how it's getting there.

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,160
 It doesn't matter if they're gently placing it.

91
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,640
 For two years, hundreds of bags of this stuff have been appearing on these stretches of

92
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,080
 road.

93
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,440
 So much so, it's become a road hazard.

94
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,040
 I should have told Radio Lunch that he's been driving down the street all the time the

95
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
 car's slipping and sliding.

96
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,000
 Cars have been hitting these bags and it's just, I would laugh so hard.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,080
 Even if my own car hit a bag of poop, I'd laugh really hard.

98
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,720
 The funniest one, which is probably far more dangerous, because you've got four wheels.

99
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,600
 One wheel gets covered in poop.

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
 Say la vie.

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,320
 One guy was riding a motorcycle down the road.

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
 No windshield.

103
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
 No protection.

104
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,800
 Riding his motorcycle down the road.

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,200
 Hits a white bag.

106
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
 Poop shoots up.

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,720
 I imagine that was the biggest bag ever.

108
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,760
 I imagine that day that guy truly had a grande meal.

109
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
 I hope.

110
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 I hope it was comical.

111
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,720
 I hope it looked like he was covered in mud.

112
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,120
 But maybe not.

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,920
 Maybe he just feared out of control.

114
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,760
 Maybe he just lost control of his motorcycle and got a concussion.

115
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,320
 I'd be all, "Oh man, I'd be super disappointed."

116
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
 He's like, "Uh, call an ambulance.

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
 I'm just walking away."

118
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,760
 I'm like, "Whatever, dude.

119
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
 Be funny.

120
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,840
 Be funny next time you get injured."

121
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,040
 It's been going on for so long.

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,600
 That's when Nonomah County Code Enforcement Officer David Thompson is on the case.

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,240
 This man's obsessed with bringing down this supervillain.

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,920
 I don't think he's really supervillain.

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,320
 He's just pooping in bags.

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 David Thompson goes, "Listen, it's so funny because the article that I read about this,

127
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,720
 the article that I read about this, he's pleading.

128
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
 He's pleading for some closure to this case."

129
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,440
 He actually changed his work schedule.

130
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,520
 He used to work during the day, but now the night calls him.

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
 He's actually worked the overnight shift because these bags are being deposited between midnight

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
 and 4 a.m.

133
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,160
 And David Thompson's sitting there.

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,640
 He's disguised as a big white bag.

135
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,000
 He's hoping someone will pick him up and poop in them and they'll jump out and go, "Aha!"

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,560
 I'm sure he actually has a better plan than that, but he's been trying to catch this guy.

137
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,640
 David has actually personally picked up 100 bags of this guy's stuff.

138
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,840
 And the article, he's pleading, he's like, "He can't."

139
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,400
 So funny because on the one hand, he totally wants to catch this guy, and then on the other

140
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,440
 hand, it boggles his mind why someone's doing this.

141
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
 He thinks.

142
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,800
 He's going, "Listen, maybe the guy's septic tank isn't working.

143
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,720
 Maybe this guy's having some financial issues and something happened with the septic tank,

144
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,560
 and we can help.

145
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
 Tell us who you are."

146
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
 He's so funny.

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
 He's reading this article.

148
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,040
 He's like, "Please tell us who you are because we can help you."

149
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,320
 He also says, "If we catch you in the act, see, then you're in trouble.

150
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,160
 Then you're going to get the maximum fine, which I'm assuming is like a $95 ticket.

151
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,720
 It's littering at the end of the day.

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,800
 It'll be nothing."

153
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,600
 But he goes, "If you confess, if you confess your sins to us, then we will give you a couple

154
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,360
 hundred dollars to fix your septic tank.

155
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
 What's going on?"

156
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,000
 I think the guy probably broke his septic tank because of the kitty litter, but then

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,240
 eventually he probably got his septic tank fixed, and now just really enjoys throwing

158
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,080
 poop out the window.

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,480
 And if anything, I think David Thompson has found his calling in life.

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,240
 How many people actually get to be?

161
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,800
 Sherlock Holmes to someone else's Moriarty or Batman to someone else's Joker.

162
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,880
 David Thompson has this now.

163
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,760
 So David Thompson, aka the Crap Crusader, we here at Dead Rabbit Radio salute you.

164
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,520
 We hope that you find what you're looking for.

165
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:56,360
 We hope that you find a suspect holding his own feces in a shopping bag, and then you

166
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,560
 have to put handcuffs on that guy and maybe even wrestle him to the ground.

167
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,320
 And then he's throwing them like green goblin bombs at you and you're like, "Oh, this

168
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,680
 isn't part of the job."

169
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,440
 If that happens, if that happens, if you think that's going to happen, David, call me.

170
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 We will come out there.

171
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,080
 We will record it live, and it'll be hilarious.

172
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,920
 But if that's not going to happen, then don't bother.

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
 Don't bother.

174
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,080
 If you just arrest the guy, or it turns out that his septic tank isn't working, whatever.

175
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
 That's not what we're here for.

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
 We're here for the funny.

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,320
 This next story is not funny at all.

178
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
 Radio lunch, I'm going to toss you the...

179
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,440
 Let's use the hair hang glider.

180
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,400
 You're good at hovering anyways.

181
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,440
 Radio lunch, call in that hair hang glider.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
 We're going to leave behind Motonoma County.

183
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:50,560
 We are headed out to a science laboratory in Science Town, USA.

184
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,120
 This story is literally the opposite of funny.

185
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,720
 I had to find a good episode to put it in.

186
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 In Science Town, USA.

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,400
 We walk into the science laboratory.

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,240
 We're looking through microscopes, picking up beakers, releasing rage monkeys.

189
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
 You know the stuff we normally do at science laboratories.

190
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,720
 An assistant finally comes out and goes, "He gets bit by a rage monkey.

191
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,960
 He gets taken away by security."

192
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
 But another assistant shows up and they're wagging their finger at us.

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,000
 They go, "Guys, quit messing around with stuff.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,680
 You're going to injure somebody."

195
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,400
 And I go, "You're right."

196
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
 And that would be bad.

197
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
 That would be bad.

198
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,560
 And you're like, "Jason, what is up with this bizarre segue?"

199
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,040
 I'm trying to lighten the mood because this one is super depressing.

200
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
 Because I think it has some really rough implications.

201
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,280
 I actually got this out on my new news folder.

202
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
 New news.

203
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,440
 New news is a segment we do every so often.

204
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,920
 I downloaded a bunch of websites back in the year 2004.

205
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
 And every so often I go through them.

206
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,680
 And there's been a lot of good stories we've gotten out of the new news folder.

207
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,880
 It was kind of a snapshot in time.

208
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,280
 Weird news from the year 2004.

209
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,040
 I'm going to start this story off by saying, first off, I'm not a medical professional.

210
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,240
 Secondly, if you're suffering from opioid...

211
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
 This is a tough one, guys.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
 This is a tough one.

213
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,480
 Secondly, if you suffer from opioid addiction, opioid abuse, this is not...

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,240
 I hope this doesn't trigger you.

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,480
 You're like, "Jason, you stopped looking through the microscope."

216
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,720
 You're like, "What are you even going to talk about?"

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,200
 Back in 2004, this was super interesting.

218
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,320
 They did this study.

219
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,800
 Northwestern University does this study on chronic back pain.

220
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,560
 And what they realize is that based on brain scans, chronic pain, specifically chronic

221
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:43,200
 back pain, can cause brain shrinkage as much as 11%.

222
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,360
 Chronic back pain can shrink your brain.

223
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,840
 Specifically it's shrinking the gray matter in it.

224
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:58,960
 And they said, based on these studies, 11% of your brain, that's 10 to 20 years of aging.

225
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,040
 But this is a compacted amount of time you're dealing with chronic pain can actually shrink

226
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,600
 your brain.

227
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,320
 Here's a quote from this study.

228
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,280
 "Every year of pain appear to decrease gray matter by 1.3 cubic centimeters."

229
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
 So not a lot.

230
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,400
 I mean, any part of your brain shrinking is a lot, but I don't want you to think like

231
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,560
 you're like, "Oh, my back's hurt for three days."

232
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,160
 And you can only say, "Mom, fear and give."

233
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
 No.

234
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
 But you do have that shrinkage.

235
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,880
 And every year it shrinks a little bit more and you can shrink up to 11%.

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
 Not you.

237
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,400
 It's kind of fun to actually get tinier.

238
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
 This isn't fun.

239
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
 Your brain shrinking.

240
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,560
 So of course they have to control for opioids.

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,880
 2004 was one of the boom years of opioid prescriptions.

242
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
 So they had to control for that.

243
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
 Is it possible that it's the opioids that are making your brain shrink?

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 No.

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,160
 They also did controls for issues like depression due to pain, PTSD from the event that caused

246
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,240
 the pain, et cetera.

247
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,960
 After controlling for these other factors, what they could find was chronic back pain,

248
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,080
 shrink your brain.

249
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,320
 And part of the issue is the gray matter that is being reduced is in the forebrain.

250
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,040
 And that's the part of your brain that helps regulate pain.

251
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
 So you have that.

252
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,520
 You don't even have the ability to get used to the pain.

253
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,280
 And when they're saying chronic pain, they're talking six months or longer.

254
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,720
 In 2007, because I did more research on this, I didn't just read an article in 2004, I'll

255
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
 call it today.

256
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
 It's more research on this.

257
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,640
 In 2007, the University of Alberta runs a similar study to this.

258
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,080
 Two thirds of chronic pain sufferers, so this is just outside of back pain, just two thirds

259
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,040
 of chronic pain sufferers, they develop significant attention and memory problems.

260
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,880
 So let's put our conspiracy caps on here.

261
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,360
 Opioids used to be overprescribed.

262
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,280
 I talked about it in my episode Solar Plexus Clown Gliders.

263
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
 I injured my back.

264
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,200
 They gave me 240 Vicodin a month.

265
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,880
 Totally overprescribed on that.

266
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
 But now they're underprescribed.

267
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,840
 So the medical way of really relieving pain is gone.

268
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,360
 Basic day-to-day pain, you can't do it through westernized medicine.

269
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,320
 Then when you look at stuff like marijuana, CBD, it's not legal in a lot of states.

270
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,320
 CBD, I know, you can get it shipped and stuff like that, but that's just CBD.

271
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,240
 Not a medical professional, but just the CBD stuff.

272
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,080
 You have to have a little bit of the marijuana in it, the wacky-tobackey in it, for it to

273
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,360
 actually be effective, in my opinion.

274
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,720
 Because I've tried just CBD stuff and it was junk.

275
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
 So a lot of the other stuff is still illegal.

276
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,240
 Marijuana is still illegal for pain relief, pain management in a lot of states, in a lot

277
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,300
 of countries.

278
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,560
 If you cap fully on, what if there is a reason for us to suffer in pain?

279
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,080
 I'm not talking about some sort of theological reason, so we will be reincarnated as a better

280
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,360
 person or so on and so forth.

281
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:15,440
 I'm talking about would a government entity want to have a dumber population?

282
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,600
 Would a government want to have a population that has less gray matter?

283
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,740
 If a government wanted a population that was dumber, wouldn't it make sense to take away

284
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,420
 the ability to not lose brain matter?

285
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,380
 Wouldn't it make sense to regulate and make illegal medications that could actually prevent

286
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,100
 you losing 11% of your brain?

287
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,020
 We talk about fluoride in the water.

288
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,700
 We talk about chemtrails.

289
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,900
 We talk about 5G and microchips and all this other stuff.

290
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
 It's nonsense.

291
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 It's nonsense.

292
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,360
 Well, fluoride is in the water, but I mean, it's not going to make you crazy.

293
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,320
 These are studies that have been done by Northwestern University and University of Alberta.

294
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,680
 Chronic pain can make your brain shrink.

295
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,240
 The government wants a compliant population.

296
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,680
 That's not a conspiracy theory.

297
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,360
 A government wants their population to be smart enough to earn money to tax and dumb

298
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,180
 enough to not argue.

299
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,500
 That's not an American thing.

300
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,140
 That is literally every government since the beginning of time.

301
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,820
 Smart enough to be a mechanism in the machine, but dumb enough to not know how to monkey

302
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,020
 wrench it and stop said machine.

303
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:47,140
 And if you could create generation after generation of people who are suffering from chronic pain

304
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:56,200
 and making the medicine that can alleviate that pain, illegal or regulated, you don't

305
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,400
 need chemtrails.

306
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,120
 You don't need 5G.

307
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,640
 You just need to put enough pressure on the human body day in and day out so they suffer

308
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,160
 pain.

309
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,400
 Whether that is through backbreaking labor or for the people who are working in a cushy

310
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:25,780
 office job, pumping them full of carbs and sugar and high fructose corn syrup in all

311
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:32,660
 of their foods, you're either out in the field breaking your back, or you're sitting in an

312
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:38,300
 office overeating and putting stress on all of your joints.

313
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,380
 You don't even know it.

314
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:47,880
 You create a nation of people who suffer from pain and make the way to alleviate that pain.

315
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,240
 Difficult if not impossible to get.

316
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,120
 You will have a population of people who are smart enough to pay their taxes and dumb enough

317
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,560
 to not complain about it.

318
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,000
 Radio lunch is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,640
 You went straight up conspiracy theory with that.

320
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,900
 conspiracy theory cap on, but still, I, you were like, Jason, you weren't wearing your

321
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,500
 conspiracy cap that whole time.

322
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
 You had yours on.

323
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,420
 I was like, okay, let's just move on to the next story.

324
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,060
 The next story is a little less, I'm just walking away.

325
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
 I'm just walking away.

326
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,060
 You're like, Jason, what are you going to say?

327
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
 Come on.

328
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
 Do you really believe that, Jason?

329
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
 I'm just walking away.

330
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,140
 I'm doing like an action hero pose as I'm walking away.

331
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,160
 These are the leaders of all the food companies and the government are about to take me out,

332
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
 but they can't take out Jason.

333
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
 They probably could.

334
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 They probably could.

335
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,920
 I'm sure Taco Bell or McDonald's could, not Arby's.

336
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,880
 Radio lunch, let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter.

337
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
 We're leaving behind a burned out Arby's.

338
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,000
 They tried to take me down.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,360
 They can never take me down.

340
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:04,360
 We are headed out to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

341
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,820
 I got a story from the 40 in map.

342
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,140
 It's one of my favorite tools to use for this show.

343
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,460
 I always like to give them a shout out.

344
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
 I'll put it in the show notes.

345
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,140
 I think you guys will enjoy it as well.

346
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,820
 Just a global map of a bunch of weird phenomenon.

347
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,580
 It's March 23rd, 1951.

348
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,540
 The US Air Force is on a mission.

349
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,580
 There's a C-124 Globemaster II making the journey from Roswell, New Mexico all the way out

350
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
 to England.

351
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
 It's 1 PM.

352
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,900
 It's in the middle of the afternoon.

353
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,480
 And the pilot radios out of Mayday.

354
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,160
 There's a Coast Guard ship in the area called the Casco.

355
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
 And it receives the call.

356
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
 Mayday.

357
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
 Mayday.

358
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
 What is that?

359
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
 A Muppet?

360
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
 What is that?

361
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
 Beaker from the Muppet show?

362
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
 Mayday.

363
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
 Mayday.

364
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
 Check, check.

365
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
 One, two.

366
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
 Is this working?

367
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 Can you guys hear me?

368
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
 We're all about to die.

369
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 Casco's like, "Yeah, yeah, we can hear you.

370
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
 What's going on?"

371
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,720
 And they said there's a fire on board the plane.

372
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,360
 We're trying really hard to put it out.

373
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
 But here's our coordinates.

374
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,260
 The Coast Guard ship, Casco.

375
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,860
 It's like, "Okay, we got it.

376
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,940
 We're going to relay this message.

377
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
 We'll take care of you.

378
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,820
 Just stay radio contact in case anything bad happens."

379
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,060
 The plane continues to fly.

380
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,900
 And eventually another radio call does come into the Casco.

381
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,340
 And they said, "Listen, we can't put the fire out.

382
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
 It's spreading.

383
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,180
 We're actually going to ditch the plane in the ocean."

384
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
 Right over.

385
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
 It's so interesting.

386
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,180
 The story.

387
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,740
 This is one of those stories we come across every once in a while.

388
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:35,160
 It's an interesting story, and then there's little offshoots to it that don't make sense.

389
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,640
 It's 1 p.m. when the original call comes through.

390
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,800
 There's several hundred miles from Ireland.

391
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
 The call comes through.

392
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,240
 The plane's on fire.

393
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,320
 When they decide to ditch the plane, the logic is this.

394
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,720
 It's going to get dark soon.

395
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,920
 So I'm wondering, it's March.

396
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,800
 March, right?

397
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,420
 How long were they flying for?

398
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,060
 But the reports show that the call comes in at 1 p.m. and then they say, "We're going

399
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,480
 to ditch the plane because it's going to get dark soon and we don't want to ditch the plane

400
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
 at night."

401
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,740
 Now I'm not a pilot.

402
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,220
 Maybe when you're up in the sky, the sun's farther away when it's setting.

403
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
 I don't think so.

404
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,980
 I don't think that's how light works.

405
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,220
 But who knows?

406
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,180
 So they decide to ditch the plane before night falls.

407
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
 And they do.

408
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,580
 [imitates plane landing sound]

409
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,500
 Perfect water landing of a plane that was not designed to land in the water.

410
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,620
 And they radio in the coordinates.

411
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,020
 They're able to call the cascades and say, "Well, we ditched the plane.

412
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,100
 We are all able to make it off.

413
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
 Totally fine.

414
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,800
 This is where we're at."

415
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,980
 There was an Air Force base.

416
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,080
 They got the call that this plane was going down.

417
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,260
 They launched a B-50 Superfortress plane to go out to the area and hopefully they're

418
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,060
 originally going to try to escort this globe master to safety.

419
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,740
 But by the time the B-50 gets to the area, the plane's already been ditched in the water.

420
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,100
 But the B-50 flies over the area and they look.

421
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,940
 And this is what they see.

422
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,300
 Everyone is alive.

423
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,180
 Even according to the radio call in, everyone got off the plane.

424
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,700
 Nobody died during the crash.

425
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,060
 53 people on board of this plane.

426
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
 Everyone's alive.

427
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,700
 The B-50 flies overhead and begins circling over.

428
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,100
 They see all of these life rafts.

429
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,780
 And the life rafts had survival equipment, life preserver, signal flares.

430
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,140
 The guys are out there with the signal flares.

431
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,420
 It is a perfect landing at sea.

432
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,580
 It is a perfect emergency landing.

433
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,220
 Not a single casualty.

434
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,840
 There's these giant rafts very, very well supplied.

435
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,660
 The plane is flying overhead for a while.

436
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,940
 You couldn't ask for anything more in a situation like this.

437
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,420
 You've crashed, you have all the supplies you need and people know where you're at.

438
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,060
 And there's a plane circling you.

439
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,940
 You're totally fine.

440
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 The B-50 eventually realizes they're going to run out of fuel.

441
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,460
 So they leave the area.

442
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
 Why wouldn't you?

443
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,620
 Why wouldn't you, right?

444
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,900
 They are 100% safe.

445
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,300
 The call comes in at 1pm.

446
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,040
 The plane is on fire.

447
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,900
 They decide to ditch the plane before it gets dark.

448
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,220
 That's a considerable amount of time, but they ditch the plane.

449
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,480
 They're in the rafts.

450
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,740
 They have the flares.

451
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,100
 The B-50 is flying overhead.

452
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,220
 Remember in the Coast Guard ship Costco had gotten this original call.

453
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,300
 But they don't get to the location.

454
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,580
 The B-50 has to leave.

455
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,140
 The Coast Guard ship does not get to the location until early the next day.

456
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,520
 There's no specific time, but we can say 1am in the morning.

457
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,720
 It could even be later than that, but you have a long period of time.

458
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,880
 Now I know they didn't have the fastest vehicles back then, but they weren't this slow.

459
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,560
 Everyone knew at 1pm this plane was having trouble.

460
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,520
 And when it ditched and it landed, everyone knew where this was at.

461
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:13,140
 But it takes hours for this Coast Guard ship to get there, and when it does, there's nothing

462
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,740
 left.

463
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,220
 The Coast Guard ship gets there.

464
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,420
 They don't see any flares.

465
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,460
 They don't see any rafts.

466
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,420
 They don't see any people.

467
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,340
 They don't even see the plane.

468
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,820
 What had just been there a few hours earlier?

469
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,320
 Everything is gone.

470
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 Every single thing is gone.

471
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:49,880
 There is nothing in the water, except for a few pieces of plywood and a briefcase.

472
00:23:49,880 --> 00:24:00,400
 53 people, all of their supplies and the plane they crashed with disappeared.

473
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,200
 This is 100% a true story.

474
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,620
 This is an honest to God military mystery.

475
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,880
 They have never figured this out.

476
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,320
 The Costco, they realize it's kind of spooky.

477
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,860
 They think it's more spooky, right?

478
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,060
 They call it a full sweep of the area.

479
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,980
 Plane show up, a couple warships show up, submarines show up.

480
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,580
 Summarines don't find any pee.

481
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
 Well, it's not like they have portholes, right?

482
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,560
 It's not like you guys looking out the side and see someone floating.

483
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,040
 But they couldn't pick up the plane on sonar.

484
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,920
 You couldn't pick up a shoe floating in the water or a bloody arm or radio or used flair.

485
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
 Nothing.

486
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,600
 Everything was gone.

487
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,640
 It boggles my mind.

488
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
 How is that possible?

489
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,520
 When I read this on the 40 in MAP, he must have gotten a detail wrong.

490
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
 That's not true.

491
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,020
 But it is.

492
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,620
 A true mystery that has never been solved.

493
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,740
 Nobody to this day knows what could have caused it.

494
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,580
 There was no storms in the area.

495
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,020
 There was no bad weather in the area.

496
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,940
 The one thing that has been suggested, but even the military is like, it might be, like

497
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,020
 they just don't know.

498
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,300
 Soviets.

499
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:31,000
 The Soviets in that period of time may have shown up in a sub or a boat and captured all

500
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,360
 53 people before anyone else could get there.

501
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,080
 They waited until the plane, they would have to be a perfect timing for them to show up.

502
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
 They would have known the plane would have gone down because they would have heard the

503
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,280
 Mayday call.

504
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:51,400
 But they would have had to show up and not only can nap 53 people, but not leave a single

505
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,380
 shred of evidence.

506
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
 They took all the rafts.

507
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,900
 Why would you take the rafts?

508
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,220
 The Soviets like, not only will we can nap all of these Yankees, but we'll also start

509
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,220
 a mystery that will be covered on a podcast.

510
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,460
 Why would they go through that?

511
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,180
 That makes it more mysterious.

512
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,940
 You just want to make it look like a storm came.

513
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,060
 The plane's gone.

514
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,060
 Everything's gone.

515
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,220
 Except for a couple pieces of plywood and a briefcase.

516
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,600
 But we here at Dead Rabbit Radio know what happened.

517
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,800
 Let's put our conspiracy caps on.

518
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,880
 The plane, if you remember, was leaving Roswell, New Mexico.

519
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,000
 And when a fire broke out on board, definitely was an emergency.

520
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,120
 And to this day they don't know what caused the fire.

521
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,920
 They wouldn't be able to figure it out because the plane doesn't exist anymore.

522
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,400
 They could never investigate the fire.

523
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,280
 But even the radio calls apparently don't know how the fire started.

524
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,080
 It just started.

525
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,740
 Here's my conspiracy theory.

526
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,500
 This plane was transporting something from Roswell, New Mexico.

527
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:02,540
 Roswell, New Mexico is most famously known as the crash site of the Roswell spacecraft.

528
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,420
 We've done episodes on that and I personally have disputed whether or not an actual UFO

529
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
 crashed in Roswell.

530
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
 But let's forget that.

531
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,740
 Let's forget that I said that for this episode.

532
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,420
 I totally believe in Roswell.

533
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,740
 I totally believe it.

534
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,120
 So, forget my previous episodes.

535
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
 This is the ending.

536
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,200
 This is the fun part.

537
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
 It's all fun.

538
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,040
 But you know what I mean.

539
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,560
 What if this Glowmaster 2 was transporting something from Roswell, New Mexico to England?

540
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,400
 The crew had no idea what was on this plane.

541
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,080
 They were just transporting something.

542
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,320
 And the fire may have been caused by this item.

543
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,660
 Or the fire may have allowed this item or thing to be released to get out.

544
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,220
 Did it cause the fire?

545
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,260
 Did the fire awaken it from some sort of cryogenic sleep?

546
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:02,580
 Or simply give it enough of a distraction to get out of its confinement?

547
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:06,300
 And then when the plane crashes, the radio calls are still coming in.

548
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,620
 Hey, everything's okay.

549
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
 Everyone's alive.

550
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,120
 It's perfect.

551
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,620
 But the top brass knows what they were transporting.

552
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,220
 Nobody else knows what was on that plane.

553
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,820
 Not the crew of the plane, not the Coast Guard ship Costco, not the B-50 Super Fortress.

554
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
 None of the rescue team knew.

555
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,700
 But the top brass knew what was on that plane.

556
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,380
 And they didn't know if it caused the fire either.

557
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,040
 Or if the fire allowed it to escape.

558
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,660
 They only knew one thing.

559
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,340
 Whatever was in that plane was too dangerous.

560
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,600
 And knowledge of that thing was also too dangerous.

561
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,560
 So they delayed the rescue effort.

562
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,080
 Using whatever pencil-pushing explanations they could, they'll be fine.

563
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
 They're fully supplied.

564
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,040
 We don't have to go out there right away.

565
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,880
 The B-50 got visual.

566
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,960
 Everyone's fine.

567
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
 Just wait a couple hours.

568
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
 There's no emergency.

569
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
 Everything will be fine.

570
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,240
 Because the top brass knew whatever was in that plane most likely also survived the crash

571
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,140
 of the plane.

572
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:14,540
 It's possible now that the plane may have been designed to go down.

573
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,660
 And wasn't supposed to survive.

574
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,280
 A crash at sea.

575
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,680
 But due to expert piloting, it did.

576
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,760
 Maybe the whole thing was some sort of bizarre false flag.

577
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,800
 But now we're going down even deeper rabbit holes.

578
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 Something being transported from Roswell, New Mexico to England.

579
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,000
 If it didn't make it to England, you could always say, "Well, we tried.

580
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,120
 We tried," Prime Minister.

581
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,680
 "We tried sending you over some samples.

582
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
 The plane went down."

583
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
 "What are you going to do?"

584
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
 "Send us more samples."

585
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,520
 "Well, we don't have any more samples."

586
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
 That's all we had.

587
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,840
 We can't risk it again.

588
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,240
 So there's that scenario as well.

589
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,560
 But even if there was some sort of alien life or alien technology on the plane, why would

590
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,760
 it disappear like that?

591
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,920
 What happens to everybody?

592
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,520
 How come they weren't able to find anything?

593
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,800
 Even if there was some sort of grey alien with the vengeance running around strangling

594
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,320
 everyone, they would have found 53 strangled bodies.

595
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,080
 If it wasn't alien being transported alive or dead, it'd have been one of the crash

596
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,920
 victims of Roswell.

597
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,000
 And now it's in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, in the middle of the night, completely

598
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 unguarded.

599
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,960
 Who's to say that an alien craft did not show up to pick up one of their species?

600
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:41,760
 And while they were there, abducted 53 humans and their craft to steady, like we would steady

601
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,560
 their craft and their species at Roswell, New Mexico.

602
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 Definitely possible.

603
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,520
 But what if this cargo wasn't an alien?

604
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,200
 What if it was alien tech?

605
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,160
 And either it caused the fire on accident or the fire was completely unrelated to the

606
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
 cargo.

607
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,400
 But for whatever reason, the fire broke out.

608
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,880
 The plane is ditched in the ocean and everyone is fine.

609
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,440
 But the fire they couldn't put out.

610
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,440
 And somehow in some way that fire interacted with that alien technology.

611
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,320
 And in the dead of night in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, this alien technology vaporized

612
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,800
 everything organic and inorganic.

613
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,840
 If you had been there to see it, it would have boggled your mind.

614
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,800
 But if you missed it by a millisecond, you would just see a quiet ocean.

615
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:39,920
 Waves over waves in the darkness.

616
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:50,400
 When a mystery has gone unsolved for 70 years, even the absurd theories start to make sense.
