1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 A big foot sighting that makes us re-examine what the world must look like to our 10 foot furry friend.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we take a look at the bizarre crossover of the world of the paranormal and alien life.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Is it possible to give an alien an exorcism today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm your host Jason Carvin or I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I had a great birthday and I thank you for everyone who sent me birthday wishes.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Also special thanks to Sabine.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 She got me a Blizzard ice cream cake from Dairy Queen.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This episode sponsored by Dairy Queen.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 This episode is actually fueled by Dairy Queen.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I devoured this ice cream cake, cookie dough, Blizzard ice cream cake.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Every cell of my body is now infused with the power of raw sugar and whatever other ingredients are in there.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Cookie dough obviously.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Another thing that's currently infusing my cells, odd transition, is our newest Patreon, T-Mad.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We're gonna give a clap out to T-Mad.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 He's a flown around.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 He's getting devoured by my white blood cells.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 He's like, "No, no, no. We'll pull him out of my body."

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Again, super weird transition.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Now he's standing there.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that too.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Just help get the word out about the show.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Now I know yesterday I promised to actually lift it as a cliffhanger to let you know how to find out whether or not you're a reptilian.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And I was going over it and I'm like, "This isn't really that entertaining. It wasn't that great."

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I kept going over my notes and basically boiled down to this.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 There's actually a huge list of like 25 physical symptoms you may be possessed by a reptilian.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 They were things like you're suffering from Alzheimer's, which if you're suffering from Alzheimer's, you're probably not reading the list.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 First off, secondly, there's a lot of people who suffer from Alzheimer's.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 The website basically stated that all forms of memory loss, including Alzheimer's, proves that you're a reptilian.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Also, other signs you're being currently possessed by a reptilian is numbness of your extremities or face, pain in your chest that mimics a heart attack.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You're having a heart attack.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 If you're having a heart attack, you're like, "Oh no, it's those reptilians in me again."

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Just go to the doctor at the very end of this list.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 A lot of them were like eye pressure, violent sneezing.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 That's a sign the reptile's trying to get out of your body.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Hearing voices, if you feel like someone's always stalking you.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You have chronic depression. That's a sign you're a reptilian.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'm looking through this list and I'm like, these are actually like medical emergencies.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 These aren't proofs that you're being possessed.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 These are things you have to go to the doctor for.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And there was basically a list of 25 basically very grievous injuries.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 If you get in a car accident and you're bleeding out, you might be possessed by a reptilian.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 It went on and on like that and then it capped it off with this thing.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 These were the signs that the reptilian has totally taken control of your body.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 You're greedy.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So that's a lot of people. That's almost part of the human condition.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 You're a misogynist.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 If you actively hate women, if you go out of your way to hate women, you might be possessed by a reptilian.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 If you're a pedophile, and that's a weird one in the group.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 The pedophile is always the weird one in the group by definition, but I guess I am doing this segment now, but it's a much shorter version.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 We all know people who are greedy, right? Again, this part of the human condition.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I've known a few misogynists in my life, like people who just actively hated women and they didn't hide it.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 They despised women.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Might have been reptilians, I don't know.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 But then the pedophile, right? That's a weird one.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I could see that's such a obscene behavior that you could see that almost not being human to engage in that.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 But if someone's just greedy, I mean, I get it.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Smalg was greedy. He sat on a bunch of gold.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Greedy misogynist, if you're a pedophile, you might be a reptilian.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 The last big thing is it doesn't fit into any of those three.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 If you hate seawater, you might be a reptilian.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So I just saved you. I actually tried recording that segment two or three times and it wasn't any good.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And it was... I imagine what I just told you stretched out over the course of 20 minutes instead of being compressed into five minutes.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And it just didn't work.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But in case you really wanted to know why you hate seawater so much, why you refuse to go to SeaWorld,

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 why you hate sea salt, why you hate Salt Lake City, actually, not to think about it.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Didn't have to do a story about reptilians living underneath Salt Lake City.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So I don't know. I don't know.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But if you happen to be a greedy misogynist pedophile who loves the land, then you might be a reptilian.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 You also might be having a heart attack and suffering from Alzheimer's at the same time.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 You might be a reptilian. All sorts of crazy stuff.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 But that's the end of that segment.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Team Mad, we had to compress that one down.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Team Mad, I'm going to toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit rowboat.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 We are going to take a quick journey down the Columbia River in Oregon.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So...

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 We're rowing the boat.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Team Mad standing on the bow, smoking his corn cob pipe.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 It's summer 1992.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And we're going to sail by Rooster Rock.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 It's this massive rock that has its own little state park.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 It's Rooster Rock State Park in Oregon.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Now, it's also known as Cock Rock.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I think originally it was called Cock Rock.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And then a bunch of people go, "Uh, we probably shouldn't have called it that."

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 "We probably don't want to have a sign that says Cock Rock State Park."

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 But anyway, so they changed it to Rooster Rock.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Apparently it's supposed to look like a rooster.

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 It actually looks like an egg.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So I guess it can be whatever you want, whatever you imagine is in the egg.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But you have Cock Rock there.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Now it's known for two things.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's known for one thing in this area.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 That's where dudes go to bang each other.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 It's like a cruising spot.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 We're going back to the year 1992.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 We're at Rooster Rock.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 It's a nice, hot summer morning.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's early morning.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It's 2 a.m.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 There's a couple out camping.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 There's a man and his wife out camping.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And they're having fun.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 The husband keeps looking in the distance, looking for a sexy man-shaped silhouette.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Honey's like, "Come cuddle with me."

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 He's like, "Yeah, in a second, in a second, baby."

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But anyways, he's looking out in the distance and they hear a "Aaahhhhhh!"

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 They look at each other.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 They're like, "What?

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 What was that terrifying noise?

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 What was going on?"

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So the man gets up to investigate what this horrible noise was.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 He begins walking around in the darkness.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He doesn't see anything.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It's 1992.

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Flashlights hadn't been invented yet.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Back then we just had to put our arms out as far as we could

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 and just feel into the darkness until we bumped into something.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And this man is doing that.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 No, he probably had a flashlight.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But anyways, the point is that he's walking.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 He doesn't see anything.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And then he turns and he sees 10 feet in front of him.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Bigfoot.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 [Growling]

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The man freezes and looks and he describes this 10-foot-tall furry man with eyes

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 the size of silver dollars.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And they were glowing red.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 When's the last time you saw a silver dollar?

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I don't think I even know how big those are.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Just imagine like big ol' tweker eyeballs.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 [Growling]

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Poking out of his head, Don Knot's eyes.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I guess that's an even more obscure reference than a silver dollar.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 He sees Bigfoot 10 feet in front of him.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 But Bigfoot doesn't acknowledge this man.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Bigfoot is staring off across the river at Washington.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And the man is so terrified by what he's seeing.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 He runs away, which is what you would do, right?

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 He's unarmed.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 He didn't have a flashlight.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He's thinking he needs to invent one real quick.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 He runs.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He gets in his boat and launches right off of the water and boats away.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Now remember, he wasn't alone.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 He left his wife there.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And his wife was wondering, "Where the hell is he?"

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 He just wandered off into the darkness.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And then he hears the sound of paddles hitting the water.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 What is going on?

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 She actually, this is long before cell phones.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 That's not a joke.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 This is long before cell phones.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 She had to eventually call a friend, which took a while,

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 because you have to actually go to a phone.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 She's walking down the highway.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 She gets a phone.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 She calls up a friend.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 She gets picked up.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 A friend picks her up and then she finds out that her husband was arrested.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 He's being held by the cops.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 She goes to the police station.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 She goes, "Honey, what happened?"

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Like, it was in the middle of the night, and we heard that horrible sound,

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 and then I heard a boat launch, and then I had to walk all the way down the freeway

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 to make a phone call.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And he goes, "Honey, you won't believe what happened."

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And he told the story that I just told you.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Now this story was from something called Ray Crowe's track record.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I've been coming across this, it seems like a zine, a collection of books or something like that.

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I've been coming across this a lot lately.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Think about it, docs.com, it's actually where we got all of these stories today.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 I really, really like this resource, but they got it from Ray Crowe's track record number 43.

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And I actually tried looking for this.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It's defunct.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It's defunct.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I couldn't find it.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It's still being published.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 My memory serves me right.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 You can buy it, like, you used to be able to buy a collection of it on Amazon,

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 but I don't think that's even in print anymore.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But he tells the story.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 That's all the information we have.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Now, that's either one of two things.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's either the story of Bigfoot actually...

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It's interesting because if Bigfoot is a biological entity,

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 because we always have that debate here on this show,

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 you can't cross a river like that.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 You can't cross the Columbia.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 You can't swim it.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 People have swam in it in the past.

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But if Bigfoot is the measurements that he is,

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and if he's more simian than man, like Gorillaz can't swim,

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 I don't know about monkeys, but I saw this documentary once called Planet of the Apes,

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 directed by Tim Burton.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 There was a key point in it that I found out in that movie, Gorillaz Can't Swim,

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 and that is true, but could he swim?

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 A raging river is, to a human, it's a huge obstacle,

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 but we can invent boats, or we can not invent some.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 If we just have one, we can use boats.

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Even in native times in the area, you could get across the Columbia.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Nowadays, we build bridges across rivers.

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 But to something like Bigfoot, he can't be like,

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 "One tool please!" and like, paying with silver dollars.

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He's pulling them out of his eyes like a magic trick.

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Here you go.

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He can't cross the bridge.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 For him to stare off across this river, that's what, like,

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I don't know, 700 yards across, if not more.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It's an insurmountable gap.

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It'd be the same thing as if you came across the middle of the Grand Canyon,

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and you'd be like, "Well, I can walk down it,

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 and then climb back up the other side, or I can walk around it."

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And a river is even worse.

219
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 It goes on for miles and miles and miles.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 The one edge is the ocean.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 He's like, "Oh, me Bigfoot, in bigger predicament now."

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Because he can't like sail around any saltwater,

223
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 because he's a reptilian.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 But yeah, so he's kind of stuck.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 The other, so that's kind of an interesting way to look at how a cryptid,

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 like Bigfoot, would view geography.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 He couldn't use all of the mechanisms that we use.

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 He would just stare across the river and go,

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 "Ugh, me want there. Me want to go home."

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And then just kind of sit there.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But knowing the reputation of this area,

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I have another reading of this story.

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 This guy went to go bang some dude in the bushes,

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 and the dude wasn't a 10 foot tall hairy guy.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 He was just a 6 foot tall hairy guy,

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 and something went wrong,

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 and he jumped in the boat and sailed away.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Oh, actually now that I think about this,

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 what if him and the dude in the bushes got on the boat and sailed away?

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Because it doesn't say why they got arrested.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So what if they got on the boat and sailed away,

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 and the cops picked him up?

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It's an interesting story.

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 To be fair, to be fair,

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 to not say that this guy just happened to be cheating on his wife and another dude

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 in the middle of Rooster Rock Park.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 They did say that the next day they found a set of footprints,

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 a set of tracks, 17 inch long.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 So, you know, there's that.

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 There's evidence that it was Bigfoot.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 But who knows, maybe the dude was hooking up with Bigfoot, actually.

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I know that's a real popular erotica genre.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Maybe that's the reason why he was at Rooster Rock to begin with.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Not the guy but Bigfoot, so.

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 All sorts of mysteries that I'm not willing to explore any further.

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 T-MAD is already on the boat.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 He's like, "Come on, come on."

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So T-MAD, call in that carpenter copter.

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 We are leaving behind Rooster Rock State Park.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And we are headed out to Seduna, South Australia.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 [hums]

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 It's July 28, 1997.

263
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 There's a man named Allen.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Now he's an elderly man who had a reputation in the area of being a water diviner.

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Those are the people who can find water, obviously.

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But it's important in a desert area.

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 If you're on the coast, you're like, "There it is!"

268
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And everyone's clapping.

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 They're like, "Oh, he's so good. I thought the water was not here."

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 In a desert area, you would use these people.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 I'm not saying that it actually works, but in a desert area where you need wells and things like that,

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 instead of just digging wells everywhere, digging a bunch of holes,

273
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 you have a water diviner come out and he holds like little crystals or he has the stick.

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 You guys have all seen the Y-shaped stick and you hold it and you're like,

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 "Uh, here's water."

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And then you start digging there.

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 That was his skill set.

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 But he also had an interest in good old-fashioned Ouija boards.

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And one day he's sitting there, because you've got to be varied in your interest.

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 He's sitting there and he's moving the Ouija board.

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Can you use the Ouija board by yourself, actually?

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I don't think you're supposed to.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 While he's doing this, it starts to give him an instruction.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Really, it gives him directions.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It tells him to go to a bush outside town.

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It's all me, bush. It's a bigfoot.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Bigfoot's ghost trying to get him into the bushes for a little bit of lovin'.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And while he's doing this, he's asking, you know, like,

289
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 "Why do you want me to go to the bush?"

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And the Ouija board is actually pretty accurate.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It says that he's going to meet someone there.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Really, it says he's going to meet an alien.

293
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He's like, "Well, I guess I got to do that, right?"

294
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 "I guess I got to risk life and limb," the board told me to.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 So he goes out to the bush to meet this alien.

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 The Ouija board also said explicitly,

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 "You're going to meet this alien and he's going to abduct you."

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Why did this guy go on this adventure, right?

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 At all. But anyway, the Ouija board says,

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 "You go to this bush, there'll be an alien waiting there for you."

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 "He's going to abduct you."

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 So he's like, "I'm elderly. I got nothing to lose at this point."

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Other than, you know, being abducted by aliens

304
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 and being experimented on for hundreds of years while they keep me alive

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 and some sort of torturous test tube.

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He shows up. He goes to this location.

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 A hot Australian wind is whipping through this bush and he's walking closer to it.

308
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And then he sees an alien standing there.

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Clear as day, an alien.

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 He doesn't describe the alien, so it could have been a gray alien.

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It could have been-- really could have been anything, right?

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 It could have just been a tall Nordic blonde guy standing there.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 But he runs into this alien and the alien's looking at him.

314
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Sizing him up.

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And the alien says, "No."

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 "No."

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 He rejects Alan.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Alan asks why.

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And the alien tells him that he was, quote, "too good of a man,"

320
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 unquote, and decided not to abduct him.

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 The alien and the alien just stand there in the middle of nowhere,

322
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 looking at each other for a moment.

323
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Alan gets back in his car and leaves.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Alan said-- the story wraps up like this.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 This was a fairly short one, but Alan says,

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 "From that brief interaction, he got the feeling this alien's intentions were not good."

327
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 He got away from the scene.

328
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I don't think he probably ever used the Ouija word again.

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 He's like, "Ah, best two out of three."

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 That's an interesting story because we don't really see a lot of crossover

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 between the paranormal and aliens.

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 But if Ouija boards have the ability to communicate with spirits,

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and we already have alien technology that's so much based on telepathy

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 and just the rules of the universe not applying to them,

335
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 why couldn't they use a Ouija board to communicate with people?

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Interesting story.

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And again, if he had disappeared, if he wasn't too good of a man,

338
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 had he disappeared, he would have just been a missing person in Australia.

339
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 The story would have ended with-- the story never would have been told, right?

340
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Someone would have went into this old man's apartment,

341
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 it's flooded with water, they're like, "Ah, he found it, he found it all."

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Everyone's drowning.

343
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But then when the rescue team goes to pick up those people,

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 they would go, "Oh, you know, we came into his house, there was like a bunch of weird stuff."

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 The Ouija board may not even be out of place.

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 You saw Ouija board sitting on a table.

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You would just have a man who went missing, an elderly man.

348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 They go, "Maybe he went out for a walk.

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Maybe they'd find his car at some point."

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 It would be mysterious.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 But it wouldn't be recorded.

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 It'd be a little note in the local police log.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 "Old man goes missing."

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 When I'm saying the Australian police don't care about elderly missing people,

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 they're like, "Every time some grandpa disappears, they're like,

356
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 'That's Australia for you, that's actually our slogan, old people go missing.'

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Welcome to Australia."

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 They would obviously investigate it, but it wouldn't become part of UFO lore.

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It wouldn't be something that was ever really talked about on that level.

360
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I've been doing Patreon live streams recently.

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Live streams, because I want to reward the Patreons for all their awesome support.

362
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 I was doing Patreon live stream, and on it, Burntos Ghost,

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 which is someone who's been supporting the show for a long time,

364
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 asks the question, "Do you think aliens have souls?"

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That's an interesting question.

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And I think the next story may provide a bit of an answer.

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Team Ad, let's hop back in that carpenter copter.

368
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 We are headed out to Italy.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 [imitates car engine]

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 We're headed out to Monsumino.

371
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 That's in Potenza, Italy.

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's September 14th, 1992.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 11 p.m.

374
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 That helicopter's coming low over a bunch of villas and Adobe brick buildings and stuff like that.

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 However, their buildings look.

376
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I'm sure they look normal, but I don't know.

377
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 We're going to land in the middle of the city.

378
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And we're walking around. Everything's quiet.

379
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's pretty late at night.

380
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And we see a little house in town.

381
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 The lights are on, and we walk, and we're looking in the window.

382
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And we see two people sitting there.

383
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 One of them is a medium. One of them excels in being able to talk to the dead.

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 The other one was a clairvoyant and exorcist, dual class, this person.

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 They're sitting there. It's up late at night.

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 They're drinking tea or coffee or saltwater. I don't know.

387
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But they're just having a good time.

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And then all of a sudden...

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 [imitates car engine]

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 They see a luminous sphere float through an open window.

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 [imitates car engine]

392
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And they're like, "Did you do that?"

393
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And the other person's like, "No, I thought you did that.

394
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I'm just an exorcist and a clairvoyant. You're the medium."

395
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Like, "No, I'm actually a fraud, but don't tell anyone."

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That's super spooky.

397
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And this orb opens up.

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 [imitates car engine]

399
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And outsteps a one meter, what is that?

400
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Like three feet tall dude with white skin.

401
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Scaly white skin.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Little reptilian human walks out of this orb.

403
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So now at this point, they put down their tea,

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 they put down their drink of choice.

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 They're hiding their saltwater.

406
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 This creature's standing there and he's looking at these two.

407
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And he points to the exorcist and goes,

408
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 "I need your help."

409
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And I'm like, "What happened?" And he goes,

410
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 "You won't believe, you won't believe the day I had."

411
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And he sits down.

412
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 "Ugh, so good to get off my feet. You know how hard it is to pilot one of those orbs."

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 What he actually says is that he was recently in Puglia,

414
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 which is another place in Italy.

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And he's like, "Listen guys, this is what happened.

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 So I was just minding my own business and I might have abducted somebody.

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 I might have abducted a human. I don't know. Maybe he wanted to come."

418
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 He was kind of freaking out the whole time,

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 but you know the way things happen sometimes.

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 You accidentally abduct people aboard an alien starship.

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You know what I'm talking about. He's all nudging them.

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 They're like, "We don't. We have no idea what you're talking about."

423
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 We're surprised you even speak Italian.

424
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 He's like, "Yeah, it's a gift."

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I air quote, "Abducted this guy and I haven't aboard my spaceship."

426
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And he casts a spell on me.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Not a love spell, but like an actual evil spell.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 A spell that would actually make me worried

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 because I could feel it working on me.

430
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Now, I'm flying around in my ship

431
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and I realize that I'm gonna have a real bad afternoon

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 if I don't get rid of this spell.

433
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So that's why I have come to you pointing out the Exorcist

434
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 because I know that you can give me an Exorcism.

435
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So the medium and the clairvoyant kind of look at each other

436
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 and they realize, first off, this is super bizarre

437
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 because this guy is identifying himself as an alien.

438
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He's obviously an alien, right?

439
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 If we take the story to face value, this guy's not making it up.

440
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 He floated into their house and jumped out of an orb.

441
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It's a really hard trick to pull off.

442
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 David Blaine would have a hard time doing that.

443
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 David Blaine would also have a hard time making himself appear

444
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 to be three feet tall and a reptilian,

445
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 but they realize this is an opportunity of a lifetime.

446
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And so the Exorcist goes, "Yes, we'll give you an Exorcism."

447
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And then the alien goes, "Step on board."

448
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 He's motion--you can't see what I'm doing,

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 but he was motioning towards the orb.

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So the Exorcist and the clairvoyant kind of looked at each other

451
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 and they're like, "Yeah."

452
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And the orb and a storm, they all walk into this orb.

453
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It's obviously big enough for this little dude

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 and these two normal-sized humans sitting in there.

455
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And for the next five minutes,

456
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 the Exorcist performed the traditional Exorcism.

457
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Doing this cross, sign of the cross,

458
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 and then like saying a bunch of stuff in Latin

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 and the alien's just kind of sitting there.

460
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I don't know if the alien's head was spinning around.

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 He's like, "Oh, no, that's normal. We always vomit."

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I don't know if he was going through all that stuff,

463
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 but the Exorcist says,

464
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 "I have like a five-minute Exorcism that I can do.

465
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 That's what I did for the alien."

466
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 The alien was very thankful.

467
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 The orb opens back up, doesn't abduct us, luckily.

468
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 We jump out of the orb.

469
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The orb flies away and we've realized

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 that five hours have passed.

471
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Never saw that little guy again.

472
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Now, that's a bizarre story on multiple levels.

473
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 One, when we talk about whether or not aliens have souls,

474
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 I couldn't answer that on the live stream.

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 That's a pretty complicated question.

476
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Do all living things have souls?

477
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Do no living things have souls?

478
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 There's a lot of stuff you can work in on that.

479
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But the idea of an alien being cursed by a spell,

480
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 we're no closer to that answer whether or not aliens have souls.

481
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I would assume they would,

482
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 but if you can cast a spell on an alien,

483
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 an evil spell like that,

484
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I think it would lean more towards the fact that they do have souls.

485
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 The magic would attack them at a metaphysical level,

486
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 as opposed to a physical level.

487
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And any sort of physical representation of a spell or a curse working

488
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 would really be working at a metaphysical level within your body.

489
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 So you have that idea.

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 You have the idea, first off, that aliens are vulnerable to magic.

491
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 That's something I've never ever thought of,

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 that you can place a curse on an alien and it actually affects them.

493
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 The other idea is that whenever we have missing time stories,

494
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 generally there's always a sinister motive to it.

495
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 There's always, we went driving, we don't remember what happened,

496
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 next thing we knew we were both standing outside of the car,

497
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 four hours have passed.

498
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 There's always this sinister implication.

499
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Here were people coming to help the alien out of their own free will,

500
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 and they suffered time loss.

501
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 They willingly stepped onto the ship, they helped this alien,

502
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 and then when they get back off the ship, five hours have passed.

503
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And they don't recall that sort of time distortion.

504
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So it's one of two things.

505
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 These time loss incidents are not malevolent, right?

506
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It's simply the act of interacting with these sort of elements

507
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 to distort space-time.

508
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It's not because they're trying to hide anything.

509
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It's not because they're trying to prolong their experimentation.

510
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 It's just simply a fact of it.

511
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Just like you can't jump into the water without getting wet.

512
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 It's impossible.

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 This would be that same thing.

514
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Your clothes would get wet or your wetsuit would get wet.

515
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 You can't jump in water without getting wet.

516
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 It's not the water doing it to be mean.

517
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It's simply a fact.

518
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 So it could be something like that.

519
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 It could be something like that.

520
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Or it could be that even though they went out of their way to help this guy,

521
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 at the end of the day, human generosity is alien to aliens.

522
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So when they stepped on that ship, they did cure him.

523
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 It was a quick five-minute fix.

524
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 But remember, he had abducted somebody earlier in the story.

525
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 He had taken somebody and was metaphysically attacked by this young man.

526
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 You notice that he never says what happened to that guy.

527
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And what would you do if you were an alien being,

528
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 you had someone in your grasp and they cast a spell on you?

529
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Would you let him go or would you punish him?

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And now these two mystics get on board this UFO

531
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 with this creature who had abducted someone just hours ago.

532
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Could he pass up the opportunity to continue his research on two more humans?

533
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And really not just any two humans.

534
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Two humans who knew how to pierce the veil.

535
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Two humans with abilities far beyond what normal people can do.

536
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 So while they use that beautiful human gift of compassion,

537
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 mixed with curiosity to help out this creature,

538
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 he couldn't let his curiosity and scientific inquisitiveness to pass this opportunity up.

539
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 So while they may remember spending five minutes on this orb,

540
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 helping out a little reptilian,

541
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 for the remaining four hours and 55 minutes,

542
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 their memory has been erased

543
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 of the experiments, of the torture,

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 of the mind-altering tactics that this reptilian would use.

545
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 He learned all that he could learn and he let them back into our world.

546
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But now this alien, one, knows that magic is real and can be used against his kind.

547
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And two, has everything he needs to know to defend against it.

548
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 A blueprint of two human psyches that are able to communicate with the dead,

549
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 to see the future, and to rid a host of demons.

550
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Those are skills that are far more powerful than a ray gun or a teleportation beam.

551
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 When you combine science so advanced, it seems fictional.

552
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 With the abilities that have been talked about for tens of thousands of years on Earth,

553
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 you can create an unstoppable alien adversary.
