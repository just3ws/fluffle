1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
 A new computer program has shady origins.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,980
 A long time ago we covered the conspiracy theory that Bugs Bunny is actually a Native American

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,420
 deity.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,220
 We have a bizarre update to that story.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:24,620
 And then we take a look at the bizarre scientific phenomenon when Deaf Schizophrenic hear voices.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,220
 What do they hear?

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,820
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,580
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,340
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,580
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,120
 I hope you guys had an awesome Halloween.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
 I know that I did or did...

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,860
 I don't know, it's still Halloween.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,940
 I'm recording this episode right after the last one.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,580
 I haven't officially had my Halloween yet, but I will not go on a Halloween rant.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,580
 I hope it's good.

17
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,020
 Right now it's 2PM October 31st 2021.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,340
 So that's when I'm recording this.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,300
 And hopefully it's a really cool Halloween.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,740
 This is the segment they play after their local man got shot, ran over and stabbed

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,820
 to death in a one man mass casualty event.

22
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,580
 And they'll just play that at the beginning.

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,900
 They're like, "It started off as such a good day for body casters Jason Carpenter until

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,180
 he walked outside and then all that bad stuff happened."

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,940
 Something that's not bad is giving a hand to one of our legacy Patreons.

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,660
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,660
 Give it up for Devin Bracken.

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,660
 Everyone give him a hand.

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,180
 He's walking and driving his semi with a knife in his hand.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,180
 I'm like, "Gulp."

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,540
 Devin, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

32
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,980
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,500
 Just hope you spread the word about the show.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 Really, really helps out a lot.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,780
 You guys have no idea just by telling people about the show how much that gets the show

36
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,780
 to grow.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,380
 It's so important for you guys to do that.

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,500
 Devin, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,180
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:11,500
 We are flying all the way out to Columbia.

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,620
 I was watching YouTube the other day watching I have my ad blocker uninstalled so I can

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,500
 support my favorite YouTubers by watching their ads.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,820
 Otherwise, if I was not a YouTuber, I would have ad block installed.

44
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,660
 But it is nice when people shut it up.

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,940
 So I shut it up.

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,900
 This ad popped up and I thought you dirty, dirty rats.

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,540
 That wasn't the name of the product they were selling.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,380
 It wasn't as equal to Hungry Hungry at Pose.

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,460
 I'm watching this ad and I knew immediately what I was watching was a product that was

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,460
 designed.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,620
 Okay, let me back up here for a second.

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
 Allegedly.

53
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,860
 That sounded super.

54
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,300
 I am 100% reserved.

55
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,300
 Allegedly.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,300
 Allegedly.

57
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:00,020
 I am very, very, very allegedly sure that there is a new app that is out or style of

58
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,020
 app and I go to the CIA developed that app.

59
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,820
 I mean 100% this thing was designed in DARPA and CIA had their hands all over it.

60
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,140
 It is an app that by simply using your cell phone, some of you guys may be really familiar

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
 with it.

62
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
 Some of you may use it.

63
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,820
 It's ingenious, really.

64
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,820
 By using your cell phone's camera, you can create a perfect 3D replica of a room you're

65
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,140
 standing in.

66
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
 And they show it.

67
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
 They're like, "It's easy as one.

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,180
 It's easy as C-I-A."

69
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,660
 And they have this camera and all you do is you kind of move it around the room and then

70
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,460
 you go back and you go back to Quantico, you go back to wherever you're based out of and

71
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:48,380
 you can have a perfect 3D layout over some of them in London's bedroom.

72
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,420
 It's ingenious and I'm sure that on the ad they show the guy kind of hovering, kind of

73
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,700
 like moving the camera slowly around the room.

74
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,580
 I'm sure that's the consumer version.

75
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,780
 Because I'll tell you this right now.

76
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,100
 Any criminal worth their salt is using this app.

77
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:11,180
 Anyone who's doing any sort of job that has any sort of inside job applications, obviously

78
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,980
 like smash and grab, it might be good to know what the front of Mervins looks like, but

79
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,540
 you're driving your car through glass doors.

80
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,340
 I don't think you're worried about square footage.

81
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,660
 But if you're doing anything, you're going over to a friend's house and that friend's

82
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,540
 selling drugs but you know he doesn't have any backup.

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,100
 Like it's just him and his boys and you know they're just kind of punks.

84
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,940
 You go, "I'm not encouraging this behavior."

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,380
 But if you know you can steal from him and he's not going to get back, he's not going

86
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
 to come back to you, right?

87
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,380
 And he's not really a friend.

88
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,940
 He's more of an acquaintance.

89
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,660
 You walk in his house and you would get a perfect layout of his house.

90
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,380
 So then when you did go decide to talk to him, you knew where it was.

91
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,860
 Like you're putting in, you're making it like the Sims.

92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,300
 You're having all these people walk around and give you drugs.

93
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,140
 You're like, "I'm the best drug dealer in the world in the Sims."

94
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,820
 But yeah, dude, that's actually super creepy.

95
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,180
 I didn't think about the whole like sexual crime thing.

96
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,300
 I was thinking more of like home invasions.

97
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,580
 Kids can like go over to girls' houses and like break in and then make a total map of

98
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,180
 the house and then build a sim of them.

99
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,940
 I mean, they're already in the house, right?

100
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,660
 They could probably do something far more creepy, but I didn't want to think about that.

101
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,860
 But yeah, so with this program, you can map out a house perfectly.

102
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,340
 I'm sure the original CIA version, you didn't have Jason Bourne wasn't sitting there going

103
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,740
 like, "Excuse me, sir.

104
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,700
 We're trying to get a signal in your house."

105
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,100
 And he's like turning around in circles.

106
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,740
 I'm sure it's much easier, but yeah, and it's better than a photo.

107
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,140
 And you can actually have furniture.

108
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,100
 You can drag and drop into the house.

109
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,660
 So you'd be like, "No, someone's bed wasn't that big.

110
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
 It was a full.

111
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
 It wasn't a queen."

112
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,940
 So you get perfect of this 100% of CIA.

113
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,780
 And I don't know if they developed...

114
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,260
 Let me back up.

115
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,140
 I'm pretty sure they developed it.

116
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:04,220
 I'm wondering if they just said, "We're going to make this CIA run out of money.

117
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,620
 We've got to buy a new pair of spy shoes."

118
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,300
 So they decided that maybe they're getting a percentage of each sale of this, or if

119
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,420
 the technologist just got out there.

120
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,220
 For all I know, the Chinese sold it from the CIA and then they released it.

121
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,220
 And so now, because there's a ton of different apps that do this now.

122
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,340
 But the one main app I saw was...

123
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,340
 I'm never going to name the website.

124
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,220
 I'm not going to name the website because I'm making some pretty bold claims here.

125
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,220
 It's cia.gov.

126
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,100
 It's now also selling apps to do home remodeling.

127
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,700
 But yeah, it's my conspiracy theory.

128
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,900
 I'm pretty sure it's accurate.

129
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
 If it's...

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
 Let's say it went the other way around.

131
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,260
 Let's say some dude in Idaho developed this app with his buddies and they took it to the

132
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,860
 private sector and they were looking...

133
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
 100%.

134
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,680
 100% the CIA would have contacted them and say, "We're going to have a meeting first."

135
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,380
 Because the technology can be used...

136
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,260
 Think about all the horrible ways I came up with just sitting in my closet.

137
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,900
 I mean, a terrorist could go in and map out a bank, an embassy.

138
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,900
 So if it was not developed in-house by the CIA, whoever did develop had a very, very

139
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,980
 long meeting with government officials and they got first look at it.

140
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,900
 I think it's been being used for a while.

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
 Yeah.

142
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,000
 Super, super interesting.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,900
 I also find it very, very suspicious that when I'm not watching ads on YouTube to support

144
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:38,660
 my favorite YouTubers and thinking that it's CIA- oh, CIA funded ads.

145
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,140
 Every so often, I have not been able to figure out what triggers this, but every so often,

146
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,540
 YouTube will constantly show me videos for schizophrenia medicine.

147
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,380
 It's a weird loop it'll get into.

148
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,780
 Pandora started doing it the other day as well.

149
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,920
 If I was a more paranoid person, I might think something, but I'm not.

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,080
 So I just think it's odd.

151
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,880
 But a paranoid person could go, "Oh my God, are they listening to me?

152
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,920
 Are they driving me crazy?"

153
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,280
 There's an app for that.

154
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,160
 There probably is an app that could drive you crazy, but we will talk about that when

155
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,360
 I am on the verge of losing my mind because I went too far into the Google App Store.

156
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,760
 Kane, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jollopi.

157
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,240
 We are leaving behind Columbia.

158
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,860
 Oh, I forgot we were going to Columbia because we were going to be CIA agents.

159
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,980
 I had this whole thing planned out.

160
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
 We were going to be CIA agents.

161
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,700
 We were walking around some drug lords' house, and then I totally forgot.

162
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,780
 So the drug lords just stand there and he's like, "Hi."

163
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,940
 And then we get in the car and drive away.

164
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,300
 "Devin, go ahead and drive us away from this now angry Colombian drug lord.

165
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,540
 We're headed all the way out to Dead Man's Curve."

166
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,980
 Dead Man's Curve is this road in the Hollywood area.

167
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,600
 But in a two-year period had 25 accidents.

168
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,100
 Super dangerous curve.

169
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,520
 And this was back in the '60s.

170
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,440
 So back then, windows and cars were made out of glass and seatbelts.

171
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,240
 I don't even think we're optional.

172
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,040
 I just don't even think they were invented at that time.

173
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,480
 So a car accident back then was pretty brutal.

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
 It's January 24th, 1961 in Mel Blanc.

175
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 Mel Blanc.

176
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,440
 You guys should know who he is, but maybe younger people don't.

177
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,600
 He's a voice actor.

178
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
 He's the voice of Bugs Bunny.

179
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,180
 He's the voice of that dumb bird.

180
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,180
 What was his name?

181
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,020
 Not Woody Woodpecker, the little yellow one.

182
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,020
 Not Woodstock.

183
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
 The other one, Tweety.

184
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,020
 Tweety.

185
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,700
 Tweety Bird.

186
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,020
 He was the voice of so many other voices.

187
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,660
 I didn't write him down.

188
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,020
 I forgot to write down.

189
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,020
 I don't know.

190
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,340
 Maybe he did Huckleberry Hounds and Porky Pig and stuff like that.

191
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,300
 But he's done tons of voices.

192
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
 A lot of them.

193
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,140
 So many that I just assumed you would know his name.

194
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,200
 And he's driving around Dead Man's Curve.

195
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,120
 And the curve, it got a little too dead man for him.

196
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
 Huge car accident.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,120
 Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

198
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:11,880
 That's a predicament.

199
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:26,720
 I can't even think of a celebrity nowadays that would be the equivalent of Mel Blanc.

200
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,520
 Because he was in all these cartoons and you grew up with the cartoons and your kids were

201
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,560
 growing up with the cartoons in 1961.

202
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
 There's no one like that today like a Brad Pitt gone in accident.

203
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
 People would be sad, right?

204
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,840
 But would the nation go into mourning?

205
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,720
 Now to be fair I don't know if Mel Blanc, I don't know if Mel Blanc's coma.

206
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,840
 I don't know if they lowered the flags to have staff.

207
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,040
 I know that I would have been totally gutted but I wasn't alive in 1961.

208
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,360
 But anyways, he's the voice of several generations.

209
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,840
 He's in a coma and 14 days he's just laying there asleep and stuff.

210
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,600
 Brain is not working.

211
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,280
 And a doctor walks in and goes, "Bugs Bunny, how are you doing today?"

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
 Just kind of a joke.

213
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,080
 It says in the articles he was testing an experiment but I think he was just being

214
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
 kind of a jerk.

215
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
 He goes, "Bugs Bunny, how are you doing today?"

216
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:23,320
 And Mel Blanc goes, "Ahhh, what's up doc?"

217
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,640
 And the doctor realizes, wait a second, we've been trying to communicate with this guy for

218
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
 14 days.

219
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,360
 This is a 1961 level medical technology.

220
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,440
 This guy's lucky he's even alive right now.

221
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,080
 The doctor's flabbergasted.

222
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,680
 He goes, "We've been trying to communicate with this guy for days now but let me try

223
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
 another thing."

224
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,800
 He goes, "Tweetie, can you hear me?"

225
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:55,160
 And then Mel Blanc goes, "I taught I taught, puttycat."

226
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,840
 So they realize that he can communicate.

227
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
 This is true story.

228
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,600
 I did not believe when this was sent to me.

229
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
 I'll get into that in a second.

230
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
 I did not believe.

231
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,800
 I did not believe in the first question.

232
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,400
 I think it said, "Interesting, what is your source for this?"

233
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
 This is a true story.

234
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,200
 He could only talk in cartoon voices.

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,360
 Not till this day, right?

236
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,520
 It's not like you're trying to have a conversation with him and he's like, "Why ought to shoot

237
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 you in the face?"

238
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,520
 He's like, "Oh, it's your Sam and Sam."

239
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
 He got better.

240
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,600
 Within two months later he stopped talking in cartoon quotes.

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,480
 He's like, "Aye, Arriva, Arriva!"

242
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,520
 He's running around the hospital and they're like, "Oh no, he's speeding and tall as now."

243
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
 He didn't get the powers.

244
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,760
 He didn't get the powers of the characters either.

245
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,520
 I don't know why I've added that detail.

246
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
 Where's Mel Blanc?

247
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
 He dug out of his room.

248
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,080
 He's like, "I'm digging into Albuquerque."

249
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,600
 He's eating carrots.

250
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,680
 Anyways, two months later he makes a full recovery.

251
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,400
 The only thing that isn't recovered is his body.

252
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,440
 He's in a full body cast and they have to wheel him home and he gets better and he actually

253
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
 soothes the city.

254
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,480
 He goes, "Listen, Dead Man's Curve.

255
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,200
 I was the 26th accident on there.

256
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 I almost died.

257
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 Soothes the city wins."

258
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,080
 They have to fix the road.

259
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,880
 They have to fix Dead Man's Curve.

260
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,560
 The reason is a very, very interesting story, just like a weird tidbit of how the human

261
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,640
 mind works.

262
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,680
 But I was sent this story on the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit by iteration 19.

263
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,160
 Iteration 19 sent this over.

264
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
 Really, really appreciate it.

265
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,360
 And they sent it over in the context of, "This is an update to a story you did a long time

266
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,000
 ago.

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,160
 It was episode 140."

268
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
 Can you believe that?

269
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
 140.

270
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,240
 It was that 600 episodes ago.

271
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,840
 Is Bugs Bunny, this is the name of the episode, is Bugs Bunny really a Native American deity?

272
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,160
 I really like that episode.

273
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
 It's a really fun one.

274
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,000
 It takes a look at just a bizarre conspiracy theory that was going around.

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
 I think it was on the iceberg.

276
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:55,120
 But the idea was, and that one, that Bugs Bunny, if I remember correctly, if Bugs Bunny is

277
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,200
 the representation of an ancient Native American trickster spirit.

278
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,240
 And it has moved through our reality.

279
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,120
 It was never a fictional character.

280
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
 It's part of our reality.

281
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,520
 And what we have done is we have avatarred it.

282
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,640
 We've created a physical form or thought form of this deity.

283
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,520
 It used to be a trickster bunny in olden times.

284
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,920
 And now it's the wisecrackin' Bugs Bunny character.

285
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,200
 And it needed the creators to navigate its life cycle.

286
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,640
 Because they didn't want to be like Felix the cat.

287
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,800
 No one knows who that is.

288
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,160
 Or Betty Boop, who just appears on women's handbags nowadays.

289
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,440
 Bugs Bunny is an icon.

290
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,760
 He's an icon.

291
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,200
 And I would argue Bugs Bunny is more popular than Mickey Mouse.

292
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 Let me back that up.

293
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,800
 I will argue Bugs Bunny is a better character than Mickey Mouse.

294
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,680
 Maybe not more popular, but Bugs Bunny always seem to have more of a complex character as

295
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,280
 opposed to the other like Felix the cat or Mickey Mouse or Betty Boop and stuff like

296
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
 that.

297
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,800
 So the fact that there's not much Mickey Mouse stuff in production except for little kid

298
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,320
 things.

299
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
 And Bugs Bunny just had a movie come out last year.

300
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
 Was it this year?

301
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,760
 Space Jam 2.

302
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,040
 So Bugs Bunny is this, this was the theory.

303
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,920
 Bugs Bunny is this enduring spirit that has become part of our reality and we worship

304
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,600
 it now with these Bugs Bunny hats and these Bugs Bunny cartoons.

305
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,120
 Oh, I want a Bugs Bunny to be my birthday and what we're really doing is praying to

306
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,000
 this ancient native deity.

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
 It's kind of the episode in a nutshell.

308
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,080
 600 episodes, I'm just going off my memory.

309
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,360
 And this is an interesting sign out to that because if I remember correctly in that episode,

310
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,760
 the animators at Warner Brothers had to give this thing a life and like they were talking

311
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
 about how its personality changed.

312
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,440
 Bugs Bunny was originally a different character and slowly morphed and the theory was that

313
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:59,800
 was the spirit making the physical representation of it fit more to its spirit.

314
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,640
 Basically the idea wasn't an original idea like friends, let's make a show about seven

315
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,920
 people coming to New York.

316
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,000
 No, the coffee shop, this idea and that may be guided by writers and the actors, they

317
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 cast and all that stuff.

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,800
 But this one, you had this deity who was navigating them.

319
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
 Everything was left up to chance.

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,720
 The spirit was controlling them.

321
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,600
 And Mel Blanc was the voice of Bugs Bunny.

322
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,520
 And after this accident, he continued to work in animation doing the voice of Bugs Bunny

323
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,080
 for an additional 30 years, which is massive.

324
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,040
 Obviously we have a new Bugs Bunny nowadays.

325
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,880
 We have a new voice, but they are doing an imitation of the Mel Blanc voice.

326
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,480
 Had he died earlier in his career, they would have had to hire someone else.

327
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,280
 And that voice would have been different.

328
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,480
 It may have not been the voice the spirit assigned to itself.

329
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,720
 It's earthly vessel.

330
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
 It's messenger on earth.

331
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,560
 But when it's messenger was struck down in this tragic car accident, it may have been

332
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,120
 locked in Mel Blanc's brain as well.

333
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,920
 And that is why he did not answer to Mel when the loved ones were coming in, when the friends

334
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,640
 and family were coming in to talk to Mel.

335
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
 He's in that coma.

336
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:21,160
 It took someone talking to Bugs Bunny to bring him back into our world.

337
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:31,320
 And Bugs Bunny was once again able to have its image worshiped all over the planet.

338
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
 Interesting conspiracy theory.

339
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,240
 I really love covering weird stuff like that in iteration 19.

340
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,720
 This is a really cool update to that.

341
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 Thank you very much.

342
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,600
 I love the idea of thinking what if after that point it was no longer Mel Blanc.

343
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
 Bugs Bunny was in control of that body.

344
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,280
 However, I have absolutely no proof of any of that.

345
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,920
 I don't know really much about Mel Blanc other than he voiced Bugs Bunny.

346
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,120
 The only reason I know he voiced Tweety Bird because the doctor talked to him and he got

347
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
 in a car accident.

348
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,080
 That's pretty much I'm limited to my Mel Blanc knowledge.

349
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,400
 Devon, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbon or car.

350
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,960
 We are leaving behind Dead Man's Curve, which is a much safer place to drive nowadays.

351
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,720
 We are headed all the way out to London.

352
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,000
 [imitates car engine]

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,240
 Specifically, we're going to the University College London.

354
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,100
 And then we're going to meet a woman known as Joanna Atkinson.

355
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:31,640
 She's the clinical psychologist based at that college and she's deaf.

356
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,840
 This store, I got the bulk of my information from an amazing article written by Jemima

357
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,480
 Atkinson for mosaicscience.com.

358
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,200
 It's a really, really interesting article and the headline really says it all.

359
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,000
 Can deaf people hear voices?

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
 What Jemima is writing about is deaf schizophrenic people.

361
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,000
 When they have auditory hallucinations, how do they hallucinate?

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,120
 And it's one of those questions that the second you ask it, you have to know the answer.

363
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,200
 I know I promised it on yesterday's episode and you're like, "Oh, I can't wait to hear

364
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,880
 that and now you're listening to it now, so thanks for your patience."

365
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
 You might have just looked it up.

366
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,840
 In the meantime, can deaf people hear voices?

367
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,240
 This article for mosaicscience.com, we're going to talk about...

368
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,360
 50% we're going to talk about some stats and then we're going to get into Joanna Atkinson's

369
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,760
 research on it as well.

370
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,520
 It's just very, very fascinating.

371
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,080
 The current scientific consensus on the question, do schizophrenic deaf people hear voices?

372
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,040
 Deaf people hear auditory hallucinations is...

373
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
 Yes.

374
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,040
 50% of deaf people with schizophrenia hear voices.

375
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,720
 But how do they hear them?

376
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
 What's the mechanism there?

377
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,640
 And obviously, when you have deaf people, you have people who were born deaf, who have

378
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,720
 never heard anything.

379
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,720
 Then you have people who go deaf, either due to industrial accident, ice pick through

380
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 the ear, or just...

381
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
 It doesn't have to be...

382
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,120
 It doesn't have to be that dynamic.

383
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,560
 It could just be getting old.

384
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,120
 But you have people who have heard throughout their life, but now they're considered deaf.

385
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,120
 If you look at the research, it says that 50% of schizophrenics who are deaf hear voices.

386
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,360
 And when they are talking to their doctors, they use words like "loud."

387
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,520
 They use words like a whisper.

388
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,640
 So volume.

389
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,200
 And so the doctors go, "Well, if you're talking about volume, there's auditory."

390
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,440
 Sign language doesn't really have a volume.

391
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,600
 You can't whisper and sign.

392
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,800
 You can yell and sign by signing very frantically.

393
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
 You can yell, right?

394
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 In sign language.

395
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
 So where were these things coming from?

396
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,720
 Where were these volume words coming from?

397
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,880
 So Joanna Atkinson, who is a clinical psychologist and she's deaf herself, she is looking at

398
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,320
 these studies and she goes, "This cannot be accurate."

399
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,880
 A person who has never heard noise at all, any words ever their entire life they were

400
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,720
 born deaf cannot hallucinate a voice.

401
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,920
 It's impossible.

402
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
 So she starts digging into this.

403
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,320
 She goes, "It doesn't make any sense."

404
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,480
 Now for us who have hearing, we can imagine what it's like to be deaf.

405
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,880
 But then, even if you're imagining what it's like to be deaf, you still can have a running

406
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,560
 monologue in your head.

407
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,080
 You can still imagine voices.

408
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,560
 Because we've heard them.

409
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,000
 We can imagine what it would be like to be deaf.

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,280
 We can maybe close off our senses in like a tube that we have no sense of sound, no sense

411
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
 of touch.

412
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:45,160
 But we have inner thought, which are words that we've heard.

413
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
 Super fascinating.

414
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,600
 So this is what she figured out.

415
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:56,400
 When a deaf person is talking to a hearing doctor, there is a translation error.

416
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,200
 Because when a deaf schizophrenic is talking to a deaf doctor and they're using sign language,

417
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,640
 there are no volume words.

418
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,840
 There are none.

419
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,240
 So it was a translation error.

420
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,720
 The general scientific consensus was, "This is happening.

421
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,840
 We don't know how, but when she says if there are deaf patients and deaf doctors, 100%,

422
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,280
 they do not hear auditory hallucinations."

423
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,000
 This is what her research said.

424
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,600
 Deaf people who had never heard did not experience true auditory hallucinations.

425
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,480
 But they still have hallucinations.

426
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
 Because they're suffering from schizophrenia.

427
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,960
 Now when you have these voices in your head, and we've covered these before on our show,

428
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,480
 we've covered them before on our show.

429
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,880
 And just in general knowledge, I think people have an idea of the stereotypical schizophrenia.

430
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,360
 But these voices are telling you, "You're awful.

431
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,440
 You're a horrible person.

432
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
 No one's ever going to love you."

433
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,240
 Like the CIA is coming after you, all of this stuff, right?

434
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,880
 You start to have these voices in your head.

435
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 You're worthless.

436
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,000
 You're nothing.

437
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,560
 But they can't hear voices.

438
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,880
 But the schizophrenia still, the mental illness still wants to convince them that they are

439
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,760
 useless.

440
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
 So what they, what they're, this is fascinating.

441
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:21,840
 What their brain does is they hallucinate arms doing sign language in front of them.

442
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
 It's a visual hallucination.

443
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
 But it's talking to them.

444
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
 You're useless.

445
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,720
 Isn't that creepy?

446
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,680
 Your brain wants to punish you so much when you're in the grip of this mental illness.

447
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,200
 But it can't punish you with words because you don't understand audio hallucinations.

448
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
 So hands will appear in front of you and make sign language telling you, "You're a piece

449
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
 of trash and no one loves you.

450
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,000
 You should just kill yourself."

451
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
 The government is watching you right now.

452
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,280
 If you don't leave the house within the next three minutes, it will explode.

453
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,800
 You're seeing this.

454
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 So fascinating.

455
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,280
 So if you've never heard anything in your life, they said, "What you'll see is you'll

456
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,000
 see arms appear in front of you."

457
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,920
 And they'll start doing sign language or you'll see a pair of lips appear in front of you

458
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,040
 if you're adept at reading lips.

459
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:21,000
 Now they said, "If I'm hallucinating, but involve someone I know, I'll see them.

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,720
 I'll see them in front of me doing sign language telling me, 'I never loved you.

461
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,680
 You're a horrible, horrible person.'"

462
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,520
 This one patient would hallucinate her mother's lips.

463
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,600
 Just her mother's lips floating there.

464
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:43,080
 I would write if you're asking me to choose between hearing voices telling me I'm trash

465
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,000
 or seeing my mom's lips float around me telling me the same thing.

466
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,840
 I'm choosing the voices.

467
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,320
 And then think about it.

468
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,160
 Those are the people who have never heard anything.

469
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,840
 What about the people who used to be able to hear and now they're deaf?

470
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
 What do they hallucinate?

471
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,480
 Do they also see the arms doing the sign language?

472
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,080
 Oddly enough, no.

473
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,200
 If you've never heard a single word in your life, it can't give you an auditory hallucination.

474
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,920
 So it signs to you and tells you you're worthless.

475
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,320
 If you used to be able to hear and you're fluent in sign language, you lost your hearing

476
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,920
 when you were 30.

477
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,200
 You're 52 now.

478
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,560
 You're fluent in sign language.

479
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,240
 You're a huge part of the deaf and hard of hearing community.

480
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,280
 And you have schizophrenia.

481
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,520
 You don't see the hands.

482
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,440
 You hear voices.

483
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,720
 But you haven't heard anything for 20 years.

484
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:51,040
 You can hear the voices, but you can't understand what they're saying.

485
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
 It's almost like the...

486
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 Because think about it.

487
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,240
 If someone hasn't heard anything for 30 years and you wanted to communicate a message with

488
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,800
 them, the path of least resistance would be to do the sign language.

489
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,640
 But the voice, this outside voice wants to be heard so badly, it defaults to that.

490
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,160
 Instead of doing the visual hallucination, it will talk to you, but you can't understand

491
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,000
 it because you haven't heard anything for years.

492
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,160
 So it's just mumbling coming from somewhere around you.

493
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
 I don't know.

494
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,000
 I know I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia and I hear voices when no one's around.

495
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 What do they say?

496
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
 I don't know.

497
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,120
 So why don't the voices talk to them on the side?

498
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,240
 It's so determined to talk to people who have in depth since birth that it creates this

499
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,080
 bizarre hallucination.

500
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,920
 It's your mind's eye showing these complex symbols, hands making these symbols.

501
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,040
 And I'm wondering, are they even human hands?

502
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,440
 Like if you are...

503
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,240
 We covered this a long time ago.

504
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,400
 They had the program where you could...

505
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,400
 People who had schizophrenia, people who were hearing voices, you were able to build a digital

506
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,840
 avatar of that voice.

507
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,000
 I'll put that on the show notes.

508
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,720
 It was really cool, but it's a technique they're using.

509
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,960
 And they could actually make the face look like the voice was really weird.

510
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,320
 And all the faces looked really evil.

511
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,400
 The ones they showed for photos of.

512
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,440
 So like with the arms, were they masculine arms?

513
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,960
 Are they feminine arms?

514
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,520
 Assuming they didn't know who the person was.

515
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,040
 If they know they're hallucinating about a person, it's them.

516
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,360
 But were they human arms?

517
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,320
 Reaching out from the darkness, telling you how horrible you are, how no one loves you?

518
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,880
 Then there's a third group.

519
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,920
 A third group of people who I, in a Venn diagram of any subculture, I would just not...

520
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,400
 I would not put them in the Venn diagram.

521
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,240
 I didn't know they existed.

522
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,160
 Especially in one, because obviously deaf and hard of hearing, it's a subculture.

523
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,560
 And now we're looking at a subculture of that, people who are deaf with schizophrenia.

524
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,280
 And there is a subculture of that.

525
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,840
 Well you have people who are deaf with schizophrenia, who are born deaf.

526
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,000
 You have people who, over time, became deaf.

527
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,680
 And then you have a third group, a group of people, quote, who had reached adulthood without

528
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,600
 learning any formal language.

529
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,560
 Unquote.

530
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,080
 So not only do they not know American sign language very well, they don't know how to

531
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,760
 speak at all.

532
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,400
 Apparently there is a crossover.

533
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:28,400
 You had enough of them to study who were deaf and had schizophrenia and had learned no language

534
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,000
 at all.

535
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,720
 They learned sign.

536
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,600
 The reason why Joanna was able to communicate with them was later in life they learned sign

537
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,160
 language, but they weren't fluent.

538
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,600
 And they had no...

539
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
 It says without learning any formal language.

540
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,760
 So maybe they were like, "Oh shucks, come on down to the well and let's beat up some

541
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
 beekeepers."

542
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,200
 Or some, "I don't know, I don't know."

543
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,120
 Maybe some weird hillbilly speak or something.

544
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,160
 No formal language without learning any formal language.

545
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:03,200
 So how do they get thoughts telling them they're worthless and the CIA is about to kill them

546
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,240
 for beating up all those beekeepers in Louisiana?

547
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
 No talking?

548
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,840
 They don't have any language, right?

549
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
 No formal language.

550
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,600
 No talking.

551
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,720
 And their sign language isn't up to par so they're not able to have the sign language.

552
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,320
 They just see an angry face staring at them.

553
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,120
 Scowling.

554
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,080
 It doesn't speak.

555
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,840
 It just stares.

556
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,280
 That is...

557
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,920
 I mean, that would have to be the most unsettling of all, right?

558
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,760
 At least if it was speaking you could kind of have an argument with it.

559
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,000
 You could try to fight it off, but you could just see your mental illness personified as

560
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,880
 this face in front of you because you don't have any communication skills.

561
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
 You're...

562
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,400
 That's what's so fascinating and tragic about illnesses like schizophrenia.

563
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,480
 Your brain wants to punish you so badly that it will get you no matter what.

564
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,320
 Now again, I 100% am an advocate of professional help.

565
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,840
 That is a hill I'm willing to die on.

566
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,400
 You may have had a bad experience with a counselor and I always tell people...

567
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,280
 People have good counselors, people have bad counselors.

568
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,600
 I say it's like picking a boyfriend or a girlfriend.

569
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,800
 You don't go with the first one, right?

570
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,720
 You're a pair in a spare.

571
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
 That's what they say, right?

572
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,640
 You should have two counselors you should talk to and then one on the side if this

573
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
 one gets a little...

574
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,560
 It starts raining a little too much down in your notebook.

575
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,800
 No, in all seriousness, you should get this stuff.

576
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,360
 There's no shame in being treated for...

577
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 It's an illness.

578
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,440
 It's like having a runny nose or having a stomach ache.

579
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,840
 No one has gout and goes, "Nah, I'm good.

580
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 I'm good.

581
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,040
 I can't turn my neck much and everything's super painful, but I'm not going to go to

582
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
 the doctor."

583
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,200
 You can't do that and normal people go, "Dude, that's so gross.

584
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,240
 Your gout is exploding all over my Caesar salad."

585
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,400
 With mental illness a lot of times because we don't see it until it's stuff's really

586
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
 bad.

587
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,880
 We just put it off and then other people don't encourage others.

588
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,200
 I personally see no shame.

589
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,960
 You know what I mean?

590
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,440
 I think it's creepy that your brain wants to get you so badly it will do whatever it

591
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
 takes to get you.

592
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,960
 If you can hear, it'll give you horrible, horrible auditory hallucinations.

593
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,360
 If you used to be able to hear, it'll still try to give them to you, but you can't hear

594
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
 them luckily.

595
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,600
 You just hear this mumbling.

596
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,520
 You don't hear these horrible words, but then you can't hear it all.

597
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,720
 It will make you hallucinate.

598
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
 I just think it's creepy.

599
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,120
 It doesn't matter how you access information, how you're able to have your senses work.

600
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,920
 It will get you.

601
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,800
 It'll make you have auditory hallucinations.

602
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,320
 Oh, you can't hear.

603
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,400
 You're going to have visual hallucinations of me telling you your trash.

604
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
 Oh, you don't understand the language.

605
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,680
 I'm just going to project a horrifying face in front of you, showing you how disgusted

606
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,440
 I am that you exist.

607
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,920
 It won't let go.

608
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:34,120
 And you have to imagine like what if someone was blind and deaf and schizophrenic, had never

609
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:43,360
 seen anything or heard anything, and was suffering from a mental illness this severe.

610
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,560
 What could the brain possibly conjure up?

611
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,120
 It would think of something.

612
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,880
 It would think of something we couldn't even comprehend.

613
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,080
 Dementia is a real life illness that needs to be treated by professionals.

614
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,960
 It is a serious illness.

615
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,120
 If you suffer from it, you should continue to seek help.

616
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,560
 But when we talk about things like this, it really, really makes you see why people often

617
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,280
 do confuse mental illnesses with demonic possession.

618
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,560
 Because this sounds demonic.

619
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,280
 No matter what you do, no matter who you are, it will punish you.

620
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,800
 It will make you see things.

621
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
 It will make you hear things.

622
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:37,680
 Whether or not you can see or hear is irrelevant to this illness.

623
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,400
 It will push you to the limits.

624
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,800
 It will try to break you down.

625
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,400
 It will try to destroy you.

626
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 It will try to destroy your will to live.

627
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,240
 And if that doesn't sound demonic, I don't know what is.

628
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,240
 It will try to break you down.
