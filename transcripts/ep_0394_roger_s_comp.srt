1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 Is there a house in Michigan that is haunted because of the work of a serial killer?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,400
 And then we take a trip on a UFO with a young boy, Roger S.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,300
 He woke up one night to find aliens standing around his bed,

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,500
 and he stumbled into one of the greatest conspiracies today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,700
 I hope you guys are having an awesome day leading into an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,700
 I've actually had a really good week.

11
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,500
 I've actually had a really, really good week.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
 If you listen to the first episode, I was a little distraught because of the whole job situation,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,800
 but everything's been going great.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,600
 It's been awesome.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
 And I want to thank you guys for being such awesome listeners.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,800
 Really, really appreciate it. You guys rock.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 And I also want to say this too.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600
 I want to give a shout out to three listeners, in particular, WiggleWoggle22,

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,200
 HerbRoasted, and H.Sucker.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,600
 All three of them left five-star reviews on podcast apps.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,800
 It could have been iTunes, could have been Podcast Addict, Spotify.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,700
 I'm not for sure, but all three of them left.

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,000
 Not only did they leave five-star reviews, but they left pretty detailed reasons

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,600
 why they thought the show deserved five-stars.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,700
 So I really, really appreciate that, guys.

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,200
 That helps get the word out too.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,800
 Any way that you can support the show is always appreciated.

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,700
 And I appreciate you guys so much.

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,000
 You guys rock.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,700
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story here.

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,200
 So let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,100
 We're going to drive to Detroit, Michigan.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,900
 That was supposed to be the eight-mile song, but it wasn't.

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,000
 We're driving to Detroit, Michigan, right?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,400
 And we're going, specifically, we're going to the Brush Park Historic District.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,100
 So load up.

37
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,900
 Let's go to stop at the gas station.

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,300
 You can get a bunch of Fago.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
 Yeah, Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,700
 So we got our sugar rush in.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,600
 Mm-mm-mm.

42
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,700
 So I don't think I've, I think I've had Fago once, one time.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,200
 I imagine it tastes like Shasta, but a Fago famed drink of the insane clown posse, famed drink.

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 I think you can only get it in Detroit, Michigan.

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,100
 I'm pretty sure it's just Ford factory runoff water that they slap a label on.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,700
 And depending on the color of the water, that's the quote-unquote flavor.

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,900
 But anyways, prove me wrong.

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,500
 Send me a bunch of free Fago.

49
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,600
 It's Detroit, Michigan.

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
 We're in Brush Park Historic District.

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,200
 We're specifically going to the Hot Mansion.

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
 Now, I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,800
 Not the word mansion, but "Hot H-A-U."

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,600
 How often do I spell stuff out on this show?

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,900
 H-A-U-G-H-T.

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,200
 The hot, I don't want you to think it's Nelly's house.

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
 It's not the Hot Mansion.

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,100
 It's the Hot Mansion.

59
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,100
 Anyways, it's just this building on an empty lot.

60
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
 And we're just standing there.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,400
 We're looking up at this.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,000
 And he goes, "So, who wants to go in first?"

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,100
 And you volunteer because you're the bravest of all of us and you go in first.

64
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,500
 And in about 20 minutes, you haven't come back out yet.

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 We're just drinking Fago.

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,100
 We'll start painting our faces.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,700
 We're juggalos now.

68
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,300
 And you still haven't come out.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,600
 So we're like, "Well, that's the end of that segment.

70
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,000
 Now let's go on to the next one."

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,900
 No, eventually, though, we are going to have to go on a look for you.

72
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,800
 In particular, we're walking where shiny flashlights around.

73
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,300
 Spooky place.

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,700
 Now, this place became famous recently because of an urban explorer.

75
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,800
 And he wrote a book and it was like a photo essay type book.

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,700
 And in this book, this house is featured.

77
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,400
 The book is called "13, An American Horror Story."

78
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,000
 And it's all about like these ancient decrepit buildings and their sinister past and experiences

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,700
 that this urban explorer, he goes by the name "Seph Lawless."

80
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,900
 It's illegal a lot of times to do urban exploring.

81
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,800
 So the fact that he's using a pseudonym makes sense.

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,500
 But anyways, Seph Lawless has photographed.

83
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,400
 Guys, don't do the comments just yet.

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
 The Seph Lawless is photographing these locations.

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,400
 He wrote this book and he's kind of popularized this one.

86
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,100
 So we're walking around.

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,700
 So we've seen this place in Seph's Lawless beautiful photography.

88
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,900
 We're walking around and it looks great.

89
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,700
 But the problem is we find you.

90
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
 We find you cowering in the corner.

91
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,300
 Get up, man.

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,700
 Come on.

93
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,400
 He's like, "No, no, no.

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
 I was just pretending to cower.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,000
 I was just pretending to wet my pants.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
 I wanted to, it was a social experiment.

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,600
 We're like, "Yeah, yeah, we still love you."

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,500
 So this place was a gentleman's club for, it was a whorehouse basically back in the 1920s.

99
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,600
 Probably a better way to put it.

100
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,300
 But it was a little bit higher than a whorehouse because it was for the wealthy and the elite.

101
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,400
 So you want to just go down there and it wasn't just like Betty, who was the girl there.

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,000
 It was like Esmerelda, who, it's still Betty.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 She changed her name, put some more makeup.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
 But that was this place.

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,700
 What happened was in 1941, this is according to the Courier Mail.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
 It's a newspaper, obviously.

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,000
 1941.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,300
 The place was shut down because there was more.

109
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,900
 People kind of turned a blind eye to it because one,

110
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,100
 it serviced the elite, serviced in more than one way, the elite of the city.

111
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,600
 And two people were kind of like, "Oh, you know, it's the Roaring Twenties and then the Roaring Thirtys.

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,100
 But by the forties, people go, "Las, shut it down."

113
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,600
 All this new anti-prostitution laws got passed.

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,100
 Law enforcement really put an elbow on the place that got shut down.

115
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,900
 So it was just an empty building sitting there of a glorious past where you could go and pay money and have sex with beautiful women.

116
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,100
 Now it was just a place where bums showed up to have sex with each other.

117
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,300
 In the 1960s, though, a phone call was made to the police.

118
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,000
 "Hey, guys, I was just down here being a bomb, being a homeless person.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,300
 And there's something down here. It smells really, really bad.

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,000
 Apparently Rick Sanchez was a homeless person in Detroit, Michigan."

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,100
 The cops go down there and as they're getting close to the place, they can smell it.

122
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,400
 Uh-oh.

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
 So they walk in, they're walking around and get their flashlights ready.

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,300
 You smell that? Yeah, yeah, I smell it. I smelled it out there.

125
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
 I mean, why are you even asking me that, bro?

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,900
 Of course I smelled it.

127
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,700
 They go down and they follow the smell like straight-up fruit loop in it down to the basement.

128
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,400
 And there's just bodies everywhere.

129
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,900
 Like, do quick, quick cut flashes of all these individual bodies.

130
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,700
 [imitates gunshot]

131
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,100
 Straight CSI style. And then we're gonna do a cut to police scene tape.

132
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,400
 I wonder when police scene tape was invented.

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
 I don't think they had it in 1941.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
 Oh wait, when does this happen?

135
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,900
 This happened in the 1960s, so I don't think they had it in the 1960s.

136
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,300
 'Cause you would need... I wonder how they used old-timey police tape.

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,800
 The Papyrus, did they use that back in Egyptian days?

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,900
 They're like, "Okay, guys, cordon off this area."

139
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,800
 I guess originally you probably just used string.

140
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
 But I wonder if it said police on it.

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,800
 Anyways, they cordon off the area somehow.

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
 They just stand... they just have a cop standing every few inches.

143
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
 Cordon off the area, bringing homicide investigators.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
 A ton of bodies down there.

145
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,200
 Now, to this day we don't know exactly how many bodies were in this basement.

146
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,000
 It was enough to make the place stink from outside the building.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But each of the bodies had what seemed to be a perfect circle carved in the torso.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So some people have thought that this is some sort of cult.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,200
 Maybe the elite came back to continue to use the building.

150
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
 Now that they couldn't like, you know, bang people there,

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,800
 they're just going to use it for other elite activities.

152
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,100
 Even sacrifices.

153
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,300
 Some people believe it was a serial killer who that was his place to dump the bodies.

154
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,500
 And it wasn't until they just got...

155
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,100
 The homeless people just were living there and just like, "Ah, what are you going to do?"

156
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,500
 Like, there's two or three bodies in the basement.

157
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,000
 But I've lived in worse place.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And again, it's Detroit, Michigan.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 So two or three bodies in your basement, you're like, "Yeah, it's normal."

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,500
 But by the time the human body started to stack up and homeless people,

161
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,700
 I mean, imagine waking up to that smell.

162
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,900
 So some people think it's a cult.

163
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,500
 Some people think it's a serial killer.

164
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,700
 Now, what's funny is there is an other urban explorer who goes by the name Nailhead.

165
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,400
 And he's actually nailed this one on the head.

166
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,500
 He's actually figured out this thing.

167
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,000
 Seth Lawless made it up.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
 It never happened.

169
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,000
 Now, this, like I said, this was featured in his book, "13 An American Horror Story."

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,900
 And this house and 12 other locations were published all over the internet.

171
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,300
 Look at this spooky photos and read about these terrifying backstories of these locations.

172
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,800
 And I found out about this on an Italian website called illparanormale.com.

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,700
 And they said, "This is the true story about this mansion that has all these bodies in it that's haunted today."

174
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,700
 And here's a photograph of it.

175
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,400
 And I go, "Oh, that's interesting."

176
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,100
 And then I start researching it.

177
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,500
 And I'm finding these other things.

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,200
 13 ghost locations that are super spooky.

179
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,900
 Courier Mail did actually run an article on it.

180
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,900
 Headlined 13 Real-Life Haunted Houses in the Horror Stories that go with them.

181
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,300
 Nailhead, this other urban explorer, followed this story up.

182
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,900
 Whole stories made up.

183
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,200
 Seth Lawless is an urban explorer.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
 He exists.

185
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,700
 He does take these photographs, but he made up the backstory to sell the book.

186
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,400
 Nailhead was just using the photograph and having a rough idea, Detroit, Michigan,

187
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,800
 seeing where the photograph is at, seeing where these photographs are at,

188
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,200
 was able to locate the building in real life.

189
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
 It was a border house.

190
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,500
 And this Nailhead goes through all of these public documents.

191
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,600
 He's like, "I'm really going to disprove this one.

192
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,800
 This is absolutely ridiculous because I know for a fact that he's making this stuff up."

193
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,500
 He begins going through public records and he goes, "Listen, I'll be honest with you guys.

194
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,100
 It was a border house.

195
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,400
 People died there, but people tend to die at home."

196
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,200
 And he begins listing all of the elderly people who've died there.

197
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,500
 There wasn't, they weren't rotting so bad that the hobos were leaving.

198
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,900
 There were no hobos.

199
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,600
 It did become a derelict building, but as of 2016, they're rebuilding it.

200
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,600
 The people who bought the property are like, "Guys, no, it's not haunted.

201
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,400
 That story's totally made up."

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,500
 Seth Lawless early on before this gets out that he's caught doing this,

203
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
 has this quote.

204
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,900
 He calls his war creative nonfiction.

205
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,800
 So he's saying it's true, but it's creative.

206
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
 Here's a quote from him.

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,700
 "It's taking real life stories and making them appear to be fiction.

208
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,700
 The goal is to make the reader become so enthralled by the details and the fantasy

209
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,000
 that they forget the story is real."

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
 Unquote.

211
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,900
 Now, Huffington Post did a "Here's 13 Spooky Things" and think about it.

212
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
 It's a puff piece.

213
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,400
 It really is a "Here's 13 Photographs."

214
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,700
 They are beautiful photographs, but here's 13 photographs.

215
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,500
 That'll make your skin crawl.

216
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,700
 Ooh, probably came out around Halloween.

217
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
 Maybe sometimes it came around the release of his book,

218
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,900
 but if he was smart, he'd release the book around Halloween.

219
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,800
 A puff piece article.

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,700
 "18 Things You Can Do With Cheez-Its."

221
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,000
 Stuff like that.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,700
 They issued a retraction on this puff piece.

223
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,200
 People aren't going to write it and say,

224
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 "You can't do those 18 Things With Cheez-Its.

225
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,700
 They just let the article stand.

226
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,800
 It's garbage article for clicks to get money."

227
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 Whatever.

228
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,900
 They issued a retraction.

229
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,300
 They said, "Listen, a lot of our readers have reached out to us

230
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,000
 to let us know this is fake.

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,300
 However, we want to leave the article up for historical purposes."

232
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,000
 And I think, one, they're getting--

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,900
 They did put the retraction at the very top of the articles, like, bam.

234
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,100
 As art, the photos are beautiful.

235
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,200
 Now, the backstory is totally, again, totally made up.

236
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,700
 We know for a fact that the hot mansion one is fake,

237
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,100
 but we do know that the hot mansion is fake.

238
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
 That story is totally made up.

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,400
 And it's most likely the other ones are as well,

240
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,100
 especially since Huffington Post was like,

241
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,900
 "Hey, so many of our readers have written in."

242
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,100
 And that was the end of that.

243
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:25,500
 So, it's really disingenuous because part of being in the paranormal community is trust, right?

244
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,200
 Like, that's part of it, is that when we read these sources, we trust that they're accurate,

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,600
 but this guy is just manufacturing this stuff wholesale.

246
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
 And it really goes to show that a lot of it probably is as well.

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,200
 This guy just happened to get caught.

248
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,600
 So, Nailhead, thanks for exposing that.

249
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,800
 I mean, and as an urban explorer and as a photographer,

250
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,900
 Seth Lawless is-- I'm sure he's pretty good at what he does,

251
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,200
 but as a author of creative nonfiction,

252
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,500
 he's just muddy in the waters for everyone else.

253
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
 And let's go ahead and move on.

254
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,900
 Let's use it as a transition for our next story.

255
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,400
 Because our next story, while not knowably false,

256
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
 it's recently come to light.

257
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,900
 I could-- the only reference I can find to this was back from November of 2019.

258
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,000
 So, super recent story.

259
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,200
 It's fascinating, but it'll be interesting to find out

260
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 if we get any additional information regarding this.

261
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,400
 But let's go ahead.

262
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,900
 We're hot back in the Jason Jalopy.

263
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,000
 We've gotten you a brand new pair of clothes.

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,100
 You're like, "Thanks, Jason.

265
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,000
 I bought you some straight up Dickies pants.

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,900
 We're wiping off our Juggalo face paint,

267
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,300
 buying one more 2L of Fago for each of us.

268
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,000
 I get the orange flavor."

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And we're driving off bumping some ICP to Orlando, Florida.

270
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Now, most of this information I'm getting is from--

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,600
 because I want to give credit to this guy who wrote this awesome article.

272
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 His name is Marcus Loth--

273
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,800
 Loth? I just really can't pronounce names.

274
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,300
 Marcus Loth, he writes for ufounsight.com.

275
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,900
 I've got a ton of stuff from him.

276
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,300
 They seem to be a pretty reputable website.

277
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,800
 But again, this story, because we're only just hearing about it

278
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,700
 and it took place so long ago, it does raise a little red flags.

279
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
 But I find it very, very fascinating.

280
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 So we're going to take off our skeptic hat for a bit.

281
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,100
 We're going to take our baseball cap and turn it backwards.

282
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,500
 Even though we've left Detroit, we still got Detroit inside our hearts.

283
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,900
 And we get to Orlando, Florida.

284
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
 It's April 29th, 1989.

285
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,400
 It's 1130 p.m.

286
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,900
 There's a little boy, little 10-year-old boy laying in bed.

287
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,900
 He goes by the name Roger S.

288
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,800
 It's an interesting pseudonym to use because Roger S.

289
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,200
 is actually hard to find on the internet

290
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,100
 because he keeps wanting to pull up Rogers.

291
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,000
 Rogers.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,700
 Rogers.

293
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 So a detail to make it more difficult to verify this story

294
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,800
 or just a pseudonym that accidentally makes it difficult to track stuff down.

295
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,200
 Who knows?

296
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,500
 But Roger S.

297
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
 10-years-old little boy, he's sleeping.

298
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,400
 Wakes up in the dark of his room.

299
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,000
 But he's not alone.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,400
 Not alone.

301
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,000
 Standing around him in the darkness, he sees four aliens.

302
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,500
 And by all description, they fit the classical gray pattern.

303
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,000
 Little arms, tiny little bodies, short, about four, four and a half feet.

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,100
 But he describes her head as being heart-shaped.

305
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,700
 So it's not the typical giant oval, but basically like a heart.

306
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,700
 So right there, there's kind of an interesting detail,

307
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,500
 something that kind of sets it apart from other alien stars.

308
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,600
 But everything else, no nose, slit mouth, big eyes,

309
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,900
 but the head had a lump in the little valley and then another lump.

310
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,500
 It wasn't the straight old big old egg head of the gray aliens.

311
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,800
 They're standing around him.

312
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
 And their mouths, actually, this was another detail.

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,200
 They wore slits, but they were gold mouths.

314
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
 So the pale skin, gold mouth.

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,800
 So where they doing makeup before they are like,

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 "Oh, we got to get ready for this abduction.

317
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,100
 We're going to look so beautiful."

318
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,600
 "Sally, don't!"

319
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 Beauty school dropouts playing over there.

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,200
 I wonder if they listen to music in UFOs, dude.

321
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,300
 Because think about it, like when you're in a battleship,

322
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,400
 I've never been in a battleship at sea.

323
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,600
 But you know, I've seen like under siege,

324
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,500
 that documentary that came out a long time ago.

325
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,100
 As you're walking along in a battleship, right?

326
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
 I'm sure like you walk by the cook.

327
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,400
 He's like bumping some guns and roses, right?

328
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,700
 Please correct me if I'm wrong.

329
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
 I can't have never been on a battleship.

330
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,000
 But you think like if for an interstellar journey,

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
 or if you're just time traveling or whatever,

332
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
 coming from other dimensions, however you have those get here.

333
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,200
 You don't need to listen to music.

334
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,900
 I actually have a theory that aliens don't have music.

335
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,700
 They don't listen to me.

336
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,600
 They don't know what music is.

337
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,100
 I think music may be a completely human thing.

338
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,700
 You look at all the alien encounters ever.

339
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,600
 Ever.

340
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,700
 There's very rarely, is there any mention of art or drawing

341
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,200
 or anything like that or music?

342
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,200
 So that's kind of creepy to think you can have an entire race.

343
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,700
 No music.

344
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,400
 None.

345
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 Because music is such a part of the human experience.

346
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,700
 Just to the point where we've created an entire industries

347
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,100
 that you can press a button and listen to any music you want at any time.

348
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
 It's like water for humans.

349
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,800
 It's available everywhere.

350
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,400
 To imagine a species that that's not important to is very weird.

351
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,400
 But anyway, so while we're considering those implications,

352
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
 this 10 year old boy is getting abducted.

353
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
 We're standing in the bedroom.

354
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,400
 I'm like, but no, I mean, have you ever heard of an alien hitting the bongos?

355
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
 The kid's like, help me.

356
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,300
 Help me.

357
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,700
 These aliens, they throw him on a hover bed and it starts to kind of hover out of his house.

358
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,300
 Now, I don't know how the layout of his house is.

359
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,200
 I don't know if it's like hovering down the stairs and then going through the foyer.

360
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,800
 But eventually he's in this hover bed and he can't move.

361
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,900
 Because what's the point of having to hover bed if you just kind of get up and hop off of it?

362
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,500
 And the hover beds leaving his house and he sees a saucer in his backyard.

363
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,900
 He blacks out.

364
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,800
 He's inside the ship now and these aliens are standing around him and he can talk to him telepathically.

365
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,900
 The aliens are doing that.

366
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,100
 He's able to talk back back and forth.

367
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,500
 One of the aliens ask, what are you?

368
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 Thanks about it for a second.

369
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,900
 He goes, a human boy.

370
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,700
 Pretty basic, pretty basic way you would explain it.

371
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,000
 You want to say that to another human.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,900
 But when you're talking to an alien, that would be how you would describe yourself.

373
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 Aliens are bringing him on this craft and then he's on this hover bed and he sees a row of panels.

374
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,800
 All these different visual images that are going to be feeding him information here.

375
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,000
 And on one of them, he sees his friend Nancy.

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,100
 Assumably she's asleep as well at her house.

377
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,900
 But in one of these panels, he sees her in the hospital.

378
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,000
 And so he asks, where's my friend Nancy?

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
 Why is she in the hospital?

380
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,600
 And the aliens are just kind of going about their business, but they're communicating with him and they go,

381
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,500
 she's on another ship.

382
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,700
 She's on another ship right now.

383
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,000
 And then we have this interesting quote.

384
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,600
 She will not be reborn because she has been born too many times.

385
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,900
 Long alien fingers just hitting buttons on a control panel.

386
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,000
 Ten year old boy is just sitting there in this UFO trying to digest everything.

387
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
 One, he's been abducted by aliens.

388
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,800
 That's kind of bizarre.

389
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 Two, his friend who should be sleeping in her house is in a hospital somewhere.

390
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,700
 And now he's been hit with this idea that not only is there reincarnation, but there's a limit to it.

391
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,400
 And aliens have some hand or knowledge in reincarnation.

392
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,200
 The alien ship is flying around in the cosmos at this point.

393
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,100
 And the aliens take him on a tour of the ship.

394
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,500
 He's walking through and he's kind of doing this whole like walking through looking in doors and stuff like that.

395
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 He walks past the room.

396
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,800
 These aliens are leading past the room.

397
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:49,300
 He sees what he describes as a 30 year old man just kind of sitting on a table looking at Roger.

398
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,300
 And aliens kind of looking, doing steady in the 30 year old man.

399
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,700
 He moves to the next room.

400
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
 He goes to this one room.

401
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:03,000
 The aliens take off his pajamas and they give him a red suit that Roger puts on and he says,

402
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,600
 when I put it on, it clung to his skin.

403
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,500
 So it didn't matter what size he wore, it was the perfect size for him.

404
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,600
 And he said it was red and it had what appeared to be hieroglyphics.

405
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,500
 Now he's walking around in his cool jumpsuit.

406
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,100
 That's an interesting detail too, because a lot of times when aliens wear clothes,

407
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,800
 they always talk about how form fitting it is.

408
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,600
 Very rarely have we come across alien stories where they're wearing baggy clothes.

409
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,900
 He gets taken to another room.

410
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,500
 There's another panel there and he's showing this specifically on this panel is him sleeping in bed.

411
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,900
 What?

412
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,400
 Just like pre-recorded?

413
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 Did you guys plan this?

414
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
 What is going on?

415
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,400
 And he's watching himself sleep in bed and he sees his dad actually open the bedroom door

416
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 and go in and kind of look, check on him and then go back to sleep.

417
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 And that's when it dawns on Roger.

418
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
 This is happening now.

419
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,400
 He's watching video footage of right now.

420
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,300
 So now he's really, he's like, "Well, where am I?

421
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,300
 Like, am I having an out-of-body experience?"

422
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,300
 Which is something that a child wouldn't be able to process.

423
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:20,300
 I don't think anyone would be able to process any of this information, but am I still there and this is,

424
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
 I'm having an out-of-body experience?

425
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
 Is that a clone?

426
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 Is that a doppelganger?

427
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,300
 Little Roger's sitting in bed and what if the dad walked up and touched it and it,

428
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,300
 that would actually be creepy that dad walks up and he like touches it.

429
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,200
 Two minutes of doppelganger and it's not alive and the dad's like, "Oh no, my son's passed away."

430
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 And then the aliens look at him and look at Roger and be like,

431
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,200
 "Well, that was unfortunate. We can't take you back home now because how would we explain you coming back to life?

432
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
 I don't know."

433
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
 Or maybe, who knows what it was?

434
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 Who knows what it was?

435
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,200
 But yeah, that if their plan was discovered halfway through, it's not like the aliens could show up with the real Roger

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
 and say, "Oh, here you go."

437
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,700
 Like, it would be too late.

438
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,200
 I don't know. That was kind of a grim thought experiment.

439
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:11,100
 He also, then they show him on this panel, video of himself skiing down a mountain in the future.

440
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,100
 He sees himself as an, this is a trippy one.

441
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,100
 And again, we really have to wonder like, what is behind the story?

442
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:27,100
 But he sees himself as an older man, not super old, but you know, older than ten, skiing down a mountain.

443
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:34,000
 He's taken into another room and there are heart-shaped head aliens with gold lips.

444
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
 But these ones are orange.

445
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,800
 They have an orangish tint during your way to that Fego, I bet.

446
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,500
 And he is told that these ones are the female of the species.

447
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,000
 Little orangies, little females.

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,900
 And they begin to ask him questions about how humans procreate and he's like, "Bfff, dude, don't ask me.

449
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,200
 I'm ten years old. I have no idea.

450
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,300
 You abducted the wrong person.

451
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
 I couldn't even begin.

452
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,900
 I don't even know what procreate is."

453
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,600
 And he's like, "Yeah, that's fair enough."

454
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,400
 He then goes into a room which seems to be kind of common in some of these stories.

455
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,300
 It's a room full of animals.

456
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,000
 A zoo, basically.

457
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,900
 And we always hear the same description.

458
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:25,800
 There's a mixture of real-life animals, so bears, badgers, boars, butterflies, baboons, banana slugs,

459
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,900
 and so forth.

460
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,000
 But also animals that he couldn't identify.

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,100
 Does that mean that the animals are alien?

462
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,000
 Does that mean the animals are from Earth that he's just not familiar with?

463
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,100
 We don't know.

464
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,900
 I guess the implication is they're alien.

465
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,700
 And again, since we're already on and if somebody on Earth said, "I saw an animal the other day.

466
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,900
 I've never seen it before. I think it's an alien animal."

467
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,900
 You would be like, "No, dude, you're an idiot. It's a real animal.

468
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,100
 Let's go look at it."

469
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:56,500
 But if you're already on a UFO and you're going to expect to see animals you've never seen before,

470
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,900
 but I've come across this a lot recently.

471
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,800
 People talking about these space zoos aboard UFOs, which would make sense because they're abducting people anyways.

472
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,300
 And again, that goes to show why our cows getting...

473
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,100
 I believe cows are getting mutilated, but I don't think they're UFOs.

474
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,500
 If anything, it's a human colt, some weird colt thing.

475
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,400
 But it doesn't make sense for a UFO to abduct a cow, suck all their blood up, and then throw them back onto the Earth.

476
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,800
 Why not just incinerate them?

477
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,000
 They can cut the cosmos in half with their vehicles.

478
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
 They don't have a heat ray.

479
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
 They don't have a crematory.

480
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,300
 But then they also are keeping all these other animals.

481
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,400
 It doesn't make sense.

482
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,300
 Cattle mutilations on a UFO perspective doesn't make sense.

483
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,500
 But then we come to the most interesting room, which honestly for this story is a bit of a high bar.

484
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,200
 We've got space zoos.

485
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,900
 We got seen into the future.

486
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:52,400
 We got the idea of out-of-body experience versus photocopies of humans being left so abductions can go on undetected.

487
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
 Did the father...

488
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,500
 That's kind of interesting thing too.

489
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,000
 I'm not a parent myself, but did the father wake up in the middle of the night because he just felt something was off?

490
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,700
 Does he always check on his son?

491
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,700
 Or did something prompt him that night to kind of wake up and feel a little uneasy?

492
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,400
 Something in the pit of his stomach that made him go in and check on his son and go, "Oh, everything's okay."

493
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,900
 When his son was really possibly millions of miles away.

494
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,600
 So it's a pretty weird story.

495
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,700
 We got reincarnation.

496
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,300
 We got hieroglyphics, spaces.

497
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:30,600
 But for the creme de la creme, for the coup de gras, whatever French term you want, the aliens really saved the best for last.

498
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
 So we got all this stuff going on.

499
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,700
 The aliens take him to one final room and he sees a bunch of other humans in there.

500
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:44,400
 So we've already seen the 130 year old man sitting on the table, but now we have a bunch of humans sitting in this room.

501
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,300
 And there's a bunch of like hover beds as well.

502
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,500
 But the humans aren't on the hover beds.

503
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:58,200
 The humans are wearing what Roger could identify as NASA uniforms.

504
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:04,200
 And on the hover beds are unconscious aliens.

505
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,500
 And the humans are running experiments on him and taking notes.

506
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:19,300
 Roger is then dropped off at home now being shown the greatest conspiracy possible involving UFOs.

507
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,400
 He's dropped off at home.

508
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,500
 We specifically get this quote from UFO Insight.

509
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:32,300
 The next thing he knew, he was alone in his room, which in normal terms means he woke up.

510
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,600
 Like I said, the earliest we found the story was November 2019.

511
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,800
 And I keep seeing the same phrase.

512
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,700
 It says Roger S.

513
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,200
 This is the story of Roger S.

514
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
 As told by James Greenin.

515
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,900
 But I can't find a James Greenin in UFOology.

516
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,200
 I can't find...

517
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:58,100
 I found a bunch of James Greenins, but I couldn't find a particular James Greenin who's attached to this story in any sort of way.

518
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,500
 So who knows why this story is just getting exposed now?

519
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,200
 Who's James Greenin is?

520
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,100
 Roger S. wants to keep his identity secret.

521
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,900
 I understand.

522
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,800
 I mean, it does make the story harder to verify, but I do understand that.

523
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,500
 So there's a little bit of suspicions.

524
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,900
 There could be a ton of reasons why this is like this.

525
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,100
 And but I think we'll assume for the sake of the story that it's true.

526
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,900
 The narrative is true because I'd rather address some of the stuff there.

527
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,500
 The idea of the aliens having access to the future.

528
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,300
 The idea that the aliens have access to the knowledge of life and death.

529
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,400
 That makes them feel more supernatural than alien.

530
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:52,700
 But the idea that you have these aliens being tied to these abilities I've seen in the future past lives makes you wonder if there's not a more supernatural element than we previously thought.

531
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,300
 To me, though, the more interesting thing is the humans.

532
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:07,200
 Not only are humans working with aliens, but that humans are experimenting on aliens on an alien starship with the alien's knowledge.

533
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,100
 I guess there's always been the suggestion that humans have worked on dead aliens or captured aliens.

534
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:21,000
 And this has always been kind of the X-Files type theory that we found out aliens existed after the crash of Roswell.

535
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:33,500
 The government or members of the shadow government or deep state as it's known today made alliances with the grays or the reptilians or both to have an exchange.

536
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,100
 You give us technology to help win the Cold War or to take over the world.

537
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,300
 And we will give you humans that you can abduct.

538
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,100
 We will not investigate it at all.

539
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,000
 It's a quid pro quo situation.

540
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,400
 We want technology.

541
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,800
 You want humans to experiment on.

542
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,700
 That's always been kind of the main.

543
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:56,600
 I don't know if that's as popular as it used to be, but in the 80s and 90s, when I was really into researching UFO abductions and stuff like that,

544
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,900
 there was always kind of the underlying conspiracy.

545
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,000
 The US government and governments around the world allow people to get abducted in exchange for technology.

546
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,500
 I think it's interesting to think that there may be another layer on that, that humans are not just finding dead alien bodies where they can and working on them.

547
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:24,000
 But the aliens themselves may be kidnapping their own alien people to be experimented on by humans.

548
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,800
 Does that make sense?

549
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:33,300
 Like, is it possible that there is an alien planet where there was some young, heart shaped alien headed kid playing bloke arc?

550
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:40,740
 And then he does his homework, does his space work, lives his life, says goodbye to his friend,

551
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,040
 walks in bloke arc and eats his noodles because they have that everywhere.

552
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:57,240
 And then goes to bed and then he wakes up and there's four six foot tall humans standing around his bed in uniforms with a weird emblem on it.

553
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,440
 And the next thing he knows, he's being pulled around the ship.

554
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:15,740
 You see some of his fellow aliens there, but he's mostly being worked on by these tall, pale creatures with small heads and beady little eyes.

555
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,440
 I find that idea fascinating.

556
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,740
 That they may not just be abducting us, we may be abducting them.

557
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:32,140
 And both are working together for whatever means, whatever the end result is, both are working together.

558
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,440
 And we're just the experiments.

559
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:44,440
 We're all just the pawns in this game of the powerful of the alien planet and the powerful of Earth.

560
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,140
 And if that's true, it's kind of interesting.

561
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:57,940
 It's kind of an interesting thing because maybe it's not us versus the elite and their alien allies.

562
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:12,240
 Maybe it's us and a planet full of alien us's workers and dreamers and lovers, just of a different species from a different planet

563
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:22,740
 that are also being preyed upon by their corrupt government who made a deal with another corrupt government thousands of light years away.

564
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,440
 Because if that's the case, then we have allies.

565
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,140
 We have friends.

566
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:41,040
 Someday will we not be fighting an alien race, but be allied with an alien race to overthrow both of our systems of tyranny.

567
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,740
 Who knows?

568
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,540
 But it's an interesting spin on the idea of the alien brotherhood.

569
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:55,140
 We're not going to join some galactic federation and become just a cog in the machine.

570
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:07,240
 We're going to team up with other oppressed peoples across the galaxy and overthrow those governments that thought we were just there as specimens.

571
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,640
 An interesting theory that may simply be based on the dream of a 10-year-old boy.

572
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:22,640
 But it could be the start of a beautiful friendship.

573
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,540
