1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 What would you do if one day you went diving into a lake with your scuba gear, expecting

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,760
 to find some clams, or maybe a mermaid?

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:16,000
 Instead you find yourself face to face with a floating ghost.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,160
 And then we traveled to Southern California to get a little skiing in.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,760
 Put those big pieces of wood on your feet, snap on them snow goggles, and get ready

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,080
 to go down a mountain full of excitement, danger, and cursed boots filled with the flesh of rotting

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
 humans.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,240
 This is a weird episode, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:51,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,160
 I hope you guys had an excellent Halloween.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,720
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover, so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,240
 of our legacy Patreon supporters.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,080
 Everyone give it up for S.E.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
 Woohoo!

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
 Yeah, come on in, S.E.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,920
 He's walking on into Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,800
 He's got all of his recreational gear.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,000
 This is a activities episode.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,200
 Both of these stories I didn't plan it this way.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,160
 Both of these stories are about living large and being in charge in very non-human, safe

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
 environments.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,760
 People love doing stuff, it puzzles me.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,800
 White people love spending time in the water, because that's where people die, like all

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,720
 the time.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,120
 And then people also go up mountains and ski, which is also weird to me because snow sucks.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,800
 So we're going to take a look at some hostile environments to humans.

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
 And S.E.

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,760
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot for this episode.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,120
 You guys can't to worry the Patreon, I totally understand.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,400
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

33
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
 That helps out so much.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 It really, really does.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,080
 S.E., let's go ahead and get this adventure started.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,560
 I'm going to toss you the hair hang glider.

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
 Let's jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,760
 We're going to glide all the way out to Lake Superior.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:14,760
 Now I'm not an outdoorsy guy myself.

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 I mean, I leave my house, right?

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,040
 I'm not a hermit.

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,240
 I do leave my house.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:28,280
 I don't mind being outdoors, but I don't understand why people do stuff, outdoors stuff.

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,160
 I honestly, like, it's not fun to me.

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,680
 Like walking through a city is fine, but replace the city with the forest?

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
 No.

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,800
 I don't walk in the forest.

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,520
 I might walk in the desert if I was ever given the opportunity to be like, "Hey Jason, you

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,200
 want to hang out in the desert with me?"

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,440
 Yeah, I'd probably do that.

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,960
 Because like, it's for stuff.

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,320
 Like you can see, Jason, are you suffering from a stroke or something?

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,760
 This is the most incoherent episode you've ever had.

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,560
 And I've listened to all of them.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
 You can, when you're in the middle of a desert, you can see in all directions.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,440
 You can go, "Oh lookit, that's all flat and stuff."

57
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,560
 And then there's some mountains way over there.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,000
 You can't get snuck up on.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
 There's no like bobcats.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,840
 Maybe there's a lynx up in the hills, but I'm not there.

61
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
 Like I'm in the middle of the desert.

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
 Got a bunch of water, right?

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,240
 I know how to prepare.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
 You get some water.

65
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
 You get some clothes.

66
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,520
 But you also have to have, you have to have warm clothes for night.

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,400
 Otherwise you'll freeze to death.

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,640
 But in the daytime, you just wear your shorts.

69
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,680
 Jason, you are so horribly unprepared and you might be having a stroke as well.

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,840
 Because none of this is making any sense.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
 None of this is making sense.

72
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
 I thought we were going to Lake Superior.

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,120
 Why are you talking about walking through the desert?

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,680
 You would wear, I don't think I'd be in shorts in the middle of the desert.

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
 You're like, "Oh, are you still on the desert thing?"

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,400
 I don't think I'd wear shorts in the middle of the desert because I'd get sunburned and

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,040
 that would be miserable.

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,440
 But like you wear pants.

79
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,120
 You wear like regular human clothes and then you walk and then it gets super cold at night.

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
 So then you got to put on like a jacket so you don't freeze to death.

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
 And then the next morning you take your jacket off.

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,600
 You try to run your waist.

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,080
 You're just sweating so much.

84
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,760
 Your legs can see we're skinny.

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
 They're all sweaty.

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,960
 And then you just walk out of the desert like easy peasy.

87
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,200
 Forest, no.

88
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,720
 Not into hiking through forest, not into hiking through wilderness.

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,120
 So when we're going to take a look at some activities this episode, and again I didn't

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
 plan it this way.

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,320
 Just when I was doing the intro I go, "Oh, this is a themed episode!

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,000
 Jason Stroke the episode!"

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,200
 I thought, "Why would you want to go diving?

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 Why would you want to..."

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,720
 I don't even understand why people go boating or waterskiing or really anything because

96
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,440
 the water is so hostile.

97
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,560
 That's something that for generations people have looked at and go, "Uh-uh, that's super

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
 dangerous."

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,520
 And then other people do it all the time.

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,000
 I live next to a giant river and like every summer people are drowning and I'm like, "No

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 thanks, guys.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,280
 I'm standing in the middle of the desert and reading the newspaper and I'm like, "Tisk,

103
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 tisk, tisk."

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,760
 It should have been more safe and I... it's just awful, right?

105
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,600
 But anyways the reason why I'm talking about this is we're going to meet some divers.

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,640
 We're currently on the shores of Lake Superior and there are these dudes putting on like

107
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
 scuba gear.

108
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
 They got their wetsuits.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,680
 Zip, zip them up.

110
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
 Put on their fins and things.

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,120
 And then they're jumping into the water and we're like, "Hey guys, what are you doing?

112
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 Why are you jumping into the water?"

113
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,880
 Like, "Don't you know how dangerous it is?

114
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,040
 Don't you know how dangerous it is to be in the water?"

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,400
 They're like, "Yeah, that's why we're wearing scuba suits, you idiot."

116
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 So we don't freeze to death and we can breathe underwater in this stuff.

117
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,000
 They're jumping in the water, splashing around and I go, "Those brave men and women who just

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,840
 jumped into the water, they are not here just to swim in the most dangerous environment on

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 the planet."

120
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 No.

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
 They're on the lookout.

122
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,440
 Well, they also do want to swim.

123
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 They love diving.

124
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,040
 But they're also searching for a sunken boat.

125
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,720
 People have been looking for this boat for decades.

126
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
 Will they be the ones to find it?

127
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,120
 I want to give a shout out to Brandon Schloeb.

128
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,120
 He's one of our newest Patreon supporters and he recommended this story.

129
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,440
 This is a really cool one.

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,640
 Thank you, Brandon, for sending this over.

131
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,560
 Let's go back to early December 1927.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
 We're on Lake Superior.

133
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,200
 We're standing on the shoreline.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,040
 And currently there is this boat known as the SS Cam Loops.

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,200
 It's a Canadian lake freighter.

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,120
 They're loading up some final goods.

137
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,720
 Basically, the winter in this area is so bad that you want to get as many runs in, supply

138
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,360
 runs in before the winter storms make it impossible.

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,600
 So you had all of these ships trying to get their last loads of goods to where they're

140
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 supposed to go.

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,320
 They're shipping stuff across Lake Superior from the United States into Canada.

142
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,440
 I don't know why they didn't just use trains.

143
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
 I'm sure they did use those as well.

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,720
 They also were using boats and stuff.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,800
 So the SS Cam Loops, they're loading stuff up.

146
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
 They're like, "Get that tar up on this boat."

147
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
 And they're like, "Yes, Captain."

148
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
 And they're like throwing tar.

149
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
 They're just throwing tar-wheeling millies.

150
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
 Like, "No, you're supposed to keep leaving in the boxes, you buffoons."

151
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,080
 This SS Cam Loops, they'd been running this circuit for quite a while.

152
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
 So they're used to this.

153
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,600
 And they're really trying to get in before winter gets bad.

154
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,160
 At this particular time, December 1927, it's loaded with a bunch of industrial gear, as

155
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,760
 well as farm supplies, shoes.

156
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,640
 They had a whole bunch of shoes on there.

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,200
 So someone really was like, "Ah, before winter it's...

158
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,840
 I have horrible foot fetish.

159
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,640
 Then I need to have my shoes to smell used women's shoes.

160
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,640
 I'll buy them by the ton."

161
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,680
 SS Cam Loops is like, "We'll get them there.

162
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
 You freak.

163
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,320
 We'll get them over to you as soon as possible."

164
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,200
 They have a bunch of shoes.

165
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 They have food.

166
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,160
 They have a crew of about 22 people on board.

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,200
 We're waving goodbye as they're steaming off.

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,440
 Toot toot.

169
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,680
 It's sailing away, steaming away across Lake Superior.

170
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,640
 Now there were a lot of boats trying to make these final runs, and all of them were not

171
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:20,120
 prepared for a horrible winter storm that just seemed to appear out of nowhere.

172
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,640
 What we see happen is all of the other boats that were out on Lake Superior at this time

173
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,520
 get to their destination, except for the SS Cam Loops.

174
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,800
 And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize what happened.

175
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,640
 The boat must have gone down in the storm.

176
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,480
 So on December 12th, just a couple days after the last sighting of the Cam Loops, a search

177
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,880
 begins.

178
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,440
 Can't find anything.

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,400
 They can't find any wreckage of the boat, but again you have to assume that it went down.

180
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,440
 And this search continues for another 10 days.

181
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,920
 They're really trying to find this boat.

182
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,720
 And also, you know, you're looking for survivors.

183
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,960
 You figure maybe some people got stranded on an island.

184
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,040
 Maybe some people were floating around in little dinghies.

185
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,240
 But they can't find anything.

186
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,000
 No survivors, no boat, no wreckage either.

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,440
 The search would have continued on longer, but winter got too bad, which is what they

188
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
 knew was going to happen, and they had to stop searching.

189
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,720
 It's not until April 1928 that they begin searching again for the wreckage and the crew

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,160
 of the SS Cam Loops.

191
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,200
 Still, they don't find anything.

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
 They have no idea where the ship went down.

193
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,840
 But the next month, in May, bodies begin to wash up.

194
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,800
 You'd have fishermen out there on their little fishing barge, and they're like "Arrrr, matey,"

195
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,600
 and they're like wheeling up big old bags of fish, and there'd be a dude in it.

196
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,920
 Fishermen started finding bodies floating around.

197
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,520
 Like, "Nobody eat this batch of fish!

198
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,840
 We found a human in it!"

199
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,320
 They begin finding these bodies, and they go "Well, these have to be the bodies from

200
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,080
 the Cam Loops.

201
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,000
 Where else would we find a bunch of bodies floating around?"

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,520
 There was no other boat that had gone down recently.

203
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:22,240
 December 1928, so now we're a full year later, on the opposite side, so the last place of

204
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,560
 the SS Cam Loops that we knew its location, it was headed towards Isle Royale, which is

205
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,220
 in the northwest of Lake Superior.

206
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,960
 On the opposite side of the lake, on the eastern shore of Lake Superior, there's a trapper

207
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,320
 working the forest, and he finds a message in a bottle.

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,680
 A little rolled up piece of paper stuck in a bottle, pulls it out and reads it.

209
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,840
 It's from a woman named Alice Betridge.

210
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,720
 She had worked on the SS Cam Loops.

211
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:04,080
 She leaves a note that says "I am the last one alive, freezing and starving to death

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,000
 on Isle Royale in Lake Superior.

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,840
 I just want mom and dad to know my fate."

214
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,120
 So now we can kind of figure out where the boat went down.

215
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,840
 It must have reached, or at least gotten near Isle Royale.

216
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:33,640
 As you had people stranded on that island, but they all died.

217
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,680
 Some must have went down with the boat, some must have gotten to the island, but they were

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,800
 not found during these search efforts.

219
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,600
 We don't know exactly how long she lived.

220
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,760
 I'm freezing and starving to death on Isle Royale.

221
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,800
 The boat went down between December 5th and December 7th, that's kind of what they estimated.

222
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
 I read a couple different.

223
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,040
 I read a couple different accounts, but so it had only been, they started searching

224
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,240
 the area December 12th.

225
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,920
 So she'd only been there for five days.

226
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,680
 You can't really starve to death in five days.

227
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,880
 You can definitely freeze to death in less than five days, but terrible tragic.

228
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
 She just wanted her mom and dad to know her fate.

229
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
 Quite sad.

230
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,240
 So now they know where the boat went down, and the search though continues.

231
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,220
 People want to know why the boat went down.

232
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
 These boats are built.

233
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,040
 I mean, they shouldn't be out in the dead of winter.

234
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,640
 It's just so bad.

235
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 But every other boat made their destination, why did the SS Cam Loops sink?

236
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,120
 And then it also just kind of became a hobby, right?

237
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,720
 It was a lost ship on Lake Superior.

238
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,360
 People tried looking for it.

239
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,280
 So that brings us to August 21st, 1977.

240
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,400
 Now we're standing on the beach and we're watching this crew of divers walk out into the water.

241
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,600
 These are a group of sport divers who are trying to find the SS Cam Loops.

242
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,500
 They actually have like a grid set up and they're like searching areas over time.

243
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,260
 They found no trace of it, but they do.

244
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,020
 On August 21st, 1977, they do find it.

245
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,100
 It's northwest of Isle Royale.

246
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,140
 It's now named Cam Loops Point.

247
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,020
 And that boat still sits down there.

248
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,100
 It's about 260 feet down.

249
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,060
 It's at the bottom of an underwater cliff.

250
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,280
 And you can get your scuba gear and you can go die for it right now, right now in the

251
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
 beginning of November.

252
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
 Probably not recommended.

253
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,440
 I'm sure it's super cold, but you can go die for it.

254
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600
 It's 260 feet down.

255
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,440
 And they said you can see the boat just sitting there.

256
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,480
 And there is cargo that poor man's precious fetish shoes are still down there.

257
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:45,560
 There's cargo like containers, like big crates strewn across the lake bed.

258
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:53,060
 And there's also, you can swim into the boat and you can see cargo there as well.

259
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,160
 But there's also something else you can see.

260
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,700
 Some people say it's a ghost or the rotting corpse of a man.

261
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:10,240
 And the cold temperatures of the lake have preserved this body fairly well over the years.

262
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
 They call him old whitey.

263
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,080
 And it's this corpse of a man with white hair.

264
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,600
 And he floats around the boat.

265
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,440
 Now the first accounts had him floating around the engine room.

266
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,120
 There's just this corpse kind of floating there.

267
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,720
 The divers would be like pushing him into the other divers.

268
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,200
 He's like, "I think fast."

269
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,600
 You would swim around because you can swim through the boat.

270
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,000
 You would see this corpse floating around the engine room.

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,640
 But subsequent diving missions, and then just not really missions, just people, "Hey, you

272
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,720
 want to have a fun afternoon?

273
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,800
 Let's go see that floating corpse."

274
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,400
 Other people would dive down to the cam loops and the body would be in different parts of

275
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,560
 the boat.

276
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,840
 So this legend started.

277
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,640
 They go, "Is old whitey down there still taking care of the old SS cam loops?"

278
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,400
 He's floating around the captain's quarters.

279
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 He's floating around the kitchen.

280
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
 He's making food.

281
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
 He's serving up clams.

282
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,240
 Sometimes you'll find him in the bunk room.

283
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,840
 He'll be floating among all the beds.

284
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,560
 And so it started this kind of eerie story where as a skeptic would go, "Well, yeah,

285
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,240
 he's moving around the boat because of the currents of the water.

286
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,840
 They're obviously moving him from room to room."

287
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,640
 But then you also get to the point where there is kind of this eeriness to it because it's

288
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:48,200
 almost as if he's continuing to exist on the ship, trapped in between a ghost form and

289
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,120
 a physical form.

290
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,440
 The body's not decaying normally, but is his ghost still in it somehow?

291
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,400
 I mean, it's most likely just the currents floating him around.

292
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,120
 But yeah, they say when you go down there, you don't know where he's going to be.

293
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,680
 He'll just be milling about the ship.

294
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,000
 And they've only recovered nine bodies apparently of the 22.

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,200
 And then we know old whitey's down there floating around.

296
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,440
 I don't even think they ever recovered the body of Alice, the girl on Isle Royale.

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
 So who knows what happened to her?

298
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,280
 And to this day, they don't know what caused the boat to sink.

299
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,280
 When they go down there and they look at it, there's not a definitive cause.

300
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
 It's not cracked in half.

301
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,120
 There's not cracking suction cup marks on the side of it.

302
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,920
 They don't know.

303
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,320
 But if you're in the area or if you have a lot of money, you can fly out to the area

304
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,240
 and go diving and maybe visit old whitey yourself floating around.

305
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,160
 I would say, yeah, the most likely answer it is the currents of the lake moving him around.

306
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,280
 But they said, yeah, people have said they've gone down there and it looks like he's just

307
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,040
 laying in bed.

308
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
 Just laying there.

309
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,800
 And then other times you go down there and he's floating around the engine room again.

310
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,520
 So, S-E, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter.

311
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,640
 We are leaving behind Lake Superior.

312
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,680
 Take us all the way out to Southern California.

313
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:28,240
 This story is another recommendation from a longtime supporter of Dead Rabbit Radio,

314
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,240
 Ampus Allen.

315
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,640
 Ampus Allen sent us a ton of stuff over the years.

316
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,000
 And this one is equally weird.

317
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,720
 It makes you really ask the question, how do curses work?

318
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 Let's take a look at this.

319
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,240
 This is a really interesting one.

320
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,000
 Greg used to work at a ski rental store, ski rental location.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,880
 Somewhere in Southern California, it seems to be, wasn't able to get a specific location,

322
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,680
 but it seems to be near the San Bernardino Mountains.

323
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,640
 There's this ski rental store.

324
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,800
 Greg's working at the ski resort and a young woman walks in with a pair of ski boots.

325
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,160
 She sets them on the desk.

326
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,360
 She goes, you won't believe what happened.

327
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,680
 You will not believe what happened.

328
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,240
 She starts telling this story and Greg's just like, okay, I guess that's possible, right?

329
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
 Sure, anything can happen on the mountain.

330
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,680
 But after the customer leaves, one of Greg's coworkers says, yep, that's kind of what I

331
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,200
 expected when they checked out these boots.

332
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,160
 Co-worker takes the boots away and puts them in the back room.

333
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,800
 Greg's like, wait, what do you mean?

334
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,720
 That's what you expected was going to happen.

335
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,680
 The coworker goes, those boots, those boots are cursed.

336
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,480
 So this is the story that was told to Greg.

337
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,720
 Back in the 1980s, it was ski season and everyone was coming out to go skiing.

338
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,120
 And this first man definitely did go to Snow Valley in the San Bernardino Mountains.

339
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,520
 We know that for sure.

340
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,080
 This guy comes in and he rents out an entire set of snow gear.

341
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,160
 So he got the skis, he got the boots, all that stuff.

342
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,080
 And he's getting ready to go skiing.

343
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:22,160
 It's a rental place, so he pays the money and then he'll bring them back.

344
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,520
 But he doesn't bring them back on time.

345
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,720
 And then the workers at the shop, because they're waiting to, it's kind of how rentals

346
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
 work, right?

347
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 You're supposed to get your gear back.

348
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
 You can rent to someone else.

349
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,240
 They learn that the guy who rented out all that gear has gone missing.

350
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,760
 They don't think it's, he wanted the gear he took at home.

351
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,000
 They realize he went up on the mountain and something bad must have happened.

352
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,800
 So they're probably never going to see that gear again.

353
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:58,040
 The next year, month of April, a sheriff's deputy pulls up outside the ski rental place

354
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,600
 and he walks in and drops off the rented gear.

355
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 What?

356
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,000
 This stuff went missing last year.

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,560
 The cop says, "Yeah, we found the guy."

358
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,200
 What it looks like is he was up on the mountain and a fog bank rolled in and he didn't know

359
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
 where he was going.

360
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 He was lost.

361
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,240
 They ended up skiing off a cliff.

362
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,600
 Here's your boots back.

363
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,160
 And when the officer dropped the boots off, the employees at the time they looked at him

364
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,600
 and they go, "Dude, this is super creepy."

365
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,320
 The last time these boots were on was they were on a dead person.

366
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,080
 And they also noticed it appeared to be, if you looked in the boots, you could see little

367
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,320
 bits of quickly thawing pieces of flesh stuck to the sides of these boots.

368
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
 Now not a lot.

369
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,520
 It didn't look like a straight up hot dog sleeve, but there was enough to make you uncomfortable

370
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,680
 with any amount of human flesh.

371
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,760
 Rotting in a pair of boots is too much, but they go, "Should we just throw these away?"

372
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,280
 And the boss in typical Scrooge McDuck fashion goes, "Absolutely not.

373
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,200
 We're gonna keep those boots."

374
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,120
 But throw them in the sump pile.

375
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,400
 Apparently that's a thing.

376
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,800
 The sump pile is all the gear that's full of rotting flesh.

377
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,840
 It's all the gear that's not the best gear you throw it in the back.

378
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,160
 So if it ever gets so busy we run out of stuff, we'll start going into the sump pile and renting

379
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 stuff out of there.

380
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
 So whatever.

381
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,200
 Boss wants us to do that.

382
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,160
 What are the chances of these boots ever leaving the place again?

383
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,080
 They throw them in the sump pile.

384
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,000
 A year later, it's Easter break.

385
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,640
 The ski rental store business is booming.

386
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,760
 Everyone's swinging by the ski rental shop.

387
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,600
 They actually rent out all of their boots.

388
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,560
 They're now pulling boots out of the sump pile.

389
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,320
 And this guy gets the boots, rents some poles, takes off.

390
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,440
 Doesn't return the gear.

391
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:09,560
 The next day, Mountain Ambulance Squad swings by the ski rental store.

392
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,160
 They drop off the poles that he rented, all of the stuff he rented, and the boots drop

393
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,680
 them on the counter and say, "Hey, yeah.

394
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,960
 Guy couldn't return them himself.

395
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,440
 So we're returning them for you."

396
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,520
 And everyone's like, "Not everyone knew about the decaying flesh.

397
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,240
 Obviously the people that worked there the year before would remember this story about

398
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,840
 the boots that had previously been on a dead body for months."

399
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
 The new hires would just be like, "It's just a pair of boots, but this is how this legend

400
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
 starts."

401
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,800
 You see, the old-timers remember this stuff, and they remember when Mountain Ambulance Squad

402
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,480
 showed up, and they said, "Hey, this guy, he was skiing down the hill, and he completely

403
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,840
 blew out his ACL.

404
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
 Massive knee injury."

405
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
 But he's live.

406
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,000
 He's totally fine, but he's probably not going to go to the hospital.

407
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
 He may never walk again.

408
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
 He may walk with a cane.

409
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,280
 It's a pretty serious injury.

410
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:13,080
 Now, the people at the ski rental store, they wanted to test the boots to see was there

411
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,400
 something defective about the boots that could have caused that injury.

412
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
 They did.

413
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,280
 They tested the boots out, and there was no structural flaw.

414
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,680
 There was no breaking of the boot.

415
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,880
 The boot was perfectly fine.

416
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,840
 In fact, if you wanted to, you could rent the boot out again.

417
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,320
 But they figured this boot was cursed.

418
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,720
 I mean, at this point, what else could you think?

419
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,400
 This boot is probably cursed.

420
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,240
 Anyone who has this boot on, something bad's going to happen to them.

421
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,800
 But they start to think that there's something wrong with these boots.

422
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,120
 Like, not structurally, we tested that.

423
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,240
 You had a man die in them, they were stuck on his feet for months, and now you have another

424
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,880
 guy freak accident blows out his knee.

425
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,600
 Now they're sitting back here, and the boss is like, "Put them in the sump pile.

426
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,040
 Put them in the sump pile.

427
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,320
 I don't want to hear nothing about curses or anything like that.

428
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,640
 I just want to hear about money.

429
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,560
 I want to hear about coins falling in my money bin."

430
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,840
 So they put the boots back in the sump pile, and they're like, "Okay, this just has to

431
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,040
 be a weird coincidence."

432
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
 Right?

433
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,640
 This has to be weird.

434
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,000
 The next year, now Greg is working at the rental store.

435
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,920
 Greg's here now.

436
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,720
 And a young woman walks in with the boots.

437
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,800
 Thomp puts them on the counter, and she's like, "I'm sorry, I know we were supposed to return

438
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,000
 these yesterday, but we couldn't.

439
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,160
 We couldn't return them."

440
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,960
 My boyfriend rented these boots from me yesterday, along with some other gear.

441
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,840
 And we were up there skiing on the mountain.

442
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,760
 And then for whatever reason, he decided--this is kind of hilarious--he skis down a mountain,

443
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,800
 apparently, but then halfway down or something, he decides to take a toboggan the rest of

444
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 the way.

445
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:16,960
 He decided to take off his skis and toboggan down a mountain, and got in an accident.

446
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,520
 So Mountain Squad had to come and help him out, but things are just too crazy, so we

447
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,680
 didn't return his gear.

448
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
 But here you go.

449
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,840
 I hope it's not too much of a cost to have him for an extra day.

450
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,560
 Greg's just like, "Oh yeah, sometimes it happens, people get injured."

451
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,040
 And he's just processing it as a normal return.

452
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,480
 But his coworker, after the young woman leaves, the coworker tells Greg, "Those aren't any

453
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,920
 ordinary boots."

454
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,920
 These boots have a history.

455
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,640
 And then he tells Greg the story of the boots.

456
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,140
 Cursed items.

457
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,880
 Cursed items, cursed objects.

458
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,600
 Not only are they a mainstay of the world of the paranormal, they're honestly a mainstay

459
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
 of world religions.

460
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:14,080
 Most major religions talk about curses and cursed items and protection from curses.

461
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,120
 It is pretty much a given in those contexts, in a religious context and in a paranormal

462
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
 context.

463
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,560
 So it's not out of the ordinary to have an object which could be cursed.

464
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,640
 Just yesterday we talked about a possibly haunted statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

465
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,200
 And if that can happen, definitely some ski boots that came off a factory assembly line

466
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,720
 could be cursed.

467
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,000
 But what I love about the story, and Ampus Allum, thanks for sending it over, what I

468
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,440
 love about the story is that it also shows us something that I think we have all kind

469
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:54,080
 of believed anyways, is that curses diminish over time.

470
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:03,200
 And that's a really interesting thing because it makes it more believable.

471
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,880
 It makes it more believable.

472
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,240
 If when you went outside, you saw a caveman ghost.

473
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,480
 That would be proof that ghosts exist anyways.

474
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,400
 But the big question is, how can we don't see ghosts pre, say, late, late Roman era,

475
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,080
 Renaissance era, even that's actually pretty old.

476
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,240
 How can we don't normally see ghosts that predate Elizabethan times or Native American

477
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,680
 times in America?

478
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,880
 And the answer is, is because whatever is causing the ghostly activity diminishes over

479
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 a time.

480
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,240
 Here's the thing, because we know in the real world, forget the world of the paranormal,

481
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,800
 we know energy dissipates over time.

482
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,200
 That is just a scientific fact.

483
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,680
 Things wear out.

484
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,800
 So if cursed items, if something was cursed in 200 BC and it's still cursed today, well

485
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,480
 then it seems more like it's an urban legend.

486
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:12,160
 It would seem less believable because now it's actually disobeying the laws of thermodynamics.

487
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,680
 I know I might be losing the plot on this one, but you know what I mean?

488
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,600
 It makes sense that a curse would diminish because everything diminishes over time.

489
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,480
 Suns burn out.

490
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,880
 So if you had curses that could potentially last longer than the universe, then it does

491
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,920
 seem more ridiculous if that makes sense.

492
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,680
 The fact that it's also obeying laws that we know govern real world things.

493
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,080
 If you bounce a ball on the ground, it will only bounce so many times by itself until

494
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,620
 it stops bouncing, until all that energy is dissipated and the bounces get smaller and

495
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,600
 smaller and then it starts rolling around.

496
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,280
 That's a scientific fact.

497
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,920
 So the fact that you can have these boots, that we don't know the origin of these boots,

498
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,440
 and again this story could totally be made up.

499
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,760
 This could have been creepypasta, someone posted online.

500
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,560
 And if that's the case, it's Ampus Allen's fault for sending it to me.

501
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
 No, just joking.

502
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,800
 It could be fake, right?

503
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,840
 This whole story could be fake.

504
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,340
 But assuming it's true, we don't know who had the boots before the dead man.

505
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,680
 We don't know if the dead man cursed the boots because I have two theories.

506
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:29,560
 One that the boots were cursed and that's what killed the man in the first place.

507
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,720
 There was some sort of cur...

508
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,160
 Like someone could have been wearing those boots and they got their heart broken, right?

509
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,600
 Their girlfriend broke up with them.

510
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,320
 They're like, "Are you sure you want to leave me?

511
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,640
 Look at these great boots I have.

512
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,960
 You can't leave a man in ski boots like this."

513
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,160
 And she's like, "It's over, Johnny."

514
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
 You have that possibility.

515
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:52,040
 You have the possibility that the boots were cursed and they killed the man.

516
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,280
 They cursed the man, would probably be a better way to put it.

517
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,240
 They cursed the man, the first man, who skied off a cliff and died.

518
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:08,800
 And then the second person who got the boots, the energy was less than it was before.

519
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,960
 And so when he had the boots on, he suffered a very serious injury, but he didn't die.

520
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,120
 And then when the third man had the boots on, the energy is even less, so he doesn't

521
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
 die.

522
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,720
 He doesn't even have a serious injury.

523
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,160
 He just has a minor injury that makes him look like a buffoon and his girlfriend has

524
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,240
 to turn in his ski gear, because he can't do it himself.

525
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
 We have that possibility.

526
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:40,120
 We also have the possibility that the curse started with the first man who died in them.

527
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
 He was skiing down.

528
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,280
 He skied off a cliff.

529
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
 He did get disoriented.

530
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,000
 It wasn't super spooky fog.

531
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,840
 It was just regular fog.

532
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,880
 He couldn't see where he was going.

533
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 He skied off a cliff.

534
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
 He died.

535
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 Did he die instantly?

536
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,800
 I mean, let's get grim, right?

537
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,080
 Did he die instantly or was he laying at the bottom of that cliff?

538
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:08,280
 Freezing a death and his energy, like as he's laying there in agony.

539
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,880
 Freezing a death isn't actually that bad of a way to go, but as he's blissfully dying

540
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,280
 as he's freezing a death, and who knows what his last regrets were, who knows what was

541
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:28,000
 going through his mind, basically his energy goes into the gear that he has.

542
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,600
 So the next person who gets those boots gets pretty seriously injured, and the person after

543
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,560
 that it's a minor injury.

544
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,320
 And then after that, you know, this is one of those stories that, let's say they rented

545
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,440
 him out again the next year, because it just gets so busy they got to rent him out.

546
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,360
 Anything that happened to that guy in those boots who rents him out the next year, anything,

547
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,760
 a hangnail, his cat runs away, like at that point it does start to go in urban legend

548
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 territory.

549
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,080
 Any bad thing that happens to him, the ski rental staff will attribute to the curse

550
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,120
 of the boots.

551
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,080
 But it would definitely diminish over, or at least that's what it looks like.

552
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,240
 It diminishes each time you wear the boots.

553
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,280
 But it's a fascinating story because it does make us take a look at curses and yes, they

554
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:19,120
 most likely do diminish over time.

555
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,000
 But even if you believed that, which I do, and this is a cool story because it's something

556
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,960
 that I personally believe, right?

557
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,040
 Even if you did believe that, would you ski in those boots?

558
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,720
 Would you take that chance?

559
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,280
 This is like, I buy haunted dolls all the time, haunted paintings and stuff like that,

560
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:49,240
 but I don't take them at the top of mountains and go down as fast as I can.

561
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,880
 That's where these boots were designed for.

562
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,120
 Would you rent these boots to go skiing?

563
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
 Would you specify?

564
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,280
 I want the boots with the most human flesh still attached to them.

565
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,480
 They cleaned the flesh off.

566
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,280
 It wasn't that other people were checking these out and they were like, "What's that

567
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
 smell?"

568
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
 I don't know whatever, I'll go skiing.

569
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,560
 They cleaned them out as best as they could, but would you wear boots that a dead man wore

570
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,480
 when he died?

571
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,480
 Ski boots.

572
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,680
 Cowboy boots would be kind of dope, like if someone's like, "Jesse James died in these

573
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,360
 boots, he was shot right in the belly.

574
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,840
 He was wearing these boots."

575
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,120
 I'd be like, "Let me try them on."

576
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,400
 I would, but I wouldn't then go, "Take me to your highest peak, sir.

577
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,280
 Take me to the highest point in this western town.

578
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,840
 I'm going to see how fast I can go down it."

579
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,240
 There's a certain point where you are just asking for it.

580
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,520
 But the people who were renting these boots out, they weren't asking for it.

581
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,240
 They were almost just guinea pigs.

582
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,840
 Let's see what happens when we put these boots on.

583
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,080
 After the second person got seriously injured, they should have gotten rid of them.

584
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,440
 Whether you believe in curses or not is just bad business.

585
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,120
 It's bad business to have items that may or may not be crippling people or killing them

586
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,200
 for life, but the third person just fell off a toboggan.

587
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,880
 An interesting story, and I really like it when we can look at the world of science and

588
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
 compare that to the world of the paranormal.

589
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:22,160
 I do believe curses dissipate over time, but even believing that, no.

590
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,040
 I would not put these boots on under any circumstance.

591
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,840
 I would not put these boots on and go skiing or tobogganing or even just running down the

592
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,240
 mountain.

593
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:42,280
 Because while I do believe that curses dissipate over time, it's just the theory.
