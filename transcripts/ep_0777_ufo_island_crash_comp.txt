 One man goes all out for the ultimate cosplay and
 Then we join a group of stranded sailors on a rocky island in the middle of nowhere
 They thought they were gonna starve to death on this deserted island and that would have happened
 If it hadn't been for a crashed UFO today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 *Music*
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carbner and I'm gonna cut to the chase here guys
 Let me give you a little bit of advice
 Life is too short
 To work a job
 You don't like
 I'm gonna say that again because a lot of people need to hear this. Life is too short to work a job
 You don't like if you're not being fulfilled by your job if it's not your calling if you don't have a passion for it
 Why are you doing it?
 I know this young woman her name's Tiana. She's 16 years old. I've known her since she was 10
 She hates her job
 And I realized when I was talking to this young woman, there's a fallacy in life
 That you're supposed to work jobs you hate. It's okay to work jobs you hate as long as you're making money
 Putting food on the table. It's okay, and I say no to that. I
 Say you need to work a job you enjoy at the very least a job you enjoy
 So many of us work jobs that we don't like have you ever been going to work and think I hope I get in a car accident today
 Because then I won't have to go to work
 That's a sign you need to change your job and it is this lie
 That society tells us and that we tell ourselves that we need to work crummy jobs now
 There is a caveat to that one of my favorite movies transformers dark of the moon transformers 3
 There's a scene in it where John Malkovich tells Shia LaBeouf and this is this is an important caveat
 Shia LaBeouf is about to get a job in a mail room John Malkovich has this company
 John Malkovich says I know this isn't the job you want you want the job after this
 But you need to do this job first
 If you're on your way up the ladder
 And you need to work this job to progress
 Fine do the crummy job, but guys really I want to reach out to you
 And if you take nothing else from this podcast from this show anything
 Just to know that you are better than a bad job
 so
 Start dusting off that resume
 Start looking for something that will excite you. I know it's scary
 To change make these big changes make a list of the things you need in a new job
 Make a list of the things you want in the new job
 You don't have to do this overnight
 But if you are miserable in your job life is too short to work in misery
 You're on your way to your job and you're frustrated and you're gonna hate it
 And you hate your co-workers and you hate your job, but you make good money
 You got good benefits and as you're going to this job that you hate
 You have all this negative energy swirling up inside of you
 You have a heart attack and you die. You're killed in a car accident
 Rogue rogue elephant crushes you as you're pulling into the parking lot. How will you feel then?
 Your last thing on earth you are going to a place that gives you nothing but negative energy
 Find the positive job. It doesn't even have to be a great job. I love retail
 I love stocking shelves. I love working with customers
 So doesn't have to be a flashy job. Just look for the job that you love life is too short
 To work in misery
 We take nothing else from this podcast nothing else from 777 episodes
 Remember that there is only one of you you have one life
 Make sure you're working a job that you want to work
 Don't just work for the paycheck. Don't just work for the benefits
 You find yourself in that situation when as you're traveling to work you wish that someone rear-end you
 So you'd get the day off. It's time to dust off that resume. It's time
 To find the right job for you
 Let's go ahead and welcome in today's legacy patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command give it up
 It's Matt Sprinkle everyone give a round of applause to Matt give him a high five while you're doing a round of applause
 It's all totally confusing you accidentally punch him in the eye
 But you can't sue me Matt because you've already given me patreon money
 So you're gonna lose that's in the law. Did you not know that Supreme Court ruled on that if you give me money
 You cannot sue me Matt
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode you guys can't support the patreon
 I totally understand just help spread the word about the show really
 Really helps out a lot now Matt. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are driving all the way down to
 Brazil
 Matt is perfectly driving us down there. He's been in the vehicle. I think once or twice
 He's been a supporter for a long time Matt knows the way. He's totally like oh Brazil
 I totally know where that's at. Do do do do do we all go down there?
 You guys longtime listeners of the show know I'm a huge fan of urban legends. I think that is really
 Powered like my childhood belief in ghost of front. I'm like, oh no, there's a man with a hook is gonna come after me
 I'm not making out with anyone in a car
 I actually don't think I've ever gone old lovers lane now that I think about it make out in a parking lot, right?
 It's a little as romantic if you're in the parking lot of like a movie theater
 But you know the whole story lovers lane and the hook for the hand I love urban legends
 Those are the first scary stories that I think kids really hear and they sound believable
 I remember there was a story that I used to be told that in
 Orangevale which Orangevale, California is one of the flattest places on earth
 You can literally stand there and you're like hello state capital
 You can pretty much just see for miles and miles, but I remember my brother told me a story
 There are these two Native American people. I
 Did not use that terminology didn't use that terminology, but there are these two Native American
 People and they were madly in love
 They're madly in love with the chiefs of the different
 Oh, they're from different tribes to do that would make sense if they're just like hey
 We're in the same time. Let me back up here because this will make it more dramatic and accurate
 There's two rival tribes of Native Americans and you have a dude from this tribe
 And then you have a girl from this tribe and they were in love with each other
 But the chiefs of either tribe goes no you cannot be together. How dare you marry that?
 Oh, they were also they were also the kids of the chiefs. I guess I'm a little off track here
 You're like Jason at least like edit that stuff out. No, don't tell me how to do my show a long long time ago
 There were two Indian chiefs right one of them had a son
 Well name him Johnny and the other chief of a rival tribe had a daughter named Daphne and
 Johnny and Daphne were in love with each other, but the rival chief
 I know the water room. Me. Oh, Julia. Just get to the stupid urban legend part. So anyways
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
 Maybe you do know how to run a podcast better than I do the point is is that because they couldn't be together
 They went to a cliff a cliff in Orangevale, which doesn't exist the much you'll get is maybe a goalie
 But anyways, they went to this cliff in Orangevale and they jump both jumped off to their deaths
 I
 Guess I have to have the sound effect that made it quite brutal
 But so you're like that's not an urban legend Jason
 That's just like Romeo and Juliet
 But this didn't happen in the end of Romeo and Juliet if it did it would be awesome
 My brother told me and to this day if you go to this cliff in Orangevale that cliff that doesn't exist
 I was so scared as little kid. I'm like, I don't want to go no towards any cliffs ever
 I don't even want to see Clifford the big red dog the go to this cliff to where the two natives jumped off and made that sound
 If you stood on the edge of that cliff their faces like their faces got cut off some
 I don't know. I was a kid. I didn't understand a legic
 But apparently their faces got sliced off on the rocks when they fell
 so if you go to this cliff their
 Skinned faces would float up and they're just be like it would be like if you cut off leather face cut off their face
 And so they had no eyes. They had no mouth. It was just these two bloody
 skin pieces of skin floating around going
 That's terrifying right absolutely terrifying it would have been one thing if just their ghost showed up and they're like walking through the woods
 It's their skin got faces floating after you. I remember a I remember
 Being told that story on an overcast Orangevale morning back in like 1982. It's one of like my earliest memories
 Urban legends. I love them. They terrified me and
 Still don't go towards cliffs because you never know you never know what cliff it was
 So I love urban legends and when I can't the only thing better than an urban legend
 Is an urban legend like the one we're about to discuss and I got to give a shout out to
 Nelsilius because Nelsilius brought this to my attention. I never heard of this one before let's take a look at this
 Have you guys ever heard of a show? I'm sure some of you have called. I think it's Naruto and
 I don't really know much about it. It's about like some cat ninja
 Right, isn't that guy like half cat because he has like whiskers or something
 But I see a lot of people dressed up as him when I'm walking around just town everyone's like hi
 I'm Naruto running like him that that's really what I know
 He has a headband and then I think he has whiskers and he runs with his arms behind his back
 That's all I know about Naruto, but now I know something else about Naruto. There's a dude named Kan Kuro on the show
 and he's a shinobi ninja and
 I guess he's a puppet master ninja
 So he I don't know my research ended was like Naruto headband shinobi ninja
 I didn't watch any episodes of this but apparently he's able to control
 People or he can create constructs like puppets and he like marionettes them has him dance around on I'm assuming
 They do niggas so I'm assuming he's not putting on a puppet show for the bad guys
 I think he like makes the the puppeteering kick people in the nuts or something like that
 I'm not for sure. So that's the background of that character. He let that deep dive research
 I does something with puppets
 The reason why we're in Brazil is in 2005
 There is an anime convention called anime friends 2005 and this dude shows up dressed up as Kan Kuro
 It's his favorite Naruto character
 his name is Tarsisco Felix and he shows up as this dude and
 He brings this puppet with him like he has like this giant casket thing
 And he's like all the the marionette puppets in here
 And I guess on the show the guy has something strapped to his back or he does carry around this thing that the
 marionette dude is in
 So I lost all my Naruto viewers are there already furiously type in some on YouTube
 You're like Jason you literally could not have gotten any details more wrong than he did
 But the point isn't that I'm gonna get flooded by anime comments
 The point is this he shows up in this costume with this casket and people are like dude
 That is one of the best Kan Kuro costumes I've ever seen and there's a guy's in a next-time dress that was like
 Oh, I was Kan Kuro too. They're like you just look like some dollar store ninja
 He actually is going around the convention people like you're really this is real cool
 Gonna get a picture with you and people are like well that was weird right something smelled bad
 An anime convention, so I'm sure the B. O meter was off the chart
 But every so often someone when they'd walk by to Risco they would go hmm. I don't smell too good
 They eventually have this
 Like lineup on stage. He actually for the entire convention. He's one of the finalists for best
 Cosplay
 So he shows up and he's lined up on stage with all these other people and this is the first time he's standing still
 I'm sure maybe he's still to go to the bathroom or when he's in line to buy a hot dog
 But usually he's walking around the floor, but now he's on stage with all these other people you got these bright lights
 You got the guy on the microphone announcing everyone and people are like dude that really stinks
 Like whatever whatever your costume is really really stinks and they start to think maybe in his
 casket his backpack is whatever it is
 There's a dead animal because it smells like it's dead
 the
 Judges actually get alerted to this and people are like okay. We need to actually see you could you bring like spoiled food and
 Tarsizos like it depends on your definition of food, right?
 So they make him open up this casket. That's part of his costume
 They find a dead body
 So the urban legend goes like this
 There was a man who brought a dead body as part of his costume
 To an anime convention in the year 2005 in Brazil and when they force him to open up
 They find this dead man and it turns out that Tarsizo was actually a medical student
 and this dead body was a
 Homeless person who had been dropped off at his college
 That you're supposed to be working on so I go know my finals do tomorrow. Where's my homeless dude? No
 So Tarsizo had it if he failed Brazilian medical school in this year
 It's probably cuz Tarsizo stole your buddy
 He takes his body puts it in this coffin for his costume
 And I'm wondering if anyone said hey man, can you make your puppeteering thing?
 And I wonder if it crossed his mind and he thought yeah, I'll pull it out and he starts like making this
 But because anyone would have automatically realized this was a real dead person
 I don't know why he put it in the casket if he wasn't showing it off
 but
 The entire event was canceled
 Anime friends 2005 everyone was sent home because this one jerk ruined it by bringing in a human corpse
 On the face of it, that's a great urban legend right it goes right
 I mean it totally it fit here. This is what's interesting about it
 It fits what we know about people who go to conventions. They're weirdos and I'm speaking of one
 I go to conventions as well when I can it's been a long time since I've been able to go one but
 Generally if you're going to anime convention. I comic I used to go to comic book conventions all the time
 Back when I was younger it does attract a certain segment of society
 The weirdos the ones that would think it might be okay to bring in a human
 Okay, they're not saying all anime fans thinks it's okay to bring in a human body
 But you know what I mean? It does attract a certain segment of society. I'm not putting them down
 But they're weirdos and I'm a weirdo too because I go to these conventions as well
 But so the stereotype already fits the socially inept
 Scientists doctor who thinks it's okay to smuggle a human body out into an anime convention like it doesn't
 Defy logic right you could see this happening with so many goes others nothing wrong with this dude dress up as a comic book
 They're dressed up like Thanos. I'm gonna carry around this World War two veterans body and say that I killed Captain America
 And I read this and I go what's fascinating urban legend of course
 There's no way we can actually prove it anime friends 2005. It was what 16 years ago
 Anything is going to be in a foreign language
 And so I read this urban legend and it actually was posted on the urban legends forum
 And I thought whoa dude. It's really cool and then and
 then
 As a follow-up post Nelsilius
 showed proof
 He took a screenshot of a magazine
 That tells this story
 There's a photo of this magazine the photo was taken back in 2007 and
 My Spanish is non-existent, but I know a
 Submission of Latin and I can kind of make out what's going on
 It appears that this article is saying hey yeah back in 2005 some nudge
 I brought a human body into anime friends a Brazilian convention. It's written in Spanish
 The best type of urban legends are the ones that are true
 Now just the story alone is just a fun story right because you can see it happen
 But this apparently actually happened and I will say this the only
 question I have is
 What did that magazine come from like where?
 Was it a magazine of Brazil's best urban legends or was it a magazine about weirdos and in
 Convention culture wasn't just a magazine about conventions in general and this was a highlight story
 But it appears that this story is actually real that a man
 student did actually
 Smuggle in a human body into an anime convention and not show it. That's the weirdest thing. He didn't show it to anybody
 It's like he just wanted the realism of having 180 pounds strapped to your back. It is dead homeless man
 Fascinating story the best urban legends are the ones that turn out to be true and this one's super obscure
 I hadn't heard it before but yes a man apparently did
 Bring a dead body into into an anime convention and they shut it down and who knows what happened to the guy right?
 I'm assuming
 The very least he got kicked out of school. I don't know maybe they just gave him a demerit. They're like Teresa
 Teresa you keep still in human bodies. We're gonna mispronounce your name every time we say it
 But yeah, I really love urban legends and you can't get any better than one
 That's true and pretty disgusting right you love the disgusting urban legends
 Matt I'm gonna go ahead and touch you the keys of the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind anime friends 2005
 We're saying goodbye to all the weirdos in Brazil. We are headed on out to a
 deserted island in the Indian Ocean
 to
 Now hold on tight guys huge storm in coming
 Winds blowing rain rain we have the window sets and we don't worry about the rain
 I guess the helicopters a little wobbly because of the wind, but we're actually pretty comfy in there
 We're drinking hot cocoa, but to anyone else alive in this area. It's a miserable day. It's September
 22 and we're in the Indian Ocean and we're watching this huge storm just royal the ocean
 Now in the middle of this Godforsaken area
 There's the boat Christine
 It's a Danish ship and the people on board are trying to do whatever settlers do to avoid dying in the water
 They're like, I just don't drown. That's rule number one
 So guys like oh, I didn't forgot that rule is he's flown away
 Christine a Danish boat is out in the middle of this ocean and the wind and the water and the waves are tossing every each way
 People throw ropes throw ropes somewhere. It's not really good captain. Where do we throw them? I don't know do something
 Sailory splash people are getting just washed over
 People were singing a jaunty tune they're not singing it anymore. They're just like lashing themselves to stuff
 And it doesn't help it doesn't help the boat is out of control and they see this rocky outcropping this island in the middle of nowhere
 Look out. Don't go over there the captain
 You gotta give us better better instructions, dude
 This boat
 crashes on this deserted island and it's just I mean
 Falling in an island is probably I mean the basic definition of an island. It's land in the middle of the ocean
 But what it is it's just jagged rocks. There's no coconuts
 There's no like far-sight-esque characters already trapped there
 it's
 It's death
 It's a bunch of jagged rocks in the middle of the ocean the boat is
 absolutely destroyed and everyone starts jumping off of the boat and
 Basically like I can either be in this boat when it sinks or I can climb on these rocks and slowly starve to death
 And so the people decide to climb on the rocks
 Now these rocks they're not just like you can walk around there's like cliff sides and things like that
 It's just inhospitable to human life
 And so they actually have a good amount of water because it's raining and it's collecting in the gullies of the rocks
 So they got that but they have no food at this point everyone's eyeballing each other custom of the seas brother
 Who's gonna draw lots first? They're like, dude, we've only been here for 10 minutes. We don't want to start have to cannibalizing right now
 But no food the boat sinking they're probably getting some rations off of there, but not enough not enough
 And the men are sitting there
 kind of just
 They know they're gonna die. It's just one of those situations. You know, you're gonna die. Nobody knows you're there. It's 1862
 The chances of another boat finding you is probably as high as that boat then getting stranded on the rocks themselves
 more man meat to eat
 But you know, you're not gonna get rescued right your best hope is that more and more boats
 Crash there and you can just keep eating the survivors of those wrecks. So the men are sitting there and they're thinking we're dead
 And what's worse is that we have all this water to drink
 So we're just going to be able to prolong our lives until we all slowly start to death or start eating each other
 And that is when they see
 Something in the sky
 A massive UFO
 Is plunging through the clouds
 And the storm is so violent they're actually watching the ship wobble now
 This is 1862 they have no concept of a UFO even today
 This would be the most spectacular sight you could ever hope to see in your life a UFO a UFO
 That is estimated to be as big as a modern battleship
 This isn't some tiny three gray aliens piloting this thing
 This is a huge craft and it's coming down and even that the storm is so violent. It's battering the ship
 The men realize this thing whatever it is
 Is headed straight towards them
 What do you think is gonna get any worse?
 A giant vehicle from the sky
 Is headed right towards you they start to scatter trying to look for shelter on these rocks
 *Metal noise*
 The UFO smashes into the side of the cliff and then there is no sound but the storm
 The men start to approach this vessel and it's mangled there's massive holes torn in the side of it
 It's sitting there now on the beach
 But it's not in the best shape it hit this thing going god knows how fast
 And this ship has created a new hazard outside of the twisted metal
 Scattering the landscape the water around this craft is boiling
 This ship's hole is so hot
 The water is boiling
 The men enter the craft
 I love this story I just came across this one the other day. I really really enjoy it
 As they're walking inside they see machinery of unknown origin
 They don't know what it is. They can't make heads or tails of it. This is 1862
 This is pre-industrial revolution the most technological thing they probably saw was like a loom or an astrolabe
 But it wouldn't matter it smashed to bits
 They're looking at all this stuff. Oh no my space loom doesn't matter smashed to bits in the impact
 They see these metal boxes though
 That have a strange type of writing on them these glyphs
 And they're large but they can open them
 So they see these large crates and they pry it open and inside these crates
 Food
 So the men I know they're all sneaking up behind each other with a fork and a knife and then all of a sudden
 They just start devouring this food because again now they've only been trapped on this island
 We're like I have our this point, but
 Maybe they were super hungry on the way to get there
 Who's going to turn down some good old mysterious food in a metal box that you can't read the labels?
 These people are eating this food
 Have all this food now they know that their problems have been solved. They have food
 They have the water that they can collect from the rain and the rocks
 They don't still have no idea what this is, but you would think at this point it must be god's mercy
 some sort of angelic
 gift and then there's one atheist sailor is like, I don't know maybe uh
 Maybe none of that stuff exists and this just came from another planet people are like boo you we're gonna you work when this food runs out
 We're eating you first
 But they continue to explore the ship
 And they walk into this room
 And the sailors find them
 They find more than a dozen bodies
 strewn about
 More than a dozen bodies
 These men had dark bronze skin
 With long hair
 Long beards
 But the most spectacular thing about these bodies
 They were all 12 feet tall
 The sight of giants
 Giants from the sky in this great machine that smashed against our planet killed all of them
 None of these posed any threat. They were all dead, but the sight of these 12 inhuman beings
 Sent the sailors running
 Some of them it drove them mad
 One of them was so insane from this site. You can't comprehend it
 You're seeing a non-human entity for the first time. You're seeing a bunch of them
 When he ran out of the ship
 He jumped into the boiling water
 Cooked himself to death
 Now I know the cannibals the cannibal contingent of the sailors were like, oh, right. We're gonna get that guy later, but
 They didn't they didn't need to I know cannibals. They really want to eat this guy. They didn't need to
 Because they had enough food
 Fra I know I know they're super disappointed. Oh man. The thing is
 Is they left the food in the ship
 But they refused to go back in there they refused to go back into the ship
 Because who knows what these things were this was not a place for man
 A place for gods a place for devils
 But not man
 But they were starving they're on this deserted island in the middle of nowhere
 This delicious smell of that cooked human keeps filling their nostrils eventually they do go a while without food and they say guys
 We need to go back in there and get those containers
 We need to go back in there and get that food
 So after starving for a bit and realizing the only way to stay alive was to visit this
 This cemetery
 They go back into the ship
 They began eating the food
 They decide to drag the bodies out of the ship
 They throw them into the ocean
 Now they have food
 Now they have water
 Now they have time and strength
 to escape
 Because you can't just go out on the high seas you could build a raft day one
 But you're not going to survive that journey
 But now that they have this food they can build this raft and they know we're going to be on the ocean for god knows how long
 But we have a chance now
 So they eat they regain their strength
 They build the raft they take provisions for them and the survivors get on this raft and leave this deserted island
 Eventually
 They reach civilization
 There's a really cool book and a couple of you guys sent this to me a long time ago
 There's a really cool book called albert rozales
 Or albert roe sails one of the two humanoid sighting reports
 And it's a lot like that website think about it docs.com where it's just brief
 Overviews of these amazing stories
 And they got this story from gerome clark who wrote it for fate magazine back in september 1990 now
 And so the question is is
 It's a fascinating story. I love this story, right? It's really cool
 But the question that I always go back to is how true was it or is it true?
 And I actually found out on wikipedia. They have a list of
 shipwrecks by year
 In september 1862 there was no boat that matched this description that crashed in the indian ocean
 Although I figured maybe the dates wrong. I looked at october
 1862 I did find a boat called the christine. That was a danish ship
 And it does say it says that the brig was wrecked at jedaren
 Which I wasn't able to I don't know what that means to try to look that up on a map
 I brought out all my nautical maps at jedaren. Her crew was rescued
 It says she was on a voyage from asgard to montrose forfenshire united kingdom. So I don't know
 Why they would be going from the netherlands
 To britain and end up in the middle of the indian ocean
 But I was able to find at least a little bit of details. Does that mean the story is true?
 We don't know right whether or not it's true. We can't determine that but this story is so
 Awesome. I really love this story and the idea
 We think of when sailors crash on these deserted islands
 And that hopelessness, you know, you might be able to scrabble some stuff together to get off there
 You may slowly eat each other away
 See you I take a bite out of you you take a bite out of me
 We'll just keep doing this until the first person dies
 But you could have a 10 people die on an island and they're constantly hoping to get rescued and then they
 Turn on each other and then you know eight are left and then a couple die of disease and then all of them end up dying
 Their bleached bones are never found their family and their employers and everyone
 Never is able to figure out what happened to these 10 sailors and that's so part of human nautical history
 When we look at what humans have done crossing the oceans that is what we're doing when we look at the stars
 It's the almost the same level of technology to build those galleons back in the day and to cross
 The ocean was such a monumental task and if you messed up you died
 Water is just as hostile as space
 Right if you're
 Mucking about in space and you float out of the space station you're gone
 You're just going to keep floating and floating and floating away until you get sucked into the orbit of something
 Or burn up in the sun and the same thing if you fall out of a boat
 I'm almost gone bro. If you fall off of a cruise liner
 You're done
 It's so inhospitable nowadays. We're like, hey, let's hop on a cruise line
 Let's hop on a disney cruise and drive around and baby Yoda will come out and help feed us oysters at the buffet
 Maybe some and I believe someday space travel will be like that
 We'll look back at the this era of space travel the same way that we look back
 400 years ago in nautical travel you're like well, we'll get in a boat and maybe we'll make it
 Maybe the crew will mutiny. Maybe they'll never know what happened to that boat
 Maybe that entire galleon could sink and have all this treasure in it. We don't even know what happened to it
 And that's the same idea of an alien ship crashing on earth
 It's some backwater in the middle of nowhere if you have this galactic civilization, right
 past Alpha Centauri
 And you have this craft that you build with the top technology of the time
 You say goodbye to your alien wife and to your alien children
 And you hop on board your ship
 And you fly across the galaxy
 You're leaving behind that civilization. You see the last lights of the colonies
 Disappear on your view screen
 You go farther
 Than the farthest outpost and now you're in the middle of a galactic nowhere
 And your ship crashes on a mud ball
 On the edge of the milky way
 It's the same thing I find that so fascinating
 The idea of an alien crashing here would be the same thing if we crashed on a rocky shoreline
 You go well, there's people here. That's not good for them. What would you rather do?
 Crash on a deserted island or crash on an island full of hostile people
 Like you're probably gonna die anyways. Maybe you'll make friends
 with the people there
 Or maybe they'll just kill you because you're some weirdo outsider walking around
 You look like a devil to the humans
 You shouldn't be there. You're a trespasser
 Fascinating story and I've always loved the connection between the nautical
 and
 the galactic
 We are all just explorers
 Trying to find our way through the universe trying to discover new things about reality about ourselves
 But those type of adventures
 They take blood
 They take bodies
 You got to lose a lot of ships
 You got to lose a lot of ships
 To explore the world
 You got to lose a lot of ships to explore the galaxy
 But it is through that loss it's through that struggle
 That you gain knowledge
 That is a little
 soulless to the men and to the aliens
 Who die
 And no one knows where they are
 Little soulless to them
 But for civilization as a whole
 We wouldn't be where we are today if it wasn't for the explorers
 Who risked their lives
 To get us here
 Exploring as part of human nature
 And from all the stories we've covered
 All of the visitations all of the events all of the crash landings
 I think exploration is part of alien nature as well
 And hopefully that common theme unites us
 And that our comrades deaths will not be in vain
 And we will all someday explore the stars together
