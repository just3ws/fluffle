1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Is there a conspiracy to keep you an out-of-shape slob?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at a truly terrifying story from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We talk a lot about religious miracles and visions,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 but what happens when the vision could be a haunting today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Karpner. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon, Joel Gonzalez.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Joel, right? Gonzalez.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Thank you so much for supporting this show.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 If you're gonna be our captain in this episode, our pilots.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 You can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Just help get the word out about the show really helps out a lot.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We also have a merch store, we got some awesome merch,

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 and I'm still sending out stickers.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm almost done sending out stickers, so I'll reveal the design really soon.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Joel, let's go ahead and we're gonna start off in the Jason Jollabee.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 We're gonna take a little road trip.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We're headed up to Colorado.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We're headed up to Colorado State University specifically.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I know Colorado is a big state. We'll get there eventually, just drive around.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We talk a lot about the conspiracy.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Actually, both stories today are from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 This story is from the fitness conspiracy theory iceberg.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 It's interesting, I've seen a lot of these icebergs come out.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 A lot of you guys mail them to me. That's great, I really appreciate it.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 This one is all fitness related.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Joel, we're gonna pull up to the Colorado State University.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It's 1973, it's May 1973.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Hope you brought your bill bottoms, chest hairs all showing.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I didn't plan on coming in 1973, this is what I'm normally wear when we walk in.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 There we're gonna meet a dude named Casey Vitor.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Casey Vitor.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Now he used to be a bodybuilder.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 He used to be really into bodybuilding.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 He won some bodybuilding competitions.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But when he was working out a couple years ago, he sliced the tip of his finger off,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 had to go in for a tetanus shot. The tetanus shot almost killed him.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He dropped from 200 pounds to 167 pounds.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Part of it was depression, part of it was almost dying from a tetanus shot.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Bad combination of things.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Bodybuilding is all about building mass.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You know what bodybuilding is, right?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So his bodybuilding career was kind of falling apart, but he was a gifted athlete.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 He's down on his luck. He's sitting there.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 He's just like, "Oh, his finger, his finger's like barely holding on. He has a bandaid."

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 He's like, "Oh, in between all the weight loss, depression and tetanus shot,

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I forgot to have my finger reattached. Oh well, it's all blue."

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Like him. But his finger is physically blue. He is depression blue.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And then one day he hears a knock on his door.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 "Uh, come in. I can't open the door. I'm missing a fingertip."

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And this dude walks in, his name's Arthur Jones.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And he's like, "Casey, I'm here to change your life."

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And so Arthur and Casey get together. They go on a little road trip.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 They go up to Colorado State University.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Arthur Jones, he's the inventor of the Nautilus system, which is a highly advanced home workout system.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 A lot of "kuh, kuh."

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So it's not a steam train. That's me lifting weights with the bars, the plates on them

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 that slap against each other.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 A weight lifting machine. You know what I'm talking about, right?

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 It's not like free weights.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So now we were waiting here the whole time at Colorado State University.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I had to do that background.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Now we're sitting there and we see Arthur and Casey walking to the steps.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And I'm like, "Waking, waking Joel up."

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Dude, the story's starting. The story's starting. He's like, "Huh? What? What?"

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 So we wake up and he's like, "Come on in, you slums. We're gonna work out.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I'm gonna show you what's really going on."

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So Arthur walks in, music starts pumping up. Casey's still a little depressed.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 But we all got on sweat bands and stuff like that, unitards, and we're just doing a musical montage.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Lifting weights and stuff like that.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 You sweat everywhere. This is pre-coronavirus.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So we're like right next to each other's sweat from my faces falling on you.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You're like, "Uh..."

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Here's what happened. Here's what happened.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 While we're working out, we see what's really going on.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Arthur Jones invented this system.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So he had the Nautilus home system, but he actually invented these prototype machines.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And what he was trying to do was this thing called negative reps.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So you get assistance lifting the weight up, and then it's all on you.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Casey would come into this gym. They'd have him sit.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Sometimes he didn't work out on machines and sometimes he had spotters,

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 but the way the machine was designed is it would be really easy to get the weight up.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 You had to slowly lower it down.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So negative reps, instead of pushing up like you're on the bench press

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 and then bringing it back down, you could have more weight put on you, lifted up,

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 and then you would have to bring it down nice and slow.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Otherwise you'd die, and then your assistants pick it back up for you.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It's called negative reps.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 He built machines, prototype machines that do this as well.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So you didn't need a spotter.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The machine would actually lift up a super heavy amount of weight,

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 and then you would have to slowly bring it down.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 This was Arthur Jones.

95
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It wasn't just Arthur Jones and a sweaty dude working this out.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 They had a bunch of scientists, because really people wanted to see if this was going to work.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 They put him on a diet.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 He had to eat 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And the scientists were looking at each other and they were like,

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "That's nowhere near enough for his type of workout."

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 What type of workout is he doing?

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 We already talked about the negative reps,

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 but he only did one 30-minute workout every other day.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So it's not like he was in there for three hours.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 A lot of bodybuilders, man.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 That's their job.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 They're spending like two, three hours in the gym.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 30-minute workout every other day, eating 4,000 to 5,000 calories a day.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The goal was to see how much muscle he could put on in 28 days.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Now, normally the average person can gain 1 to 2 pounds of muscle per month.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And it's very hard to gain muscle.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I don't know how many of you out there have actually tried to put on muscle weight.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 It's way easier, I believe.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I think science believes this.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I don't think this is Jason's thing.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's 100 times easier to lose weight than it is to put on muscle.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It's so easy to lose fat as it is opposed to build up muscle.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 The average person can put on 1 to 2 pounds of muscle a month, if you're lucky.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 You might have to go mad.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 That's a gallon of milk a day.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I don't know if that's a meme diet, honestly,

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 but you need a lot of protein to put on just 1 to 2 pounds of muscle a day.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 If you have a high intense workout, it's possible you can put on 20 pounds in 3 months.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 If you really, really push yourself, you mind all your P's and Q's,

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 you're really, really working at it.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 You can put on 20 pounds in 3 months.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Focusing on negative reps, using this experimental nautilus prototypes,

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 they hired a bodyguard to follow KC Round,

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 so they would be able to prove he was doing no steroids.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 The first week, the first week, KC gained 27 pounds of muscle.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Now, listen, I know you guys don't believe that.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 There have been scientific papers written about this.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 This was groundbreaking.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 There's a great article in the show notes.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 It was on T Nation.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 It was called the Colorado Experiment Factor Fiction.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It really is written by someone who went through the notes,

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 who was a contemporary, who wasn't there at the time,

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 who was a contemporary of these scientists who was working on this.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 They went through the notes, and they went through all the notes,

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 and they actually replicated some of this as well.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 But they said, you got to understand, KC was a gifted athlete.

143
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 He was a gifted athlete.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He had dropped 40 pounds from 200 pounds to 167 pounds

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 when he stopped competing, when he was depressed.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 But still, okay, he's a gifted athlete.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 People say he was just rebuilding muscle that he had already lost.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Possibly, possibly, right?

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 He went from 200 pounds to 167 pounds in the first week.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Even saying that, that's still a massive gain.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 In the first week, he gained 27 pounds of muscle.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 He lost 7 pounds of fat.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 His total weight gain in 28 days.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Muscle weight gain in 28 days.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 63 pounds of muscle in a month.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 He was 200 pounds.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 He dropped down to 167.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 He puts back on the 27 pounds.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 That's the muscle he lost.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 He put on an additional 35 pounds.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And they remained in three weeks of that month.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 The article that I mentioned earlier was written by Ellington Darden.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He's a PhD.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 And he was writing this article.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So it wasn't some just guy writing for T-Nation,

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 what testosterone nation is what the T stands for.

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Guy who has his reputation on the line, right?

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And he's like, I knew the scientists who were working on this.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I went over their research.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And he actually tried replicating this program as well.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 And what he got was you, it's all about the negative reps.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And he got people to put on 18 pounds on 11 days.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Sometimes it would take him more time.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He had people that would take him 10 weeks to put on 18 pounds.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 But that's still much better than one to two pounds a month.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 If this works and it's able to be replicated,

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 how come we don't have these machines?

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 It's funny because I tell you exact,

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 these are all prototype machines.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 They were never released to the public.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I can almost guarantee you they were all death traps.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I can almost guarantee you that's the reason why.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 They may be like NFL teams that may own some of these,

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 but I bet you they're, I bet you not.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I bet you they're super, super dangerous.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Negative reps hold a far higher ceiling for,

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 think about it, because if you guys,

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 because again, I used to really lift weights

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 before my tennis elbow.

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Now I have a hard time doing anything,

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 but in high school I was really into weightlifting.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 You know when you're doing a bench press,

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 you know when your hands get under there,

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 right when you try it, you're like,

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 "No, this is too heavy and you're smart."

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Like, you know there's heavy, too heavy,

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and then this will kill me heavy,

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 and you start to lift and you're like,

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 "No, I'm not trying to afford this."

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 You'll take a couple plates off or a plate off or whatever.

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But with a negative rep, that's removed.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It's already up in the air.

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And of course your spotters are there,

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 if things really go bad.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 But if you have a machine,

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 that's mechanically lifting it up for you

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and assisting on the lift so much heavier

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 than you could lift on your own.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 That was the point.

210
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 You were doing these super high intense workouts

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 where you're lifting more than you could ever lift

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and then you're slowly bringing it down.

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You people would be getting killed all the time.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 How many people are just total blowhards?

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And they're like, "What?

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I can do a thousand pound hip sled."

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And then obviously they can't.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But if they are, I think they can.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And it's already extended fully and, you know,

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 they're dead.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 They're dead.

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 The machine's done its part.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It lifted a thousand pounds in the air.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Now your legs have to lower it.

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It would be getting people killed left and right.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So it does seem that it is possible to put on,

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 at the very least, 18 pounds in 10 weeks.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 At the very least, that would seem to be,

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 even when they were replicating,

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 that was the farthest one down.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 So that would be, that would be over a pound a week,

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 which is still better than what modern science

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 thinks you can do.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But it is locked away.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 These secrets to physical fitness are locked away

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 because people would most likely get killed.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But if you have a good training partner

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 that you really trust who you don't owe money to

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 or haven't been sleeping with their significant other,

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 you may want to get some people together.

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And that's what the author of this piece recommended.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 That with the right team, you've got good spotters.

243
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 He gives a full workout plan in the article.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 These are the exercises we did.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's not magical.

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Pay $19.99.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 In this article on TNation, it'll list all the exercises,

248
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 the breakdown, the negative reps, how to do it.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Please don't kill it.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Please don't kill it yourselves, guys.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 But amazing.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 That's again on the Conspiracy Fitness Iceberg.

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Very, very fascinating thing.

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 The secrets to the physical fitness universe

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 locked away on some random fitness website.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So, Joel, let's hop in that carbonic factor.

257
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 We're flying away.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 We're leaving behind Colorado.

259
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 We are headed out to Limpius.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 That is in Cantabria in Spain.

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 This is also from the Conspiracy Theory Iceberg.

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So we got two for one here.

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Pretty interesting combination.

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Generally, what I'll do is I'll read.

265
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I'll find a new topic and I'll read about it.

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And then I'll try to debunk it.

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And a lot of times I'm able to take a cheat route.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 I'll just look for other people who've debunked it.

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Now, sometimes it's like the one-off Bigfoot story.

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 A person's walking through the wood.

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Bigfoot jumps out from behind the tree.

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Unless that person also has like...

273
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Unless that person's been arrested for lying

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 in a country where lying is illegal.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You can't really debunk that.

276
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Every so often you'll find something.

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 So those type of stories, I just try to use common sense

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 or just tell them as they are an entertaining story.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 But a story like this, I go, "Well, I'm sure there's...

280
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 I'm sure someone's run a debunk on this, right?

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 There's nothing.

282
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Not a single thing that would pop up."

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 This is pretty high profile too.

284
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So I was a little shocked.

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Near Limpius is San Sebastian de Garabandel.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And that is where you had a very famous sighting

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 of Michael the Archangel and the Blessed Virgin Mary appear.

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So you had people pilgrimaging to that area.

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 People still go to both of these areas to this day.

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Now, despite the fact that Garabandel's...

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 The visitation of Saint Michael and the Blessed Virgin Mary

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 at Garabandel came later

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 than what happens at Limpius.

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Limpius definitely still seems to be the lesser known of the two.

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So Joel, let's go ahead and land that Carbentercopter.

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 We're back in the year 1914.

297
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And we're sitting outside the Church of Saint Peter.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Now the Church of Saint Peter, in it,

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 they had a life-sized crucifix of Jesus Christ.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 The crucifix of itself dated back to like the 1700s.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It's old work of art.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Old religious icon actually would be a better term for it.

303
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's a life-sized, it's six feet tall,

304
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 a life-sized crucifix of Jesus Christ up in the Church.

305
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 It's 1914 and there's a monk and his job is to go fix a light

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 that's hanging over the altar.

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So he gets a ladder, he's up there and he's fooling around.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 He's probably not fooling around, he's probably actually doing his job.

309
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He's not like juggling light bulbs.

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 But he's up there and he's looking face-to-face with Jesus.

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 He's eye-level with Jesus.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 He's, you know, trying, he's not really paying attention to the crucifix.

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 He's trying to do his job. He's working on the light.

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And then he finds himself drawn to look into the eyes of Jesus.

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And he's looking at it.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And he's looking at it.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And he's noticing that the eyes are slowly closing.

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Trick of the light, hot day, touching hot light bulbs all day long, who knows.

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 But the eyes stay closed for nearly five minutes.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 So it's not like when you see something out of your corner or eye.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 He's staring right at this thing.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 This crucifix that had been created long before he was born

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 and survived long after him had changed and now had closed eyes.

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And I don't, after about five minutes, I don't know why I took him this long,

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 but after about five minutes he has a moment of panic.

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 He falls off the ladder. He's kind of broken out of his trance, maybe.

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But anyways, he falls off his ladder, he stumbles to his feet, he runs,

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and he goes and tells a sacristan, I guess that's like the guy in charge.

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It's the guy who runs the parish.

330
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So the monk's like, "Oh dude, dude, you won't believe it.

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 You know that giant Jesus we have hanging up in the church?"

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 He closes his eyes and the sacristan doesn't even break.

333
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 It's like, "Oh yeah, no, that's no big deal."

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 What? Yeah, no, no, he did that before.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 He totally did it before.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The sacristan's just filling out paperwork.

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Here's this quote from this article.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He said he was not surprised as he had heard that the Santo Cristo

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 had closed his eyes on one other occasion.

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 It was probably brought about by the working of some interior mechanism.

341
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 The sacristan just goes back and filling out paperwork.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Now my follow-up question would be like, "Wait a second.

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 You're telling me that Chris Fix is actually a giant robot?

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 The one that was built in the 1700s and actually has like a clockwork mechanism in its head?"

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Which would be far more terrifying, right?

346
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I mean, like the image of Jesus being crucified is already,

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 it's supposed to evoke this just emotional reckoning in you.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You're watching this man who died.

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 He was sentenced to, he was basically born to die,

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 but from the time he was born he was going to be the sacrifice of the world.

351
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Now you're telling me he also has a robot brain?

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Like the statue was already built to be unsettling.

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 We're supposed to feel like, we're supposed to feel like

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 torment and thankfulness when we see the crucifix.

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 We're supposed to understand the pain but also go,

356
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 "Oh, I'm glad he went through that, so I don't have to."

357
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 But now you're telling me it's also like an animatronic.

358
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's creepier.

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 But the monk thinks about it and goes, "Yeah, I don't know."

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So he actually later on takes a ladder, puts it back up there,

361
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 and no one's looking.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 He walks up there and he starts trying to move the Jesus,

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 he starts trying to move Jesus' eyelids.

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 He's like putting his fingers and he's like, he's convinced that he saw it close.

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And the sacrosan goes, "Oh no, no, no, that's happened before.

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I bet you that's some sort of automatic thing."

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 You know, every Easter he closes his eyes or something.

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So he's trying to do it and the monk goes, "No."

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 There was no mechanism.

370
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 There was no like flap there.

371
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 It's not like one of those baby dolls when you lay down on their back,

372
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 the eyes closed.

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It was nothing like that.

374
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 But oddly enough people don't consider it a huge deal.

375
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Flash forward till 1919, so five years later.

376
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 There's a service going on and the children notice it first.

377
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 The children notice it first.

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 So when you're on the ground level, because it's a crucifix,

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 if you haven't been in a Christian church, the crucifix,

380
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 it's not ground level.

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 It's kind of elevated.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 So it tends to be behind the pulpit.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And the center of baptism, I'm a center of baptism,

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 we use just the cross.

385
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 The crucifix we would have, that wasn't the main symbol in the church,

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 but the cross is always above the minister.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And in a Catholic church, I used to go to a Catholic private school,

388
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 the crucifix will be elevated as well.

389
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 It's not like you can put your arm against it or something like that.

390
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 It's specifically high, so you don't do that, so you venerate it.

391
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 It's six feet tall and it's raised up.

392
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 So from where you're normally at, you can only see the whites of his eyes.

393
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Like you're looking up at someone who's 12 feet up in the air.

394
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You can kind of just see it at an odd angle,

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 but it would make it really easier to tell that something's different with the eyes.

396
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 The kids in the service realize that the statue of Jesus, the crucifix,

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 has closed its eyes once again.

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And then it begins to spread through the church.

399
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Everyone in the church starts to see the eyes closed as well.

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 That's an interesting note because we've talked about that before.

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 That's how mass hallucination starts.

402
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 We've done so many stories about mass hysteria,

403
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 where it starts with a small group of people seeing it

404
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 and then other people also exhibiting that.

405
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 This was an interesting part.

406
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 You had people say it's sweating. Jesus is sweating.

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You had people go up there on ladders and they could feel the perspiration coming off of his brow.

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 But you also had priests there who said they didn't see anything.

409
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 This has not been considered an official miracle in the Catholic Church.

410
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The Catholic Church has to signify that a miracle is real and saints.

411
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 You just can't declare saints. They have to have done three miracles in their lifetime.

412
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Or I think the three miracles can be after they're dead as well.

413
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 If someone's holding a bone, a finger bone, or something like that,

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 they get healed. That's considered a miracle.

415
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 But the Catholic Church, they have to come out and they have to investigate this stuff

416
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 to make sure that it's a legit miracle.

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And this one, as far as I could tell, was never actually classified a real miracle.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 You had priests going, "I don't see it. I didn't see him with his eyes closed."

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I had my back turned for five minutes and everyone's like, "Priest, priest, look around."

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 He's like, "I'll get to it in a second. I'm finishing playing P-Knuckle."

421
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And he turns around and he's like, "What's all this emotion?"

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 "Just sweat." There's a puddle of sweat on the floor.

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 There were people there who said they didn't see it.

424
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Priests there said, "I looked at it. It looked totally normal."

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 That really makes it seem like mass hysteria.

426
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 There was a journalist. You had journalists from all over the world come out.

427
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 This is a more obscure story now.

428
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 There's probably a lot of Catholic listeners who are familiar with this, but I had never heard of this before.

429
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 This is on the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

430
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Journalists who were coming from all over the world back in 1919.

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Pilgrimages, they'd come here.

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 There was a journalist who was looking at the crucifix.

433
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And he sees something that I would consider absolutely terrifying.

434
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I think... Let me just explain it and then we'll dissect it.

435
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 He's looking up at this crucifix of Jesus and he sees...

436
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 [breathing]

437
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 He takes a deep breath.

438
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 [breathing]

439
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Second breath is more labored, more painful.

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He says he can actually see the muscles tense.

441
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 The arms try to rip free from the nails in the hands.

442
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Eyes close.

443
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Another labored breath.

444
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 The pain of that man in that form.

445
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Pressing against that cross until finally...

446
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 [breathing]

447
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 The death rattle.

448
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Blood begins pouring out of the statue's mouth.

449
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I mean, listen, dude, everyone wants a sign, right?

450
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Of your belief.

451
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Everyone wants to know that it's real, but come on.

452
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 That's terrifying.

453
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And again, the crucifix is supposed to be a combination of pain and hope.

454
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 That this happens for all of us.

455
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 That this horrible thing happened for all of us.

456
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But there's a...

457
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You know, I've never seen The Passion of the Christ.

458
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 There's a specific reason I haven't seen The Passion of the Christ.

459
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Because I don't want to see The Passion of the Christ.

460
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Like, I'm sure it's probably a well-made movie.

461
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I know a lot of people who've seen it, but it basically looks horrifying to me.

462
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Um...

463
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And that... Imagine seeing The Passion of the Christ in front of you.

464
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And not being able to do anything about it.

465
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I mean, it's not like I can hop into the movie, but...

466
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Now, there's two ways to look... There's multiple ways to look at the story.

467
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 One is, obviously, mass hysteria.

468
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 If...

469
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I mean, it's saying this to be disrespectful to anyone's religious beliefs.

470
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 But I think if you go somewhere...

471
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 If you walk into a house, if you walk into a normal house,

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 you walk around, no big deal, you leave.

473
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 If you're told that there was someone murdered there, there was a ghost there, something like that,

474
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 you may feel something different.

475
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 You may feel something different.

476
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 If you make a pilgrimage to a site where you are told that the crucifix is alive,

477
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 the chances of you seeing something is much higher than not.

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I think probably the most authentic story is the Monk's story.

479
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 He was so close to it.

480
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 He was so close to it. The other...

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Here's the thing. I think something happened.

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I think there was a miracle here based on what I've read.

483
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I think the Monk saw something. I think he probably had done it before.

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I think the mass hysteria in 1919, it may have closed its eyes again.

485
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 But then you had people saying they were there and they didn't see it.

486
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 The priests who were there, that was the most interesting thing.

487
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 The priests who were there, I didn't see it. I don't know what they're talking about.

488
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 The sweating.

489
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I mean, we have stigmata.

490
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 That was something that fascinated me as a child, the idea of stigmata.

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 It still fascinates me, but I've never really covered it.

492
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It's pretty common. I shouldn't say common. It's a pretty well-known event.

493
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 But stigmata always fascinated me.

494
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It was funny. I actually used to be friends. I'm still friends with them.

495
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I just haven't talked to them in a while.

496
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 My buddy Ryan, super devout Catholic. Super devout Catholic guy.

497
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It was interesting. He told me he goes...

498
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Yeah, I dreamt that I was at the crucifixion.

499
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I watched Jesus get crucified. I was there.

500
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 It really terrified me and I went to my priest.

501
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And my priest told me that that's extremely rare.

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 People almost never dream of being at the crucifixion.

503
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Out of all the people who have come to the priest over confession or over the years.

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It's super rare. And I thought about that. I go, "I grew up in the church."

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 That was such a big part of my life. I went to church probably about three times a week.

506
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And I never dreamt of being at the crucifixion.

507
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 I just kind of like, it's funny because I thought, "What? How come he gets to be there?"

508
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I'm all walking into his dream. I'm like pushing him out of the way.

509
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 But at the same time, it's such a horrifying event.

510
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But yeah, it's super rare. It's super rare to dream that you're at the crucifixion.

511
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And the priest said there was... That meant something to my buddy Ryan.

512
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 That meant that was a... That was almost a miracle. That was a holy event.

513
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And I thought, "Yeah, that's weird. I used to consume three times a week."

514
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Even though my dad was a minister, we were always around it. But interesting.

515
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 So on the one level... I don't remember what I was talking about.

516
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 On the one level... I know I was talking about crucifix.

517
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 On the one level, we have this story of this. I do believe it was a miracle.

518
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I do believe something happened. Whether or not it's a robot head, I don't think so.

519
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But actually, you can't discount that. But the monk did try to discount it and doesn't think the eyes moved.

520
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 We can look at it as that. We have these type of stories with Stigmoda.

521
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 That's what I was talking about. Stigmoda, bleeding statues, and things like that.

522
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Stigmoda is usually a person with their hands bleeding. But we have issues like that.

523
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 But I originally was going to put up the photo of this crucifix for my podcast art.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And it's so disturbing.

525
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 It's so uncanny valley. I couldn't even look at the...

526
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I honestly made it. I would ask all of you to go to the show notes and look at the photo of this crucifix.

527
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Because it makes me sick to my stomach.

528
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 It's the uncanny valley. I've never seen such a realistic statue.

529
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I might be building it up for you. But I was like, "There's a lot of people who watch this on YouTube."

530
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And they don't want to have to look at... Trust me, I've grown up around Jesus iconography all my life.

531
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It's not the fact that it's Jesus. It's not even the fact.

532
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 This image of Christ looks human.

533
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I've never seen anything like it. It looks like a human in pain.

534
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I could be building it up, but just even thinking...

535
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 You know what the uncanny valley is? When something looks so realistic, but you know it's not real,

536
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 it actually has a fight or flight... It basically just has a flight response to it.

537
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 They believe it's an evolutionary thing that keeps us away from dead bodies.

538
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So when you look at CGI that's close to real, but not totally real, makes you sick to your stomach.

539
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Like Mars meets Moms. It was super gross. That movie was super gross.

540
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So you have to do an elite of battle angel make the eyes look bigger.

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 This statue... This image looks very human, but you know it's not human.

542
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 It actually makes you sick to your stomach. I'm actually getting sick to my stomach talking about it.

543
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I was going to use it for the cover art, and I figured no one would listen to this episode.

544
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 So I don't know if it was the way that... I mean, again, it's not...

545
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 This isn't the first crucifix that I've ever had any sort of blood coming out of it.

546
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 This isn't the first crucifix that's ever had any miracles attributed to it, but I think that this thing...

547
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 It won its life size. It's a representation of a person who died horribly in a place where people worship that person,

548
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 that manifestation of God on earth.

549
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 There might be a reason why crucifixes are tiny.

550
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Why generally you want them around your neck or on your wall and aren't a perfect representation of a human entourment.

551
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 The idea of tulpas is something we've touched on before, and I think if you had an icon to build your tulpa around,

552
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 it would make it easier for that tulpa to form.

553
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Tulpa is a thought form, if you're not familiar with that.

554
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 You focus so much, you can basically create... create a thought form.

555
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I'm not trying to be sacrilegious or anything. I hope that's not how this is coming across.

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Would it be possible to create a tulpa, to create a life form in a religious icon,

557
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 or does the fact that it's a religious icon protect it from that sort of psychological metaphysical meddling?

558
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Who knows? Who knows? I don't think really it's ever been investigated.

559
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I think that the Catholic Church will either say that this...

560
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 They haven't said this was a miracle yet. They may consider it was just a case of mass hysteria.

561
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 That would obviously be one answer.

562
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 The other answer, it is a miracle, or certain parts of it was real.

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 The mock actually saw the eyes closed.

564
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Or you have the scenario that it's all real, and for whatever reason the Catholic Church is looking at it and goes,

565
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 "Well, that stuff did happen, but it didn't come from God. We're not going to classify it as a miracle."

566
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But something did happen. Who knows? Who knows?

567
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I would like to think that religious icons are protected in some fashion.

568
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And maybe they are. Maybe they are.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Maybe it is God reaching out, showing people that miracles can still happen.

570
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Or it could be something using the guise of a miracle.

571
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 You're never really sure until you see it for yourself.
