1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 From elephants in Bolivia to dogs in Syria, that kind of rhymes, right?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,000
 This is Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,800
 [music]

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,760
 Hey everyone, welcome to a new episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,120
 Hope you're having a great night.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,000
 I'm feeling better.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,640
 My sinus infection, I think, I'm on the downside of it.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,400
 I'm still having some tooth pain, some pressure pain,

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,000
 but I'm still taking my antibiotics.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And I'm sleeping, sitting up.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I found out last night, when I haven't been able to,

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I've only been in like two hours sleep at night,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 that if you have sinus pain, you're not supposed to lie down,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 because all your gunk starts floating around in your face

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 and putting pressure in places where it shouldn't be putting pressure.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Wish I had known that.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Wish I had googled that earlier.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Or a doctor had said something.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 It's funny because I think we overestimate what doctors actually know.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I think that, you know, that's one thing that I've kind of learned,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 that doctors are just, they're like Walmart employees.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And the same thing like cops.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 They're just doing their job.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 They don't know everything.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 We put them on this ideal like, oh, you're a cop,

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 so you know more about, so they know more about like, crime scene analysis, maybe.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But they also think, well, they know more about crime scene analysis than me.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 But at the same time, they're thinking about their mortgage

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 and thinking about what they're going to eat and stuff like that.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So people get distracted all the time.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 You kind of have to, you can't put too much faith in them.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The microwave bee peeing is because my meal is waiting for me.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 It's beans and rice.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I had to go off keto because I've been having tooth pain.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I can only eat soft stuff.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 But I'll get back on it.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And that's another reminder.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 If you're ever like on a diet and you have to break the diet

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 or you already broke the diet, you had a bad meal,

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 don't let it get you down.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You just got to keep going.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Because being on a diet or doing any sort of life-changing thing,

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 it's a day-by-day thing.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 You make a mistake just, and don't say, well, I messed up.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 This stage is already shot.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I'm going to eat eight blizzards.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You know, you got to be rational about this stuff.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So here is a fact that I've been told.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So, you know, this story is going to be good.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 When I started off saying that I've been told a fact or I read a fact,

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 and I'm not ready to present any sort of evidence for it,

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 it's disgusting.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 So I heard that the reason why they invented chocolate milk is tasty as it is.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Chocolate milk is the best of all the milks, by the way.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 The reason why they invented chocolate milk is because they were milking cows so much,

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 that they started to bleed into the milk.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 They like, chafe.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So the milk would turn pink, and they're like,

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 "Dude, we're never going to be able to sell this pink milk."

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And someone says, "What if we change the color of the milk?"

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So that may or may not be true, but I do know that now, whenever I drink chocolate milk,

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I'm thinking, this is probably the blood milk.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It's kind of disgusting.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 It's kind of disgusting, but I guess like all milk has a little bit of cow pus in it and stuff like that.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 That's just kind of part and parcel of eating industrialized food.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Or any, like, I guess all food that comes from an animal is kind of grotesque.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 So I wanted to talk about some interesting stories.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 You know, I have a board here that I write down story ideas on,

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 and in the middle of the board, there is somebody's...

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Well, I'm assuming it's me because I live by myself,

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 but I have everything's written out really well and in the middle of it in barely legible writing.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 It either says "Dreams, Organ, or Dragon."

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I can't really tell.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 It's a little concerning because I'm the only person in here,

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 and none of those are any topics I was even thinking about talking about.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I already covered "Dreams" in an earlier episode.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 So why would I have written that?

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I just ran it in the middle of the night in the dark with my left hand

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 because I just can't make heads or tails of it.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 That's kind of creeping me out.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's kind of creeping me out.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 You know, one of the side effects of doing like a paranormal podcast or a conspiracy podcast

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 is you have to make sure that you don't get too spooked out yourself.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 You know, I was talking last night, the last episode about doing true crime,

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and it's kind of depressing.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 It's the same thing with paranormal stuff.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I love watching horror movies.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I have not been able to bring myself to watch it at all.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And it's funny because I'm not even scared of clowns.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 That trailer just looks so creepy.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 It looks so spooky.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And I'm always kind of looking over my shoulder anyway.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 So, you know, when you're doing a podcast,

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 we were talking about ghosts and these shadowy groups and stuff like that,

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 or weird science, it does kind of put you on edge.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So you always kind of got to find a balancing act for that.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 At the time of this recording, or, you know, a little bit earlier,

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 but we got the good news, the world got the good news.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And that was that those 12 young boys and the coach in Thailand were rescued from the caves.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And, you know, that was one of those stories that you're like,

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 "Oh, man, this could turn out really, really bad."

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I kind of ignored the story for a while.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It wasn't until, you know, I was kind of aware of it in the periphery,

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 but it wasn't something that I was really focused on.

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And then once they discovered them, I was like,

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 "Oh, that's cool."

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And kind of got more into the idea of how they were going to rescue them.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And at first they were like, "They might be down there for four months."

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And they were talking about bringing them supplies and all that stuff.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And it was just insane, you know, because, you know, it was pitch dark down there.

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 They were down there for 10 days.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I was talking to my friend.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 She was saying, "Well, I remember we were talking."

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And she goes, "You know, they might have had food with them."

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And I go, "They just came from a baseball game, or soccer game, football game."

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And she goes, "Yeah, but maybe they had food."

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I'm like, "Yeah, maybe a couple granola bars."

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I don't think that these 10 kids brought enough food for 10 days, let alone one day.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I mean, what kid, other than like the chubbiest kid on the soccer team,

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 who's the water boy, basically, who brought like eight Snickers with him,

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 that's not going to happen.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Do they even have Snickers in Thailand?

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I'm sure they do.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But anyways, I'm sure like maybe they each had a belly full of Chuck E. Cheese Pizza

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 and a granola bar each.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And then they're stuck there for 10 days.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 It's insane.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Luckily they had water though.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Maybe they were eating bats.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I don't know.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 We'll find out more.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But it's great that they came out because there's a story that I wanted to do,

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 and I didn't do it at first.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And then once that happened, I was like, "Ah, man, I can't.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I can't talk about this because it's in bad taste."

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 But now that everyone's safe, everyone's out, I think it is time to broach this subject.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 My friend Lana can attest that she came over to my apartment the other day

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 and she saw this story written up on my whiteboard.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 She goes, "Why is that up there?"

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So she can attest this actually happened before the Thailand thing.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Anyways, here's my question.

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 It's not really a story.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It's more of an open-ended question.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 You're in a cave.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And it could be any sort of situation where you're trapped,

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 but let's keep it in a cave.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 You're walking through a cave, and there's a cave in.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 So you're trapped in a chamber.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 You try to get out.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Like a boulder comes down.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 You are not able to move that boulder.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 You are trapped in that chamber by yourself.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And you know unless somebody else rescues you, you're stuck there.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So just for the sake of argument, let's say that there is a team on the other side of the boulder.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 They locate you, or they were already there when you were out.

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 You know, you guys were all just kind of chilling in the cave doing cave stuff.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And you know, I don't know what you would do in a cave.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I've never gotten the whole spelunking thing.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I've never actually even got like diving.

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Like you go down and you see stuff and then you come up and...

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I don't get it.

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I don't get what the point is.

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Like oh yeah, I saw like a blue fish and coral.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And that was worth $80.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Or I don't even know how much it would have cost.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But anyways, so you're in this cave system, a boulder comes down.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 You're trapped.

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And the people on the other side of the boulder are like,

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 "We can get you out in three days."

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Or "We'll get you, but we will get you out eventually."

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 You're trapped in this dark chamber.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 You're all alone.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 How long do you think it will be before you start to masturbate?

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 That's a legitimate question.

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I think if you know that you're going to like, you can't facilitate your own escape.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 The people on the other side can help you get out, but you're stuck.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 At what point do you go, "Yeah, I'm going to be here for three days."

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 At what point do you start masturbating?

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I think once the panic of the situation ends and you realize you're going to get rescued.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I'd say the average person may be an hour, half hour.

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I mean what else are you going to do in a dark cave, trapped by yourself?

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I remember thinking when I was probably like in my early 20s,

184
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 I watched that movie about the guy who gets buried alive,

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 not the one with Ryan Reynolds, but there was another one.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I forgot what it was called, "The Vanishing." It's pretty creepy.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But I was like, if I woke up and I was in a coffin

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 and I realized I was under the ground, underneath like six feet of dirt,

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I'd just start jacking off.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Because what's the point? You're not going to get out.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 If I know for a fact that I can't get out of there,

192
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 I'm just going to start jacking off because there's no point.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Now you say, well maybe you can dig out of your own grave.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And yeah, I get that. But we'll just assume that this grave,

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 you're in a really like locked up tomb.

196
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And that's why I think the cave example works better.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 You just can't move the rock.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And they'll say, we'll be here in three days, we'll have a tractor pull the rock out.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And then I'll just be like, okay, I'm cool.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And I just start jacking off.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Because what else are you going to do?

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I think that's the reason why we have the ability to masturbate.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 It's a survival mechanism in case we get trapped in caves.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Actually, that might be where the word caveman came from.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 That might be a little evolutionary lesson for you.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So you know, today's episode, I came across two stories.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 One is, again, it's an interesting conspiracy,

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 because the conspiracy actually has been proven to be true.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Now, in Bolivia, for the longest time,

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 there was a rumor of what was called an elephant graveyard.

211
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 It was a rumor in the cities of these places where alcoholics go to die.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 So how it's set up is you've lost your family, you've lost your job,

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 you're homeless, and you're like, I just want to end it.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And I want to end it doing what I love most, drinking.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So you go to this building, and it's just like it looks like a storefront.

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 It's like the shutter down, but you know the secret knock,

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 you know the way to get in there, because other bums have talked about it.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You go in there, and you're such a bad alcoholic at this point,

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 you can't even hold anything in your hands.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You have the shakes, incredibly bad.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And what they do is they give you a bucket of 95% alcohol,

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 and water, to water it to taste, basically, to what you can handle.

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And since you can't hold a cup, you get a ladle,

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 and you just dip it in and pour it into your mouth.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 You go into a room, and they lock the door, and you drink yourself to death.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You have the option, there's also communal rooms where other people are all sitting in there,

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 and everyone's kind of drinking and talking.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 The rooms are pitch black, and you sit there in the dark,

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and you drink until your liver and your kidney stops functioning.

230
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Now, this was a rumor going around in Bolivia,

231
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 and it was something that people were like, "That's not true. That is like an urban legend.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 There's no such thing as an elephant graveyard."

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 There was an author who wrote a book about it, and people were like, "It was a fictional book,

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 but it was called The Elephant Cemetery. It was by Victor Hugo Viscara."

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And people thought, "Oh, that's fake. That's not true. Why are you giving our city such a bad name?

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 That's not true."

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And eventually in 2012, Tail Mundo, no, 2014, sorry, did a report on it

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and had footage of the actual elephant graveyards of the people doing this.

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And at that point, the police, because for the longest time, the stories were getting covered up,

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 and people were denying that it existed.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 It was no one in the underclass, but in the middle class and the upper class,

242
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 they were just denied it. They said it didn't happen.

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And so eventually, the cops, you know, when they were confronted, the cops said, "Yes, yes, we know there are elephant graveyards."

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And we have a special team dedicated to shutting them down, and we've been doing this for a while.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It's just not something that we thought that everyone needed to know about.

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Talk about a subculture.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 It is a place where it's a subculture for alcoholics, like hardcore alcoholics.

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 When you're just, you have nothing, and you're ready to kill yourself drinking.

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Now, I've read a couple articles about this, and what's interesting is I couldn't figure out how the elephant graveyard operators got paid,

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 because it is illegal, and what would happen is they would shut one down.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 The cops would shut one down, and they would just, another one would pop up in the city.

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 So, did they do it as some sort of humanitarian thing?

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 You know, that was the thing in the article they were saying that the police, the police don't, not saying this on the record,

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 but basically they go, "Listen, these people are homeless, and they're going to die anyways.

255
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 They can die on the street and be a problem, or they can go and die in a room."

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I mean, that's just, they don't have any, their family's abandoning them, their job's abandoning them, you know, they have nothing.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 They're going to die anyways.

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's kind of like, they shut down the elephant graveyards, but at the same time they're like, "You know, these places, they do serve some sort of purpose as cruel as it is."

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You know, hitting rock bottom is rough, but hitting, you know, like, basically to hit rock bottom and say, "Yeah, I'm just going to keep on going."

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I mean, that's insane.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And the elephant graveyards too, like I said, they lock you in the dark room with the alcohol.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 If you knock on the door, they let you out.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 They make some Saul torture room where they're like, "Have a funnel in your mouth, and you have to drink all of that in 30 seconds, or your bum and your stomach's going to blow up."

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It's nothing like that.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 They'll let you out, but then you're back and you're homeless again.

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 So, yeah, crazy, you know, and you wonder that this story was covered up for the longest time and everyone denied it.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You wonder what other subcultures are out there.

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 What other bizarro subculture groups are out there that are operating that some people know about, and law enforcement may or may not know about,

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 but the majority of society doesn't know about it, or if they do hear whispers about it, they completely disregard it.

270
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And I'm not saying stuff like reptilians taking over the planet, but just like real conspiracy theories, real groups, real subcultures that are just kind of floating around.

271
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 You know, and again, that's always fascinating to me.

272
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 We're going to do a couple more stories, not today, but I have a couple more subcultures I want to talk about that are, you know, they're just happening right next to us, right?

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 You know, it's weird.

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 The other story I wanted to talk about today was happened in Syria, and I thought this story was pretty cool.

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 So, yeah, you know, that's the thing, elephant graveyards, it's just a crazy subculture that's out there.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Imagine going into a pitch black room, imagine being such a slave to your addiction.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 You walk into a pitch black room with a bucket of alcohol and some water, you pour it in a ladle and you drink yourself to death.

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Now, here's my question to you.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I know we don't want to imagine ourselves in those type of situations, but let's say that you are at rock bottom with your addiction and you go to an elephant graveyard, you knock on the door, they let you in.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 You know you're not, you know this is the end for you.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 You said goodbye to your family. They're not really talking to you, but you leave them a letter.

282
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 You walk in there, your hands shaking, they give you the bucket, they give you the ladle.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 You go into the pitch black room and they lock that door.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 How long do you think it would be before you started masturbating?

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Because, again, I think it would be very quick for me.

286
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I think it would be about five minutes, because, I mean, sure, now I have something to do as opposed to the cave, I had nothing to do.

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Here, I can drink, but that would probably, well, you know, that would be difficult because if I was super drunk, I wonder if hardcore alcoholics can actually get it up.

288
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 That's interesting. I know there's that term "whiskey dick."

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Yeah.

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Oh, that would be terrible. You're trapped and you can't masturbate. That would be the worst, actually.

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 So, we're going to go ahead and go on to one more story here.

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And I think this story is fascinating. I know all stories are fast-advanced.

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 This involves six special forces units, or six special forces, British special forces, soldiers, troops, whatever, in Syria.

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 You may have seen this in the news, but a couple months ago, they were on routine patrol in Syria.

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And they're in an armored vehicle. These six soldiers are in this armored vehicle.

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 They pull into a town they're supposed to do recon on.

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 The thing pulls in, I don't know, like chicken scuttle.

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 People are kind of like looking through the windows. They're suspicious of this vehicle that pulled up.

299
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And these six British troops pop out. They got their guns at the ready. They're looking around.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 They see like, I imagine like a Western town, like there's like a guy, a tips his hat, and like the, they show the mortician.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He's like measuring out the coffins for them. A sign is swaying in the wind.

302
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And I know it's not a Western town. But anyways, they just embark from their armored vehicle. They get out.

303
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 They have just started to kind of swoop the town and all of a sudden within a basically they're just gunfire comes in from all angles.

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 They're shooting from buildings. They're shooting from alleyways. And all six soldiers are pinned down.

305
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Everyone's shooting at each other now. And the British soldiers are like, this is not going well because they're surrounded.

306
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And they're doing their best. They're fighting their best. But people are poking out of the windows and lighting them up.

307
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Bullets are just flying right past them, hitting the armored vehicle. That's next to them.

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 They're trying to regroup. They can't. They try to move away from the vehicle. They can't. They try to get into the vehicle.

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 They can't. They're stuck. They're pinned down.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And one of the soldiers looks and he sees a fighter in a building shooting and he sees two more soldiers in that same building.

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 They're just pinned down. There's no hope.

312
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Now one of the soldiers, he looks and he sees one of the gunmen shooting, peeking out from behind the window.

313
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

314
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Door to that house is open. He knows if he can get in that house, they can at least secure that building, give themselves a little bit of a security.

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 They can start working their way out of the circle of fire that they're in.

316
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Now this soldier doesn't just have his rifle with him.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 He has a dog and he looks down at the dog and he gives the order to enter that house.

318
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And the dog just takes off into that house.

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And that's when the soldiers start hearing a man screaming.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now the soldiers are getting a little bit more coverage.

321
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 They got one area of that circle of fire taken out.

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 The dog then runs out of the house, takes out two more jihadi soldiers, just mauls them.

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And then the other six, it turns out they were being surrounded by about nine soldiers.

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 The other six now, they're overpowered. It's like six on six now.

325
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But the British soldiers, the Special Forces, they're better trained. They retreat. The jihadi's retreat.

326
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 The soldiers then begin to recon the area, secure the area, they're safe.

327
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 They go into the house that the dog ran into. There's just a body on the ground and a clump of flesh in the corner of the room.

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 This attack dog, this military dog, ran up on a jihadi soldier who was firing on his squadmates and just ripped his throat out.

329
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Spitted out on the ground and then took off after two other targets.

330
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 That is awesome.

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 The dog was fine. Maybe had some scratches or bumps on him.

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Now of course the name of the dog they haven't revealed, the name of the squad members they haven't revealed.

333
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 They waited a couple months to tell the story and I'll put the link in here for security reasons.

334
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But it's funny because that dog was so well trained.

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Not just in being able to remain calm under fire. I mean that's hard for humans to do.

336
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 But then to go into this room and take him out with one bite and then to leave without the commands of his handler and take out two other soldiers.

337
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 How intelligent of a dog do you have to be to be that tactical?

338
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 I had a friend, I had a good friend of mine who was one day he was shopping for dogs.

339
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 He was shopping for a German shepherd and I go, "Oh, how much are you thinking about spending for it?"

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Because you know I'm thinking, "You go to the pound and you can get dogs."

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 You know I know some people will drop like a thousand bucks or like 500 bucks on a pit bull or whatever.

342
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And he goes, "Oh I'm thinking about dropping like a hundred grand."

343
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And I'm like, "What are you talking about? A hundred grand for a dog?" He goes, "Oh no, no, these dogs are bread."

344
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 They're about as smart as a fifth grader.

345
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Like intelligence wise. He was telling me all this stuff like you can train these dogs.

346
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 They'll patrol you like you take them around your house eventually they'll come up with their own patrols.

347
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They'll figure out like where they need to be at certain times. They're just super well trained.

348
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You have them meet each member of your family and so they get to know them.

349
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So it's not like these guys are walking around with just like your average like great day.

350
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Which they're smart dogs too, but you know what I mean. Like they're not walking around with pound puppies.

351
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 These dogs are go through military training and this dog was able to assess the situation,

352
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 take out multiple targets, uninjured, and allow these men to make their way out of this dangerous situation.

353
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 So bravo to Warpup. I'm sure he has a real name. They haven't revealed his name like I said, but.

354
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 We'll call him Warpup. I think that's a good enough name.

355
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Maybe someday they'll make a movie about him. I don't know. That would be kind of like that would be the whole movie I guess.

356
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Would just be like him doing that. Unless they did like a rocky story where that is the moment and like you see like first off he's a dog like little puppy and he has like a bad leg and the other dogs are making fun of him.

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Bam. You can make it an animated movie dude. You can make it a movie.

358
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 The whole movie is like a cartoon like a Pixar type cartoon and they show him like all the other puppies is like he was the smart he was the runt of the kennel until he was picked up and I don't know I can't do the trailer voice but anyway so like he's this little puppy who like everyone picks on and he's like all sad and then eventually he goes someday I'm going to be a soldier and they're like no you're not even though his name is Warpup they're like no you're not Warpup.

359
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 You're just a big nerd and he's like crying and then eventually like he meets an older dog who's kind of like scarred up and he's like I was a soldier and they kind of like Bond and then you have him meet this girl pup and she's like really cute and she's like kind of like a peace puppy and she's kind of like protesting the war but at the same time she like has the hots for him so you have like this cultural battle going on.

360
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 You have him finding the mentor you have him facing down the bullies so you have like this typical like Pixar cartoon and just like at the ending show him getting in the armored vehicle he's like waving goodbye to his cartoon girlfriend who's also like a puppy and she's like a peaceful puppy but she learns to love Warpup for who he is and like the old rugged pup actually he died in World War II and it was a ghost the whole time dude.

361
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 See man why I'm not a movie executive I don't know this dog story needs to be told but then again I guess I just told it so that might have fulfilled that factor.

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Well that's all we're going to talk about tonight this was our 25th episode which is kind of cool a little bit of a landmark so I'm happy about that but you know it's a daily show so it's not like I've been doing it for an extreme amount of time but still 25 episodes that's pretty cool.

363
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is our email on Twitter at Jason O. Carpenter website is dead rabbit.com where you can go there and look at all the show notes follow all the links to all the crazy articles that we've covered already 25 episodes.

364

 That's pretty awesome.

365
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 We are going to be back tomorrow we got some more stories for you I can finally erase masturbate in a cave off of my whiteboard.

366
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But in all you know joking aside I am glad that those kids got rescued back that was a really crazy story.

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And hopefully people stay out of those caves for a while especially during the rainy season you stay out of those caves too because if there's a cave in.

368
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 You're going to have to be faced how long will it take for you to start masturbating.

369
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 The eternal question that will never be answered but we try on Dead Rabbit Radio.
