1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 An upcoming lawsuit may reveal a piece of lost media.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:13,000
 What happens when a woman goes to the doctor to treat her asthma and instead becomes a medical freak?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,400
 And then we travel to India to take a look at a haunted train station that to this day,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
 people refuse to use after the sun goes down.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:31,800
 Everyone in town knows the story of a ghost that murdered a family today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:42,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we get to get started right away.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command with a pocket full of beavers.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
 It's Jackal for Lorne. Everyone give a round of applause to him.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,800
 He no longer has pants. The beavers. He apparently had wooden pants.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 The beavers ate them all. Jackal, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,800
 Just spread the word about the show. Talk about it online.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,800
 Talk about it to your friends. Help spread the word of Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
 That is another great way you can help the show out.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,800
 Jackal, I'm going to go ahead and throw you a pair of non-wooden pants.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
 And I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out too.

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
 A courthouse in Los Angeles.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 [Jackal makes a sound effect]

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
 As Jackal is driving in this old-timey Jalopy down Los Angeles,

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 I got to say something here real quick, guys.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,800
 I'm now back down to my pre-pandemic weight.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 I've lost 20 pounds since March 24th. I'm kicking my butt.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,800
 Lifting weights. I have this crazy stair routine that I do.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 And I'm really proud of myself. My diet is on point.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,800
 I have a really, really nice regulated, healthy diet that leaves me full at the end of the day.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,800
 I had a really hard time recording yesterday's episode.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 Like, yesterday's episode took nearly two hours to record.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 It doesn't sound like it. It sounds like a normal episode.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 But, and I like it. But it took me two hours to record.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
 It took me 20 minutes just to get it started.

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
 I had this block, this mental block.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 I was recording at 1 p.m. in the afternoon. It's super hot.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 I'm in a closet. I just couldn't figure the story out.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
 And I remember I've been doing so good on my physical fitness.

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
 I've been doing so good on my diet.

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,800
 I remember when I couldn't realize, I didn't know why I was having such a hard time getting the stories to work.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
 And I remember I had this little voice in my head saying, "Maybe you just need some caffeine."

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 Which I don't drink caffeine anymore.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
 "Maybe you just need some caffeine, Jason. Maybe that'll give you some pep."

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 "Maybe what you need is some sugar. Why don't you go get a cookie? Why don't you go get a scone?"

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 And I knew the answer wasn't edible.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 I knew it wasn't a delicious answer.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 So I sat down in that closet.

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
 That was basically probably a war crime in any country in this hot, hot closet.

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
 And I got the episode done.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
 The answer is never chemical.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
 If you're feeling bad, well, okay.

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
 If you actually need medicine for something, yes.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 But if you're feeling bad and you think, "Maybe I should just reach for that bottle."

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
 "Maybe things will get better if I smoke this doobie."

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,800
 "Maybe I'll feel a little bit better if I eat a whole carton of Ben & Jerry's ice cream."

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
 "Those things will make you feel better."

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 "Sure."

58
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 But they're not the answer to why you're feeling bad in the first place.

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 That's my message to you today.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 I got the episode done. I had a lot of fun with it. I thought it was funny.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 I loved how I was able to tell all these urban legends.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
 And in the end, I chose, I knew that sugar and caffeine was not going to make that episode work.

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
 I was going to make that episode work.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
 Words of encouragement if you are struggling with anything chemical.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 It could be as silly as a sugar addiction or a caffeine addiction.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 It could be something much more impactful to your health in the short term.

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 Sugar is more of a long term thing, but just, we all have each other's back here in the fluffle.

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 In this dead rabbit collective.

69
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 So, the answer is not chemical.

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 The answer is you.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 So Jack, we'll go ahead and pull up outside of this courthouse.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 The reason why we're in LA right now is because Marilyn Manson,

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 Shock, Rocker, and Marilyn Manson is being sued by a woman for sexual assault.

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 It's a civil case. It's not a criminal case.

75
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
 But she's alleging that he sexually assaulted her.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
 He's facing a couple of these cases.

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,800
 Again, I don't think he's being charged criminally because of statute of limitations and things like that.

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
 But he's being charged, he's being sued basically.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
 He's being charged in civil court.

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 And I believe there's two other cases, but we have this one.

81
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 I know there's been other accusations.

82
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 Now, full disclosure, I do really, really enjoy Marilyn Manson's music.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 I hope these allegations aren't true.

84
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
 I know the thing out there is saying, well, you know, that's what they get for hanging out with Marilyn Manson.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
 Like, what'd you expect?

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
 Well, I don't think you expect that.

87
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 That'd be like saying if someone's working at a liquor store and their brains get blown out, you're like, pfft, sorry, bro.

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
 That's what you get for working at a liquor store.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 Like, you can still have compassion for a victim.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
 I don't think that just because they're hanging out with Marilyn Manson, they deserved to get assaulted.

91
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 I really hope the accusations are not true.

92
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 I hope they aren't because I really like Marilyn Manson's music.

93
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 But the reason why we're talking about this here is because one of these women, she's going by the name Jane Doe in court documents,

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,800
 she is alleging that not only did Marilyn Manson sexually assault her,

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 he showed her a film, you're like, you can sue someone for showing you a movie? What?

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
 You're trying to sue Ryan Johnson right now?

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,800
 No, you can't sue somebody for showing you a movie, but it's part of her lawsuit.

98
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
 And I'm reading this article because I've been following the Marilyn Manson case.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 Again, I hope none of it's true.

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,800
 I'm reading this article and it says that he sexually assaulted her and then forced her to watch a video

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 where it made it appear that he murdered a young fan.

102
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 I was reading this article on crimeonline.com and I kind of froze for a second.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 I go, dude, did he show her groupie?

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,800
 So back in, I've heard of this lost media for 20 years.

105
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 This is, I always just thought it was a rumor, but apparently back in 1996.

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 So this has always been rumored. There's a clip of it on the end of one of his tour videos

107
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 or on one of his music videos.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
 There's a little clip and people go, oh, that's from the movie Groupie,

109
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,800
 but you never knew for sure because you could have just been part of this music video,

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 but here was the story.

111
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 There's a piece of lost media from 1996 that only three people had ever seen.

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 This is the plot of the movie.

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,800
 Well, it's not really a plot and you're going to realize really quickly why only three people saw it.

114
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,800
 It starts off with, if you have kids in the room, if you have kids in the room

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 and they have stuck around this far, usher them out.

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,800
 It starts off with Marilyn Manson giving this, his drummer, not just some random drummer

117
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 walking on the street, he's in a marching band.

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 Marilyn Manson's like, come here, sir.

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 It starts off with Marilyn Manson giving another guy a blowjob.

120
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,800
 In the description of the movie on the lost media wiki,

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 it says that Marilyn Manson, it goes really in a detail, right?

122
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
 It goes into detail even though only three people have supposedly seen this movie.

123
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,800
 Marilyn Manson is giving a blowjob to his drummer.

124
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 Maybe it was his bassist.

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
 It doesn't matter.

126
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 It doesn't matter who he's blowing, right?

127
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
 Marilyn Manson has given a blowjob to a member of his band

128
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,800
 and it says in the article that he's given a blowjob to this dude

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,800
 that it was a flaccid penis.

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 Like, okay, here's the thing, okay?

131
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 First off, I don't need that visual.

132
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 I didn't need the visual at all of Marilyn Manson blowing his bandmate

133
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 and I'm thinking when I read that, because I'm thinking,

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
 so what am I taking away, I don't read that and go, oh, Marilyn Manson's gay

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 because I didn't even cross my mind.

136
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 He's just a party dude and that's what he's doing.

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 It's one hell of a party with Marilyn Manson.

138
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 Marilyn Manson, I'm thinking when I read that, I didn't think Marilyn Manson was gay

139
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 or even bi.

140
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 I thought Marilyn Manson must be really, really bad at blowjobs.

141
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 And then it cuts to like a party, right?

142
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
 There's like a party going on at Marilyn Manson's house

143
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 and this woman shows up, like a fan of Marilyn Manson

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 and then he starts like bullying this girl.

145
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
 Like, she's a groupie, right?

146
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 He starts bullying this girl and everyone who's standing around is like,

147
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 "Dude, what the hell's going on? Marilyn Manson just blowing that dude."

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 I expected that.

149
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 It's Tuesday night, but does he really have to mistreat this young fan?

150
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 And then he goes, "Listen lady, if you want a party at my house,

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 you got to drink urine."

152
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
 And everyone else looks at their cup at the same time.

153
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
 They're like, "Oh man."

154
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
 The girl freaks out and Marilyn Manson goes,

155
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
 "Listen, don't worry, all drink the urine first.

156
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
 This is supposedly real movie."

157
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 And then Marilyn Manson drinks some urine and then the girl drinks urine

158
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
 and then they tie the girl to a chair and they pistol whip her

159
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 a couple times and put the gun to her head.

160
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,800
 Supposedly only three people have seen this movie in its entirety.

161
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 Marilyn Manson saw it.

162
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
 He's the one who edited it and put it all together.

163
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,800
 His manager, Tony Cayula, saw it and he told,

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 "This is in like the Las Media Wiki. This is part of the legend."

165
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 Because that's only bits and pieces.

166
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 We don't know everything that happens in the movie, but supposedly.

167
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 His manager, Tony, told Marilyn Manson,

168
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,800
 because he was like, "Oh dude, this isn't this awesome.

169
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,800
 This is filmed back in 1996, so his career is just starting off.

170
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
 Look at how edgy and cool I am."

171
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,800
 His manager, Tony, said, "Don't ever release this movie.

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 If you release this movie, I can guarantee you."

173
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 And it's interesting because this quote, I saw this quote years ago.

174
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
 He goes, "I guarantee you if you release this movie,

175
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
 it will be used against you in a criminal trial.

176
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
 This is atrocious. Don't release this."

177
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
 And now, here we are in 2021, it's possibly being used against him

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 in a criminal trial.

179
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,800
 And his manager, Tony, his manager since 1996, just dropped him.

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,800
 He said, "I'm done." He cut ties with Marilyn Manson.

181
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,800
 The other person who saw it was Andy Dick, also an infamous comedian.

182
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
 He was on news radio. He did a lot of really funny stand-up,

183
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 but I also think he got hit with some pretty serious sexual assault allegations a while back.

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
 So, we only have the three witnesses who have seen the movie,

185
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
 and we still have, where are these descriptions coming from?

186
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
 There is a clip of it.

187
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 There is a clip of it attached to one of his DVDs,

188
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 one of his music videos or tour videos where you see a woman tied up.

189
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
 You don't really see her face.

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 You don't see much.

191
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 You just hear her voice and you hear him threatening her.

192
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,800
 People always said that was from Groopy,

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 but the whole film Groopy has been lost media for nearly, what, 25 years at this point.

194
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,800
 Another part of the Groopy story, too, is that the victim was actually in on it.

195
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 She was hired by Marilyn Manson.

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 He was trying to shock the audience and everything was totally fine.

197
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 The girl was never killed or anything like that.

198
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
 It was all acting.

199
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 But the thing, we have no way to verify that,

200
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
 because we've never seen the movie.

201
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
 We don't know who the girl is.

202
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 And now we have this news article coming out in 2021 where it says it appears that the woman died.

203
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 It appears that the woman was killed in the film,

204
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 so now it's gone from a lost media where a girl gets pistol whipped

205
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,800
 to possibly lost media that may have a snuff component to it.

206
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
 I can't imagine his man.

207
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 I mean, Marilyn Manson is a pretty rough and tumble guy as far as his image is concerned.

208
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 It would have to be pretty rough for his manager to watch it and be like, "Don't ever release this."

209
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 Considering he wrote books where he would talk about doing horrible things to people.

210
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 So I can't imagine, like Tony's reading the book, he's like, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

211
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 So I can't imagine, like Tony's reading the book, he's like, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

212
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:51,800
 I don't know in a civil lawsuit if you can compel somebody to release...

213
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,800
 I know in a criminal lawsuit that police could say, "We're getting a copy of that video."

214
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,800
 100%. The prosecutor can order you to turn over stuff.

215
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
 I don't know how that will work in a civil defense.

216
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 Who knows? It'll be interesting to see.

217
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 I don't... it will most likely come out.

218
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 We will see, though.

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 Jackal for Lorne.

220
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbon helicopter.

221
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 We're going to save the medical freak story for tomorrow

222
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 because that Marilyn story went on a little bit longer than I thought.

223
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 Jackal, let's go ahead and leave Marilyn Manson's mansion.

224
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 We are headed out to India.

225
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 [imitates gunshot]

226
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 Specifically, we're headed to B. Gunn Kodor.

227
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,800
 That's in the Perilla district in West Bengal.

228
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 Jackal, go ahead and bring this carbon helicopter down nice and low.

229
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 The year is 1960.

230
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 Choo choo!

231
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 The very first train is running into the B. Gunn Kodor railway station.

232
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 Kids are standing outside with balloons waving.

233
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 The conductor is giving them a big thumbs up.

234
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 And he's like, "Get out of the way! Get out of the way! They're on the tracks!"

235
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 [imitates gunshot]

236
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 It was a bad first day to the railway station.

237
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 But after they cleaned the front of the engine, everything is A-OK.

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 This railway station is just one of many railway stations throughout the region.

239
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 And everything's fine for the first seven years.

240
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,800
 But in 1967, the station master of the B. Gunn Kodor railway station,

241
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
 one night he was walking around the station all alone.

242
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 And he sees a figure in the distance.

243
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 A phantom.

244
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,800
 A ghost of a young woman floating around the railway station.

245
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
 The next day, he starts telling people about the ghost.

246
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 People just want to take the train home.

247
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 He's like, "No, no, there was a ghost here last night."

248
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 They're like, "I don't really care. I'm here during the day. Ghosts aren't spooky."

249
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
 He starts telling people about the ghost.

250
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 No one believes him.

251
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 No one believes him. He's like, "Why can't you guys believe me?

252
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 Sure, you trust me enough to put you on a locomotive that goes 100 miles an hour,

253
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 but you won't listen to me about ghosts?"

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 "Fine. Get on your train and be gone."

255
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 So no one believes that he actually saw this ghost, but he keeps telling people,

256
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
 "There's a ghost here. This place is haunted."

257
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 No one would believe him, and then one day, travelers show up to the train station,

258
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 and they're like, "That's weird. The station master's not here.

259
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 I was waiting here for another hilarious ghost story and make fun of the man for being insane."

260
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
 [knocking]

261
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,800
 "Station master, are you in your home? That's here?" He lived at the railway station for some reason.

262
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 "Hey, the trains are fine. We just were wondering if you were okay,

263
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 because normally you're out there talking about slimer."

264
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 "Eee?"

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 "Oh, I actually have a real door now. I can make real sound effects."

266
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 They open the station master's door.

267
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
 [door creaking]

268
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 His entire family had been slaughtered.

269
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
 [gagging]

270
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 Imagine like quick cuts.

271
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 Reach for those noises. Imagine that. Rewind it and then imagine that.

272
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 His entire family was slaughtered in the middle of the night.

273
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 So the legend goes that the ghost woman killed the whole family.

274
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 I talked about on yesterday's episode, the most difficult episode ever recorded.

275
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 I talked about ghost killing people is extremely rare.

276
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,800
 It's extremely rare. We don't see it a lot, even in made-up stories.

277
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 I mean, outside of like your babysitter telling you a story.

278
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 Local legends even don't have a lot of ghost killing people.

279
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 So now we've covered two back-to-back, which is quite an anomaly.

280
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,800
 But here we have in 1967 an entire family slaughtered by a ghost and not a vengeful spirit.

281
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,800
 Well, I mean, it might have been a little pissed off if it's going to kill the whole family,

282
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,800
 but it's not generally in the ghost stories we've covered where the ghost kills somebody.

283
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 They're killing their murderer.

284
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 I can't think of another story where an unrelated ghost murders a family.

285
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 But this story also plays into yesterday's episode because it gets...

286
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 I didn't really thought about this until yesterday's episode.

287
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 How closely related urban legends are to a traditional ghost story?

288
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 The ghost story of you waking up in your loved one at the foot of your bed.

289
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,800
 That's a pleasing memory. That's a nice story.

290
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
 I'm not talking about stuff like that.

291
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 I'm not talking about stuff where people are taking photographs of orbs either.

292
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 I'm talking about the stories where people go to an old-timey hotel

293
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,800
 and they see a phantom walking down the hallway and they start to go,

294
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 "Who was that? I saw this fan of me who's wearing a tuxedo, had a little top hat on. Who was that?"

295
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
 And then the urban legend starts it backtracks.

296
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
 Well, there used to be a guy here named Slimy McGee.

297
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 Slimer, eat all hot dogs at the gin joint.

298
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 There used to be a guy here named Slimy McGee. Nobody liked him.

299
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,800
 He was really mean to the prostitutes and one day someone shot him in the brain

300
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 and he was always known to wear a top hat to cover up the bullet hole as he was dying.

301
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 He's like, "Oh, I'm so embarrassed. Give me my top hat."

302
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 You know what I mean? The stories get made up.

303
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 There's a ghost sighted and they're like, "Yeah, we call him Tommy. It's a little cake."

304
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 We hear that a lot. We hear it like there's ghostly activity and then sometimes they bring in a medium

305
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 but a lot of times they just make up a story.

306
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 We think it was Sister Agnes who got away with murdering that guy at the whorehouse and then died peacefully in her sleep at the age of 90.

307
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:16,800
 Do you know what I mean? I think urban legends and ghost stories are more related than I really ever thought.

308
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
 We run into the same thing here.

309
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 But this really falls outside of urban legend because this one had real economic impact.

310
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 He was talking to this ghost all the time. Every time he saw him walking up, he just wanted him to punch your ticket

311
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 or make sure the trains had working engines and weren't going to blow up in the middle of a tunnel or something like that.

312
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,800
 He wanted to talk about ghosts. So he talked about ghosts all the time.

313
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 When his family is killed, people rightfully so decide, "I'm not going to use that train station anymore."

314
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 I mean, if I have a 1% chance of being murdered by not just me, my entire family being slaughtered by a ghost

315
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 or I can get in my car, drive to the nearest train station and then take that across the region, I'll do that.

316
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 I might pay a little bit more in gas, a little more wear and tear on my car, but I won't be murdered by a ghost.

317
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,800
 This story actually caused the railway station to be shut down.

318
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 It was very quickly considered one of the top 10 most haunted railway stations in all of India.

319
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 Spoiler alert, there's a lot of them. The landmass of India is huge. There's a ton of train stations.

320
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 And I looked at some of the other 10, an orb floating by the train tracks, a silhouette of a man walking by a window.

321
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:49,800
 Lame stuff. These ghosts don't murder nobody. Lame stuff. This is the only one that you had a murder connected to.

322
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 So this train station, in real, this is not an urban legend, got shut down from 1967 to the 1990s.

323
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:07,800
 When finally local people go, "Listen, Grandpa, I know you're really afraid of the spooky, spooky ghost that probably doesn't exist at the train station."

324
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 And it's probably all made up. But Grandpa, we need to have a working rail station in this area.

325
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,800
 So in the late 1990s, locals petitioned the state government to reopen it.

326
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 And they had a theory, they formed this committee and they had a theory. We don't believe that it's haunted.

327
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 The other nine most haunted railway stations, maybe they are. This one's not haunted.

328
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 And they said, "I bet you anything," that the employees of the railway station made the story up because they didn't want to work in this region.

329
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 That it was just an excuse. Which is so funny because I talked about that on Monday's episode.

330
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,800
 I talked about the workers you got hired to knock down the haunted house on the military base and they're like,

331
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,800
 "Oh no, I'm having hallucinations and headaches. I guess the ghosts have got me too."

332
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,800
 And it took them years to knock down this building because the employees kept complaining about wanting to murder their families,

333
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 wanting to kill their families because of ghosts. And I said, "That'd be an easy thing to make up. Boss, I can't commit a day.

334
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,800
 I'm possessed. I'm possessed by a ghost that's making me super lazy."

335
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 So that was the thing, they go, "It's probably not haunted."

336
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 In India, it's interesting you had, they call them rationalists over there.

337
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 So I think it's kind of the cross between a skeptic and an actual ghost hunter.

338
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 They kept talking about these paranormal groups, these researchers who went out to the railway station

339
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,800
 and would confirm over and over again that this railway station is not haunted.

340
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
 This is not one of the haunted stations.

341
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
 So the locals are saying this was a myth made up because no one wanted to work here.

342
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 You have these groups, these paranormal investigators saying that they're even saying it's not haunted.

343
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 So in the year 2009, they do reopen the station.

344
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 Think about it, this has been closed for 42 years.

345
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 For 42 years this railway station was closed because a family died and it was believed it was caused by a ghost.

346
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 The railway station is now reopened in 2009.

347
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 10 different routes pass through this railway station every single day.

348
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 But there's no passengers to pick up once the sun goes down.

349
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 It turns into a ghost station, not a literal ghost station, but a metaphorical ghost station.

350
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 After the sun goes down, no one is at the train station.

351
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,800
 Trains still pass through, trains still stop there, but no one gets off, no one gets on.

352
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 The last train comes through at 9pm and a couple minutes before 9pm.

353
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 A car shows up at the parking lot, an employee has to drive from home,

354
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 go to the ticket booth, stand there for a couple minutes, all alone, that's the scariest job, right?

355
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 They stand at that ticket booth, no one ever buys a ticket, but just in case.

356
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 The train leaves, the person then shuts the ticket booth back down, leaves the train station, it reopens the next day.

357
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 When the sun sets, the train station for all intents and purposes is closed.

358
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 Because of this story of this ghost that murdered family.

359
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,800
 You go Jason, you keep saying that, but at the end of the day a ghost did murder a family.

360
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 Would you work there?

361
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 Well, this is really interesting.

362
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 I did so much research on this story.

363
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 And I was looking through all of these lists of like the 10 most haunted India train stations.

364
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 All of these, because this is a very, very well known story.

365
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 It had a massive economic impact on the region.

366
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 You need trains here.

367
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,800
 I'm reading these stories all over, I'm reading these stories all over the internet.

368
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 But I finally came across one.

369
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 It was an article in the India Express, it was an article written by Ravik Bhatchakhira.

370
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 Again, this story has been going around since 1967.

371
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 And it's repeated all over the internet.

372
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 It got the railway station shut down.

373
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 To this day, if you want to buy a ticket after sunset, you're out of luck.

374
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 The India Express had an article with Rapparti Mahato, an 80-year-old man.

375
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 So he was alive during these ghost murders.

376
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 And out of all these articles I read, thank you Ravik for finding this quote.

377
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 Out of all the articles I read, only one of them had this information.

378
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 Here's a quote from Rappati Mahato.

379
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 "The station master," so this person knew the station master.

380
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 Very, very important.

381
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 "The station master was a musician and very friendly.

382
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 But then some goons misbehaved with his daughter."

383
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 He left, telling the railways the station was haunted.

384
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 In 1967, they shut it down.

385
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 So it was made up.

386
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 It was 100% made up.

387
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 He left.

388
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,800
 And if anything, he sounds like a disgruntled employee.

389
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,800
 We don't have any information on what happened.

390
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps here.

391
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
 This is what I think, just from this quote.

392
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 And we're taking this quote at face value.

393
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 This guy may be lying and the family did really get murdered.

394
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 But I think that I was never able to find any proof that the family was murdered.

395
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
 Or how they were murdered.

396
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
 Were they poisoned? Were they strangled?

397
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 I mean, I'm not some gore-ound.

398
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
 There's a big difference between everyone dying in a house due to carbon monoxide.

399
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 It's a tragedy.

400
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 That's big different than all of their veins were pulled out of their body.

401
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 Like, one second was impossible.

402
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 Like, if it's a ghost, how does this kill the whole family?

403
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 Were they brutally slaughtered?

404
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
 Were they peacefully dying to sleep? Who knows?

405
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 There was never any details.

406
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,800
 But here we have this article in the India Express.

407
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,800
 And you have this quote from a guy who's 80 years old who knew the dude.

408
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 It's very rare when we're able to trace back a real beginning to an urban legend.

409
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 And he made it up.

410
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 It almost sounds like he was a disgruntled employee.

411
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 Maybe the goons worked for the railway station.

412
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,800
 Maybe he couldn't go to the police because what they did didn't rise to the level of police intervention.

413
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 They're just like, "Hey, baby, show me the melons."

414
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 Or something like that. Back in 1967, that wasn't really against the law.

415
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 So it could be something like that.

416
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 And then he tried getting them fired. And who knows?

417
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 But he quit and moved away.

418
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 And as he's walking away, he goes, "Hey, by the..."

419
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 As he's walking away, he goes, "Hey, everyone, guess what? The whole place is haunted."

420
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 It's haunted. There's a ghost here.

421
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 They believed him so much.

422
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 The locals believed this story so much that he quit.

423
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
 And then they thought he got murdered.

424
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
 He convinced... I don't know how... It's interesting.

425
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 I don't know if he was slowly planting the ghost story over time.

426
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,800
 Or if he was literally like, as the train was pulling out, he goes,

427
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 "Guys, look out behind you. There's a ghost."

428
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 And everyone turned around.

429
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 And then they turned back and the train was gone.

430
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 They're like, "Oh my God, what happened to the family?"

431
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
 Did he spend days and weeks trying to convince people it was haunted?

432
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 I have to imagine he did that.

433
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 But it was definitely a plan. He laid out.

434
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,800
 He convinced people it was haunted so they would shut down the railway.

435
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:32,800
 He was that disgruntled of an employee that he economically crippled the entire area for 42 years.

436
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
 That's pretty dope.

437
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,800
 Like, out of all the disgruntled employee stories, I don't think I've ever come across one

438
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 where he ended up punishing like 2 million people, 2 million local residents.

439
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
 Fascinating adventure looking into the story.

440
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 I was just looking for a fun ghost story, because I spent all last week reading a bunch of ghost stories.

441
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 That's why there's so many this week.

442
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,800
 And instead, we were able to find a ghost story that, one, involved a murderous ghost, which is incredibly rare.

443
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 Two, caused a bunch of people to lose their jobs.

444
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 That's unheard of. I don't think I've ever come across a ghost with that heavy of an economic impact.

445
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:16,800
 And three, find the origin of the story from some random quote in this article.

446
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 It was like buried in the... it wasn't like flashing headline. It never happened.

447
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,800
 It was in this whole article about this haunted train, just buried deep in it.

448
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 Stumbled across the... fascinating story.

449
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 So if you ever open a business, be careful if a super old dude shows up.

450
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 Who looks like he probably had a job as a station master in the year 1967.

451
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,800
 You see this old decrepit dude walk in, and he's like, "I'd like a job, please!"

452
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 You're like, "Yeah, I work in heavy manufacturing. You're 97 years old. I'm sure you can do it."

453
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 Be careful who you hire, because that person you hire may actually be someone with a little twinkle in their eye.

454
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 Sure, they do everything just right.

455
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 Sure, they're the best employee you ever had. You wake up each morning, there's a cup of coffee ready for you.

456
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 You're like, "How did he get into my house?" But this man has a plan.

457
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 And one day you wake up, there's no coffee next to you. You go, "Oh no, where'd Henry go? He's my best employee."

458
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 He was the best. And then you walk to your workplace, and everyone's gone.

459
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 And there's a note on the door, and it just says, "You've just been booed."

460
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 You're like, "What? That doesn't make any sense." And then you open it up, and there's more of an explanation.

461
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,800
 It says, "I didn't like the way you treated me last night."

462
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 You're like, "What did I see you last night?" And then it says, "So I've told everyone at work your place is haunted."

463
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 "Good luck getting new customers now." Your friend, your friend Henry.

464
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
 Or Harry, whatever his name was, you're like, "No!"

465
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 I think the moral of the story is be careful who you hire, because at any moment you can tell everyone your business is haunted,

466
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 and it can get shut down.

467
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 And in the end, the business you spent so long creating, it just got booed.

00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,800

 I shrugged my shoulders after that one. After yesterday's episode, that was about as good as it is in the end.

470
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 I literally shrugged my shoulders. I like the ending. I like the ending.

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,800
 I'd say that was 7 out of 10 maybe.

472
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 You're being super generous.
