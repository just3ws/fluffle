1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
 Does a forest in California hold the secrets to time travel?

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,960
 And then we take a look at a bizarre phenomenon that's happening all over the world.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:22,560
 Why are people reporting that in the middle of the day the sun disappears?

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,560
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,560

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,200
 Someone who I know always has the best plans for the weekend walking into Dead Rabbit Command

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,440
 One of our newest Patreon supporters.

 Woohoo walk through that door Greenacre.

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,360
 Greenacre they get a little cheered, they get a little danced, they get a little danced

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
 as you're walking in.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,920
 Greenacre you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

 Seriously no problem.

21

 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,560
 That is how you can help the show grow.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,280
 Greenacre1234 let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,360
 We're gonna jump off the highest point at Dead Rabbit Command Glideus all the way out

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 too.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:36,800
 San Marcos, California.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,720
 Greenacre keep flying us out here.

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,920
 We're headed out to San Marcos but we're not going to the city itself.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,360
 Nearby is a place that sounds magical.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,280
 And some people, a lot of people actually online, say that it is.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
 But they probably want to use the word magical.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,640
 That's why I guess nobody actually says it's magical but there's definitely something paranormal

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
 going on here.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,720
 If the reports are to be believed outside of San Marcos, California, which that's I believe

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,080
 in Southern California out of all the details and research that's the one thing I didn't

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
 double check.

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,520
 It's near the coast though I know that.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,680
 There's a place called Harmony Grove.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,120
 Sounds pretty nice.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,600
 Also known as Elphin Forest Recreational Reserve and this is a big patch of beautiful trees

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,880
 and forested area that the government has said don't touch.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
 Don't touch.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,240
 We gotta keep this place pristine.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,760
 Now it seems like they were a little late, they're a little late pulling the trigger on

45
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,760
 that because it did get encroached in kind of on all sides by development.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,560
 So we have this, it's about 740 acres of woodland.

47
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,360
 But then there's like roads and Popeyes chickens and all that stuff just right outside.

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,320
 But what we have now has been preserved and it's not just preserved because it's beautiful

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,240
 because there's trees everywhere in America right?

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,800
 This place has some historical significance.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,240
 They believe, historians believe that there had been Native American tribes living in

52
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,920
 this area up to 9,000 years ago.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,560
 They found artifacts there.

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
 They found petrographs.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,760
 So it has some historical significance in the area.

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,080
 The idea is though that although they may have had one tribe that settled in the area,

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,400
 a lot of different tribes used Elphin Forest as a meeting place.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
 That makes sense right?

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
 You'd want to meet some place beautiful if you were thinking about declaring war against

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,320
 another tribe you'd be like let's do it among the groves.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,960
 Let's look at the trees above us.

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,600
 Maybe it'll make us less likely to start a war.

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,200
 Maybe we can make a bunch of arrows behind their backs.

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
 We're like picking up twigs and stuff.

65
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
 It makes sense.

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
 It makes sense.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,200
 I guess nowadays when two nations want to like not fight, they go and indoors.

68
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,600
 They go into like a building.

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,800
 I guess at what was it?

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,720
 World War or Civil War?

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,440
 They did it on a train.

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
 Seems a little tricky.

73
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 The train's moving.

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,960
 You're trying to sign the peace treaty.

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,600
 The train's all bumping you around.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,000
 I think actually like the train had stopped at that point.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,440
 But it would make sense if you wanted to stop a war to do it in a beautiful place.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,680
 You'd be like listen bros do we really want to start dropping bombs?

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,840
 Look at this awesome orange tree right next to you.

80
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,760
 They're like yeah who wants to blow up an orange tree?

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,720
 So the native tribes in the area use this place to have meetings.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,640
 And then you had other tribes that pretty much just use this place all the time.

83
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
 They lived there.

84
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
 Beautiful place.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,560
 But what's happened now when people go to this area and it is pretty touristy.

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,600
 You have locals constantly driving through this area because it's a short cut.

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,520
 Get out of the way orange trees driving over them with your bulldozer.

88
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,320
 I'm on my way to bulldozing school.

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,120
 People nowadays go yeah the trees are nice and all but it's actually really creepy.

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,080
 Like it seems like the whole area is infused with dark energy.

91
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,880
 So how did it go from being this place where you had people wanting to go?

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
 Well people still want to go there.

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,120
 It's not like you got to put a gun in someone's head and take them to the forest unless you're

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
 kidnapping them and taking them to the forest.

95
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,640
 But you used to have the tribes go here to talk issues out or just to meet.

96
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
 Just meet and greet.

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
 Exchange info.

98
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,760
 Why is it so charged with negative energy?

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,200
 It's interesting because locals do say this place is creepy.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,480
 You'll find a lot of articles about Elphin Forest.

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,320
 Harmony, Grove, all this stuff.

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
 Let's take a look at why this place may be charged with negative energy.

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,640
 It's fascinating because a lot of urban legends, when I'm reading all this stuff, the newspaper

104
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,960
 articles, I can find several newspaper articles that talk about these events.

105
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,600
 Some websites are more convinced that these things actually happen.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,720
 Other websites go well this is a local legend.

107
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,640
 But apparently back in the 19th century you still had a local tribe in the area using

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
 this patch of land.

109
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,760
 But you also had a bunch of gypsies show up.

110
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,640
 A bunch of West Coast gypsies and they found Elphin Forest and they go, "Hey, let's set

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,280
 up gypsy camps here."

112
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,680
 Now the natives weren't down with that.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
 They didn't want that.

114
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,040
 There's a bunch of interlopers hanging out among their trees.

115
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,200
 And then the settlers who had moved over here, right, people who'd come over for the gold

116
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,920
 rush, they just didn't like gypsies.

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,720
 They thought they were spooky, magical thieves.

118
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,880
 So whoever it was, whether it was the native tribe or the gold rush dudes, they wiped out

119
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,040
 this gypsy camp.

120
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
 Killed everybody.

121
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,760
 Again, you would find articles saying this did happen and other articles say we don't

122
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,400
 know, this is the story that's in the area.

123
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,200
 But apparently by doing this they've spawned the legend of the witch.

124
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,280
 The witch of Elphin Forest.

125
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,080
 There's sightings of this phantom to this day.

126
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,640
 What it is, it's a witch that really, I mean at a certain point it blurs the line between

127
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,240
 a paranormal phenomenon and a flesh and blood cryptid.

128
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,640
 Very, very interesting phenomenon that may be going on here at Elphin Forest.

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,960
 People say if you go out, well first off if any story ever starts off with, if you go out

130
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,680
 late at night, it's probably an urban legend because definitely it should be, if it was

131
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,640
 a flesh and blood thing you'd see during the day.

132
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,480
 Or maybe not an urban legend, but at least maybe not a cryptid like I was saying.

133
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,560
 But if you go out late at night, you may see the witch.

134
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,760
 But it's not just some lame old witch, right?

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,640
 This witch rides a horse, which automatically makes it more frightening.

136
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:41,200
 If you had to choose between fighting a witch or fighting a witch and they were on a horse,

137
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
 the horse makes it scarier, right?

138
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,240
 You could probably take a witch, you could probably beat them up before they cast too

139
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
 many spells on you.

140
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,960
 But whether or not you win a fist fight with a witch, the horse is going to trample you

141
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
 to death.

142
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,520
 She's on the back of this huge black stallion and if you enter the forest, her forest, she

143
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,920
 knows.

144
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,120
 She knows where you're at at all times.

145
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,040
 She's omnipotent when you're in her forest.

146
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,640
 And this is a very interesting thing, we covered something like this just this week.

147
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,960
 Once you're in her forest, the witch knows where you're at.

148
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,400
 And if she wants to, she'll actually come to seek you out.

149
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,960
 But you won't see her, you won't hear her.

150
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,000
 But she's on her horse walking through the forest.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,040
 And if she sees you and you don't see her, she puts a psychic brand on you.

152
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,560
 She actually marks your soul.

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
 That's it.

154
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
 That's it.

155
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
 Nothing too bad.

156
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,880
 Just a standard soul scorching burn.

157
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
 You get to go home.

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,360
 You go home, you're out on your hike, you walk through Elphin Forest.

159
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 No big deal.

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,280
 But if you ever return to Elphin Forest, you'll die.

161
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,920
 You'll just die right on the spot.

162
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,880
 Apparently, it's like almost like a time-released ward.

163
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,200
 I mean, technically, you figure why doesn't she just kill them then the first time?

164
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 Who knows?

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
 Who knows, right?

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
 Gypsy.

167
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
 Gypsy magic could be weird, probably is.

168
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
 And she can do that as well.

169
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,280
 Other people say that that's if you don't see her.

170
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,480
 If you're walking through the forest, she'll come up behind you and she'll brand you.

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,440
 You ever come back to the forest, you die.

172
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,680
 That should, if that part of the legend was true, you should see a couple of Trip Advisor

173
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
 bad reviews on the place.

174
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
 Man, like, I loved it.

175
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,680
 The first time my uncle took me, but the second time he died.

176
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,040
 She can also just kill you where you stand.

177
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,680
 Apparently, if she sees you and you see her, she shoots green beams.

178
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
 She shoots.

179
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,560
 I mean, at a certain point, it does just sound like something you tell your little sister

180
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,760
 to make her not go into the forest.

181
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,040
 She shoots green beams out of her eyes and it kills you on the spot.

182
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,160
 It's interesting to think that on the one hand, like, yes, in the world of the paranormal,

183
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,760
 that's all believable.

184
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,400
 The other thing you wonder, like, how do-- I have this about a lot of stories.

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,360
 How do we know that?

186
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,160
 If you see her and she sees you, she'll shoot green beams out of her eyes and blow you up.

187
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
 Which, as I said, it doesn't say that it blows you up.

188
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,120
 It's like this 1980s action explosion that you die.

189
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,040
 Obviously, the only person, the only people who would be able to tell that story would

190
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,000
 be the people who died.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,880
 I mean, I guess if you were standing next to your uncle and he's like, "Ah, yes, I just

192
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
 filled out five stars on Trip Advisor, my favorite place."

193
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,280
 And then you saw a witch and he saw the witch and the witch only blew him up.

194
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,360
 I mean, I guess you could go and tell people that.

195
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
 You'd survive, right?

196
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 You'd be able to survive.

197
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,000
 I don't think the police-- if you told the police that you're not telling anyone else,

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
 you're probably going to a mental hospital.

199
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,920
 No, no, I swear, the witch shot him with green beams.

200
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,120
 So I mean, where are these stories coming from?

201
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,720
 I will say-- let's rate these on the-- let's rate this on the haunted forest meter.

202
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,840
 I would give the legend of the witch maybe a three out of five-- three out of five eye

203
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,840
 beams, because it's spooky.

204
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,800
 I actually like the idea of her leaving the psychic mark on you better, because then--

205
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
 I don't know.

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,960
 I guess it's all-- I guess it's all-- it sounds like an urban legend, but it all sounds like

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,560
 fable, but it's a little more realistic.

208
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,960
 You could say, "Well, I'm a medium.

209
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:29,320
 I can sense the spirit world and the witch put a mark on me, and now I'm not a medium

210
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 anymore.

211
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,040
 I'm just a low.

212
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,160
 I can only talk to some spirits.

213
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,720
 She scarred my psychic abilities."

214
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,000
 If the legend is, if you see her and she sees you, you die.

215
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,320
 There'd be no one left to tell that legend, but that's not all we have to talk about here

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,400
 at Elfin Forest.

217
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,880
 There is a-- again, interesting-- on the one hand, if it was just the story of the witch,

218
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,440
 I would go, "Well, that's just an interesting paranormal place and might be haunted."

219
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,600
 Let's take a look at another one of the phenomenon that appears to be happening Elfin Woods.

220
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,480
 I'd love to check this place out.

221
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 This sounds really dope.

222
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
 I mean, it's funny because some of the-- like I said, this is reported on local newspapers.

223
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,000
 This is a big thing in the area.

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,840
 People are constantly talking about it.

225
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,720
 They say-- they'll talk about the witch shooting laser beams out of her eyes, right?

226
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 And next, the sports section.

227
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,440
 They'll talk about that, but then they'll also just say-- some of the articles don't mention

228
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,560
 the witch, but they'll say there are hundreds, hundreds of paranormal stories.

229
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
 All sightings in the woods here.

230
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,320
 This is something that's been known for generations.

231
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,040
 Even if you're able to-- just like UFO sightings-- disregarded 90% of them, you're still having

232
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
 a ton of sightings in this area.

233
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,720
 I'd love to go out there.

234
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,160
 There are no trespassing signs in certain parts of it.

235
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,000
 We'll get to that in a second.

236
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,880
 But let's go back to this other major phenomenon in the area.

237
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,640
 It's the Great Owl.

238
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,840
 This owl is a 10-foot tall-- not 10-foot wingspan.

239
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
 10, 10 feet tall.

240
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,880
 There's a huge difference between the two.

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:14,360
 A 10-foot tall owl-- so its wingspan has to just be massive-- that after dark, it will

242
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,160
 attack hikers walking through the woods.

243
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,800
 This 10-foot owl will come after you.

244
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,320
 Now, not-- it would be one thing if it was just buzzing in your head.

245
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,120
 You're like, ah, that was a big owl.

246
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,280
 And then you're just continuing your slow walk through the forest.

247
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,240
 This dude eats people.

248
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,480
 This owl will eat you.

249
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,040
 Again, the citation needed.

250
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,560
 I'm not saying you're out in the forest right now.

251
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
 Listen to this.

252
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,920
 You're like, oh no, he's speaking about this.

253
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,280
 Like, it happens every single day.

254
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,520
 The legends say that this owl can actually kill and devour a human.

255
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,840
 And it enjoys it.

256
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,160
 It actually loves to hunt people down and eat them.

257
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,600
 And you're not even safe in your car.

258
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,040
 And it's so interesting to think of this area because the area itself is crisscrossed with

259
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,680
 roads.

260
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,240
 Like the witch will ride her horse.

261
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
 The witch will ride her horse just straight down the middle of the road.

262
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,320
 And cars are driving by.

263
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,440
 There have been reports that this witch or a lady in white, which also is constantly running

264
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,440
 across the street, causes car accidents.

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,840
 And the authorities in the area say we get more car accidents in Elphin Forest than we

266
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 should.

267
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,600
 Like statistically, for this stretch of road, we should not be having 24 car accidents a

268
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
 year.

269
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,800
 But we seem to run into those with Elphin Road, with the roads in this area.

270
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,640
 But we seem to run into that with the roads in this area.

271
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,000
 This owl will eat people.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,400
 There's no, there is no police report of the cops finding a giant owl pellet, a giant

273
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
 piece of owl pooping them, digging through it.

274
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,040
 Like it's a little science kit they got at a toy store.

275
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,440
 And finding human skull.

276
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,600
 There have been no reports of, there have been no official reports, I should say, of humans

277
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,920
 being eaten by giant owls.

278
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,640
 But this owl likes to eat people so much that let's say you are in your car.

279
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
 You're driving down the road.

280
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,320
 You're just trying to take a shortcut.

281
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,320
 He'll rip the roof off your car and eat you.

282
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,680
 Again, there's no police reports of that.

283
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,160
 But stories say that'll come after you.

284
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,680
 That's a pretty violent cryptid.

285
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,440
 It's funny, I keep saying cryptid, it could be more classified as a ghost or a gypsy curse

286
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,640
 even.

287
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,640
 It's funny because cryptids often have wards against them.

288
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,240
 Like well if you do this, if you make sure that you keep your teeth covered then the

289
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
 horse lady won't see you.

290
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,080
 That's an actual, that's one of my favorite cryptids honestly.

291
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,480
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

292
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
 It's super creepy.

293
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,520
 You know, there's no way to ward, there's no way to ward an office to not be anywhere

294
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,600
 around it.

295
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
 This owl will eat you if he finds you.

296
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,960
 It's not that you can be like, well flip three coins in the air and if they both land tails

297
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
 he'll leave you.

298
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
 No, he'll eat you.

299
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,280
 He'll eat you and he'll eat the coin and then he'll poop you guys off in a giant big

300
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
 pellet together.

301
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,920
 We got one more place to check out in this area and this is where, this is what I love

302
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,000
 about Urban Legends.

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,840
 I love about talking about this stuff, researching this stuff for the show is to find, because

304
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,560
 obviously I'm finding all these stories and I go, are these true?

305
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,800
 Are these the really giant owl flying around in California?

306
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,280
 I will look into it.

307
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,520
 A lot of these stories talked about an abandoned insane asylum.

308
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,680
 There's abandoned insane asylum in Elfin Forest.

309
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,080
 These are actually the easiest things to prove or disprove because somewhere there has to

310
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 be a record of this.

311
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,320
 I was not able to find proof that there was a gypsy colony there in the 19th century.

312
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,400
 That's pretty hard.

313
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,160
 But a brick and mortar insane asylum, there will be news articles in it of some sort,

314
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,640
 right, of it opening or closing or Wikipedia article about it closing because a giant

315
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,200
 owl was dressed up as a doctor and ate all the patients.

316
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,440
 A lot of these stories, a lot of these websites that were talking about Elfin Forest talked

317
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,920
 about the abandoned insane asylum, but this is when you went to go read actual news articles

318
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,600
 like local newspapers talking about this.

319
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,040
 They would say there is no abandoned insane asylum.

320
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,200
 What happened was there is, it's still there.

321
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,280
 It's actually still there.

322
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,960
 A huge retreat, a huge resort called Quest Haven Retreat.

323
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,600
 This is 640 acres.

324
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,840
 Like this is, I was getting confused if this is part of the initial 700 plus acres of Elfin

325
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
 Forest.

326
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 I think this is an addition to that.

327
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:31,120
 But back in the 1940s, this giant like spiritual retreat was built in this area.

328
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,200
 The building itself isn't 640 acres, but there's like this beautiful building that has this

329
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,760
 labyrinth-tenth like stone structure thing.

330
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,640
 It's not, when you hear labyrinth, you think, oh, it's really cool.

331
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,600
 There's like hedges and you can get lost and eventually like dogs are chasing you down.

332
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,960
 You're being a m- no.

333
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,360
 When normal kind of lamos talk about labyrinths, it's just a bunch of like rocks in the ground

334
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,440
 and you can look over them.

335
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,040
 They're not like rocks so big, you're like, oh, mom, dad, where are you?

336
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,560
 It's just like pebbles.

337
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,840
 It's like a rock path.

338
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,440
 That's what the labyrinth was.

339
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
 I remember I was so disappointed when we went on a field trip and the teacher kept saying,

340
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
 and there's going to be a labyrinth.

341
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,840
 And I was like, yeah, I'm going to start beating my sword.

342
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,480
 I'm getting my shield ready.

343
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,480
 No, we went out there and it was just like this line in this, oh, I was so mad.

344
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,680
 It was just like this line in the dirt.

345
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:28,200
 It's like two, it's like, my disappointment, my disappointment leaves me speechless.

346
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,160
 It's just like a circular path of rocks.

347
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,840
 And my teacher's like, and if you walk around the circles, your mind is clouded.

348
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,400
 I was so mad, dude.

349
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,400
 So mad.

350
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,280
 Anyways, the quest haven has one of these lamo labyrinths too.

351
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,840
 They have it and it's like this stone laid out type of dumb thing, right?

352
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,520
 And you can walk around, waste time, you go in.

353
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,400
 I think there's like spas and stuff like that.

354
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,440
 It's still in operation today.

355
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,840
 You can go out there.

356
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
 It looks old.

357
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,240
 It was built in the 1940s and at night, there's nobody there.

358
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,080
 So you would think it was some sort of insane asylum.

359
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
 So that's where those stories came from.

360
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,200
 The stories that there was like an abandoned insane asylum.

361
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,320
 You can still see the ghost in the area.

362
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,860
 The place is heavily patrolled by security at this point because a lot of teenagers are

363
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,040
 constantly going out there.

364
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,200
 And it's so fascinating because they'll say you can see the ghost of escaped inmates in

365
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 the bushes.

366
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,080
 Now we know there was no insane asylum there.

367
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,920
 Maybe there was that one kid who got lost in the labyrinth.

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
 He was the size of an aunt.

369
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,720
 He's like, "Let me out."

370
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:39,720
 But there are like, you have reports of shadowmen in the bushes not connected to the insane

371
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
 asylum.

372
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 And we've talked about this before.

373
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,320
 Sometimes people will see a ghost and they'll connect a backstory to it.

374
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,880
 It's not saying that the ghost doesn't exist.

375
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,520
 The ghost most likely exists.

376
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,880
 But people are trying to explain it.

377
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,440
 They go, "Oh, these must have been inmates."

378
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,880
 But no, they're just shadowmen.

379
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,400
 This whole area is just infused with dark energy.

380
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,920
 And it's so interesting because it used to be a place of positive energy when we look

381
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,240
 at the petrographs and when we look at the artifacts.

382
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,960
 When we look at the tribal history of this area, there was no recording of it being infused

383
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
 with darkness.

384
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,280
 But nowadays it is.

385
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,600
 There's sightings of shadowmen in the bushes.

386
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,320
 There's sightings of the white woman who's dressed in all white.

387
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,120
 She'll follow hikers down the trail.

388
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,320
 Sometimes she's responsible for causing car accidents.

389
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,760
 There's ghosts of Native Americans still walking these woods.

390
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,080
 And then we have the witch on horseback.

391
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,280
 We have the giant owl.

392
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,800
 And again, this place is considered to be one of the most haunted areas in one of the

393
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 most haunted states.

394
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,400
 There are just hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of sightings.

395
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,200
 But what I thought was so fascinating, what actually brought me to this place in the first

396
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 place.

397
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
 I was on the Shadowlands.net.

398
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,600
 I had never heard of this place before.

399
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,480
 I might have passed it in my research.

400
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,760
 I used to do a lot of ghost research in places in California because I lived there.

401
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,680
 But the place never stuck with me.

402
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
 The witch never branded my soul.

403
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,960
 Well, I was reading the Shadowlands.net the other day.

404
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,160
 I was going through all of my California files looking for some cool stuff to talk about.

405
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,760
 And I came across the Sandmar ghost, the Quest Haven Elphin Forest entry here.

406
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,960
 And I was like, okay, ghosts in the area.

407
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,060
 Native American ghosts, gypsy, massacre and stuff like that.

408
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,800
 This is what I thought was really interesting.

409
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 It said, quote, "There is also believed to be a circle of stones, and if you walk through

410
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,880
 them, time lapses."

411
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,520
 And that's what got me to do a deep dive into Elphin Forest.

412
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,440
 That's what set me off on this quest and reading all these articles and finding out about insane

413
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,760
 asylums and fearing that a giant owl was going to eat me at any point.

414
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,940
 And there is zero other reference to this in all of the articles I read.

415
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
 None.

416
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,100
 And I started to think about it.

417
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,660
 I go, I wonder if the circle of stones they're talking about is the labyrinth.

418
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,740
 And again, it's about as scary as bathroom tile laid out in the dirt.

419
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,900
 Like it's just this, I mean, it's pretty, I guess, but it's not what you would think

420
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,620
 of when you would think of a labyrinth.

421
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,200
 It's definitely not what you would think of about something and making time laps.

422
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,680
 So there might be a separate circle of stones somewhere, because again, it's a pretty large

423
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,080
 nature reserve, or it could be referring to the labyrinth.

424
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
 I'm not for sure.

425
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,920
 But I was looking around, looking around, looking around, because I was like, that's

426
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
 fascinating.

427
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,720
 Like if you could have a place that you could walk through and it causes some sort of temporal

428
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,840
 distortion, that's definitely a place worth investigating.

429
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,260
 What was so weird is I couldn't find any reference to this, but one article.

430
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,500
 There's a website called Patch News.

431
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,300
 And what it is, is it's basically local.

432
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,180
 It's a community driven newspaper, but it's a website so you put in your zip code and

433
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,260
 you can read articles written by contributors in your area.

434
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,900
 It's like a local newspaper website for all localities.

435
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,820
 I came across this quote, quote, "The short drive through Harmony Grove and Elfin Forest

436
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:19,680
 not only feels like something out of the twilight zone, but it also feels like a mindless time

437
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
 warp."

438
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,960
 Oh my God, that's interesting.

439
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,760
 It's not exactly what I was looking for, right?

440
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,400
 But it's close.

441
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,800
 And I remember, because I read all these articles about the forest and I'm reading all these

442
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,640
 accounts of these ghostly encounters, and so many articles mentioned this area as a

443
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
 shortcut.

444
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,860
 It's a shortcut through the area.

445
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
 Elfin Forest, it's beautiful.

446
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,820
 It's a quick shortcut to get where you're wanting to go, but it sure can be creepy.

447
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:56,900
 This shortcut, and I started thinking, on the map, sure, it probably is a shortcut if you're

448
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,900
 able to just drive through this nature reserve.

449
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,620
 You got all this protected wilderness on either side of the road, but this road was paved.

450
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,700
 Before then, they're just going to keep it up.

451
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
 It's a shortcut.

452
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,360
 I'm wondering if, yes, if you look at a map, it's a shortcut, but it does feel, the fact

453
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,280
 that it's referred to as a shortcut multiple times across multiple articles, and we have

454
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,400
 this one that does say, "It is weird when you're driving through it, you do feel like

455
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,120
 you're in this mindless time warp."

456
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,360
 And then we have the Shadowlands thing that specifically says there's a place in here

457
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
 that causes time to lapse.

458
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,400
 I wonder if there is some sort of temporal distortion going on in this area.

459
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,380
 And it may not be so huge that it's super noticeable, where it's not like you go through

460
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,220
 this area and a 30 minute journey feels like it's three minutes.

461
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,220
 But I'm wondering if, yes, technically it is a shortcut, but the reason why people are

462
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,980
 always referred to it as that is because time is shifting in this area.

463
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,820
 Does that make sense?

464
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,820
 There's a lot of things that we do, a lot of places we go that roads are actually shortcuts

465
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,400
 to where we want to go, but if someone ever asked you about Michelin Avenue, would you

466
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,680
 go, "Oh, the shortcut, eh?

467
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
 The shortcut."

468
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,360
 Like, yeah, technically it's a shortcut, but the, you know what I mean?

469
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,000
 You're really stretching on this one.

470
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,680
 No, I think that this area may have some sort of temporal distortion.

471
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,640
 So when people talk about it, they talk about, I mean think about it this way, think about

472
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
 the other stuff that's going on here.

473
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,960
 Giant Owl, abandoned insane asylum, killer witches, and we'll see some of those articles

474
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,820
 talk about them, some of those articles not, some of them articles mention more, the ghost

475
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,660
 stuff, some of them mention the legends of the gypsies.

476
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:44,580
 But I won't say all the articles mentioned it as a shortcut, but it was a constant refrain.

477
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,140
 I wonder if when you drive through this area, you are suffering some sort of temporal distortion.

478
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,620
 And even if it is just a minute, 30 seconds, whatever, it's enough that your brain goes,

479
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
 "Wow, I got here quick."

480
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,760
 I mean, I guess it is a quicker way to go down that road, but there is some sort of temporal.

481
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,600
 I find that absolutely fascinating.

482
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,160
 When we talk about the world of stuff like this, that's again, an alien level technology.

483
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,200
 It's either alien level or like Rip Van Winkle, godlike powers, right?

484
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,760
 To be able to shift time.

485
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,720
 And even the aliens, it's not so much that they throw you ahead in time, it's that you

486
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,560
 just lose track of time.

487
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,140
 Like the three hours passed, your friends were wondering where you were at.

488
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,700
 So even that, this would be like a huge, if this worked, this would be huge.

489
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,420
 This would be an area I would love to check out.

490
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,500
 And I know there's no trespassing signs everywhere, but if you live in the area, I'd love to hear

491
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,420
 your stories or for you to go out there, you come back, you've got these green laser beams,

492
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,860
 scorch marks all over you.

493
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,980
 The legend was true.

494
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,980
 Fascinating stuff.

495
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,560
 Actually, I mean, all the other stuff is really, really cool, but is it possible that in San

496
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:07,640
 Marcos, California, there is a nature preserve that changes reality, that shifts you through

497
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:15,040
 time somehow, some way?

498
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
 Who knows?

499
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 Absolutely fascinating.

500
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,440
 And it really, for pound for pound, it does seem like one of the most haunted areas we've

501
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 covered.

502
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
 Awesome.

503
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:31,820
 And possibly one of the most powerful, right, that it could actually manipulate time.

504
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,140
 Fascinating stuff.

505
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,140
 I love it.

506
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,500
 Greenacre1234, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbon or copper.

507
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,900
 We are leaving behind Elphin Forest.

508
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,260
 Fly us all the way out, too.

509
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,500
 Venice Beach.

510
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,120
 This next story, I know we don't have a lot of time left on the episode.

511
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,880
 This next story is not super long, but it's so, it's interesting.

512
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,480
 It's really, really interesting.

513
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,080
 And I'm trying to figure out how widespread this phenomenon is.

514
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,240
 A long time ago, we started covering this thing known as the Black Bedroom.

515
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
 The Black Bedroom Effect.

516
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,840
 I'll put a couple of those episodes in the show notes.

517
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,040
 It's something that I've stumbled across on my research where people have posted online

518
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,320
 saying they wake up in the middle of the night and their rooms pitch black.

519
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,460
 But it's not pitch black because the lights are off.

520
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,020
 It's just black.

521
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,340
 And they can get up and they can walk all around the room and they never find the walls

522
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,380
 to their room.

523
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,580
 Now you could say just a dream, right?

524
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,540
 Just a dream would be the most likely explanation.

525
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,620
 But then you have other versions of it.

526
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,620
 These people have posted different versions.

527
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,580
 And sometimes they communicate with each other.

528
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,940
 Sometimes I'll be reading a thread and they're like, "Oh, something like that happened to

529
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
 me."

530
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,380
 Sometimes they'll walk around the room, it'll be completely pitch black, they can't find

531
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
 the walls.

532
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,160
 Other times there was one version where someone woke up in the middle of the night, their

533
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,920
 room was completely black, they looked out their bedroom window and the world was completely

534
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
 black.

535
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,720
 You go chase them of course, it's nighttime.

536
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,520
 No, all the street lights were off, all the houses with all their lights were off.

537
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,160
 It's this eerie form of darkness.

538
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,600
 You had a variation where someone woke up in the middle of the night and their room was

539
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,760
 completely black.

540
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,420
 But when they looked down at their feet, their bedroom floor was the galaxy?

541
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,660
 Like they're looking down at the galaxy?

542
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,860
 Okay, I know a lot of these may seem like dreams, but this was a phenomenon as far as

543
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,460
 I know, it has never been investigated anywhere else.

544
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,380
 And I'll say it has never been connected, right?

545
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,740
 These are just stories floating around out there.

546
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,340
 And Dead Rabbit Radio has been the one to start to create this black bedroom phenomenon, not

547
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,180
 created in the sense of making it up, but connect these things.

548
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,080
 This is a lot of people have paranormal things happening.

549
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,580
 If you woke up in the middle of the night and there was a little boy standing at the

550
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:57,320
 foot of your bed going, "Mommy, leave me, you never leave me."

551
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
 You know what to do.

552
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,720
 You definitely know who to call, right?

553
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
 The Ghostbusters.

554
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
 You're like, "That's a ghost."

555
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
 And you would know what to do, right?

556
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,240
 You could tell your friends, you could set up a camera, become a famous tiktoker.

557
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,640
 Definitely call a spiritual leader, take care of it, have the house saged.

558
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,800
 You know what to do.

559
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,940
 You woke up in the middle of the night and there was a gray alien standing there.

560
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,340
 He goes, "Mommy, leave me.

561
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
 Mommy, leave me.

562
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
 You be my mommy."

563
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,780
 You'd be confused, but you would know what to do.

564
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,780
 You would know how to contact these UFOology groups.

565
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,980
 You woke up in the middle of the night and you were standing in an infinite black void.

566
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,620
 Who are you going to call, right?

567
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,180
 You may post about it online.

568
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,620
 You may mention it to your friends.

569
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,620
 You may never say anything.

570
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,100
 You'd be like, "Wow, must have just been a really intense dream."

571
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,820
 That's one of the things I love about doing this show.

572
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,240
 We cover the stuff that nobody else covers and it's daily, right?

573
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
 So we got to cover.

574
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,400
 We got to always have something to talk about.

575
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,320
 So we're always pushing the envelope and this might be something else like that.

576
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 Could be nothing.

577
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,840
 I actually thought that maybe there's a medical condition for this.

578
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,760
 But let's go into it.

579
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
 Let's go into it.

580
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,560
 I just said we didn't have a lot of time left on the show and I went on a huge segue, but

581
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,800
 I thought it was important.

582
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:13,020
 May 13th, 2021.

583
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,660
 There's a teenage girl online.

584
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,700
 She goes by the handle, "Adri5702."

585
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
 We're just going to call her Becky.

586
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,220
 May 13th, 2021.

587
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,580
 Becky's down in Southern California with a friend.

588
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
 They're hanging out.

589
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,420
 They're hitting up all the tourist sites, Disneyland, Elfin Forest.

590
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,740
 They swing on by there.

591
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,620
 Come home with "I Dodge the Beams" and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.

592
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,520
 It's May 13th.

593
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,920
 They're at Venice Beach right now.

594
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,840
 They're still on their vacation down in Southern California.

595
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,860
 They're out in the water of Venice Beach.

596
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,280
 They're looking for shells.

597
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
 They're not alone.

598
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,600
 Middle of the day.

599
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
 Beach is crowded.

600
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,920
 People are all walking around.

601
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
 Becky's out there in the water and they're not like submerged.

602
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,420
 They're not swimming deep in the water like they're living out avatar or something like

603
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
 that.

604
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,720
 Just standing there looking for shells.

605
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:09,740
 And all of a sudden, Becky realizes it's nighttime and then it's sunny again.

606
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,340
 Becky's like, "What in the...

607
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,440
 What was that?"

608
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,360
 And she said, "Listen, this only lasted for a second."

609
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
 It was not.

610
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,780
 And you could tell that she's probably had to explain this to people before and people

611
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
 go, "Was it like this?

612
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,980
 Was it like that?"

613
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,080
 She goes, "It was not like I was blinking.

614
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,680
 It was not like something passed by the sun, like a cloud or an object.

615
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,360
 It wasn't like an eclipse."

616
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:42,140
 She says the world didn't go pitch black so she couldn't see anything.

617
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,300
 All of a sudden, it was nighttime.

618
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:50,380
 She's looking now at the midday sun and then she realizes that her friend standing next

619
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,200
 to her is looking up at the sky as well.

620
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,380
 Becky goes, "Did you just see that?"

621
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,380
 And her friend's like, "Yeah.

622
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
 What was that?

623
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,780
 It was nighttime all of a sudden.

624
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,820
 Just for a second.

625
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
 What was that?"

626
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,100
 Becky doesn't have an answer.

627
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,260
 Becky doesn't have an answer.

628
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,740
 She turns though and she looks back at the beach and not everyone.

629
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,700
 Not everyone, but there was a lot of people at the beach looking up at the sky and then

630
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,400
 turning to each other and being like, "What was that?"

631
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:32,240
 So she could tell they saw it as well just from their reactions.

632
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,760
 She coined the term "sun blink."

633
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,920
 That was the only way she could describe it.

634
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
 She goes, "I don't really know what it was.

635
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:46,400
 It was like the sun blinked out of existence and it just became nighttime all of a sudden."

636
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,460
 She posted this online recently and you got a lot of people saying like, "Maybe it was

637
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
 a meteor.

638
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,340
 Maybe it was a meteorite that passed by the sun that was big enough to blot out the sun."

639
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,620
 A lot of people are saying so.

640
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,860
 Maybe it was the clouds.

641
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
 Maybe it was this.

642
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
 Maybe it was that.

643
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,460
 I mean, there might be a valid explanation, but then we find multiple reports of this

644
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
 as well.

645
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:15,340
 And this is fairly common, not the sun blink itself, but again, if people experience this,

646
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:21,880
 they may go, I don't know what that was, and they kind of file it away in their weird phenomenon

647
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,120
 I've experienced file.

648
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,280
 But then when someone else mentions it, they could go, "Oh man, I saw that and I didn't

649
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 know what it was."

650
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,840
 But now they know they're not alone.

651
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,240
 Someone else posted a few years ago there in Western Australia, "The sun blinked out.

652
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,120
 We have the same phenomenon as the first time.

653
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,700
 The sun blinked out."

654
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,180
 This time it lasted for two to three seconds.

655
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:54,380
 The world instantly became night, and then it was day once again.

656
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,500
 One witness said that they had experienced this twice.

657
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,780
 Once they were in a building and they noticed all the sunlight disappeared outside the building,

658
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,940
 the second time they were in a bedroom with daylight coming in through the bedroom window.

659
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,460
 Same thing, went pitch black outside.

660
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,560
 Their version of the story is interesting because they're indoors.

661
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,000
 The people on the beach wanted to notice this.

662
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,200
 The high school students might have noticed this, but this happened to one person twice.

663
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,200
 All electronic devices and all artificial lighting died as well.

664
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,280
 And then came back on.

665
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
 Someone else posted it.

666
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,160
 They were a high school student visiting a college, hanging out in the dorm.

667
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,000
 For less than a second, the sun disappeared and instantly became night.

668
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Multiple witnesses.

669
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,040
 It's fascinating that these stories have multiple witnesses.

670
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
 We have this happening over and over again.

671
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,640
 The last one that I found on just this one report, someone posted this on Reddit and

672
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,700
 all these other accounts began responding to it, which makes me think, like the black

673
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,360
 bedroom phenomenon, I took like a couple months to put that pattern together.

674
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,600
 That was multiple reports.

675
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,560
 Multiple reports over time because I was just consuming so much information or I read so

676
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,080
 many articles to get this stuff and I started to go, oh, this is kind of like that story

677
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
 we covered before.

678
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,960
 This is from one posting we got all this.

679
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,800
 Spring 2014 at Pleya del Carmen Resort.

680
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,920
 Pleya del Carmen.

681
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,780
 Multiple witnesses at a hotel.

682
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,520
 Multiple locations at the hotel.

683
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,520
 The person who was writing this said they were with their spouse in the lobby.

684
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,680
 They were like checking into the hotel.

685
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
 Sun disappeared.

686
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:45,160
 Split second, day to night, back to normal.

687
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,800
 And the clerk behind the desk checking them in saw it.

688
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,080
 It actually freaked them out.

689
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,240
 They ducked down behind the counter because they had no idea what was happening.

690
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,320
 The clerk behind the desk who was checking them in saw it.

691
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,080
 The husband and wife saw it.

692
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,360
 A couple of other people at the resort saw it, but then you had other people, they're

693
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
 so interesting.

694
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
 A couple of other people at the resort, nothing.

695
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
 They didn't see anything.

696
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
 What is this?

697
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,680
 This is fascinating and I'm honestly thinking this is way more common because this all came

698
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
 off of one post.

699
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,520
 It could be a total LARP, it could be a total ARG and if it is, I apologize for wasting

700
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
 your time.

701
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,520
 But absolutely fascinating.

702
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,560
 Again, going with the, I mean originally we were talking about the ability to shift

703
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,680
 through time.

704
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
 What is this?

705
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
 Is it that?

706
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,240
 Are people suddenly?

707
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
 I don't think so.

708
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
 It would be a shift from day to night.

709
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,960
 It has to be some sort of phenomenon, but I, obviously some of the answers, people talking

710
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,920
 about this, they said, you know, clouds moving in front, stuff that just wouldn't make sense.

711
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,200
 Clouds don't move in a second.

712
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,360
 They wouldn't cause the world to go pitch black.

713
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,600
 We all know what it's like when a cloud goes in front of the sun.

714
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,160
 It dims it, but not to the point where you think you're having tunnel vision, not to

715
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,800
 the point where it's nighttime.

716
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,640
 Some people are saying the simulation is breaking down.

717
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:08,040
 Whether that was tongue in cheek or not, that would be the power level that this would require.

718
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:19,360
 For the sun to go out, this would require some sort of cosmic level interference, aliens,

719
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,600
 right?

720
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,520
 Or something with reality actually ceasing to work.

721
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,120
 What I think is really interesting is the earliest story we have on just this post is

722
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,920
 2014, which makes me think it's a relatively recent phenomenon.

723
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,400
 I can't say that I've never come across anything like this in 30 years of paranormal research,

724
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,880
 but if I did, it was so isolated I don't remember it.

725
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,560
 I know there's probably been stories just off the top of my head of aliens abducting

726
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,560
 people during the day and them being returned at night, but again, that's a progress of

727
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
 time.

728
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,640
 They didn't make the sun disappear.

729
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,080
 That's biblical stuff.

730
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,960
 When I try to look at more information on this and they're like, "You know if a volcano

731
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,560
 goes up, yeah, I know that there are things that can block the sun," but that's not what

732
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
 we're talking about.

733
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,720
 We're talking about the sun disappearing for just the second.

734
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,220
 This is awesome.

735
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,800
 I mean, I guess it's not awesome if the simulation's breaking down or if the sun's disappearing,

736
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 but you know what I mean?

737
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,880
 This would be a huge paranormal event.

738
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,920
 This would be on the live.

739
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
 This continues.

740
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,120
 This would be the level of the trumpets in the sky phenomenon.

741
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:44,320
 I heard that before I ever saw a video on YouTube, before any of that.

742
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,360
 Again, so this is a perfect way to wrap up the episode.

743
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,240
 I might have talked about this before, but I'm sure I have.

744
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,020
 Here's that trumpets in the sky phenomenon.

745
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,340
 You can type it in YouTube and you can hear these videos and people go, "Oh, that's just

746
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,620
 construction vehicles in the area.

747
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,820
 That video from Russia, that's Photoshop," before any of those videos came out by a

748
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,780
 couple of years.

749
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,020
 I remember my little brother was hanging out at my grandma's house with me.

750
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,700
 He was visiting from college and he was headed back out and I was walking him back out to

751
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,700
 the car.

752
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,260
 As we were walking out to the car, it had to be like 8, 9 o'clock at night.

753
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:29,440
 We're walking out to the car and there is the loudest noise that it sounded like someone

754
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:38,720
 was ... I don't want to say like blowing, it was just this *loud noise*, this super, super

755
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
 loud noise.

756
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,080
 It was coming from right over the horizon.

757
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
 I could hear it.

758
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:52,000
 What was interesting was my brain was telling me it's just a vehicle passing by.

759
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,200
 So just talk over it, right?

760
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,760
 At this point, me and my little brother were walking to his car and we're continuing our

761
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,760
 conversation and I'm yelling to be heard over the sound.

762
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,560
 *loud noise*.

763
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:15,400
 It was just like one long note and I'm yelling and my little brother's like "uh-huh-huh,

764
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,560
 he's listening to me, he's listening to me."

765
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,000
 And then this went on for a minute or two and finally I go "What is that?

766
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 What is that noise?"

767
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,200
 Because I got tired of yelling over it and at first I thought it was just something driving

768
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,600
 by but as it continued I'm yelling.

769
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,400
 I go "What is that?

770
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
 What is that noise?"

771
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,240
 And my little brother's like "What?"

772
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,680
 I go "That noise!" and I'm pointing out like past the neighborhood, I'm pointing out to

773
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
 the horizon.

774
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,920
 I go "That noise!

775
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,320
 What is that noise?"

776
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,000
 And he's like "What are you talking about?"

777
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,280
 I go "You don't hear that?"

778
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,280
 *loud noise*.

779
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,920
 And he's like "No, I don't hear it at all."

780
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,840
 It went on for minutes because I remember him being like "Okay, see you later bro, it's

781
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,680
 nice hanging out with you, nice vacation, giving him a hug and all that stuff."

782
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:06,520
 It's like "See you later!" and my little brother gets in his car and drives away.

783
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
 And I just went inside.

784
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,480
 I didn't think it was anything.

785
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,920
 I didn't put it together that it was anything paranormal at all.

786
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,960
 I was like "What was that noise?"

787
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,720
 I was so loud and so loud I was like "It had to have been construction equipment."

788
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,760
 That's exactly what I thought.

789
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,680
 It wasn't until later when I started hearing people talk about the Sky Trumpets I was like

790
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,880
 "That was what I heard."

791
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,720
 And it was so weird because my little brother didn't hear nothing.

792
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,640
 And I heard it so loud I was yelling over the noise.

793
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,680
 To keep talking about movies or video games or whatever we were talking about.

794
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,760
 I was yelling over the noise.

795
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,120
 This may be something like that.

796
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,480
 That people just experience and they don't make a connection.

797
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,320
 They just think it was them at that moment but it may be something that's happened multiple

798
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
 times.

799
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,240
 I like that one person could post about it and six or seven people respond that leads

800
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,760
 me to think that this is fairly common.

801
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,320
 Which makes me wonder if the Disinfo Campaign is going to start up soon.

802
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,800
 Where you're going to start seeing YouTube videos of the sun blinking.

803
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,440
 Someone did post a video like that but I just think that was Lins Flare.

804
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,320
 I don't think they were really paying attention to what the article was.

805
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,320
 But watch.

806
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:22,600
 We'll see if in the next year or two if this keeps popping up you start to see the Disinfo

807
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
 Campaign.

808
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,760
 Because the videos of the Sky trumpet a lot of those I think are fake.

809
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,120
 What's weird is they get the sound pretty close.

810
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,720
 They do get the sound pretty close.

811
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,040
 So I don't know if the videos are actually fake or if the comments are the Disinfo.

812
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,520
 Trying to make them seem fake so people brush their whole thing off.

813
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,080
 But I 100% heard that with my own ears.

814
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,200
 Standing outside my grandma's house in Orangevale, California.

815
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,760
 100%.

816
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
 Fascinating stuff.

817
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,160
 Let's see if the Disinfo Campaign starts to pop up.

818
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,840
 They start to fake videos of the sun blinking out.

819
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,640
 So in the future when people talk about this.

820
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,160
 People are like "Oh that's fake.

821
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
 That was on YouTube.

822
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
 You just made it up.

823
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
 That's fake.

824
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
 I saw that video.

825
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,000
 It was just someone in the editing shop deleting the sun.

826
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,520
 Putting it back in a second later.

827
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,720
 We can handle a ghost boy in our room.

828
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,280
 We can beat up a witch.

829
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,600
 Or maybe outrun a witch on horseback maybe.

830
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,440
 We can evade a flying owl.

831
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,360
 We can become king of the insane asylum.

832
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:40,200
 But how do you fight something that is so powerful it can delete the sun?

 But we better figure out a way, right?

836
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,440
 We better figure out what this is and how to prevent it.

837
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:00,360
 Gotta do something before whatever this thing is decides to delete the sun for more than
