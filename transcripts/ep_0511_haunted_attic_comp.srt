1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A mysterious disappearance happens at high speed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we travel to Britain to find a tenant who gets more than they bargained for

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 when they move into an apartment that's haunted by the sound of a sack of potatoes today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. My co-host Veronica the Haunted Doll is still here. It's interesting.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I was just listening to yesterday's episode when I was editing it and there is a dog barking.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 There's a whiff in the middle of the edit. Let me play it for you right here. I'm going to play you the raw audio right here.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I'm playing with a bunch of aliens having a perpetual party. Her vision may be messed up in deep space.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 She may have a hard time remembering stuff, but would she be cut?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I don't want to end it with kids crying for their lost mom. That's a sad way to end the episode.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 It's possible that she did go missing.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You did hear me making some munching sounds and stuff like that. I was sucking on a lozenge.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Generally when I suck on a lozenge, it doesn't make the sound of a dog barking.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Is that a result of Veronica the Haunted Doll? Is it a result of a dog outside? I don't know.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It's for you to decide. It is for you, paranormal experts. What is the most likely answer?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 A doll of a little girl made that noise of a dog barking or was it actually a dog with my super sensitive microphone?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 This microphone is amazing. The Neumann TLM 103 for all you sound nerds out there. Super sensitive.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So it's most likely a dog barking outside, but still I just thought I'd point that out.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Gregory A. Gorley.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Gregory, thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 The Patreon's really growing recently. I really, really appreciate that, guys.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 That really helps a lot as well. Gregory gives me a knowing nod. I give him a knowing nod back.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We are going to travel out to Canada.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 It's a long drive. I got a mixtape made. It's all of Britney Spears. Greatest hits.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So all of them. It's her entire desography. She didn't come out with one bomb.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Email my heart. It's pretty rough. That song kind of sucks, but everything else.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It's her greatest hits. It's every song she's ever recorded. We're headed out to Levis.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Maybe there's no pronunciation. Maybe it's just Levi's. Levi's? That's in Quebec, Canada.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I actually got this as a request from Pepe La Pointe. So we waved to Pepe as we were driving by.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 "Take me with you. Take me with you." Hop in the back. We're driving to Levi's in Quebec, Canada.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 So I've been doing the promo read for that movie, The Vanish. That's something that I got to...

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I actually really enjoy it. I know it might come off as being cheesy, but I like doing stuff like that.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's probably the closest I'll ever get to being in the movie industry.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 But originally I was going to do a whole week of missing people stories to go along with the movie, The Vanish.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So I have this cool promo talking about this movie. It's very odd movie. It's a very, very odd movie.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I'm still kind of digesting it, honestly. The movie The Vanish, I was going to do Missing Persons Week.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And I had all these missing person stories. Super depressing. I was like, "I don't want to do five episodes."

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And then they were never saying again. Like, there's some interesting stuff.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And I think I'm going to spread them out over the next couple of weeks.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But a whole week of stories just me shrugging my shoulders at the end going, "I don't know.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Maybe they're right behind you." And you turn around.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Very, very compelling stuff. I got a lot of them, but I didn't want to do a whole week of them.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Just too intense. Because this is true stuff. It's one thing if I did a whole week of like, ghosts that haunt your toaster.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Like, that's cool. Unless you really like toast or are a toaster yourself.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And it's super scary. That's the scariest week ever. You're the brave little toaster.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And not so brave now. You're thinking, "Oh my God, I didn't know I could get possessed."

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Anyway, so that is all a lead up. We'll be doing the promo read for the Vanishing soon.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And I do enjoy that. I actually feel that honestly makes me feel like this is a professional show.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 The fact that someone's like, "Hey, read this."

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So anyways, Gregory put the pedal to the metal.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 We're driving on the road. We're headed to Levi's in Quebec, Canada.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 It's July 8th, 2020. It's 8.30 p.m.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And Martin Carpentier, 44 years old, is at an ice cream shop with his two daughters, Nora, she's 11, and Romy, she's 6.

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And they're having ice cream.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 The people working at the ice cream shop just see a loving father and his two daughters. Nothing seems amiss.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 9.30 p.m.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 [mimics car noises]

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Cars are driving down Highway 20 in Saint-Apple-Lynaire.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 There's a woman named Lynn Provincher driving down the road.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 There's nothing unusual about that. Lots of Lynn's drive down the road. There's no law saying, "What? Your name's Lynn. Give me your driver's license."

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 That's normal, but what happens next isn't.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 She sees a Volkswagen Passat driving down the road as well, and it drives off the road,

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 [mimics car noises]

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 hits a road sign, [mimics car noises]

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 and then smashes into a tree, and it hits the tree with so much force, the car actually flips over.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 [mimics car noises]

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Lynn immediately stops the car, jumps out, runs to it, the car is completely empty.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 She sees an ice cream cone laying on the seat of the car. She sees a child safety seat there as well.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 As she's taking this all in, other cars start to pull up.

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It was a massive crash. She would have seen it down the road. It made a lot of noise.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 She takes out her phone and she begins filming the scene.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And this video has been taken offline. This video is not available online anymore.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 It may be some places that I'm not willing to look, but it's as far as I've seen in the reports they did remove from the internet.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 She's videotaping it, though, and she says, "There's nobody. The tires are blown out. The windows are blown out.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 There's no one in the car in the field. It's crazy. I don't understand."

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 She says, "I really hope there wasn't a child in the car because it's really serious. The car is finished."

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Those are all actual quotes she's recording this live.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And the reason why she's thinking there might be a child in the car is because there is a kid's seat, but there is nobody around.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 The cops show up and their immediate suspicion is probably what we're all thinking as well.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 They're flung from the car. They weren't wearing their seatbelts. Everyone flew out of the car.

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So the immediate thing, the cops begin searching the field. There's nobody there.

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 If they had just come across the car that was overturned and no one was in it, you would probably think,

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 "Well, maybe they got out and they were just dizzy. They had little stars floating around their head."

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 They stumbled off into the darkness.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The car went off the road in full view of people.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 It crashed through a sign, hit a tree, flipped. Nobody is in the car. Nobody is in the field.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Nobody is anywhere.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Massive search in the area because at this point they're thinking, "There's obviously a kid. There's at least a driver missing."

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Right? And probably at least one kid as well.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 They're running plates. They're finding out who the car belongs to. They're trying to backtrack what could be going on.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 That night, so this area apparently is pretty much like a wilderness area,

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 but there are houses speckled throughout the area.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 That night as cops are searching the field surrounding the car,

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Canadian 911 starts getting these calls that they're hearing screaming from the woods,

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 which is the most terrifying place to hear screaming from, right?

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Other than screaming from inside your house, the woods would be the spookiest place to hear screaming from.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And it's so loud, it's waking people up.

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 People weren't up watching television. They were dead asleep.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 The screaming was so loud it was waking people up.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So now those cops are searching the forest. They're trying to figure out what's going on.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And at first the cops go, "We don't know if the two things are related.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 We don't know if the missing people who are flung out of this car or what

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 is related to the screams coming from the forest."

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But it was weird because actually I was about to add something to it.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 They never really said the two things were related.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 They're like, "Oh, I don't know." Could be totally unrelated,

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 but they issue, at that point, they issued an Amber Alert for the girls.

109
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They're thinking, "Okay, there's no one around here.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 We know that he was traveling with girls who were able to backtrack who owned the car

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 and that he was seen at this ice cream shop." Things like that.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 So he has to have the girls, but we don't know how in the world the car would have flipped

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 or really, who cares about the physics of it, where they are at now.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They hear the screams from the woods and they're still saying to the media,

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 "We don't know if the two things are connected."

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Could be just a dude like Screamin' in the middle of the woods. We don't know.

117
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So that all happened on July 8th.

118
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 July 11th, the police hold a press conference and they say,

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 "We have lifted the Amber Alert. We found the bodies of the girls."

120
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Which is the worst case scenario in that thing.

121
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 They weren't flung out of the car.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So people are like, "That's horrible. That's the worst possible ending of the story.

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 The two girls are found dead. Did they die in the car accident where they flung out of the vehicle?

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Did you not find them?" Because this is three days later.

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And the cops go, "Listen, we're not going to tell you what happened to the girls.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 We will tell you this.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 There is a man named Martin Carpentier who we're looking for.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 We don't know where he's at.

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We would appreciate it if everyone kept an eye out for him.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Like, go check your bike. If you have a boat shed, check under your house, check in your closet.

131
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 If you find him, find him. Call us immediately.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You can look for him, but if you find him, run away. Run to a phone because we think he's super dangerous.

133
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 That's the end of the press conference, basically.

134
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Like, go look for this maniac who may or may not have had something to do with these.

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 We're not even telling you what happened to these girls. We're just telling you that they're dead.

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Go look for this guy, though. It would be very, very helpful if you went to your spooky shed in the middle of the night,

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 or even in the middle of the day. Just go out there and open it up and look inside.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And if you see a guy named Martin Carpentier in there, run back to your phone before he gets you.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Like, he's a boogie man. We will take no questions.

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 So, at this point, the police had had a search of 50 square kilometers, and they found a broken-in trailer,

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 which was somebody's trailer, right? Someone was like, "Should I go check that out, Martha?"

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 And Martha was like, "Uh-uh. Nope. Just stay here." Because it's super spooky.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 They found a trailer that was broken into, and a bunch of supplies were taken out of it.

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 This is in July. This is in July of 2020. So, again, this is super recent.

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 The police do another press conference. This one, they're like, "Okay, the reporters are like, "You better answer our questions this time."

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 The police said at this point, they go, "Listen, we think he's dead. We think Martin Carpentier is dead."

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Now, what's weird is that they say that most people, they think he's dead because no one could survive in the wilderness for that long.

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What? Like, I mean, I'm no outdoors man, but I think I can stand for...

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 What in July in Canada, what is it like a scorching 78 degrees?

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Like, you can go three days without food. You don't have to be hunting squirrels.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You don't have to be straight up Robinson Caruso to do three or four days in the woods, right?

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 But they did say they go, "We don't think he's capable of making rational decisions."

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 The media's like, "What do you mean by that?" And the police are like, "No further questions."

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Fresh conference is over, people are like, "What is going on? What's going on? Like, did he get brain damage from the car accident?

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Like, how did the girls die? The cops are just walking away. They're not answering any of these questions."

156
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 July 20th. So now it's been a full 12 days since the car crash.

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 The authorities are going to call, "Martin Carpentier has been found by somebody."

158
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 The cops are like, "Oh, Martin Carpentier had been found by someone he had committed suicide."

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 So cops go, "Well, found him, killed himself, case closed."

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And the media's like, "That's, yeah, I guess. It's kind of case closed, but we have a couple questions."

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The cops go, "No more questions." They just walk off. To this point, we still don't know some very key factors.

162
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 "Hey, it's Jason from The Future. I actually have to jump in here real quick. I'm editing this episode up and I go,

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 'Enough time has passed. We have to have gotten more information about this story.' So I did a little more digging.

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Here we go. They have now actually given us more of a timeline of what has happened."

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So this is, again, this is bizarre. I'm reading from an article in the Montreal Gazette.

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 This came out July 23rd, 2020. I don't know why I didn't see this the first time I was researching this.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 So what the police are saying now is that the car crash was a complete accident.

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 It was an absolute complete accident. The car crash, they didn't mean to do that, which is kind of the definition of an accident.

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 The police also state that witnesses have now come forward to say that they saw a man leaving the scene, holding one daughter,

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 and having the other one by the hand. So that's weird because you have someone with video right on the scene, no one seeing anything.

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Apparently they would have had to jump all, get out of the car really quickly, including the young one in the car seat,

172
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 all got out of the car real quickly. And the police don't know. They don't believe that that was planned.

173
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 They don't believe that the flip off the freeway was planned. The police are saying that, again, there's so many odd, odd things going on here.

174
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 The police are saying that the car accident may have played a part in him deciding to murder the girls. Whatever that means.

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Like, did he get brain damage from the car accident and then murder the kids and he got out? He wasn't in his right mind.

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Who knows? Who knows? The police really aren't letting us know, but they think that the car accident may have caused this.

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 They also say that all three of them were dead within the first 12 hours.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 So even though it took that huge span of time to find him, they believe that when he broke into the shed, that the two girls were still alive.

179
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And they have revealed their cause of death. They were both bludgeoned. They were both bludgeoned to death.

180
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 When he broke into the shed, he got a shovel. So we can assume that was the instrument. I'm sorry, this is probably the most depressing update possible.

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So they believe that that happened. And then, again, the police just don't want to answer all these questions.

182
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 The police say that he broke into another shed and got a ladder, but won't tell us how he committed suicide.

183
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 There's only really, there's a very limited amount of ways that you can commit suicide with a ladder.

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 So we would assume he hung himself. I don't think he got in a ladder match with the Undertaker and lost.

185
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 There's very, very limited ways to kill yourself with a ladder. There's really only one guaranteed way to kill yourself with a ladder and that would be a hanging.

186
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 So why are they being so, I mean, they're police, I guess, you know, they're in charge of the details and stuff, but they're really not letting anything out.

187
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But they're saying that all three of them were dead within that first 12 hours and they couldn't find them because the forest was so dense and their heat sensors wouldn't pick them up.

188
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 But they were only found about five kilometers from, he was found five kilometers from the accident and they were closer than that.

189
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 They were about 1.7 kilometers away from the accident. So took them, what was it, 10 days to really wrap this thing up.

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So there's still questions, still questions why he did it as the biggest one, why it took him so long to find these bodies.

191
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Is that timeline correct? We don't know, we don't know, even with it being now a full month since even this article was published and even longer since the crime took place, the police either know and aren't telling or the police simply don't know, simply don't know at all.

192
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So I'll let the original recording take over now.

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It's weird because it's a missing person story on its head and even though everyone was found and it was the worst possible ending, there's so many questions involved in this.

194
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And the biggest one is how is it physically possible for three people to disappear from a moving car and then it crash.

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 This is one of those stories that would, if they were not found, let's say that this guy killed his daughters and then himself, but those bodies weren't found.

196
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 This would be one of the biggest paranormal stories of all time, right? Like it has all the hallmarks of that.

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Did you imagine if he did this and he either absconded with the children, they lived in the wilderness like cave people forever? That would be the happy ending.

198
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Well, the happy ending would be none of this happening, but you know what I mean? Like let's say everyone survived when they become outdoorsmen, they're out in the woods for the next 50 years, just live in the hermit life.

199
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 It would be one of the biggest paranormal stories of the modern age. A family disappears from a moving car.

200
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And if the bodies were never found, even if we have this tragic ending, if the bodies were never found, it would still be like, what in the world happened?

201
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But even with this horrible tragic ending, there's still so many, it falls out of the paranormal realm, which in the beginning people were like, how do people disappear from a moving car?

202
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And then it's funny because you kind of would rather have that than the tragic real ending.

203
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But it still leaves you with so many questions. What's the screaming related? Probably. Even like, I guess in Canada they have probably different free speech laws, but the video is deleted, even though it didn't show anything, it wasn't graphic or anything like that.

204
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 It was just a video of an empty car, it got taken off the internet. The whole thing's bizarre.

205
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 A story that could have lived on in paranormal infamy instead becomes a story about how brutal a human can actually be to take the lives of their own children.

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 But I guess even then we don't even know if he did it.

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 The whole thing's bizarre. The whole thing is super weird. See, I did not want to do a week of stories like that.

208
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I mean, that's a very, very interesting story and thank you for the recommendation, Pepula Point, but I couldn't do a "hey everyone, thanks for listening to the rap radio."

209
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I mean, that's a rough story to cover because it's like the worst crime possible and then there's just so many questions and that's what always pops up in these missing people things.

210
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 It's just what? Like, what is going on? Like I said in the beginning, basically the story is me just kind of shrugging my shoulders.

211
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But the reason why I wanted to do the vanished story was because of the movie, The Vanished. I love doing these little adorings. I try to keep them short. I hope you guys enjoy them. You guys should check it out.

212
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 New today on Digital, Anne Haitian Thomas Jane star in the gripping psychological thriller, The Vanished. Directed by Peter Fascinelli,

213
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 a family vacation takes a terrifying turn when two parents discover that their young daughter is vanished without a trace.

214
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Stopping at nothing to find her, the search for the truth leads to a shocking revelation where nothing is what it seems in this intense thriller.

215
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Own or rent The Vanished on Digital today and watch it at home tonight, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

216
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 The Vanished is just weird. Again, I want to talk to you guys about it, but I'm going to give it some time. I think we could do a really interesting dive into that movie.

217
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 It's just weird. Good weird. It's just one of those movies where you're like, everyone is so weird in this movie. It's interesting. It's an interesting film.

218
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Gregory, let's go ahead and hop in that mythological beast that we call the carbonicopter. We are headed out to the UK.

219
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Oh wait, no, sorry. We're headed out to Melbourne, Australia. He's all turning around. I said in the intro, I'm not going to re-record it either because I'm super lazy.

220
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I said in the intro we're going to the UK because at one point, a character, not a character, and at one point, the person in the story picks up a cricket bat and I go, "What? There's only exist in one place in the world, right? Britain."

221
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So anyways, we're in Australia. Just pretend in the intro I said Australia because I'm too lazy to edit.

222
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Gregory's turning the helicopter around. We're a little low on gas by the time we get to Australia. It's quite a difference in distance there.

223
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 We're landing. There's a bunch of wallabies with little light things. They're waving us down. We put our luggage in a kangaroo.

224
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 We actually know we get in kangaroos for hopping. That's their Uber down there.

225
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Ruber.

226
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Okay, okay. That was my one, that was my one brilliant joke per episode.

227
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So here's the story I got from Reader's Digest. Reader's Digest, the magazine every mom reads but no one under the age of 52 knows exists.

228
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 They did a whole thing about spooky ghost stories, spooky, spooky ghost stories.

229
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 So we're in Melbourne, Australia and we're reading Reader's Digest. What is this, huh?

230
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Holding it upside down or like, "Well, this doesn't make any sense. This is a magazine."

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And I'm like, "Yes, yes. Those things used to exist before the year 2015."

232
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 We're in Melbourne, Australia and there we're going to meet an unnamed person.

233
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Technically, this is bizarre. Reader's Digest got this from Reddit.

234
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So that's what's going on now. Reader's Digest, your mom's magazine.

235
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Keeping moms entertained in beauty salons since 1952.

236
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 They got this story from Reddit and it's from someone named DigzDaws.

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So thank you DigzDaws. We're just going to call you, we're going to give you a normal human name.

238
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 We're going to call you Duggy. We're going to call you Duggy for this story.

239
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So Duggy has a one bedroom apartment in Melbourne, Australia.

240
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And now he says that the building was put up in the 1930s.

241
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 But he's not, he's not 90 years old. He just moved in.

242
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 He moved into this new place. Landlord gives him the keys.

243
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Link falls into his hand. "Have fun at your apartment."

244
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Okay, that's what a landlord says right when he rent a place.

245
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Everything's fine in his apartment. He does notice one weird thing.

246
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 In the bathroom, this would be a red flag, right? This is where you're like, "Eh, I might want to move."

247
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Because this is an opening for something spooky.

248
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 In his bathroom, the one place you should feel the most safe.

249
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 There's a wooden board covering up a hole in the ceiling of the bathroom.

250
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Just move out, dude. Because you know if that board is just crooked a little bit,

251
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 you're probably going to see like an eyeball staring down at you, or a big old black widow coming out of it.

252
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Well, I guess that one, would you pick your poison? What's more menacing to you?

253
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Seeing an eyeball staring at you from your heater vent, or seeing a black widow come out of your heater vent.

254
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Like, I would much rather have the eyeball in there.

255
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Because the eyeball is ain't going to do nothing. I mean, it might see me when I'm like, you know, making love to a lady.

256
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 But the black widow is going to murder me. Like, the ghost is just going to be like, "Oh, come on Jason, not again."

257
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Ugh. I'm not saying I want eyeballs floating around either, just so we're clear eyeball monster.

258
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But if you had a hole in your bathroom, that's just bad. But there's like a plank of wood covering it up.

259
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 But one night, he's sleeping, and he hears a "CRACK!"

260
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 So, "Oh, oh, oh, man, woke me up." He's trying to figure out where did that noise come from.

261
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Ugh. I don't know. I looked everywhere. Time to go to the bathroom. He goes in the bathroom.

262
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 The board covering up the hole has been cracked. And he said it was a thick board. It was about an inch thick.

263
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And just snapped in half. He's like, "What?" So he calls his landlord the next thing. He's like, "Hey man, you gotta fix this hole."

264
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 You gotta, "Well, you should just fix the hole, honestly." But since you're not doing that, can you at least get another plank of wood

265
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 that'll cover up the hole? And the landlord's like, "Oh yeah, yeah, totally. I'll totally do that."

266
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 So, they do that. The landlord fixes the hole, plank of wood covering up the spooky, spooky hole.

267
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 A month later, it's 4 a.m. and Dougie is fast asleep. And then feels something.

268
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 What? Ugh. Wakes up. Feels hands rubbing on him. What? Ugh. Wait.

269
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Then he hears above his bed. Like, so, in the-- above his bed is the ceiling. How bedrooms are normally constructed.

270
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 He's not living in a tent. Above his bedroom is a ceiling on top of the-- or above the ceiling is the attic.

271
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Learning how to pronounce that word. So, in the attic, there is space up there.

272
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And also, the hole in the bathroom also leads to the attic.

273
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 So, theater of the mind. To picture this, there is an apartment and above it is a roof.

274
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 And then, in between the roof and the ceiling of the apartment, there's an attic. So, there you go.

275
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 If you've never been in a domicile on the planet Earth, that's how it goes.

276
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 He hears noises in the attic. So, he's getting this cool massage or-- and/or creepy massage, depending on how you feel about

277
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 astral hands touching you. But he hears something in the attic. He describes it as somebody pulling a sack of potatoes.

278
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And so, five minutes he lays there in bed for five minutes as he hears this sound of sack of potatoes.

279
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 He goes, "Normally, I'd be really scared right now, but this back room, he sure is making me relax."

280
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Oh, yeah. A little bit lower. Oh, too low. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know if it was two ghosts,

281
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 but if it was the ghost carrying around the sack of potatoes, it's like, "Dude, you're messing up my vibe. I'm trying to scare him."

282
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Also, how-- here's the thing. Like, I said on my last episode, I heard the sound of a dog, and I played it back for you.

283
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And obviously, it sounded like a dog, right? There was no question of that.

284
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I don't know if I could identify a sack of potatoes getting-- how many sack of potatoes has this guy heard being pulled across attics before?

285
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Not drug addicts. Pulled across attics before that he goes, "Hmm, I can tell that's a sack of potatoes."

286
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 "It's probably rusted potatoes." No, no. Pure Idaho bread. At least the five pound bag, I think.

287
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Like, how do you get so specific? Like, when did it just been a sack of heavy stuff?

288
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He's like, "No, I can tell the sound of a potato hitting wood." Like, how specific is that? A sack of potatoes.

289
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Anyways, he's laying in bed. He's getting a really relaxing massage from one ghost.

290
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 If it's the same ghost, then he's kind of messing up his own vibe. Plus, that's a multi-tasker.

291
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Like, you want a haunted dude, and I don't know if the ghost is actually giving him a full back rub.

292
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Just so that it was massaging him or touching him, I think, was what it actually said.

293
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I turned it onto a full-on Swedish massage. It's like putting hot stones on his back.

294
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 He lays in bed for five minutes. He's hearing these sack of potatoes being dragged around.

295
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And then he grabs his cricket bat, and he gets up because he kind of knows what's going on at this point.

296
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I mean, he doesn't. He's not like, "Oh, that must be the sack of potato ghost."

297
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 He can kind of figure out that it probably has something to do with the hole in his bathroom.

298
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 He goes into his bathroom with his cricket bat, and sure enough, the plank of wood is snapped again.

299
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 At that point, the dragging sound stops, and he hears a whisper in his ear.

300
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 "It's your turn. It's your turn."

301
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 What would you do at that point? Cricket bat or not, right? You hear someone saying, "It's your turn. It's your turn."

302
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Even if someone, even if it wasn't a ghost, even if you're a roommate, like, you're going,

303
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 "Oh, no, there's a whole ceiling again." You turn around your roommate standing there, and he goes,

304
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 "It's your turn. It's your turn." You're leaving, right? Right? Ghost or not.

305
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 If anyone's just saying that to you, you're out. He proceeds to go, and he turns all the lights on in his apartment,

306
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 tries watching television, which is what you normally do when people are telling you, "It's your turn."

307
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 He's trying to watch television. He's like, "Oh, he's watching the sack of potato channel."

308
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 He's like, "Oh, this will make me relax. It's just much potatoes getting dragged around."

309
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 He's watching that. Fuse blows. All the power goes out.

310
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 At that point, he hears his dog Dexter squawking. It's the word he uses, squawking.

311
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So, squealing? Is that how an American would describe it?

312
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 [squealing]

313
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Here's the dog freaking out. He leaves. He leaves the house.

314
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He leaves the dog as well. He leaves his dog there. His dog was being attacked by the sack of potato ghost.

315
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 He runs out, and he decides to stay in his car until the sun comes up.

316
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Eventually, he says he eventually starts to see neighbors out walking their dogs,

317
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 and he's like, "Oh, it's safe to go back inside, because these people are outside also."

318
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 "Oh, no, my dog's in there." He runs back into the house.

319
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 This all started at 4 a.m. When does the sun come up? Like, six?

320
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 He goes inside, and his dog is face down in the toilet bowl, like, slashing around.

321
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 "Uh-uh-uh." And he's like, "Oh, no, why did I leave you here, dog?"

322
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And he gets the dog out of the toilet. Now, he calls the landlord and tells the landlord,

323
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 "Hey, dude, listen. Let me tell you what happened last night."

324
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 He tells him the whole story, and after telling that story,

325
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 but then he can imagine the guy left out all the dog stuff.

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 He's like, "Oh, yeah." And then someone was dog-sitting, my dog.

327
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Someone asked me any questions about my dog, and the dog's dog sitter likes to give him a bath,

328
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 but only the top half of the dog.

329
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So, from his neck to his snout, he's totally washed.

330
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 The landlord's like, "What? Why are you telling me that story?"

331
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 He tells the landlord the story. The landlord's response to all of this goes,

332
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 "Oh, wow. You heard the whispering, too?"

333
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 So, apparently, this had been ongoing. After all of that, after all of that,

334
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Dougie lived there for another 18 months.

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 He said every so often, he'd hear the whispering, right?

336
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And two more times had to replace that board.

337
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 But eventually, he moved out, and then one day, he got a call from the landlord,

338
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 and the landlord's like, "Hey, the new tenants have some questions for you?

339
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 The new tenants want to talk to you." And the story ends with Dougie saying,

340
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 "No, I'm not talking to anyone. I don't ever want to think about that place again."

341
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Now, it's an interesting story. It's kind of a spooky...

342
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's a story that your mom would read while she was waiting to get her hair done, right?

343
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 It's not super spooky. It's left pretty open-ended.

344
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 So, that is the story of Dougie and his ghost.

345
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 How long could you put up with the ghost? I don't know if I could do 18 months.

346
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Actually, to be fair, my apartment's haunted. We've talked about that a couple times before.

347
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 The ghost pretty much leaves me alone. If he was keeping me up at night,

348
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 you would do something, right? At the very least, and at the very least,

349
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 you would give your dog to somebody else. You'd be like, "Eh, maybe he's better off living with you

350
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 until my lease is up." But how long could you handle a ghost making that much

351
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 racket, breaking stuff, dragging potatoes around?

352
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 But 18 months, if it's making a much noise, is if it's crotted, chopping wood, I'm out.

353
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 I mean, at the very least, at the very least, Dougie may have had a lease

354
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 and not have been able to move. But at the very least, I hope he gave his dog to a dog sitter.

355
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I hope he's like, "Please take care of my dog for 18 months. I am not a good dog owner.

356
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I will leave my dog as they're being strangled by a ghost."

357
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Because Dougie didn't seem to be the most concerned owner in the world. The bad owner. Bad owner.

358
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 You gotta take care of your dogs.
