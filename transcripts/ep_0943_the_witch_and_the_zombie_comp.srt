1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 What would you do if someone presented you with a book that if you read it would tell

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,480
 you exactly the way you die?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,660
 And then we travel to British Columbia to meet a young homeless man wandering the streets

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,800
 of a city looking for a computer so he can email his mom.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,220
 Instead he finds himself on a collision course with a witch, a zombie, and a voice in his

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,800
 head screaming "Kill, Kill, Kill" today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:48,160
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 I'm your host Jason Garbender, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,640
 day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun out in the world doing all the stuff that

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
 you're doing.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,740
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,320
 First off, everyone give a round of applause for our newest Patreon supporter, writing himself

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,720
 into Dead Rabbit Command.

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,160
 Give it up for Horseboyo.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 Woohoo!

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,240
 Yeah, get on boy jump on his back riding around like a horse.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
 Like his name says.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,280
 Horseboyo, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode if you guys can't support

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,520
 the Patreon I totally understand.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,680
 Just helps read the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,440
 It really does, it helps the show grow.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,640
 Now Horseboyo, get that bit out of your mouth, he's like not a real horse, it's just a nickname.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,760
 Get that bit out of your mouth but I'm staying on the saddle.

24
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,320
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible, we're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:48,760
 Command, fly us all the way out to a library.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,680
 We're walking around this library, it's like any library you've seen before, any city library

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,160
 that you can walk around, there's books and nerds and then it's surprisingly hot librarians

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,360
 nowadays, have you guys noticed that?

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,400
 I don't know what it is, nowadays librarians, they're just hot, they don't even have to

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,080
 let their hair down or take their glasses off, it's not like 'cause she's all that,

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,160
 are they nerdy or hot type of thing, they're just hot, have you guys noticed that?

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,440
 I don't know, maybe it's just me.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
 But you're like okay, you pervert, I'm not allowed in the libraries anymore.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,400
 I'm outside on this segment 'cause I'm in a restraining order.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,600
 However, you guys get to walk around the library and you're looking for a book.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,960
 Now we don't know the name of the book, we don't know what part of the Dewey Decimal

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,400
 system it would be and probably dark magic occult knowledge, I don't think there's a

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,120
 Dewey Decimal number for that.

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:46,280
 We're looking for a book that may or may not exist, in fact, as far as we know, there's

40
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,960
 only three people who know of this book.

41
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,320
 So with teeters on the edge of an urban legend, a fictional tale, right, this could be completely

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:03,200
 made up, or something that's real that was never catalogued because in a sense you wouldn't

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,280
 want this book around.

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,120
 There is a guy online, he goes by the name Few Conflict 4038, he told this story, we're

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,280
 gonna call him Joey for short, but Joey, he normally posts online about like car transams

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,560
 and stuff like that, like hey is this muffler look cool, I don't know, I'm not a car guy,

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,920
 I have no opinion on that, he talks about music and stuff like that, he talks about

48
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,920
 relatively normal stuff and that's kind of what I like when I see stuff this bizarre

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
 online.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,640
 I've said this before, if someone's always talking about once in a lifetime paranormal

51
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,920
 events, it makes it seem less true, right, but if someone is just talking about ordinary

52
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,760
 stuff all the time and then one day posts something like this, just out of the blue,

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,120
 I'm not saying 100% that I know this is factual because I don't, but it does add a lot of

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
 weight to this story, and let's take a look at this.

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,720
 What Joey says is, he went online and he goes, I'm looking for a book and I want to know

56
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,880
 if anybody knows about this book, I know about it because my mother used to tell me about

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:15,720
 this book and she knows about it because her father owned it.

58
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,960
 And Joey comes from a Hispanic family as well, so Hispanic family, we're about two

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:30,760
 generations back, Joey's grandfather owned a book and this book, if you read it, would

60
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,520
 tell you exactly how you were going to die.

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,920
 Joey says that he's looking for this book and not necessarily like he needs possession

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,640
 of it, Joey's going online and he's like, has anyone heard about this?

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,840
 Does anyone know anything about this?

64
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,320
 He posted about it in the Urban Legends subreddit and he's like, I haven't been able to find

65
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,960
 anything online about it.

66
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,640
 Was this something that my grandpa told my mom to scare her to kind of keep her mind

67
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,520
 there, it's like you better go to bed honey or I'm going to make you read that book, you're

68
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,760
 going to find out you die, you die in your sleep when you're nine.

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,120
 Did he use it to scare the mom into doing things?

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
 Was this something that actually existed?

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,920
 Because Joey's never seen the book.

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,400
 So that's kind of what prompted this and he wasn't able to find anything online, he doesn't

73
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,960
 have a ton of information to go off of.

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,080
 But he did add this and this really I think is the thrust of the story when he was talking

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,120
 a little bit more about the book.

76
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,760
 His mom had told him that people who read the book went insane because they became so paranoid

77
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,080
 trying to stop the way that they would die.

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,280
 In first glance, if someone came to you with a book and they said if you read this book

79
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,560
 and it's funny, it's not like an envelope, it's not like a page in the book, I imagine

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,640
 you're like, okay, come on, all this Jacob stuff is super boring.

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,200
 When does Edward come back into the story and then tell me how I'll die?

82
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,760
 I don't know how thick the book is.

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,160
 I don't know if there's a plot, you're like, you're too bored, you're like, I don't want

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,560
 to read tonight, but you're going to find out how you die.

85
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,880
 Yeah, I'll read more tomorrow.

86
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,360
 I'm too busy watching Cobra Kai.

87
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,200
 Like, was it a real page turner or was it just like you opened it up and it said you

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 will die?

89
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,520
 You'll see this is the thing like imagine, I imagine you open the book up and it says

90
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,880
 you'll die in your sleep.

91
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,280
 It doesn't specify, at least according to Joey's description, when you'll die, just how you

92
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
 will die.

93
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,320
 If I read that, I thought, okay, I'm going to live to be, you know, 80, 90 and I'll die

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
 in my sleep.

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,000
 It's pretty good.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,480
 What if it said you will be buried alive?

97
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,720
 Like, at that point, you know you're being murdered.

98
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,880
 You know you're the victim of some brutal crime.

99
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,240
 You open the book up and it says you will bleed out in an abandoned basement.

100
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,920
 Like, it would depend, right?

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,440
 If it was a good death, you'll die in a hospital surrounded by your loved ones.

102
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,320
 It's like you're on an adventure and it's on the end and you're like, oh, there's a

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,880
 little drawing of you laying in a bed.

104
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
 Like that would be fine.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
 Like see, that's the gamble, right?

106
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,040
 If I told you, listen, you could open this book up and it'll tell you exactly how you

107
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
 die.

108
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,720
 First off, would you do it?

109
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
 Would you read that book?

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,040
 And it's funny because the way Joey, and this is a very, very short post, the way Joey

111
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,520
 has presented it is we don't know, it doesn't sound like the mother ever looked at the book

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,160
 and we don't know if the grandpa is even still alive.

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
 But would you look at that book?

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
 Would you open that book up?

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,440
 If somebody said this book will tell you exactly how you are going to die, would you do it?

116
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,440
 And I think it would drive you insane because if it told you in a year, if it told you the

117
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,920
 timeline, I think it would be less traumatic, right?

118
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,440
 You're like, oh, buried alive.

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,600
 I'm not buried alive, but it's 25 years from now.

120
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,920
 Time to party it up.

121
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,960
 Like you know what, if it's farther off in the future, no matter how horrific it is,

122
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,400
 you're like falling a wheat thresher, what, I don't even hang out at farms.

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,120
 But you know, it's not going to happen until I'm 82, so maybe it's some soil in green situation.

124
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,560
 I'm feeding somebody.

125
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,280
 So whatever.

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,360
 But if it just said you will fall in a wheat thresher, you would drive you nuts.

127
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,440
 And if you knew it was no matter what you did in life, you were going to die by falling

128
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,880
 in a wheat thresher, you first thing you would do is you'd move to a big city, right?

129
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,520
 You'd be as far away from farms as possible.

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,560
 And then you would not want to live, I'm assuming by like any roads, right?

131
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,640
 In case like a wheat thresher was driving through the Macy's parade in New York, you're

132
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,800
 out there with your balloons, you're like, yay, and then you fall in the wheat thresher

133
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,040
 float.

134
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,240
 But no matter what you did, something would make you die in a wheat thresher.

135
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,920
 You would end up becoming a punk rock band called the Wheat Thresher.

136
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,280
 You're like at the concert and you're dancing like, oh, who's this band opening up for slip

137
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
 knot?

138
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
 And they're like, it's Wheat Thresher.

139
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
 You're like, what?

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
 Get in here and move from the music.

141
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
 And they're like, it's Wheat Thresher.

142
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,440
 And you're like, no.

143
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,960
 And then the band stomps you to death.

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,680
 That's their signature move.

145
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,360
 They stomp a single person to death each show.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,720
 Yeah, like it would drive you insane if it was something.

147
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,920
 Again, if it was you dying bed, you dying a hospital, you dying your sleep, you'd be

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,160
 like, OK, even if that happened tomorrow, you'd be like, oh, OK, it doesn't give me the exact

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
 date.

150
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,360
 But I don't think you would never sleep again.

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,080
 You would assume that'd be a peaceful death.

152
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,880
 But if it was like killed in a mass shooting, stabbed in the brain, you could stop naming

153
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,400
 the worst possible things you can think of.

154
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
 That would make you more paranoid.

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
 That would make you 100 times.

156
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
 You wouldn't be able to enjoy life, right?

157
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,240
 You would constantly be worried about someone stabbing you in the brain during a mass shooting,

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,720
 oddly enough.

159
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,640
 Yeah, so does this book exist?

160
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
 That's the first question.

161
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,880
 And it would be terrifying if it did.

162
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,360
 I'm a fan and a believer of items like this.

163
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,920
 Like, if this story turns out to be totally fake and some sort of ARG, I apologize for

164
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
 wasting your time.

165
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,560
 But I do believe items like this can exist.

166
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,680
 Most objects are one of those things that I do personally believe in.

167
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,080
 From haunted dolls to things like this.

168
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
 Ancient texts.

169
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
 Not so ancient.

170
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,400
 I mean, I'm sure somewhere in some used bookstore, somewhere in the world right now, there's

171
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,120
 a copy of a paperback Dime Store romance novel published in 1987.

172
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
 That is cursed.

173
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,760
 It has some sort of dark energy attached to it.

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
 I believe in that stuff.

175
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,240
 I've come across that stuff personally.

176
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,960
 Did I ever tell you, I told you the guys, the story about the doll we found in the backyard

177
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,560
 that hypnotized me and Jackie.

178
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,600
 I told you guys that story, right?

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
 Put in the comments or email me if I never told you that story.

180
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,560
 Like, no Jason, you clearly didn't tell me that time where you were hypnotized by a doll.

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,920
 I'm pretty sure I told that story.

182
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,280
 But anyways, if I didn't, I'll tell it in a future episode.

183
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,920
 I believe in those things because I've come across those things.

184
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
 This story fits with things.

185
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,600
 I've never come across a book that would tell me if I was dead, but that's why I'm so fascinated

186
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,280
 by this, even though there's not a lot of information to go off of.

187
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,680
 And two, if it did exist, would you read it?

188
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,940
 That'd be the big question because it's a gamble.

189
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,720
 If it was a piece of...and again, not knowing the date.

190
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,280
 If it just said the way you died, that's the big difference.

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,680
 If it said I was going to die violently at the age of 92, I'd be fine with that.

192
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,040
 Because I know I could...I know that I could be as violent as I wanted to other people.

193
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,440
 People are beating me up and I'm like, "Haha, nothing will stop me till I'm 92."

194
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,640
 And they throw me in prison.

195
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,080
 And I'm like, "Oh, I probably shouldn't have been violent towards all those random people.

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,600
 Now I'm going to be in prison until I'm 92."

197
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,640
 If it told you the date, that'd be one thing, no matter how brutal it was, you could at

198
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
 least not be paranoid until that last year of your life.

199
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,920
 But if it was just like, you are going to be crushed by a wall and you knew it was going

200
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,800
 to work because it happened with everyone else who read that book.

201
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,840
 They ended up dying the way that the book told them to.

202
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,800
 You would become super paranoid because you don't know if it happens while you're reading

203
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 the book.

204
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,280
 It happens a hundred years from now.

205
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,920
 So would you read that book knowing that it could either give you peace of mind, that

206
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,720
 it'll be a very peaceful death, and there's nothing you can do to change that peaceful

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 death.

208
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,840
 You could go skydiving, you could do all these crazy sports and stunts.

209
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 I'm the next evil, kind of evil.

210
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,160
 It doesn't say anything about me.

211
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,360
 I'm sure you might be able to break all the bones in your body and still be alive.

212
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,720
 The book's not that specific, but you would have a freedom knowing that you were going

213
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
 to die in your sleep.

214
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,000
 You're like, "Well, I know I'm not going to die following an airplane.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,160
 I've always wanted to go skydiving."

216
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 You know what I mean?

217
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,520
 It's super interesting, but if you open that book and it was a bad ending, it was a choose-your-an-adventure

218
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:51,640
 that you can't turn to page one and start over, would you open it?

219
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,720
 Forbidden knowledge.

220
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,800
 Like at what point do you access it?

221
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,720
 In my 20s, I probably would have read the book.

222
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,440
 But it's funny because at 45, it turned 46 in about two weeks.

223
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,320
 I'm much closer to dying than I was when I was 20.

224
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
 Well, it doesn't seem like that.

225
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,720
 I was a knucklehead in my 20s, but I don't think I would read it now.

226
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,680
 I think it probably would drive me insane.

227
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,680
 But what would you do?

228
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,200
 Very, very interesting.

229
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,480
 Sorry, right?

230
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,400
 Very interesting dilemma.

231
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 Would you read the book or not?

232
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
 Does it exist?

233
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
 Who knows.

234
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,560
 It might be sitting in someone's library somewhere.

235
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,800
 Waiting to be read.

236
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,720
 Waiting to be innocently picked up by somebody, not knowing what it is.

237
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
 They read it and they wouldn't believe it.

238
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,520
 They wouldn't know the lineage of it.

239
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
 They'd be like, "What?

240
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
 It says that I'm going to die.

241
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,100
 It says I'm going to die by dismissing a book, throwing it over my shoulder and knocking

242
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,520
 over a huge thing of molten steel."

243
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,320
 He's reading it in his molten steel factory.

244
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,160
 It's not going to make sense.

245
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
 So who knows?

246
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
 Horseboy, oh, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter where we are

247
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,200
 leaving behind this molten steel factory as a tidal wave is chasing us.

248
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,680
 Sorry, we can't save everyone.

249
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,480
 We have room, but we don't have time to pick you up.

250
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,200
 Horseboy, oh, take us out of here.

251
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,880
 We are headed all the way out to British Columbia.

252
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,000
 [imitates horse noises]

253
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,880
 Specifically, we're headed to Abbotsford in British Columbia.

254
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,200
 It's November 1st, 2016.

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,280
 And before we get started, I want to give a shout out to the person who recommended this

256
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,200
 story to me, Brew.

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,920
 Brew emailed me this story quite a long time ago.

258
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,200
 Quite a long time ago, I got his email and I don't know why I waited so long to tell

259
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
 this one.

260
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,160
 This is a really cool story.

261
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,120
 On November 1st, 2016, in the town of Abbotsford, there's a young man walking down the street.

262
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,800
 His name is Gabriel Brandon Kline.

263
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 On this particular morning, Gabriel's walking around town and people can tell something's

264
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,680
 wrong with him.

265
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,960
 Even though on video camera, video surveillance footage that we have, he looks like he's smiling,

266
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,200
 he looks normal, right?

267
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,280
 He looks like anyone else walking into the store.

268
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,680
 He wasn't being video-taped.

269
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
 A lot of witnesses said, "Yeah, we noticed this guy walking down the street.

270
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,800
 He was screaming at the top of his lungs.

271
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,760
 He was shouting at people randomly."

272
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,400
 Oddly enough, when he walks into a liquor store, he has a big smile on his face.

273
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
 He's not screaming.

274
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,480
 He's not drawing any attention to himself, which is probably smart on his behalf because

275
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,240
 he's actually going into shoplift.

276
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,080
 And we see on video him shoplifting two bottles of alcohol and throwing them in his backpack

277
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,800
 and then just walking out of the store.

278
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
 Now like I said, this wasn't the town he grew up in.

279
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,200
 He actually was originally in Alberta, Canada.

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,200
 But early in his childhood, early in his childhood, he knew there was something wrong with him.

281
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,800
 He was having these delusions.

282
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,160
 He was believing things that weren't real and he was hearing voices and he said he had

283
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,400
 two voices in his head.

284
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,400
 A good voice and an evil voice.

285
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,520
 The evil voice he named Lucy and she would tell him to think awful thoughts, to do awful

286
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,560
 things.

287
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,160
 And as his delusions grew, he ended up fleeing Alberta because he believed he was being chased

288
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:19,320
 by three different organizations, white supremacists, the Hell's Angels and the Mounties, the Royal

289
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
 Canadian Mounted Police.

290
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,040
 Which if I was being pursued by white supremacists and the Hell's Angels, I would hope the Mounties

291
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
 were chasing me.

292
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
 I'd be like, yeah guys, I'm glad you're here.

293
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,080
 I'm currently being pursued by a bunch of white supremacists and Hell's Angels.

294
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,480
 Can you help me out?

295
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
 But his delusions weren't making sense, right?

296
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,000
 What were these groups doing running together?

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 So he ran.

298
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,640
 He left Alberta and he was homeless, just walking around.

299
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,240
 He finds himself in Abbotsford in November of 2016.

300
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,360
 He's stealing that liquor.

301
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,840
 Now he did take a couple shots, a couple shots of alcohol and he continues walking down the

302
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,960
 street screaming at the top of his lungs.

303
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,480
 And yet people just passed by him.

304
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,040
 There's no report that I could find of anyone calling the police and saying, hey, there's

305
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,080
 this lunatic walking down the street screaming at the top of his lungs.

306
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,520
 Everyone just kind of minded their own business.

307
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,040
 A few hours after going into the liquor store, we have him on video going into a Cabela's,

308
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,560
 which is an outdoor sporting hunting type store, if you're not familiar with him.

309
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,660
 And we have him.

310
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,000
 We see him on video walking into the Cabela's and he goes straight to the hunting knives

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 section.

312
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,720
 This pretty dope store that you have an whole area just for hunting knives, but he's walking

313
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,040
 around, he's looking in the hunting knife section and he sees one that he likes and

314
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,200
 he just walks out with it.

315
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,320
 Just walks right out of the store holding the knife.

316
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,520
 Didn't even put it in his backpack.

317
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,960
 Walks out holding this knife.

318
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,760
 As he's walking down the street screaming, shouting, drawing all this attention to himself

319
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,120
 and yet no one is paying any real attention to him, he begins to see things following him.

320
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,720
 The shadows are back.

321
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,840
 He catches out of the corner of his eye dark figures slowly stalking him.

322
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,200
 And the voices in his head are only getting louder.

323
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,480
 The alcohol didn't help, which it rarely does, right?

324
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,680
 You can self-medicate to a certain point, but when you're in this level of a mental crisis,

325
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,400
 a couple shots at Jack really aren't going to do, they're not going to do Jack at that

326
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,960
 point, right?

327
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,040
 And he, this isn't the first time he felt this way, but on November 1st he is completely

328
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 suicidal.

329
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
 And he's alone.

330
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,320
 He's walking through the street.

331
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,760
 And he decides, you know what, all I want to do is talk to my mom.

332
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,120
 All I want to do is talk to my mom, and it might be the last time I ever talked to my

333
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,920
 mom, right?

334
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,440
 I want to let her know the despair I'm feeling.

335
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,720
 I want to let my mom know that I'm at my lowest point.

336
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,640
 I feel like killing myself.

337
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,000
 So he walks to Abbotsford Secondary School, which is a high school in Abbotsford.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And the reason why he went there is because he wanted to use a computer to email his mother.

339
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,440
 There is no other way that he could think of to really get to a computer, so he figures

340
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
 they're in the high school.

341
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,240
 He walks into the high school completely uncontested.

342
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,840
 No one even thinks anything about this adult, this 21-year-old man walking into this high

343
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
 school.

344
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,320
 You could say, "Well, Jason, you know, he had a backpack on, so maybe he looks like

345
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
 a student."

346
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,040
 I should also add he's barefoot, right?

347
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,320
 Not a lot of students are walking around barefoot, not a lot of students are 21-years-old.

348
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 Not a lot of students are screaming to the top of their lungs.

349
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,640
 He's like, "Go team!"

350
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,200
 It was weird because he would only scream out loud when he wasn't trying to be stealthy.

351
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
 And so you have to start to wonder, like, was he insane?

352
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,840
 That's a question that'll pop up as this story progresses.

353
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,040
 He walks into the high school not acting like a lunatic.

354
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,000
 He walks in a library and there's no seats available at any of the computers.

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,240
 So even in the darkest moment, he still can't reach out to the one person he knows who will

356
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,200
 always have his back, his mother.

357
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,440
 So he walks out and there's this rotunda in the school and he kind of sits down there.

358
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
 What do I do now?

359
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
 Right?

360
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
 Wait for a computer?

361
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
 Do I just continue walking?

362
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
 What's next?

363
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
 Right?

364
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,680
 I just want to talk to my mom.

365
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:41,960
 And at that point, he sees pure evil in front of him.

366
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:54,520
 In this school, he sees a witch, an evil practitioner of the dark arts.

367
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,160
 Possibly the cause of all of his hallucinations, the voices in his head, the shadows that stalk

368
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
 him.

369
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 The supernatural warlord is walking right in front of him and standing next to her

370
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,240
 a zombie.

371
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:23,480
 The decayed remains of a human somehow walking upright, maggots crawling out of its skin,

372
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,280
 monsters through and through.

373
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,160
 He may have questioned what he was seeing.

374
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,720
 He may have thought, well this doesn't make any sense.

375
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,520
 If he did have that thought, if he did think, wait a second Gabriel, don't overreact.

376
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,000
 It's the day after Halloween.

377
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,760
 There's no way that could actually be a real witch and a real zombie in this school.

378
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:56,280
 He may have had those thoughts, but when these two creatures walk past him, Lucy, the evil

379
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:06,320
 voice in his head, begins to scream at him.

380
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,120
 Gabriel pulls the hunting knife out of his backpack and attacks the demons in front of

381
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:21,800
 him.

382
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,280
 We have video footage of this as well.

383
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,760
 As far as I didn't look super hard for it, I saw one screenshot, I don't like watching

384
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,720
 video of people being brutally assaulted.

385
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,520
 I saw a screenshot and then YouTube had taken down the video.

386
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,160
 There was a lot of articles from the local authorities saying please do not share this

387
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,400
 video with people.

388
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,840
 This is very upsetting and it's upsetting to the people involved in it and just upsetting

389
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 to watch.

390
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:58,080
 There's a six second video going around and you see Gabriel standing over a teenage girl

391
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,520
 swinging his knife at her.

392
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,440
 She's trying to crawl away and he's continuing to attack her.

393
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:15,240
 You hear a piercing scream over all the other noise, over all the other chaos.

394
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,360
 Still the rotunda that they're all standing in.

395
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,920
 And then a man approaches Gabriel.

396
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,160
 Gabriel immediately drops the knife back away.

397
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,580
 Once he dropped the knife, Gabriel said he looked down.

398
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,280
 There was no witch.

399
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,920
 There was no zombie.

400
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,320
 It was simply two teenage girls.

401
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,880
 So we have this situation where now he's looking down, he sees that there are two young girls

402
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,880
 in front of him and once he drops a knife he says a voice in his head, assuming the good

403
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:57,960
 voice said you're going to hell now.

404
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,040
 And while we don't know what his eternal punishment will be, we do know what happened

405
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,920
 instantly after he dropped the knife.

406
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,240
 The school principal tackled him and the staff restrained him while other members of the staff

407
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,320
 tried to perform first aid on these young girls.

408
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,560
 One was 13 years old and one was 14 years old.

409
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,720
 It stabbed multiple times in a very, very short period of time.

410
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,200
 Both girls had to be airlifted out and fortunately the 13-year-old girl, she died.

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
 She died of this attack.

412
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,600
 The 14-year-old girl did not die but she was stabbed multiple times as well.

413
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,520
 Eventually his trial was held and it just really came to a close in 2021.

414
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,240
 He was sentenced to life in prison, eligible for parole in 16 years and he was giving

415
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,320
 seven years of credit because he was in jail for so long.

416
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,760
 So technically he could be out for parole in 2030.

417
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
 What is that?

418
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
 Eight years from now he could be out.

419
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
 It's super weird.

420
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,200
 The crime took place in 2016.

421
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,160
 He was sentenced in 2021.

422
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,080
 So I'm bad at math but that's only five years between 2016 and 2021, right?

423
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,400
 How did he get seven years' credit if only five years had passed?

424
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
 I don't know.

425
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,080
 Canada has a really weird justice system.

426
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,440
 Britain has probably the worst that I've ever seen.

427
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
 They let lunatics go all the time.

428
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
 They do.

429
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,480
 I'm not saying America's justice system is anything that I know about.

430
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,400
 But Americans' justice system tends to over prosecute and other countries tend to under

431
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,440
 prosecute or under sentence.

432
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
 America tends to over sentence.

433
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,440
 Anyways, this guy murdered one girl, injured another one, and it's possible he'll be out

434
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,160
 of jail in 2030.

435
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,680
 But this story, I wanted to talk about this story for a couple different reasons.

436
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,440
 I want, I just find it fascinating, we talk about mental illness a lot on this show, right?

437
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,120
 What it must be like to be in the mind of a maniac.

438
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,480
 Secondly, you have to wonder about those voices, right?

439
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,280
 Like, whenever we encounter stuff like this, there's two different ways to look at it.

440
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,920
 As it being straight up mental illness, this guy has a chemical imbalance in his brain,

441
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,720
 or he had so many bad experiences in his life, it just warped his worldview.

442
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,440
 And that's definitely possible.

443
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,520
 I think there's always a conjunction of two things, right?

444
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,360
 I think that's the majority of people who quote unquote go crazy.

445
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,200
 It's a chemical imbalance in the brain, bad upbringing, maybe both of those smashed together,

446
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,280
 horrible life experiences, all that stuff, right?

447
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,440
 We've seen people get head injuries and become completely different and completely violent

448
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
 people.

449
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,360
 They're totally normal up until then.

450
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,640
 But then you also look at the demonic influences, right?

451
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,960
 Which I think is a minority of mental health cases, but I do think that there are people

452
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
 who are plagued by that.

453
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,360
 And then you wonder what the Venn diagram is between someone who's in a mental health

454
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,640
 crisis and being preyed on by forces of the supernatural.

455
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,040
 And you'll never know, right?

456
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
 You'll never know.

457
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,800
 We covered that one story, the one episode on this podcast that gave me nightmares.

458
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,280
 I think the guy was named Michael Taylor.

459
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:17,880
 He was a brutal, brutal killer who was infested with all of these demons.

460
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,280
 I'll put that episode in the show notes like that.

461
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,640
 Was to me the scariest episode of this entire podcast.

462
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,400
 Really of all my research of paranormal stuff in general, the story of Michael Taylor.

463
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,720
 These two voices, were they part of his imagination?

464
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,400
 Were they part of his illness?

465
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,840
 Were they an external force putting pressure on him?

466
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,560
 Like a demonic force instructing him to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

467
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,160
 It's a sad story too, you know?

468
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,240
 I mean, like, definitely he was at his lowest point possible.

469
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,160
 Like he was getting ready to kill himself.

470
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,800
 And what's interesting is the psychiatrist, when he first got arrested and he was being

471
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,240
 interviewed by psychiatrists, they thought he was faking.

472
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 They actually didn't believe his delusions.

473
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,880
 And I thought he was making it up.

474
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,080
 Which is always a theory.

475
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,080
 And this is so interesting too, because recently I did a net like real recently.

476
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,200
 It was in the past week or two.

477
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,640
 I don't remember what the episode was, but I was talking about someone snapping and going

478
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,440
 crazy and how scary that is.

479
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,640
 And a long time listener of the show, a long time supporter of the show, Fabio Nurbon, commented

480
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,080
 on my YouTube channel.

481
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,280
 I never thought about this before.

482
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 This is so fascinating.

483
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,200
 He said this right when I was prepping this story.

484
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,960
 He goes, "I don't fully buy the snapping phenomenon.

485
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,040
 How come that the one who snaps only seems to target weaker opponents?"

486
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,520
 Wow.

487
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,240
 I didn't think about that.

488
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,600
 And here we have this.

489
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,800
 He snapped and he saw these monsters and he attacked him with a knife.

490
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:56,960
 And the second that a man showed up, an adult man showed up, like walked onto camera.

491
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,360
 Once Gabriel sees a man show up, he dropped a knife and the delusions went away.

492
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,200
 Like as I was prepping this story, Fabio left that comment and I go, "That is so fascinating.

493
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,520
 He's right.

494
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,160
 You're right, Fabio."

495
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,160
 Generally speaking, these people snap and they don't snap and start punching Marines.

496
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
 They don't snap and start walking.

497
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
 They're like, "That's it.

498
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
 I'm done."

499
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,440
 And they walk into a mixed martial arts gym and start fighting people, right?

500
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,040
 Teenage girls.

501
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,480
 Fascinating.

502
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,320
 So you do have to wonder in these certain circumstances, how is it mental illness?

503
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,280
 Was it a lifetime of mental illness that was causing these problems?

504
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
 Was it actually a demonic influence?

505
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,000
 Piggybacking on the mental illness or a demonic influence of 100%?

506
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,920
 Did he make it up?

507
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,360
 Did he make it all up?

508
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,960
 Or is it that Venn diagram where a little bit of it's exaggerated, a little bit of it is

509
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,520
 authentic mental illness and maybe even a little smidgen of it is something darker?

510
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
 Who knows?

511
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,920
 The only person who really knows the answer to that story is sitting in prison.

512
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,200
 The only person who knows what's actually going on in his head, because the delusions

513
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
 are gone now.

514
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,000
 He says he's been on the right medication and everything like that.

515
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,840
 He's better now.

516
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,920
 So the only person who truly knows the whole story is sitting in prison and it's possible

517
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,160
 he'll be walking the streets again in the year 2030.

518
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,400
 If it was mental illness and he's better, the delusions are gone.

519
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,720
 I still don't think he should get paroled in eight years, but if he does and he's better

520
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,440
 and the mental illness is treated, then do we have anything to worry about?

521
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,440
 If it was these demonic forces that were kind of piggybacking on the mental illness, now

522
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,840
 he's served his purpose.

523
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,440
 He's killed people.

524
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,640
 He's sent fear throughout the community.

525
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,240
 He's shattered families.

526
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,400
 Maybe the demonic influence is gone.

527
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:05,440
 But if he's making it up, if the mental illness was all in act and he really just wanted to

528
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,200
 kill some young girls, everything else was faked.

529
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,440
 There's a chance he will be walking the streets again in just eight years.

530
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,600
 A man who fooled the justice system.

531
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:27,360
 A man who convinced the court that he had no control over his actions.

532
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,400
 When really, he was the only one in control.

533
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:39,840
 When he grabbed the knife, when he headed to the school, when he stood in court and convinced

534
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:50,440
 a judge to give him possible parole in 16 years, Gabriel was the one in control.

535
00:31:50,440 --> 00:32:01,320
 Not the voices, not the demons, not the illness, but a master manipulator who's already murdered

536
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:28,200
 once and may soon be walking the streets once more.

537
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:48,200

538
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,780
