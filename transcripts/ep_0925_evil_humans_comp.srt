1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 Pack your bags and get ready for a road trip.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,120
 We're gonna travel down Ghost Avenue.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,640
 And then we're gonna head out to the state of New Hampshire to take a look at a bizarre

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,920
 UFO encounter that forces us to ask the question.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,720
 If aliens arrive to change the balance of power on Earth, which side will you fight

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,720
 for?

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 The day on Dead Rabbit Raiding.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Raiding.

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
 I took the second I almost forgot my own name.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,760
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out in the world being yourself.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,840
 First off, let's go ahead and start the episode off by introducing one of our Christmas live

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,040
 stream contributors walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,040
 Give it up for stinkbugpotato.

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
 Woohoo!

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
 Yeah, don't step on him.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
 Don't step on him.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,040
 He's a little stinkbug walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,760
 Stinkbugpotato, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,400
 Or the live stream, it's totally gravy.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,040
 Just helps read the word about the show.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
 That's another way you can really, really help out a lot.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,640
 Now stinkbugpotato, I'm gonna pick you up and put you in my pocket.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,720
 If you get to drive anything you're too tiny, a little stinkbug.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
 You get to put your hands on the steering wheel.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
 We're gonna take the Jason Jalopy out of Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,360
 We're gonna drive all the way out to California.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,920
 Little Jason Jalopy, little old-timey, chitty-chitty bang-bang car, driving through the highways

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,640
 and byways of America.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,080
 Specifically, we're headed out to Granada Hills.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,680
 So driving down street or highway probably would probably be a lot easier to get there

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,040
 instead of taking surface streets the whole way.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
 We're on the freeway, actually we are specifically on a freeway.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,240
 We're on 118 freeway.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
 We're headed eastbound.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,200
 So we're on cars are driving by us.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,480
 We're actually pulled over to the side of the road because we got here a little bit early.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 This is a spooky story.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,240
 It takes place at night, but it's like 3 in the afternoon so we're eating some fast food

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,440
 in the backseat and the sun goes down.

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,880
 I probably just started the story at night.

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,720
 And then the moon comes up and it's all spooky time.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
 It's night time and now we're ready for the story to start.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,120
 So we're sitting in the car, I'm like, "Wake up, wake up, it's story starting."

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,080
 And we see an unfortunate family in front of us.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,680
 It's a family of four and you see a mom and a dad and then two kids and they're standing

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
 on the side of the freeway.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,640
 You can just see them kind of looking from side to side and they're just like, "Where

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
 are we dad?

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 What are we doing here?"

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
 And the dad's like, "I don't know.

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,160
 I know we should have taken a left there, but it's freeway.

56
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,360
 It's just one straight line."

57
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,840
 And the wife's like, "Honey, why didn't you ask the gas station attendant for directions?"

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,480
 And he's like, "For the last time, that guy was hallucinating.

59
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,640
 You need to start taking your medication."

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,800
 We haven't been to a gas station for like eight hours and we see this family like bickering

61
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,880
 and arguing out there and they're just kind of like lost.

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,600
 The you being the friendly person, you are go to get out of the car and you're like,

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 "Maybe we should give them directions."

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 I'm going to go over there.

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,560
 I was like, "No, no, no, don't go over there."

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
 Because have you noticed something?

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
 I mean, you notice something with that family?

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,880
 You see that mom and that dad and those two kids, they look all sad and they're on the

69
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
 side of the road.

70
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,840
 I go, "Think about it, bro.

71
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,160
 Where is their car?"

72
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,280
 And you're like, "Whoa, dude, I did not even think of that."

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
 Now this is a real ghost story.

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,960
 It's been reported on 118 Freeway Eastbound.

75
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
 It's exactly that.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,200
 You see this family on the side of the road and it looks like they're having car trouble.

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,320
 They're just kind of gathered around.

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,000
 It looks like they're waiting for someone to stop and help them.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,840
 But there's no vehicle there.

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,520
 And if you see them and you pull over, if you're a friendly person unlike me, you just

81
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,000
 sat back and watched that little show.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,560
 If you pull over to help them, they disappear.

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,560
 And it's interesting because when you are driving, I could totally see this being a

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,040
 real event in the sense that when you're driving on the Freeway, you're going pretty fast,

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,960
 and you would see the people on the side of the road and you'd be like, "Oh, I need

86
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,520
 to help that family."

87
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,480
 And by the time you pass them, obviously, and now you're already going past them and

88
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,760
 you're like, "Oh, I better go help them so you might double back."

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,560
 You might get on an off-ramp and go back there.

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,000
 They wouldn't be there and you might even rationally be able to think, "Maybe they

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 got help.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,960
 Maybe by the time they got there, some other serial killer picked them up, you're like,

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,840
 "Oh man, those are supposed to be my four victims."

94
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,880
 It takes a second to process it.

95
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,600
 Even if you saw them farther off and you started to slow down and pull in front of them, even

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,480
 if you don't give them a rational time to leave, right?

97
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,280
 If you figured they, you wouldn't immediately think it was a ghost if you got on an off-ramp

98
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,800
 and came back around and then got back on eastbound lane.

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,920
 You wouldn't really think ghosts, but people who've pulled off right away when they see

100
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,120
 them, they still just vanish in front of them.

101
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
 So I read that story and I wanted to combine it with this other story and then we'll kind

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
 of take a look at this phenomenon altogether.

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,280
 I have a theory about this, so that's in Granada Hills, California.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,840
 Stink Buck Potato drive us on out to Arizona.

105
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:26,520
 We're headed to Ajo, Arizona, a place specifically known as Crater Range.

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,240
 Stink Buck Potato take this Jason Jalopy out to Crater Range.

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,400
 That's a place in Arizona near Ajo or Ajo.

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
 One of the two.

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,680
 I'm sure a local person will email me and let me know that neither is correct.

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,000
 In the 1950s, so this is an interesting story.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,920
 In the 1950s, back in Ajo, these couple just got married.

112
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,560
 So it's like ding dong, ding dong, ding dong.

113
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,920
 They're running out of the church and people are throwing rice at them and stuff like that.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,840
 They're like, "All right, we don't have to buy dinner.

115
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
 We're just going to have rice."

116
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,080
 They're like catching it in bags.

117
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,160
 They're like, "Thanks, family.

118
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,440
 They're going to eat all this rice."

119
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,040
 And they are driving from Ajo all the way out to Lake Tahoe.

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,120
 They're like, "Let's go to a place that rhymes with the city we got married in."

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,840
 And that's where their honeymoon is going to be at.

122
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,720
 So they're driving in their own car out to Lake Tahoe, but they never reach there.

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,400
 The hotel in Lake Tahoe is like, "Oh, where's the wedding sweet people?

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
 Where's the new married people?"

125
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,760
 We have this wedding sweet also on the Big Old Berber.

126
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,600
 And I've installed people's in their room.

127
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,880
 I'm waiting for them to show up as well.

128
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
 Where are they?

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,440
 As he's getting all sweaty.

130
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
 And they're like, "Hey, hotel manager.

131
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
 Yeah, they haven't arrived yet."

132
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,120
 And everyone's like, "Oh, no.

133
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
 We're missing people.

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
 We're missing bad people.

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,040
 We're missing sometimes so much to call the police."

136
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,200
 And what happens is this couple never reached their destination ever.

137
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,760
 Because what had happened was as they were driving through Crater Range on both sides

138
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,000
 of the road, there are these hills with huge rocks on each side of the hill.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
 Basically, you remember Dragon's Lair where those big balls rolled back and forth and

140
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
 you had to run in between them.

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
 It was that.

142
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
 It was that.

143
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,080
 It was that cartoon video game.

144
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,440
 But 1950s America, they, why would you just put a fence up or roll the boulder?

145
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,640
 I would have said, "No traffic for the next two days.

146
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,240
 Our construction workers are going to be pushing boulders around and just having them rolled

147
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
 down like controlled roll-olition.

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,200
 Just get the boulders out of the way first."

149
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,840
 You're like, "Jason, I'm glad you think everyone's the Hulk."

150
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
 And that's even feasible.

151
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,440
 Well, the Hulk could have saved them because as they were driving through Crater Range,

152
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,360
 one of these big boulders had rolled down into the road to see if I had, I would have

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
 pre-rolled the rocks and then we could have like smashed them with hammers and stuff like

154
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
 that.

155
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,440
 I guess you could have done that on the top of the hill, but it's less fun.

156
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
 I want to roll them.

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
 Wee!

158
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,640
 They didn't do what I said and a rock rolled down and their car crashed.

159
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,240
 It was their wedding night, bro.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,040
 Their car crashed into this rock and they both died.

161
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,120
 So they did not get to consummate their marriage.

162
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,280
 And as a poor perverted hotel manager, had to spend the night alone.

163
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,640
 And it is said that to this day, if you are driving through Crater Range, after midnight,

164
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,160
 there's a chance that you may see this young couple standing off on the side of the road

165
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,800
 trying to flag down help.

166
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,480
 The same thing when you pull over, they're gone.

167
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,720
 So you're driving through this obstacle course of falling boulders and then you're like,

168
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
 "Oh, God, that was close.

169
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,440
 I only lost three of my four passengers."

170
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,720
 And then you see this young couple, "Help us, help us, oh no!"

171
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,400
 And then you pull over and they're gone.

172
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,160
 And so I looked at those two stories.

173
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
 They're both creepy, right?

174
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,000
 Driving around late at night, ghosts.

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
 Those are both creepy stories.

176
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,680
 And discounting stuff like the Phantom Hitchhiker story, which is pretty common.

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,520
 I think everyone's aware of what the Phantom Hitchhiker is, but I'm actually surprised.

178
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,640
 This is why I picked these two stories.

179
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,120
 I'm actually surprised there's not more ghosts on the side of the road.

180
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,960
 Considering the amount of people who die in car accidents, we really don't know what

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,320
 causes the ghost phenomenon.

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,040
 Everyone has a theory, and most people actually believe two or three theories.

183
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,200
 For the most part, though, any one of these theories could cause a haunting.

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,160
 A tragic death, right?

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,320
 It's a very common thing.

186
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,720
 You have this house where this young woman, she lost her baby.

187
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,360
 She's like, "I don't know where to put down my baby.

188
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,840
 My baby is somewhere in this room."

189
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,640
 And she can't find her baby, and she kills herself.

190
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
 We see that a lot.

191
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,400
 Women falling down the stairs often leads to ghosts.

192
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,480
 Suicides very often become ghostly activity.

193
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
 So one, it's a tragic death.

194
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,560
 Two, it is unfinished business type of ghost, right?

195
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,120
 Those ones are a little more rare.

196
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,280
 Buried treasures, wills not followed, so the dudes like rattling chains and stuff like that.

197
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,920
 That one's not as common as the tragic death.

198
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,480
 And then the third one is actually kind of an offshoot of the tragic death, but it doesn't

199
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
 necessarily...

200
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,560
 No one has to die for this type of ghost.

201
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
 So it's kind of weird.

202
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,720
 It's basically a recording of an emotional event.

203
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,480
 So somebody getting in a huge fight, this marriage, these two people having a huge fight, and

204
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,800
 they're soaking the house of that energy.

205
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,000
 And then you move in like three or four years later, they are both alive.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,600
 They leave, but they left all this negative energy, and you'll be sitting there and it'll

207
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,400
 sound like someone slammed their hand into the wall.

208
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,520
 So it's not a ghost trying to communicate with you.

209
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,600
 It's a replay of the events.

210
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,840
 Those are kind of the three big baseline hauntings, and then you get into stuff like demons, which

211
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
 is something totally different.

212
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,480
 Those things are lucid and they're intelligent.

213
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,000
 Like usually like the ghost who died of the tragic death, they can't really change their

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 situation.

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,080
 It's just kind of replaying that event.

216
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,040
 The ghost that is a recording where it's the same thing happening over and over again,

217
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,760
 but it's not necessarily anyone dying.

218
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,320
 Footsteps down the stairs, footsteps down the stairs where people walk into your ceilings.

219
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,680
 Those aren't necessarily intelligent ghosts, right?

220
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,080
 That could be a recording of something.

221
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,600
 They're like, honey, you've been so bad tonight, you got to go sleep in the attic.

222
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,040
 It's not the spooky attic.

223
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
 He's stomping.

224
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,600
 He stomped through the attic all night long so his wife can't sleep.

225
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,960
 Those are kind of the three baseline definitions of a ghost, right?

226
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,320
 And then you have demons, which is something completely different.

227
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,000
 But think about where we spend a lot of our time on the roads, where we're constantly

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,840
 in a heightened emotional state, either super happy because we are listening to music that

229
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,200
 we really love or we're in a car with someone we really love and we're enjoying the sunlight

230
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,520
 as we're driving through Arizona.

231
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:27,840
 Or if I told you once and told you choice kids, do not ask me, are we there yet?

232
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
 Did you hear that?

233
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
 Hold on.

234
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,480
 Hey, this is Jason from the future.

235
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
 I'm editing this episode now.

236
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,120
 I don't have my mic with me.

237
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,080
 I'm on vacation.

238
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:51,160
 That sound that I heard, and I'll boost the audio so you can hear it as well.

239
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,800
 That was the sound of my bathroom garbage can lid.

240
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,000
 Pulling off and you go, well, just edit it out.

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Just edit it out.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,720
 I don't know what could have caused it, could have actually made it do that.

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,400
 I never use that garbage can never ever put stuff in there.

244
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,960
 It takes like a year to fill up because I never put stuff in there and I never take the garbage

245
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
 out either.

246
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:23,120
 The lid has not never fallen off like that before or popped off like that before.

247
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,040
 So does it mean anything?

248
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
 I don't know.

249
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,800
 It's not helpful that I'm talking about the causes of ghosts.

250
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,160
 I recently found a lizard in my house, so maybe it was the lizard who did it, but he's

251
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,760
 a little dude so I don't think he could flip off a garbage can lid.

252
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,600
 And a garbage can lid didn't fall off.

253
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 I mean, it did, but it wasn't gravity.

254
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,760
 I think something might have knocked it off.

255
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
 But was it a ghost?

256
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
 Was it a lizard?

257
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,280
 Jason, why do you have a lizard in your apartment?

258
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
 Is it a pet?

259
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
 No.

260
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
 It's been one day.

261
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 I named him Alexander and he's been running around ever since.

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,840
 But anyway, so I wanted to go ahead and let you guys hear that.

263
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,440
 I hope you guys enjoyed the sound of a garbage can lid flying off in a bathroom you can't

264
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
 see.

265
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
 Let's get back to the episode.

266
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,080
 The lid just came off my garbage can in the bathroom.

267
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,280
 I don't know how much of the mic, how much of that was picked up by the mic.

268
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,960
 Anyway, it's weird.

269
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
 Okay.

270
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,240
 Anyway, it's probably normal, right?

271
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,600
 One's lid flies off their garbage can every once in a while.

272
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,800
 But emotional heightened emotional states, right?

273
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,960
 Driving down the road and that's just the emotions.

274
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,040
 Then you have car accidents.

275
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,000
 Lot of car accidents, a lot of people dying of car accidents.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,600
 And then there are loved ones on the side of the road like grieving their loss.

277
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
 Jason, come on man.

278
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
 These episodes get dark sometimes.

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,560
 I can't even know where.

280
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,280
 Just soaking into the side of the road.

281
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
 You have that type of stuff.

282
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,360
 I'm actually surprised there's not more hauntings, which adds another little twist to the haunting

283
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
 thing.

284
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,440
 A lot of people believe, and I'm a proponent of this, is that you have to have generally

285
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,560
 one of, you have to have a spark, whether that's a emotional recording or violent death

286
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,600
 or unfinished business and a location that's suitable.

287
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,200
 So it could be like if someone died in a Macy's, it's not necessarily means that there's going

288
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,080
 to be a ghost floating around Macy's, right?

289
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,200
 People die everywhere, everywhere.

290
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,400
 And so the idea is there has to be like more than one factor, otherwise there would be

291
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 ghosts everywhere.

292
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,080
 So I don't know, like are these ghosts here because there's something, there's some different

293
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,360
 type of energy in these locations that makes the ghost get trapped here, makes this event

294
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,880
 play over and over again as opposed to if they died a couple miles down the road, you

295
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
 would have no idea this happened.

296
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,360
 Or, that's one theory, right?

297
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
 And if that's the case, we should have maps.

298
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,520
 We should have maps that say don't die here, you may be a ghost.

299
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,200
 But then the other idea is what if when you're driving down the road, it's just littered

300
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,920
 with the dead?

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,560
 That's terrifying, like you're just driving down the road and you just, all these people

302
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,000
 are just staring at you and you can't see them, they're just watching you.

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,640
 Scores of them, hundreds of them, thousands of them, people who died in buggy accidents,

304
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,400
 people who died yesterday in a car accident, right?

305
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
 You're driving on the road and they're just like, "I don't know."

306
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,800
 It's as terrifying as it is.

307
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,120
 I don't think that, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle.

308
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,120
 I think there's a reason why there's not a million billion ghosts, right?

309
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,800
 And there's somewhere, basically, somewhere between one ghost and a billion ghosts, why

310
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
 are certain places haunted?

311
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
 Are there a ton of ghosts on the side of the road?

312
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,240
 Is it, what if like every one out of a hundred cars you saw broken down on the side of the

313
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
 road was a ghost?

314
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,520
 Now you don't feel so bad, now you don't feel so bad about not pulling over and helping

315
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,040
 them people out.

316
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,320
 But a scary story, and again it makes you think like why are these particular locations haunted?

317
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,960
 They're not the only people who ever died in car accidents.

318
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,200
 They're not the only people who died in car accidents on their honeymoon, right?

319
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,720
 Like this stuff happens, there's tragic stories all the time.

320
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,280
 So why these people, why these locations?

321
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,880
 Is there an answer for that?

322
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,680
 Or are there millions of ghosts?

323
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,480
 But we can only see some of them, but they can always see us.

324
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,960
 Spooky, spooky stories, stink bug potato, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

325
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
 carbon helicopter.

326
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,600
 We are leaving behind Arizona, we're going to push over a couple of boulders and just

327
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,080
 get it over with.

328
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,720
 We're headed all the way out to New Hampshire.

329
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,400
 We're in the town of Hampton, New Hampshire.

330
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,560
 The date?

331
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,720
 September 30th, 1982.

332
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,480
 Ah, okay everybody run, go home.

333
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,680
 No, lock the door.

334
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,080
 Look out the window, Nancy, do you see anything out there?

335
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,040
 I still see it, Johnny, I still see it.

336
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:19,120
 A massive UFO appeared over the town of Hampton, New Hampshire, apparently.

337
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,400
 Multiple witnesses saw this massive UFO flying overhead and Hampton is nearby Peace Air Force

338
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,000
 Base, P-E-A-S-E, Peace Air Force Base.

339
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,560
 And you imagine they were also like, get the fighter scrambled, they're climbing up the

340
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,400
 ladders and stuff like that and the guys like, motioning with the glow sticks and they're

341
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
 like, go, go, plshh.

342
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,000
 Now, I'm not saying anything about this story, there are no fighter jets launched, there

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 are no fighter jets launched.

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,600
 Like, come on, you got to give me a little bit of joy, right?

345
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 We're shooting it down, plshh, nope.

346
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,520
 Roger 2, Roger 2 is down and none of that happened.

347
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:04,160
 Instead of that action-direct event, this UFO is flying over the area, multiple witnesses

348
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,840
 saw this thing and then it descended over by a swamp and went out of view.

349
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,440
 And reportedly also it dropped off a radar at that point.

350
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,900
 But while it was out of view, these two young women were running from it, but they ended

351
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,600
 up running towards it, apparently.

352
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,840
 Apparently they're not really good at directions.

353
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,320
 They end up directly underneath this massive UFO and an oval beam of light descends from

354
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,040
 it.

355
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,840
 And the two women are like, frozen in the light.

356
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,600
 One of the women, she's just frozen, she doesn't get any sort of special communication, but

357
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,280
 the other woman, we don't have their name.

358
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,600
 This story's interesting, there's some interesting behind the scenes stuff on this, but these

359
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,200
 two women are frozen underneath the UFO and one of the women, we don't have either of

360
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 these young women's names, but one of the women receives a telepathic message.

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,840
 Now, I'll reveal what that telepathic message is in a second, but I want to do some quick

362
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,640
 things a little more about the story.

363
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,080
 I got this story from ThinkAbout@Docs.com.

364
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,720
 They got it from a guy named John Paul Oswald.

365
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,280
 He wrote about it in a magazine or some sort of publication called UFO and Paranormal Perceptions

366
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280
 Winter Edition, 1994.

367
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,000
 Now John Paul Oswald's a pretty big name in UFOology.

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,280
 He used to work for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomenon.

369
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,280
 It was a, it sounds very governmental, but I believe it was a private group.

370
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,000
 And what's interesting, when you look at the story, it starts off by saying a very important

371
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,960
 multiple witnesses, nocturnal close encounter occurred in the city located near Peace Air

372
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
 Force Base.

373
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,400
 I could find no record of this report.

374
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,440
 I could find no record of a multiple witness large UFO in the year of 1982.

375
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,360
 New Hampshire actually has some huge UFO stories.

376
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,920
 They had the Exeter sightings, which happened in the 60s.

377
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:17,120
 It was one of the, it was a massive mass witness UFO event, but that happened like 20 years

378
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
 previously.

379
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,600
 But they're saying that this one, this particular incident, I could find no other reference to

380
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 this.

381
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,440
 And what's interesting just to note that the Betty and Barney Hill Abduction, which was

382
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,400
 the very first publicly talked about story of alien abduction, also took place in New

383
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
 Hampshire.

384
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,920
 So they do have some big events in UFOology, but this story itself, I couldn't find anywhere

385
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
 else.

386
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,360
 But again, think about it, Docs.com has never steered us wrong before.

387
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,960
 John Paul Oswald's a big name in UFOology, and we do have a lot of events coming out

388
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,680
 in New Hampshire.

389
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
 The weird, right?

390
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,440
 It's weird that I couldn't find any other reference to this story.

391
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
 So I wanted to clear that up, but let's go back.

392
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,000
 I want to talk to you about this telepathic message, because I think this is a really

393
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,720
 cool thought experiment.

394
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,600
 The telepathy, I want you to think about this.

395
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:16,200
 The telepathic message that the aliens gave to this young woman was, listen, there are

396
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:27,760
 evil humans on your planet right now trying to take over, and we want to stop them.

397
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 That's why we're here.

398
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,240
 We're here to fight against the evil human power structure that is controlling your

399
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,120
 planet.

400
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,000
 So let's, this is, it's interesting because that's a very, very simple phrase, and I know

401
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,400
 there's going to be some pushback, and I know there's going to be some automatic.

402
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
 This is my thing.

403
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,600
 If you knew that this wasn't Project Bluebeam, this wasn't, these aliens were being legit.

404
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,920
 They weren't hallucinations, they weren't holograms.

405
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,080
 I don't want you to think, well, what if the bad guys are controlling them?

406
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,520
 Take all of that off the table.

407
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,240
 Take all of that off the table.

408
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:15,160
 You are seeing in front of you an alien, someone from another planet, and that alien who you

409
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,800
 know is real and is sincere, there is no duplicity here.

410
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
 It's not actually a demon.

411
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,600
 This isn't a double cross.

412
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,600
 If an alien came to you and said, me and my race, we have traveled all the way here to

413
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,080
 take evil people off of your planet.

414
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,280
 So, right there, that's the initial statement, and they are being completely sincere.

415
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,560
 No fingers crossed, they don't have another agenda.

416
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:50,160
 And their definition of evil people is your definition of evil people in this scenario.

417
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:57,280
 Whatever person, whatever group you see as the main threat of society, an alien came

418
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
 down and there is no hidden agenda.

419
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,600
 They are being completely sincere with you.

420
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,240
 Alien came down and says, we are here to rid the planet of evil people.

421
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,760
 They are people who you believe are evil.

422
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 Would you help them?

423
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,000
 Now, again, I know I'm going to get comments saying, well, no, it's Project Bluebeam, they're

424
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
 really demons, they're intricate.

425
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
 All of that's off the table.

426
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,320
 You know, for a matter of fact, these guys are being completely sincere.

427
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,800
 But they're asking you to fight against your own species.

428
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,720
 The only thing you have different with your enemies is the way you view the world, the

429
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,360
 way you think the world needs to be better, political beliefs, religious beliefs, but it's

430
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,880
 your same species.

431
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,400
 This is a really interesting question, taking all duplicity off the board.

432
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,720
 You know for a fact, and I got to keep hitting that home because I know I'm going to get

433
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
 those comments.

434
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 If an alien says, will you help us fight this group, this group of humans who you believe

435
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,000
 are evil and we believe are evil, will you help us destroy them?

436
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,640
 I find that question super fascinating because I don't know what my answer would be.

437
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:21,680
 I've been thinking about that because I may know that there are groups on planet Earth

438
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,160
 that have done untold damage to people.

439
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,920
 And it doesn't even have to be like a world wide group like in the Illuminati.

440
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:35,280
 Imagine if an alien goes, listen, all of these dictatorships around the world, we're working

441
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,480
 against those too.

442
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,680
 We could free a billion people overnight and also provide them with food and medicine,

443
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,560
 all these countries that are starving, all these people that are oppressed.

444
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,040
 We could end it, but we need your help, Jason.

445
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,520
 We're going to destroy these evil world leaders and we need your help.

446
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,080
 Would I do it?

447
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,200
 Because see at the end of the day, they're aliens.

448
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,240
 And again, see your first instinct would be like, this is a trick.

449
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,400
 I watched all of these sci-fi horror movies, great, I love V, but I watch all these things.

450
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,440
 They're tricking me or this is Project Bluebeamer, the Indian, they're like, haha, no, you are

451
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,040
 an enemy all along or, and then they came for me type of scenario, like the aliens are

452
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,720
 playing humans off so we all destroy each other.

453
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,120
 No duplicity.

454
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
 I know for a fact, I'm sitting here with this alien and I know for a fact he's telling

455
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,280
 me the truth.

456
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:44,720
 He can actually save billions of people, lift them out of abject poverty, remove all oppression

457
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,320
 on them.

458
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,280
 No trick.

459
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,640
 No the cure is worse than the disease, nothing.

460
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,360
 Would I help him?

461
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,240
 I don't know.

462
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,600
 An alien, it's not human at the end of the day, it's not from this earth.

463
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,840
 And I always talk about this too, you gotta make it clear.

464
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:16,240
 To me, a human and a dog and an earthworm and a blade of grass, we're still all earthlings,

465
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,040
 right?

466
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,080
 We evolved here, we recognize each other on some sort of basic level, we're all from

467
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,080
 the same set of genetic material, not an alien, right?

468
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,440
 So it's such an outsider coming in, that's what gets humans in the problem in the first

469
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
 place, right?

470
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,160
 Now that I said that out loud, that's what gets us in the worst place anyways, the outsider.

471
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
 Right?

472
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,600
 If every human being on the planet was the same skin color and the same religion and

473
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,680
 everything was the same about them, we would still find something that was different and

474
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,880
 hate them for that.

475
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,820
 That's just the way of the world, we see that in every culture all over the world, right?

476
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,440
 We have a ton of differences, but even if we had none, we would make them.

477
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,320
 I personally do not know what I would do if an alien gave me that task.

478
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,160
 Again, the very first thing I would do and I think everyone would do is be very suspicious

479
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,720
 of them and not trust them, but again, so that would just be everyone's answer, "Well,

480
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,640
 I wouldn't trust them, I wouldn't know what to trust them."

481
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,760
 So removing that from the table, if you did try, you knew for a fact, through whatever

482
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,960
 way, they had already started doing this or you would, you just know, you just know I

483
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,800
 can't really, I can't think of a plot device that removes all doubt, but they have their

484
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 removal doubtinator.

485
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 Obviously, they were being crooked to you.

486
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,640
 You just know for a fact, you trust them instinctively.

487
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,600
 Would you take the sight of aliens against the people you hate?

488
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,960
 You hate the elite, that whole mechanism that's real in the world and they say, "We can destroy

489
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,480
 the Illuminati like that."

490
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,400
 But we need your help, we need these human agents around to do this and you look at the

491
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,040
 scorecard and you go, "All the human suffering, the Illuminati has caused," and you know,

492
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,200
 I have to keep hammering this, so he doesn't want me tired of hearing it, but you know

493
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
 the aliens are being legit.

494
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,280
 Would you go, would you fight against, this is really what it comes down to, would you

495
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,200
 fight against fellow humans and destroy them, kill them, right?

496
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,360
 Would you kill fellow humans in league with an alien race if you knew for a fact that

497
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,880
 they were on your side and that things are going to work out well if you guys won?

498
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,080
 And I don't know what I would do, as bad as the humans are on Earth.

499
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
 You know what I mean?

500
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
 They're human.

501
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,640
 It's just an interesting thought experiment.

502
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,160
 When I ran across that, I go, "That is really, I never had really, I mean obviously this

503
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,440
 and I've thought about it before in a fantasy type scenario like me and the boys, me and

504
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
 the boys like overthrowing the government or what I'm talking about.

505
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,680
 You did not hear that part, but you know, the government's super corrupt and we're like,

506
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,320
 "Yeah, we got to have like red dawn type scenario."

507
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,880
 Obviously, but yeah, I mean like obviously you know, you're not going to be able to do

508
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 it.

509
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,840
 It's a fool's errand to think that really a small group of people can initiate a ton

510
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,640
 of change unless you have a massive amount of resources, right?

511
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,760
 And when I say small group of people, I'm like talking like 10 or 12.

512
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,120
 I'm talking about like the Wolverines and red dawn, not, you know, what is it, 3% to

513
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,840
 5% of the population can change, can actually, that's what causes revolutions and civil wars

514
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,640
 and things like that.

515
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,040
 But for like global change, these aliens have the technology and like they go, "You

516
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,640
 can help us make the world a better place."

517
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
 But we need your assistance.

518
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:42,000
 The way I would see it is to be trained my own species.

519
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,920
 So I don't know, I'm actually curious to see what you guys think, to see how you guys,

520
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,280
 I'm not fishing for comments either, I'm not like, "Coming in the video, let me know."

521
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,920
 Just to think about it, like would you be, that's what it comes down to, right?

522
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,880
 Even though I have nothing in common with the families that rule the world, the Illuminati,

523
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 even though I have nothing in common with them, and we may have very, very different

524
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 ideas of what we consider to be a just and peaceful world, the end of the day, they're

525
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
 still human.

526
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,040
 I know some people will disagree with that, eruptillians and all that stuff, but assuming

527
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,840
 again that they're actually biological human, I mean, they were born, they experienced sunshine

528
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,880
 on their skin, they were on their swings and fell in love, scraped their knees and all this

529
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,120
 stuff that every human goes through, and the aliens devoid of all that stuff, they can

530
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,280
 change it, they can actually change it and they can rid the world of these evil power

531
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,160
 structures, but they need you to turn against your own species.

532
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,640
 Would you do it?

533
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,520
 I don't know the answer myself.

534
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,560
 I just, I don't.

535
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,560
 But there may come a day where the alien ship is hovering over me and they ask, they ask,

536
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,440
 will you help us fight those evil humans?

537
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,680
 And I can only hope by then.

538
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:11,800
 I not only have an answer, but I have the right answer.

539
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,360
