1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
 Was there an empire in Europe that was so powerful the world gathered their might to

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,720
 destroy them?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,600
 And then we traveled to Florida to take a look at a story that forces us to ask the

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,500
 question "If you were brutally murdered and turned into a ghost, would you become a spirit

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,120
 of vengeance or simply a lovable goof today on Dead Rabbit Radio?"

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:38,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,380
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,840
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,840
 Maybe you're making a Halloween outfit.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,440
 Costume I think is what they normally call it, it's not even.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,040
 Maybe you're doing that?

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
 Maybe you're not.

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,040
 It's one of the two, right?

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,440
 Maybe you're either dressing up or not, you're either currently sewing together a form-fitting

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,360
 Spider-Man costume or you're just sitting there doing the dishes.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,920
 But someone who always does both of the exact same time walking into Dead Rabbit Command

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,280
 is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,480
 Everyone give it up for GodRilla.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,320
 Yeah, come on in.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,680
 GodRilla into Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,320
 Long time supporter of the show, GodRilla.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,240
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,920
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand, I really do.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,880
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,560
 Now GodRilla, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,760
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,200
 Let's drive all the way out to Great Britain.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,360
 As you're driving on out to jolly old England, go ahead and hit that time travel button right

31
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
 there.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,080
 We're going back to the turn of the century.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,040
 The early 1900s.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
 Woohoo!

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,120
 And now we're just driving down the street.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,440
 There's cobblestones and stuff like that.

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
 There's old timey people tipping hats.

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,160
 Jack the Ripper is hiding in the darkness.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
 We don't warn anybody though.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,720
 We see him and we're like, "Oh, more true crime for us."

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,680
 This is early 1900s, late 1800s really, in Britain.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,240
 And we see a little bookstore.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,240
 We see a little bookstore on a corner and I was like, "Okay, that's where we're supposed

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 to be.

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
 We're going to go to the bookstore."

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,320
 And we jump out and we run in and I'm like, "Look at all these fantastic books.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
 There's like Wuthering Heights.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,600
 It's like First Edition, right?

49
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
 That just came out."

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,280
 And the Great Gatsby, the Great Gatsby standing over there.

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,360
 He's not even a fictional character.

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
 What?

53
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
 Who would have thought?

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
 He's doing a little dance in the corner.

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,240
 We're in this bookstore but we're looking for one book specifically.

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,440
 This book is entitled "Heartman the Anarchist" or "The Doom of the Great City."

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,840
 It's the full title of this book.

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,680
 And I got to give a shout out to Patreon supporter, St. Strand.

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
 He's the guy who sent me this story.

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
 Super interesting one.

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,320
 Let's take a look at this.

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,120
 We find a copy of "Heartman the Anarchist" and what this book is, it's a piece of literature

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,160
 that is part of a genre that's been lost for almost 100 years at this point.

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,040
 This book just recently got republished, "Heartman the Anarchist."

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
 Here's an interesting thing.

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,080
 We have a few pieces of media that show that this genre once existed.

67
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 But most of it's just like entries into a film catalog.

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,920
 Like the film itself is missing.

69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,280
 But we know the film was made the same thing with this book.

70
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,040
 For 100 years this book wasn't published at all.

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,800
 You could find proof of it in like some old man's library.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,880
 You'd see a little slot, an empty slot and be like, "This is where "Heartman" went."

73
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,600
 You'd see it in catalog collections and stuff like that.

74
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,560
 But physical copies, we couldn't find them.

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
 This genre was basically this.

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,200
 You had the peaceful people of Britain living in this post-industrial revolution.

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 Everything's going great.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,920
 Chimney sweeps are dancing.

79
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
 Ladies are wearing those big long dresses.

80
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,560
 And then all of a sudden the sky is darkened as these massive airships appear overhead.

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,320
 They begin to rain down fire bombs on the cities of the west.

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,840
 Run buddy, run!

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,080
 You go into the fire department.

84
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 It's on fire.

85
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 They dropped the bomb there first.

86
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
 You're like, "Oh no!

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 You're running out of street.

88
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,760
 You have like an old timey fire brigade."

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,240
 Then it turns into a Charlie Chaplin movie.

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,160
 He's running around spilling water everywhere he's on fire.

91
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,640
 He's burning alive.

92
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,040
 It was all of these stories.

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,440
 "Heartman the Anarchist" was not about so much an invader from the east.

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,560
 But this one was about this dude who wanted to become an anarchist.

95
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,680
 He aspired to make everybody an anarchist.

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,680
 And he figured that the way to do it was to drop fire bombs everywhere.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,240
 It was published in 1893 by an author known as Edward Douglas Fawcett.

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,280
 And there's this giant airship known as the Attila.

99
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,800
 Which actually does successfully destroy London in this fire bombing raid.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,400
 And "Heartman" says, "Listen, my goal is to create anarchy, to have this new anarchist

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,480
 form of society.

102
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,560
 But I also know that there needs to be a power base.

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,360
 I know the only thing for anarchy to work is a very rigid government above it."

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,240
 So his plan, and this is a successful plan, is to fire bomb London to turn the...

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,200
 nation into this anarchist society.

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,280
 But if anyone ever gets out of line, if anyone's not anarchist enough, the Attila, the giant

107
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,080
 airship will continue flying around looking for people not being anarchist.

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,200
 You see a guy, he goes, "Rule number one of my new business, he gets firebombed."

109
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,280
 So in this story, it's kind of a...

110
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,160
 I mean, basically the villain realizes that the society I want can't function unless there's

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
 another...

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,320
 Unless there's an organized government over it to force anarchy among the people.

113
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,580
 So we have that book, "Heartman the Anarchist," and then there's the other piece of media

114
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,320
 we could find.

115
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,240
 There's a silent film called "The Aerial Anarchist."

116
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,520
 It's the same kind of thing.

117
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,120
 It's this idea that big blimps...

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,200
 I don't know how do a bunch of anarchists build a blimpy...

119
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
 I don't know anything about it.

120
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,720
 How would a bunch of anarchists build a blimp in the first place?

121
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,360
 Because they're like, "I want to do the balloon part."

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,640
 They're like, "No.

123
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 You load the firebombs."

124
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,080
 And you're like, "Uh-uh, it doesn't sound very anarchistic to me."

125
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,520
 I get to do whatever, everyone just wants to do firebomb duty and they don't have a

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 blimp.

127
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
 They just all sit on the ground and they're like, "Uh, we should probably rethink this."

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,040
 I don't know how a bunch of anarchists could construct anything, but apparently they're

129
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,840
 able to build the greatest fleet of blimps possible.

130
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,360
 They fly over London to throw down firebombs.

131
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,640
 The movie "The Aerial Anarchist" is gone.

132
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,480
 We can't find any copy of it remaining.

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,400
 It was a silent film made by a director known as Walter R. Booth.

134
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
 Very interesting.

135
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,680
 He was a stage magician who moved into film, so he started using all of these tricks.

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,920
 He's floating around the set.

137
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 He's all "Do My Biddy."

138
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 And they're like, "Uh."

139
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
 He did.

140
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
 He saw on the assistant director in half.

141
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,520
 He learned all these visual tricks.

142
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,400
 He was able to translate them to film.

143
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,800
 So we see reviews of movies like this.

144
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,640
 And they're like, "Yeah, it looks pretty good."

145
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
 It looked pretty good.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 There's a rabbit.

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,880
 They're pulling out firebombs and then they pull out a rabbit and throw it down accidentally.

148
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,720
 Anyways, there's no surviving footage of that movie, but it's kind of the same thing.

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,040
 This one, the anarchists, are just up here overhead.

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,080
 And it's fairly short because I actually found this sequel, which was called "Aerial

151
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 Torpedo."

152
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,000
 It's the same thing.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,980
 It's a bunch of dudes in blimps throwing down firebombs.

154
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,920
 And then a guy builds a torpedo and it flies around and blows up one of the ships.

155
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 And they're like, "Yay."

156
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,080
 There's also a weird subplot to that one where it starts off with this guy, this inventor,

157
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
 of the aerial torpedo.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
 He's in love with this girl.

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,640
 They go to the girl's house.

160
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,160
 The dad's like, "Uh-uh, you can't date my daughter."

161
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,400
 And then he's all forlorn, the young inventor.

162
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,260
 And then these anarchists show up and he's like trying to finish his aerial torpedo as

163
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,560
 fast as possible.

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,940
 He was building the torpedo before the anarchist showed it, by the way.

165
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,980
 It was like 90% done.

166
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,500
 The anarchists are bombing all of London.

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,060
 They just happen to blow up his girlfriend's dad's house.

168
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,580
 He runs, he pulls his girlfriend out of the wreckage, he goes back in, he pulls the dad

169
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,060
 out of the wreckage, he's dead.

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,220
 So then him and the girl run back to the lab, he finishes the torpedo, it blows up one of

171
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,940
 the ships, they win, and he gets the girl.

172
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,400
 Like, "Oh, that's pretty convenient, that's pretty convenient."

173
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,840
 It's like, maybe a little too convenient.

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,920
 Maybe he knew that the aerial anarchists were going to bomb the girlfriend's house.

175
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,720
 Anyways, we have this genre.

176
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,160
 We have this genre and there's more than just these two things.

177
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,200
 Now it was interesting because those are all real examples of this genre and it's basically

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,120
 invas- it's a subgenre of invasion literature where they're using these airships to come

179
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,920
 out and destroy the West.

180
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:32,180
 St. Strand had a theory that what could be happening here is these are linked to the

181
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,620
 Grand Tataria theory.

182
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,500
 Grand Tataria, we did a whole episode on them way back in the day, way back in the day.

183
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,100
 It's all connected to this idea of the mudflat and in short, there's a conspiracy theory

184
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,980
 that there was an advanced civilization in Eurasia.

185
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,680
 A group of people called the Tatarian Empire.

186
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
 And it doesn't exist anymore, it's gone.

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,120
 And we can find very, very brief references to this group of people.

188
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,720
 Like, as of today, there are a group of people known as the Tatars.

189
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
 They're still there.

190
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,280
 They're generally a group, there's about 7 million of them, they're Sunni Muslim, majority

191
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,540
 Sunni Muslim.

192
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,300
 They're in the area of what we would consider now mostly like Mongolia.

193
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,920
 It's that part of the continent.

194
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:36,260
 We have references and newspapers in the late 1800s of Tatarians having a standing military,

195
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,540
 having a dress form.

196
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,780
 There was a newspaper article saying like, "We're going to be greeted by people from

197
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,540
 the United States government and the Russian government and the Tatarian government."

198
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,900
 And you're like, "Wait, what?"

199
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,840
 It was such, but see, we say, "Wait, what?"

200
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,760
 Because back then, everyone knew who these people were.

201
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,440
 But today, what are they referencing?

202
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 There's nothing.

203
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,320
 Now you can even look at maps of old maps and they'll have the area of Tatari.

204
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:13,040
 And these people back in the day were actually so feared that they, when I say they, I mean

205
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,460
 the Western media, the Western governments added an extra R to the name of their society.

206
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,580
 It's Tatari.

207
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,660
 But another R was added to Tartari or Tartar.

208
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,180
 And the reason why is because it made you think of Tartaris, the place of hell, the place

209
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,020
 of the dead in Greek mythology.

210
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:42,260
 So they were actually trying to make them seem like this godless horde out east of Russia.

211
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,440
 What's interesting is we don't know if the name Tataria or the Tatarian Empire fell out

212
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,440
 of vogue because they were wiped off the map.

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,560
 Like literally, like even though they're here today, right, like I said, there's seven million

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,780
 of them, they're Sunni Muslim, we don't know if there actually was a standing empire with

215
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,960
 fortifications and cities and an army of 100,000 people and they were just obliterated.

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,560
 And then history covered them up.

217
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,260
 Like the people who were writing history completely left them out.

218
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,780
 That's the main theory about the Tatarian Empire, that it was a standing force, a standing

219
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,860
 military form of government, cities and everything like that.

220
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,260
 It wasn't just kind of a spread out ethnic group, that it actually was a standing nation

221
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,020
 like Russia or China or Japan.

222
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,140
 The idea was is that it used to be there and the governments of the world, specifically

223
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
 Russia, right?

224
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,500
 The other governments were complicit in this, but Russia wiped them off the map.

225
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,200
 And in the episode I did about Tataria, I said that's definitely possible.

226
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,600
 That's definitely possible when we look at this stuff.

227
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,920
 And there have been nations wiped off the map before.

228
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,800
 So we know that's happened in the past.

229
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,080
 So that part of the conspiracy theory is interesting and it's possibly true.

230
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,840
 One of them is it could be when you're seeing these references of the Tatarian uniform and

231
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,720
 stuff like that, that they are talking about a particular ethnic group that is contained

232
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,120
 in this area, but it does seem to be a little bit more than that.

233
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,820
 Because it's very hard to find references for this.

234
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,380
 There are actually more references to it now because so many people are looking into the

235
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,780
 conspiracy theory.

236
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,700
 We can find old maps that show Tataria.

237
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,100
 What's interesting though is the conspiracy theory, like conspiracy theories often do,

238
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,020
 tend to go one step further.

239
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,860
 And basically the idea that no, no, this wasn't just a normal group of people, a normal nation

240
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,740
 like Portugal or the United States or France or something like that.

241
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,840
 This was a high tech society.

242
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,440
 This was a group that had Atlantean level tech.

243
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,780
 And they got wiped off because the world didn't want to have such a super advanced group right

244
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,280
 next to them.

245
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,400
 It's super weird.

246
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,120
 That conspiracy theory is when you look up to Tatarian stuff now, you mostly find stuff

247
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,680
 with that conspiracy theory.

248
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,560
 Like they got wiped out because they had laser guns and spaceships and stuff like that.

249
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,620
 And it's such a weird escalation.

250
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,860
 To me, that almost sounds like you're trying to discredit the idea that these people used

251
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,740
 to be here and they used to be fairly powerful, but a normal nation that Russia wiped out.

252
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,580
 I'll put all my chips on the table.

253
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,820
 I don't think they had laser guns and I don't think they had spaceships.

254
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,620
 I don't think they had anything like that.

255
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,500
 I think if this country did exist and it had a working government, they were probably wiped

256
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 out and conquered.

257
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,220
 And yeah, they were written out of the history books.

258
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,600
 Russia did not want to have any record.

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,320
 This was their motherland.

260
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,640
 There was no other nation.

261
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,880
 There was no other great nation right next to them.

262
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,120
 They own everything from Moscow all the way to Siberia and there was no nation greater

263
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,040
 than them or even equal to them at any point in time.

264
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,000
 I think it's possible that there was a nation that was bordering Russia that was a threat,

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 not necessarily.

266
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It could have been military, right?

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,680
 It could have also just been ethnically or religious competition that Russia took out.

268
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,940
 I don't understand why all of a sudden they have laser guns and spaceships because the

269
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,340
 question then is, how did they lose?

270
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:18,660
 I mean, if you had a nation in the late 1800s that had access to technology that we don't

271
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,580
 have today, how did they lose all of this stuff?

272
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,740
 How did they lose this war and get wiped off the history book?

273
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,460
 Their holographic history books would be floating above us and they'd be projecting the truth

274
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
 down on us.

275
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,480
 And they had supposedly that level of technology.

276
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,040
 I love this conspiracy theory because I think part of it is true that there was this great

277
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,640
 nation out there, but I don't think they were technologically advanced.

278
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,360
 What's interesting about this lost media angle is it is possible that this idea of anarchists

279
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:59,160
 flying in blimps over the city, it may have just been a normal fear of the other, right?

280
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,060
 It could just be a normal fear of the others out in the wilderness or the others in your

281
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,740
 own society trying to destroy it.

282
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,380
 It could have just been that and it's that invasion media.

283
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:16,740
 St. Stran's theory, and I do like this theory, is that it wasn't just this faceless horde.

284
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,820
 These movies, this media, even though it doesn't specifically say "Tatarja," is that's what

285
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,020
 it means.

286
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
 That's what it means.

287
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,360
 A group of people somewhere in Europe that are trying to destroy our society, and when

288
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,420
 I say that I don't think the Tatarja had laser guns and jetpacks, they might have had a fleet

289
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,580
 of blimps that might have been a known thing back then.

290
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,500
 So that's an interesting thing and that would explain why that media just disappeared.

291
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 It could be because it fell out of vogue, right?

292
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,740
 At a certain point there was a real world war happening.

293
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,800
 So it could have just been that it had fallen out of vogue or it could have been a casualty

294
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,780
 of this Tatarian cover-up.

295
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:07,100
 It could have been a casualty of that when they were like "We need to erase all evidence

296
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,580
 that this nation ever existed."

297
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,380
 And they've done a very, very good job.

298
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,580
 Like again, if you talk about this, people are going to be like "What are you talking

299
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
 about?"

300
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,700
 Like it is so obscure, it's such an obscure topic that they've done a pretty good job of

301
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,860
 covering it up, and they may have also covered up any sort of media that references it directly

302
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
 or indirectly.

303
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,620
 And that could be why a lot of this stuff has fallen off, right?

304
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,780
 It's just disappeared.

305
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,700
 This is the media we know about, because we can have catalog records of it.

306
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,140
 We know that it was once in this collection, it was once exhibited at this theater.

307
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,220
 Think about all the other literature that could have been written about Tatarja that's

308
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
 gone.

309
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,820
 It's just destroyed, right?

310
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,020
 So easy to cover up information.

311
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,500
 And I do—my new conspiracy theory—thank you, St. St. Fr. for sending this over—my

312
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,940
 new conspiracy theory is that the idea that the Grand Tatarian Empire was this Atlantean-level

313
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,060
 tech society, I think that's disinformation.

314
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:10,420
 I think that's 100% to make people who look into this look like lunatics.

315
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,820
 Because that's just not true.

316
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,780
 I don't believe that's true.

317
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,260
 They wouldn't have lost the war.

318
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,620
 It would be totally different.

319
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,820
 The Russians would have then entered World War I with jetpacks and laser guns and things

320
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,980
 like that.

321
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,180
 I think that that is disinformation.

322
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,420
 If you look for this, you'll find so much of that stuff.

323
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,500
 And if you're just like casually interested in it, you'll go, "That's not true."

324
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,580
 So none of it's true.

325
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,740
 And then you just quit looking into it.

326
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:39,260
 I do believe that there was an empire probably out there that got wiped out.

327
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:45,660
 And if you can make the conspiracy theory sound absolutely insane, people will just

328
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
 take it as a joke.

329
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,140
 Same thing with alien and alien abductions.

330
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,700
 The amount of people who have actually been anal-probed, when I look at all the reports,

331
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,940
 it is so rare.

332
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,300
 It is so rare.

333
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,660
 But that's the joke.

334
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
 That's the joke, right?

335
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
 Did you get anal-probed?

336
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,500
 Oh, I'm going up to get probed.

337
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 Don't get probed.

338
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,740
 Don't let them stick stuff up your butt.

339
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
 I'm guilty.

340
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
 I make those jokes too.

341
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
 They're funny, right?

342
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
 They're funny.

343
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,820
 But that joke is straight out of a CIA handbook.

344
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,180
 All that stuff.

345
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,340
 100%.

346
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,980
 It's to make people who actually encounter aliens, they don't want to say anything.

347
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,140
 They know it's a big joke.

348
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,940
 Whether or not they got anal-probed, then they probably didn't.

349
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,500
 And again, it's super exceedingly rare in the catalog of UFO events.

350
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
 But that's the first thing people think of.

351
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,220
 These things are made to discount actual alien stories.

352
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,500
 Just like I think the high-tech nature of the Gran Turtarian Empire is made to discount

353
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,900
 the entire theory.

354
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,380
 Fascinating stuff.

355
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,980
 Lost media dovetailing into the world of conspiracy theory.

356
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
 You know what's interesting?

357
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,700
 I feel as we're approaching episode 1000, I almost feel like we're doing some of our

358
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,820
 greatest hits again.

359
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,180
 I didn't plan it that way, but I've noticed over the past couple weeks, I go, "Oh, this

360
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,580
 is kind of a follow-up to an episode 100 I did.

361
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,140
 This is kind of a follow-up."

362
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
 So that's kind of cool.

363
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
 I didn't plan it that way.

364
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,460
 It just seems to be happening.

365
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,540
 God, Rilla, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the world famous carbon helicopter.

366
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,540
 We are leaving behind Brits and Flames.

367
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,220
 We'll let Charlie Chaplin deal with it.

368
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,660
 We're leaving behind Jolly Old England.

369
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,980
 We're headed all the way out to Naples, Florida.

370
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,380
 Okay, everyone.

371
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,700
 You know, watching cities get burned really works up an appetite, doesn't it?

372
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,020
 And you're like, "No, no, you're still throwing up for watching Charlie Chaplin burn alive."

373
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,060
 I was like, "Ha, ha, ha, classic Charlie."

374
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,060
 It's time to eat.

375
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,860
 Let's go ahead and we're going to stop at this Cracker Barrel restaurant here in Naples,

376
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
 Florida.

377
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,500
 I've never been to Cracker Barrel.

378
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,620
 Apparently, it's a down-home country restaurant, so they serve like southern food, like chicken

379
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,900
 and, I don't know, green stuff.

380
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,420
 But the also have is so weird.

381
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
 It's a restaurant.

382
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,140
 This is the worst combination.

383
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,140
 It's a restaurant and a store.

384
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,460
 I don't know if they sell like old-timey rocking chairs and like little tiny scarecrows, like

385
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,500
 toys and stuff like that.

386
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,660
 But I mean, that would be the worst place to shop.

387
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,220
 Imagine you're like, "Oh, I only have a couple bucks.

388
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,540
 I got to buy a can of beans, maybe a diet Pepsi, and then you walk in and you smell all this

389
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,940
 delicious food."

390
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,620
 You smell the chicken and the green stuff cooking.

391
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
 You're like, "Oh, my stomach is hurting so bad.

392
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,940
 I'd want to eat that other stuff."

393
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,300
 I don't know if it's a grocery store in a restaurant.

394
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,940
 It might just be like a knick-knack store in a restaurant, which then you walk in and

395
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,220
 you're like, "Oh, I should have spent all my money on all of these tiny scarecrows.

396
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,460
 I really should eat something today."

397
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,540
 So you walk into the Cracker Barrel and you sit down and you're like, "One plate of chicken,

398
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
 please."

399
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
 And that's what we're doing.

400
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,260
 We're sitting there getting ready to fill our bellies.

401
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,940
 And then all of a sudden, the manager of the Cracker Barrel comes down and goes, "Guys,

402
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,220
 we don't have enough employees to work today.

403
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,300
 You, you, you.

404
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 You're employed.

405
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
 You're working here now."

406
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
 And we're like, "What?

407
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
 Us?"

408
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
 And he's like, "Yeah, come on."

409
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,340
 So we run into the kitchen and he puts the uniforms on us and he's like, "Okay.

410
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,700
 You, Jason, you, prepare the chicken.

411
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,140
 You go roll the chicken and the flour and stuff like that.

412
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:33,140
 And you," he's pointing directly at you now, "You go into the walk-in freezer and grab

413
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,820
 some frozen mushrooms."

414
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
 You're like, "What?

415
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,980
 I didn't know they froze mushrooms."

416
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,980
 You see the walk-in freezer back there and you walk back there and you open the door

417
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,100
 and you walk in and you're like, "Oh, this frozen food."

418
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,500
 And you're like, "Oh, that's kind of cold in here."

419
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 And then it gets even colder.

420
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,180
 You're like, "Oh, that was weird."

421
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:04,260
 Like I know it's cold in a walk-in freezer, but the temperature dropped even more.

422
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,420
 The lights and the walk-in freezer start to short out.

423
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:15,780
 You're like, "Jason, you're really trying to make a walk-in freezer scary?"

424
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:23,220
 This is a haunted walk-in freezer at the Cracker Barrel in Naples, Florida.

425
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,660
 If you're in the area, it's on County Road 951 near Interstate 75.

426
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,060
 This building still exists.

427
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:34,220
 If you're hungry right now, hungry for ghosts, you can go down there and order a pot.

428
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,300
 A plate of chicken and green stuff.

429
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,060
 This is one of those really interesting ghost stories where we do have the walk-in freezer

430
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,380
 that has the flickering lights.

431
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:51,780
 One of the things that is noticed is cold spots, colder than normal.

432
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,180
 You can stop rolling your eyes now.

433
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,020
 You can stop rolling your eyes now.

434
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,980
 It's a walk-in freezer where there are certain points that gets colder than normal.

435
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,300
 The light does short out from time to time.

436
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,660
 People have also reported in the walk-in closet as well as other places in the restaurant

437
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,060
 they'll see movement out of the corner of their eyes.

438
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,820
 Spooky stuff, right?

439
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,980
 This is one of those ghost stories that we know for a fact.

440
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,660
 This is something we run to all the time on this show.

441
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,220
 We know for a fact the crime that caused the ghosts actually happened.

442
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,100
 There are so many ghost stories where we just have someone brutally murdered in this house.

443
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,980
 We don't know if that's true, but now there's a ghost of a guy floating around when his

444
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,260
 intestines are hanging out.

445
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,500
 We don't know if the story behind the ghost is actually true.

446
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,860
 This is one of those very rare ones we do know and that makes the story even more interesting

447
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,700
 because now I have a ton of questions about this type of paranormal activity.

448
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,780
 You see movement out of the corners of your eyes.

449
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,780
 You walk into the walk-in freezer and some parts are colder than normal, though light

450
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,180
 shorts out.

451
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,020
 People have also said that that's in the kitchen area in the front of the store, right?

452
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,780
 In the front of the serving area.

453
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:11,300
 Morning crews will come in and stuff will be rearranged in the middle of the night.

454
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,420
 And it's always explained as "Oh, it's just a joke."

455
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,100
 "Oh, that's just good old Vicky, Jason, and Dorothy joking around with us."

456
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,180
 Moving the stuff around, flipping the displays over.

457
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,780
 Those cans aren't supposed to go there.

458
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,180
 They're supposed to go there.

459
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,020
 Oh, you guys.

460
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,020
 You crazy ghosts.

461
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,500
 Well, let's take a look at what caused these possible hauntings, right?

462
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,740
 This is...you can find tons of resources on this location.

463
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,940
 There's news articles around Halloween.

464
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
 They go out to this.

465
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,780
 They'll send out psychics to this area.

466
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,380
 This place gets reported on a lot.

467
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,180
 Let's take a look at why.

468
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,300
 November 15th, 1995.

469
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,820
 The morning crew shows up to get everything cooking.

470
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,660
 It's another day at Cracker Barrel.

471
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,380
 And they got to get there before the customers get really, really hungry.

472
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,540
 They can't get in.

473
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,300
 The morning crew can't get into the restaurant.

474
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,700
 There's supposed to be a previous crew that showed up around 4 or 4.30 in the morning.

475
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,260
 They start prepping everything.

476
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,300
 And then you have the bigger morning crew.

477
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
 That's like the starting crew in the beginning.

478
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
 It's only three people.

479
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,940
 Ricky Smith, Jason Wiggins, and Dorothy Sittle.

480
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,020
 But now that the full morning crew has showed up and they can't get in, they start to get

481
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,100
 a little apprehensive.

482
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,420
 They realize that this is not normal.

483
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,100
 They generally, at least one of these people should be in here.

484
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,580
 All three of them should be in there, really.

485
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,540
 But this has never happened before.

486
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,620
 So after a bit of time passes, they contact the police.

487
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,380
 They go, "Hey, we're afraid something might be wrong in our store.

488
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
 We can't get in."

489
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,940
 When they show up, they enter the restaurant.

490
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,060
 I don't know how they did that.

491
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,460
 I wonder if they got a landlord's key or kicked the window in.

492
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,620
 But anyways, the police do go into the cracker barrel and they begin to see bloody footprints

493
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,380
 leading out of the kitchen.

494
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,660
 So the police follow the bloody footprints.

495
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,380
 They see them leading out of the walk-in freezer.

496
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,020
 And when the police open the walk-in freezer, they see Vicki Smith, 27 years old, Jason

497
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,020
 Wiggins, 18 years old, and Dorothy Sittle, 38 years old.

498
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:28,060
 Their hands have been bound behind their back and their throats have all been slit.

499
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,580
 It actually didn't take long for the police to crack this case.

500
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,900
 That's a 100% true crime story.

501
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,420
 You can find a lot of information about it just from the reports of that night.

502
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,740
 And it didn't take long to catch the people who had did this.

503
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,980
 One of them was a former grill cook named Brandy Jennings.

504
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,620
 He's currently on death row.

505
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:56,820
 And then his juvenile accomplice, Charles Graves, is currently serving life in prison.

506
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,060
 The robbery was the motive.

507
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,140
 I guess they had tried robbing this place two times previous, but it didn't work out.

508
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,380
 And then this night, they were able to get $6,000.

509
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,860
 That's all the money that they got.

510
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,580
 And they had to murder three people to do it.

511
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
 It's interesting.

512
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,300
 I saw a couple people, because again, this story is posted all over the place, not just

513
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,700
 in news articles, but also in the world of the paranormal.

514
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,100
 I saw a couple people refer to the fact that Charles Graves at one point escaped from prison

515
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,660
 and he was caught again.

516
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,820
 I wasn't able to verify that.

517
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
 I actually tried looking for that.

518
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,060
 I'm not saying it didn't happen, but I couldn't prove that it did.

519
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,060
 I couldn't find an article specifically that said that.

520
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,740
 Brandy Jennings is still on death row.

521
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,060
 Just in 2018, he tried to appeal his death sentence and it was denied.

522
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:46,380
 So this is a verifiable true crime story, which gives us some interesting insight into

523
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,500
 the ghostly activity itself.

524
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
 But this is what's so interesting to me.

525
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,380
 Obviously, it's a tragedy, right?

526
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,780
 These three people died for a total of $6,000.

527
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,460
 It wouldn't have mattered if it was $60,000, but it always does seem more tragic, right,

528
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,180
 when it's just for such a small amount of money.

529
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:13,260
 They died brutally tied up throat slit left in a walk-in freezer to bleed out on the floor.

530
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,340
 And their ghosts pull pranks.

531
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,620
 And pretty benign ones at that as well, right?

532
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:25,260
 Rearranging the shelf.

533
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,260
 Making the light flicker.

534
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,540
 I find that so odd.

535
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,700
 It doesn't connect for me, right?

536
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,340
 It doesn't really make sense to me.

537
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:44,940
 If I got my throat slit in a brutal robbery, I'd be the worst ghost employee ever.

538
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,540
 I'm not going to say I'm going to knock hot grease onto my coworkers or anything like

539
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,540
 that, but these ghosts seem fairly lighthearted.

540
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,580
 There's such a weird disconnect between his brutal, brutal killings and the way they're

541
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,380
 interacting around the store.

542
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,820
 This is another interesting ghost story too, because the more I looked into it, I started

543
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,140
 to find people lying about it.

544
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,420
 Or talking about lying about it.

545
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,860
 This is very, very famous haunting in the area.

546
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,780
 HauntedPlaces.org is a place where you can review haunted places and you can leave your

547
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,780
 own little comments about it when you visit it.

548
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
 I love this place.

549
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,380
 On the hauntedplaces.org site, someone left a review.

550
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:32,620
 It was obviously a joke where they said that a painting, a picture in the Cracker Barrel

551
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,620
 winked at her boyfriend, and then they went on to say, and then I went to the gift shop

552
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,820
 and Miss Perry Winkle, she was the perfect cashier, and when I went to say thanks, she

553
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
 faded away.

554
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,820
 She'd been gone for 40 years.

555
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,820
 It's not true.

556
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,320
 It was a joke.

557
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,340
 There was a news article that said, "Sometimes the pictures wink at you."

558
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,940
 So that's 100% not true.

559
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
 That came out of a joke.

560
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,460
 Someone else who actually was talking about this on hauntedplaces.org, an ex-employee

561
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,980
 named Megan Betchell, she said, "Listen, I worked there in 2006.

562
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,740
 I was told this story about this brutal slain, and then later I was sent into the walk-in

563
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,620
 freezer to grab something and the lights went out, and totally freaked me out, and I came

564
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,500
 running out and everyone was outside laughing.

565
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,620
 They had shut the lights off on purpose."

566
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,460
 So you have to wonder, like, how much of this...

567
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,100
 We know the true crime is real, but just in the short amount of research I did on this

568
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:34,700
 place, we have two accounts of fake stories filtering in to the real world, to the lore

569
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
 of this place.

570
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:43,180
 So it's so weird that such violently deceased people would place a harmful trick.

571
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,420
 Now I think if there was just one, right, you could say, "Well, this little girl, she

572
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,340
 died of tuberculosis, and now she likes to ride her tricycle around the house."

573
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:56,300
 Okay, yeah, sure, honey, you do what you do, but if there were a bunch of kids died of

574
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,780
 tuberculosis, this is what I'm saying, I don't think it would be such playfulness.

575
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
 You see what I mean?

576
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,580
 Like, maybe all three of these people were practical jokers.

577
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,760
 If there was just one, and they go, "Yeah, Jason, he always loved pulling a prank."

578
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,260
 So it makes sense that after he was brutally shot in the face 19 times at this cracker

579
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,140
 barrel, his ghost is pulling pranks.

580
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:25,020
 After three people dying in one night, it just seems so minimalistic.

581
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,420
 This haunting seems so basic.

582
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:34,820
 I actually didn't think it was real because of the minor events of the ghost.

583
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,820
 That's nothing.

584
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,700
 Moving stuff around is actually really hard for a ghost.

585
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,060
 I shouldn't have to say it's nothing, but you know what I mean?

586
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,940
 It's so benign.

587
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,260
 And let's take a look at what's happening next door to the cracker barrel.

588
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,700
 This is super interesting.

589
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,420
 Back in 2000, there was a motel built right next to the cracker barrel called the Jamison

590
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,060
 Inn.

591
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,580
 It's still there, but now it's a quality inn hotel.

592
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,660
 It's built right next door.

593
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,940
 This place is super haunted and is super disturbing.

594
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:10,420
 On the one hand, you have room 114, where people say they wake up in the middle of the night

595
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,100
 and there's a man standing in the bedroom.

596
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,420
 There's a man standing in the darkness watching you sleep.

597
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,620
 It's terrifying enough, right?

598
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,580
 Let's go to room 208.

599
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,420
 Multiple people have experienced this.

600
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:35,260
 You wake up in the middle of the night, you're in room 208, and you see a headless woman standing

601
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,220
 in the darkness.

602
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,180
 But not just like she forgot to materialize her head that day.

603
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,900
 People when they describe this headless woman, they go, "Oh no, no, no, she's been freshly

604
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,060
 decapitated.

605
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,060
 Her white nightgown is stained with blood.

606
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,380
 The blood is still dripping from the stump."

607
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:02,620
 And they've also said, "You can see veins poking up out of this very fresh head wound."

608
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,940
 It's not like you just see like a clean cut.

609
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,980
 It's gory.

610
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:13,140
 It's a bloody stump that's continuing to bleed even in the afterlife.

611
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:17,900
 It's terrifying because not only is it creepy, you're waking up in the middle of the night,

612
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,340
 you're seeing this headless woman, but when you see a ghost with such a grievous wound

613
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,220
 still in the afterlife, it does make you think, "Well, I hope I don't blow up.

614
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,100
 I hope I don't get split in two."

615
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,820
 So now there's two, like my legs are a ghost, then my torso is a ghost, and I'm floating

616
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,820
 around.

617
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,980
 It really makes you, I think ghosts like that make you more terrified of how you die.

618
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
 Right?

619
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,580
 And like a certain way, isn't that creepier?

620
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,540
 Is you want to die in a way that your body's all in one piece.

621
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,980
 You're currently falling into a meat grinder right now.

622
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
 You're like, "Oh, nuts."

623
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
 Terrifying.

624
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,260
 Now, I'm not saying I want a bunch of Cracker Bear workers walking around with blood shooting

625
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,460
 out of their necks, terrifying the employees.

626
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,060
 I just don't understand why the activity is so different.

627
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,500
 And those aren't the only two ghosts at the quality end.

628
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,740
 They said that these were the reports that they were getting repeatedly, but they're

629
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,700
 like, "There's a ton of ghosts at this hotel."

630
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,340
 So again, it's an interesting question.

631
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,840
 Why is the hotel right next to it so haunted?

632
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,500
 And the place where the brutal slayings took place are, I mean, haunted's haunted, right?

633
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,260
 But they're barely haunted.

634
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,500
 I wouldn't have told this story, I would have not told the story of the Cracker Barrel unless

635
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,020
 I was able to verify the crime.

636
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,420
 I actually found the story originally on theshadowlands.net and it briefly mentioned the crime and I

637
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,660
 go, "Oh, if I can find that crime, I'll talk about it."

638
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,100
 I would not have talked about this Cracker Barrel story had it just been such a small

639
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,380
 amount of ghostly activity.

640
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,500
 That's pretty common.

641
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,220
 I mean, hauntings are rare, but in the world of hauntings, stuff moving out of the corner

642
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,020
 of your eye, lights flicking, cold spots, super common, right?

643
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
 Dime a dozen.

644
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,180
 Stuff moving around that's a little more rare.

645
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,540
 The reason why I wanted to talk about it was because what caused these ghosts is so

646
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
 insane.

647
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,020
 It's such a violent crime.

648
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,860
 And it's such a simple haunting.

649
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,220
 I don't know how to connect those two things.

650
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,460
 And then right next door, we have a woman with no head, blood squirting out of her open

651
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,340
 wound all over her dress.

652
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,740
 It's terrifying.

653
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,940
 I'm wondering if there's something in the area that's causing all of these ghosts to

654
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,100
 be here, because before the year 2000, there was no hotel there.

655
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,020
 It was built as this Jamison Inn apparently.

656
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,460
 That's what I read in the reports.

657
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,620
 So what in the world is going on?

658
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,500
 What in the world is going on in Naples, Florida?

659
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,860
 You'd be surprised how many ghost stories there are in this area.

660
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,700
 I don't know what's causing it.

661
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
 Brutal murder.

662
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,260
 Tribal murder.

663
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,100
 Left to gurgle on your own blood in the back of a walk-in freezer.

664
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,940
 Three benign ghosts.

665
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,620
 And then you go 50 feet to the left, or to the right, I don't know exactly what side

666
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,820
 it's on, but...

667
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:13,300
 And then you have a bloody stump woman squirting blood all over you.

668
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,300
 You don't even know her name.

669
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,660
 We don't even know where that ghost came from.

670
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,660
 Absolutely terrifying.

671
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,660
 Absolutely bizarre.

672
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,420
 It's one of the reasons why I live looking into this stuff, because at the end of the

673
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,880
 day, no matter how long you look into this stuff, I've been researching this stuff since

674
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
 I was 12.

675
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,740
 I've been looking into this stuff for 34 years at this point.

676
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,460
 I swear, once a week, I'm like, "I've never seen anything like this.

677
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,020
 This is the weirdest thing."

678
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,660
 And this one, it's not the ghost that's weird.

679
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,740
 It's not the crime that's weird.

680
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
 It's that...

681
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,300
 Why are they just so playful?

682
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
 I would hope...

683
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,420
 I would hope if I was a ghost, I'd be a playful ghost.

684
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,060
 But I also hope when I die, I'm brutally slaughtered.

685
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
 Absolutely fascinating.

686
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
 And again, we have...

687
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,380
 Because the ghost is...

688
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,820
 The ghost activity is so benign, we do have to ask ourselves, "Is it fake?"

689
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,320
 "Was it employees pulling tricks on other employees?"

690
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,880
 And then it spiraled out and became this "legitimate ghost story."

691
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,840
 That very well may be.

692
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:17,960
 But even if that's true, that doesn't even start to explain the terror that awaits you

693
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,760
 if you stay at the hotel next to the Cracker Barrel.

694
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,560
 Why is this area so infused with energy?

695
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,200
 Who knows.

696
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,020
 But fascinating stories nonetheless.

697
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:36,340
