1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 A spell that was written 400 years before the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 And is it possible that someone could love euthanasia so much

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,500
 that they asked the government to pay them for the privilege of killing the disabled today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 Hope you're having a great day too. Hope you're having lots of fun.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,000
 You know, I read a lot of zombie stuff. I watch a lot of zombie movies.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 There's one story that I've always kind of feel that's left out of the zombie mythology.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 They have a group of survivors in a house.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,500
 They've survived the initial 24 to 72 hour onslaught of the zombie attack.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 They're running low on supplies.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 And they're sitting there. There's maybe about five of them.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 They know each other fairly well.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 Their supplies are running low.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 And they're sitting there and they're thinking, "We need to go out.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 We need to go out into this horde because we can't last much longer."

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 And so they begin to draw plans.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 They pack up their gear, whatever weapons they have available,

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 because across town they know there is a pharmacy full of Xanax, Vicodin, Oxycodone, everything that they need.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 What happens to drug addicts during the zombie apocalypse?

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 That story's never been fully explored.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 We had a touch of it in The Walking Dead, which I still watch. I still like that show.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
 I know a lot of people have given up on it.

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 There was this young man who was like a lone.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
 He was an alcoholic. He ended up joining the group.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 And he actually ended up getting a member of Rick Squad killed trying to get alcohol.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 And it was exposed that he was an alcoholic.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,500
 And then they had a little hint of it in World War Z, where -- love it or hate that movie --

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 I think the first two-thirds of World War Z are fairly competent up until the plane crash.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 The movie's actually -- it's not as good as the book, but it's a well-done big-budget zombie movie.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 And the first two-thirds of it, I thought, were solid.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 It had its flaws, but the first two-thirds of it was good.

33
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 The last third of it was garbage.

34
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 But they had a scene in that one where Brad Pitt goes to get an asma inhaler for his daughter.

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
 And there's one of the flaws in the first part of the movie. It was stupid.

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 But anyways, he goes to get an asma inhaler for his daughter.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 And there's a junkie in the pharmacy that he has to talk down to get.

38
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 So, because that guy went there specifically for the drugs.

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 What happens to people who are drug addicts or alcoholics during a zombie infestation?

40
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,500
 We're not going to run into them as we're trying to get food and water or get out of the city or to fortify our buildings.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 What people will be running into people whose sole goal at that moment is to get more drugs.

42
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 And that would be -- that's an interesting -- they'll have to get food as well, but that won't be their main priority.

43
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 You also, I think, would be an interesting story is people who need drugs.

44
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 Not something like an asma inhaler or insulin, but imagine a zombie story with a character who is on psychiatric medicine

45
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,500
 and you prevent them from having delusions or hallucinations or the voices in their head or whatever it is.

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 Like a severe case of mental illness.

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
 And a zombie attack happens and they don't have that medication.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 So, they're not only fighting the zombies, but they're fighting the insanity in themselves

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 as it slowly begins to creep out as they're on their way to try to locate some more of this fairly rare medicine.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 Interesting. I think a lot of the zombie stories have been done to death.

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 My least favorite zombie story is five years after the zombie attack.

52
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 We're rebuilding. A lot of low-budget zombie movies do that because they don't have to have large crowd scenes.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 I think zombie movies can be done without large crowd scenes.

54
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 One last thing before we get started. I actually saw a movie the other day.

55
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,500
 You can kind of consider this a Dead Rabbit Recommends, but I saw a movie the other day called Raccoon Valley.

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 It was a zombie movie about a deaf girl -- deaf woman -- ah, deaf girl, whatever --

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 about this deaf girl trying to navigate the world of zombies.

58
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 The whole movie, it's her. There's no dialogue. There's a little bit of news reports.

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 And then there's maybe only two or three zombies in it.

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 And you're watching the movie. It's beautifully shot. It looks like a dream. It's just amazing.

61
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,500
 And at the ending, it's kind of more, I think, aimed at art students.

62
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 It's only an hour or like film students. It's only an hour long.

63
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 And it's not super weird. When I say film students, it's because you watch this whole movie.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 It's beautifully shot. And the whole movie costs $175. Not to watch, but to make.

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 I'm assuming that doesn't -- I'm assuming the actress must have known the director,

66
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 but the director edited it and wrote it, did all the VX, all the special effects for it.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 And the ending credits shows how much of the movie was special effects that she didn't realize.

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 Like, streets were just all special effects.

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 She was just walking by like this corner, and they put in this whole lane and made it look forested.

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 The whole movie costs $175. The director of Raccoon Valley was a man named Turner Clay.

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 I've actually seen -- he's done three zombie movies now. They get progressively better.

72
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 He did Disaster LA or Emergency LA or something like that. That was okay.

73
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 Then he did State of Emergency, which I actually -- I used to have a movie review website.

74
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
 I'll post the link below, but I really enjoyed State of Emergency.

75
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 It was a great little zombie movie.

76
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 The zombies were very, very creepy and fast, and they could open doors.

77
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 I tell people, "Have you ever been so sick you haven't been able to open the door?"

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,500
 Like, zombies will be able to open the doors unless they're truly like, come back from the dead.

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 If they're rage induced, they'll be able to open doors.

80
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 And then Raccoon Valley is his latest movie, and they've just gotten progressively better.

81
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 So hats off to Turner Clay.

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 If you're looking for interesting takes on the zombie genre, I definitely recommend State of Emergency and Raccoon Valley.

83
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

84
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,500
 Now, this first story is interesting because there's nothing -- I can't really find anything on it.

85
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 And I know you're thinking, "Oh, great. It's another one of those, Jason.

86
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 It's another one where you say, "I can't find anything on it," because alien blobs are re-raising the Internet.

87
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
 And that's not where I'm going with this.

88
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 I think it's something that there is a particular group of people who are very, very interested in this,

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 and they don't know about it.

90
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 There are resources on this, but they're not very robust.

91
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 And what we're going to talk about is this thing called the Ephesian Gramata, or the Ephesian letters.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 So we're going back to 4th or 5th century BC.

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
 So we're way back in time at this point.

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 People are walking around with, like, sandals.

95
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 And I imagine the sun was a lot hotter in the past.

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
 I don't know why. I always think that.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 I always assume, like, the Romans are like, "Oh, my God, it's so hot."

98
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 And nowadays you would, like, just be, like, walking around in a sweater in Italy.

99
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 I don't know. I assume everything was hotter in the past, and it's just gotten progressively more temperate.

100
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 But anyway, so Romans are walking around, they're sweating.

101
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 They're, like, all wet, just dripping wet everywhere.

102
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 They got their vaginas that put their swords in. That's a callback joke.

103
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 The...on a statue of Artemis, they found these six words.

104
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 And these are the words here.

105
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 Ascheon, Catauscheon, Lix, Tetrax, Damananius, Asaya.

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 Apparently, that's a spell. It's a protection spell.

107
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 And if you... and here's the thing, nobody really knows what it is.

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 It's these six letters. They found those six words. They found those six words on, like, belts and amulets and things like that.

109
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 And that's why historians have thought it's probably some sort of protection spell.

110
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 And people have said, again, people, nobody's really saying, "I said this or I said this,"

111
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 but the general theory is that if you pronounce it correctly, it's a powerful protection spell.

112
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 That's it. That's all the information we have, really, on this.

113
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 And you're thinking, "Wait, Jason, you're gonna keep talking about this for more than two minutes?"

114
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 Let's break it down for a second.

115
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 So, you're a historian, you find this statue of Artemis and in Ephesus.

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 Ephesus, I'm sure I mispronounced that, but I'm sure I mispronounced everything, the spell and everything.

117
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 But you find it there, and people have spent a ton of time trying to figure out if the words are related,

118
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 if they mean something else. People have had different theories as to, like, some people have said it means, like,

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 "Shadow, shadowy, earth, moon, sun," or whatever.

120
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 Other people have said it refers to six particular deities that you're calling upon for protection, but nobody knows.

121
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

122
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:00,500
 Now, this first story is interesting because there's nothing... I can't really find anything on it.

123
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 And I know you're thinking, "Oh, great, it's another one of those, Jason."

124
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 It's another one where you say, "I can't find anything on it because alien blobs are re-raising the Internet."

125
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 That's not where I'm going with this. I think it's something that there is a particular group of people who are very, very interested in this,

126
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,500
 and they don't know about it. There are resources on this, but they're not very robust.

127
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 And what we're going to talk about is this thing called the Ephesian Gramata, or the Ephesian letters.

128
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 So we're going back to 4th or 5th century BC. So we're way back in time at this point.

129
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 People are walking around with sandals, and I imagine the sun was a lot hotter in the past.

130
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 I don't know why. I always think that I always assume the Romans are like, "Oh my God, it's so hot."

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 And nowadays you would just be walking around in a sweater in Italy.

132
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 I don't know. I assume everything was hotter in the past, and it's just gotten progressively more temperate.

133
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 But anyway, so Romans are walking around, they're sweating. They're all wet, just dripping wet everywhere.

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 They got their vaginas that put their swords in. That's called back joke.

135
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 On a statue of Artemis, they found these six words.

136
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 And these are the words here. Ascheon, Catauscheon, Lix, Tetrax, Damananius, Asaya.

137
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 Apparently, that's a spell. It's a protection spell.

138
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 And here's the thing. Nobody really knows what it is.

139
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 It's these six letters. They found those six words. They found those six words on belts and amulets and things like that.

140
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 And that's why historians have thought it's probably some sort of protection spell.

141
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 And people have said, again, people, nobody's really saying I said this or I said this,

142
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 but the general theory is that if you pronounce it correctly, it's a powerful protection spell.

143
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 That's it. That's all the information we have, really, on this.

144
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 And you're thinking, wait, Jason, you're going to keep talking about this for more than two minutes.

145
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 And so generally, the way I prep stories on this show is I will find a particular subject that I'm like, that makes a good episode.

146
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 I'll grab a couple of resources, throw them in a text file. I'll look over it and make sure that it will be interesting.

147
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 Throw it in a text file, drop it in a folder. And then as I'm getting closer to prepping the episode, I'll grab that text file.

148
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 I'm glad I'm telling you all this because now a hacker will just get in my computer and delete all my research.

149
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 I actually only prep like a week ahead. It wouldn't be that big of a thing.

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 But as I get closer to doing the episode, I'll pull the websites back up and then look at it for an additional like five or six or whatever.

151
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
 So I'll usually start off with two or three and then I'll find more resources.

152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 When I was doing that to prep this episode, everything was just kind of the same, the same thing. We don't know what this is.

153
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 We think it's a spell, a spell that existed 400 years before the birth of Christ.

154
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 So I mean, if you want to talk about like ancient magic, this is it.

155
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
 I mean, outside of stuff in the Old Testament, which really isn't spells.

156
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 I mean, you know what I mean? Like there's, there's claims of magic in the Old Testament like Moses throwing his staff and it turned in with Snake.

157
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 What's interesting about that story is that in Christian, in Christianity, there's this whole thing like, you know, black magic is bad and it doesn't work and everything comes from the divine.

158
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 I'm but I'm bastardizing it really. But you know what I mean? Like generally, like all strength comes from God.

159
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:33,500
 But in that story in the Old Testament, the Egyptian pharaohs, visors, they threw whatever you called them, his magicians, they threw their staffs down and they turned into snakes.

160
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 And then Moses throws his staff down, turns into a snake and eats the other snakes.

161
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 Now, if you take that story by face value, those, the Egyptian pharaoh had like warlocks working for him in the Bible.

162
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 They, it wasn't like Moses goes, ha, that's fake. I saw him come out of your sleeve and your stick, you'd like kicked it underneath Pharaoh's chair and he was fake.

163
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,500
 But here watch God makes me make a real snake. That's not what happened.

164
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 He throws his staff and it there's a bunch of there's like four snakes rolling around on the floor and everyone in Egypt, nobody blinks.

165
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 They're like, it's a Tuesday. It's snake day. That's so bizarre.

166
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 So does that mean that the pharaoh actually had, if you take that, if you take the story of face value, Christian or not, especially if you're Christian, then you would say, whoa, there were like wizards walking around back then.

167
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 What other magical stuff was happening? Because generally stuff in the Bible, like the, the mystical stuff is from God, the burning bush, the chariot of fire, all that stuff is like divine.

168
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 But this is like dudes throwing sticks and turning them into snakes. Fascinating, fascinating stuff.

169
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 So I guess there were wizards back then and Moses, Moses was like saying, my God's more powerful than your God, but he didn't like call him out and say, that's fake.

170
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,500
 You totally faked that. No, he's like, oh, I better make a bigger snake to eat their snakes.

171
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 And then what happened to his snake? Now that I think about it, did it turn back in with staff? Like was that snake sentient?

172
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 What happened to that snake? Did it slow their way and did he buy a new staff? What happened with staff? Where's his staff at now?

173
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 Anyways, totally getting off topic. Maybe that should be its own story.

174
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 Ephesian Grammata. These words are so ancient. Nobody knows what they are. Nobody knows what they mean.

175
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 I'm researching it. There's a book that explains it. I read a review on the book. It's 115 pages.

176
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 And the guy's like, yeah, this guy really has some interesting ideas. You know, he goes, some people take a very literal approach.

177
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 And this author had some really interesting ideas and that was the review. I was like, oh, okay. Go to look at the book. It's 100 bucks.

178
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,500
 It's 100 bucks for this 115 page book. It's totally out of print. Go on eBay. There's no copies available. Check that out.

179
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 There's a couple book sites, no sites available. It could be somewhere on the internet and I'll keep kind of looking around because I'm definitely intrigued.

180
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 This is the interesting thing about spells like this is that if you believe in things like if you believe in any sort of magic or metaphysical or stuff like that,

181
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 you could say that the words are magical or you could say that the sound is magical. The vibration is magical.

182
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:14,500
 Because I was looking at this YouTube video and this woman was like, oh, it doesn't matter how you say these things. She didn't even, she mentioned the aphesia of her matter, but she didn't go.

183
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 She was just talking about spells in foreign languages. She goes, you can translate it to English. You translate it to your language and it'll still have the same effect.

184
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 And I don't think that's true. I think it would have, if you accept that spells are real, I think you have to say that the sounds themselves are what make them powerful,

185
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 not necessarily the intent for something this old that maybe the very like vocal frequency of saying these six words in combination affects the area around you and protects you.

186
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,500
 It could just be gibberish. It could just be something that put on the bottom of the statue and then a bunch of other people put it on pouches and belts and things like that.

187
00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 Could be an ancient spell that is so powerful that people don't want other people to know about it. Or it could just be a, I don't know, I guess the regular spell is kind of an oxymoron, but it could just be a spell that nobody's really examined.

188
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 But again, it's so weird that people who are like totally into like paganism and magic and stuff like that, I thought I was going to find a ton of resources on this and like blogs and pronunciation videos on YouTube, nothing, nothing.

189
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 Which makes me think not that it's necessarily being suppressed. It just makes me, it just reminds me that the world of the weird is so vast that incredibly interesting things get brushed under the rug.

190
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 People always ask me, hey, how long do you think the show will last? Do you think there's enough stuff for the show to go on for a couple of years? I go, oh yeah, absolutely.

191
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 I'm discovering new stuff all the time, new weird stories all the time.

192
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 The next story we're going to look at is about euthanasia. So there was a guy named Satoshi Umimatsu. This is in Japan.

193
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 Now he believed he used to work at a facility that dealt with people who were physically and mentally disabled.

194
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 He worked there for a while and he just saw these people going through, some of them couldn't communicate, some of them couldn't move.

195
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 Just heartbreaking. Some of them were born with disabilities, some of them became disabled. This facility treated people from like 18 to 70.

196
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 It was just like kind of an all-purpose facility in Japan. And it was just eating at him that these people were trapped in this physical hell, in this mental hell they were disabled, especially the ones who couldn't communicate.

197
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 So he wrote a letter and went to hand deliver it. 2016 is when this takes place either. This isn't like a long time ago. 2016 is when this takes place.

198
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 So he writes this letter and he hand delivers it to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan.

199
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 So basically it would be like, who's our guy right now? It's not Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer. They're like the minority leaders.

200
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 It's, um, Vayner's gone now. It's not like I don't read the newspaper every day. It's a Republican. I don't remember what his name was.

201
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 But anyways, McConnell? Anyway, so imagine that he, I mean, it's that level of a politician. It's a national politician.

202
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 The guy's name is Tadori, sorry, Tadamori Oshima. And you guys are already like crap. He's doing a Japanese episode.

203
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 He's not going to be able to pronounce any of these names. Don't worry. It gets easier.

204
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 So Satoshi writes this letter and he goes to hand deliver it to Tadamori Oshima, the House Speaker. And the guards won't let him through.

205
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 He comes back a couple of days later and he gives it to a passing police officer and says, hey, can you give this letter? It's very, very important.

206
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 Police officer goes, yeah, sure. So this is what the letter says. Thank you so much for reading this letter.

207
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:55,500
 I can wipe out a total of 470 disabled individuals. Let me remind you, this guy, he's 26 years old, Satoshi, wrote that in a letter to give to a national politician.

208
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 I will start over. Thank you very much for reading this letter. I can wipe out a total of 470 disabled individuals.

209
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:18,500
 I'm fully aware that my remark is eccentric. However, thinking about the tired faces of guardians, the dull eyes of caregivers working in the facility, I am not able to contain myself.

210
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 And so I decided to take action today for the sake of Japan and the world. My reasoning is that I may be able to revitalize the world economy and I thought it may be possible to prevent World War III.

211
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 Invisional world, where a person with multiple disabilities can be euthanized with an agreement from the guardians when it is difficult for the person to carry out household or social activities.

212
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 I believe there is still no answer about the way of life for individuals with multiple disabilities. The disabled can only create misery.

213
00:19:51,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 I think now is the time to carry out a revolution and to make the inevitable but tough decision for the sake of all mankind. Let Japan take the first big step.

214
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 Would Mr. Tadamori Oshima, who bears the world, use his power to make the world proceed in a better direction?

215
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 I sincerely hope you would deliver this message to Mr. Shinzo Abe. This is the answer I reached after serious thinking about what I can do for humankind.

216
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:29,500
 Dear Lower House Speaker Tadamori Oshima, would you lend your power for the sake of dear Japan and all humankind? Please give this full consideration.

217
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 Satoshi Umamatsu.

218
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 Jason, why are you interrupting me? You didn't let me finish. That was the same part of the letter.

219
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:51,500
 What I just read to you was actually the part of the letter that I could see any politician getting from a weirdo, other than the first line about it wiping out 470 people.

220
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 That's the part where you read the letter and you're like, "That's kind of weird." But that is the normal part of the letter.

221
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Don't interrupt me. Here's the rest. The plot. Now he's going to go over his plot. Now again, he handed this to a cop in front of a politician's house. The plot.

222
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 It will be carried out during the night shift when staffing is low. The target will be two facilities where many multiply disabled people reside.

223
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 I'm not a bad programmer, but staff on guard will be strapped with cables so they can't move and can't make contact with anyone outside. Again, gave this to a cop.

224
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:42,500
 The act will be carried out speedily and definitely without harming the staff. After wiping out the 260 people in two facilities, I will turn myself in.

225
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 And carrying out the act, I have several requests. After my arrest, my incarceration should be up to two years and please let me lead a free life afterward.

226
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 Innocence on grounds of insanity, a new name, Takashi Iguro, government registration, and documents such as a driver's license needed for everyday life.

227
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 A disguise for regular society through plastic surgery. Financial aid of 500 million yen, which is 5 million US dollars. I would like these conditions to be promised.

228
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 If you can make your decision, I will carry it out at any time. Please consider this fully for the sake of Japan and world peace. I hope with all my heart this can be discussed with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

229
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 Although I am sorry to trouble him in an unimaginably busy schedule.

230
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 So he writes that letter, tries to hand deliver it to the politician, doesn't, he can't get past the guards, comes back a couple days later, gives it to a police officer.

231
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:54,500
 Then I probably read it at the time, but eventually it does get to, I believe, the politician, but also the police are involved right now and they're like, okay, so this guy wrote a letter where he said he wanted to kill a bunch of disabled people.

232
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 He knows when he wants to do it, the facilities he wants to do it at, and then thinks we should pay him 5 million dollars for the pleasure of him murdering all of our disabled people.

233
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 So the police do what police often do, they arrest him because he's a lunatic. They have him involuntarily put in a psychiatric ward and he is there for a couple days, maybe a week or two, and they said, he's no trouble.

234
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 He has no threat to society. He's a crazy person. Wrang a crazy letter.

235
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 On July 26, 2016, so you know where this is headed, Satoshi Umamatsu at two in the morning, goes to the care facility he used to work at, climbs through a window, ties up the staff like he said he was going to do, took out a knife, and went room to room, stabbing people in the neck.

236
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 Walk into the room where there was a severely disabled person, couldn't communicate, couldn't move, stab him in the neck.

237
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 19 people were killed. 26 were injured, and out of those 26, 13 were severely injured. So I mean, you're probably even more disabled after the fact, and he leaves.

238
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 He gets away. The cops get a call at 2.30, so 20 minutes after he broke into the facility, the cops get called.

239
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 The cops don't show up until 3 in the morning, and it has been called the one of the worst crimes committed on Japanese soil and modern history.

240
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 It was just mass murder with the knives. And he felt that, like he said in the letter, that they were a drain on society that they caused misery, not only their own misery, but the misery of other people.

241
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 Other people had to care for him, so by killing them, he was actually doing everyone a favor.

242
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:54,500
 The cops are looking for the dude, and then he just walks into the police station with a bag full of knives, and a bunch of blood, and goes, "I'm turning myself in."

243
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 It was part of his plan, actually, was that he was going to do it, and he was going to turn himself in. And it's interesting, because I think he really saw himself as a hero.

244
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:14,500
 He still thinks of himself as a hero, actually. He does say that it's weird. It's so weird. His defense in the trial, he hasn't been sentenced or anything like that. This is still an ongoing thing.

245
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 He said that in his trial, he's going to claim they weren't human anymore. So he didn't really kill anybody. They're just not human. Brutal, man. That is some brutal delusion.

246
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 And it sucks because the law enforcement acted the way that they needed to act originally, where they arrested the guy.

247
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 But then you throw him in the medical facility, and you start interacting with people who may be a little more, a little more of a bleeding heart.

248
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 And they're like, "Oh, no, he's just a young kid. He's just misunderstood. He's no threat." And they let him go. And then he does this. 19 people killed.

249
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 But, yeah, I mean, the horror of being in bed, and you're physically disabled, and a guy is coming from room to room, stabbing people in the neck.

250
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:07,500
 And you hear people in the rooms down the hall, and the guy's getting closer. And you're calling up for help, and the staff's tied up, and eventually your door opens, and you're paralyzed. You can't do anything.

251
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 That's horror. That's terrifying. That's nightmare of fuel. So hopefully this guy, they're talking about the death penalty may be on the table, life in prison, whatever.

252
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 He's definitely not getting two years of new driver's license and 500 million yen. That's not happening. But, yeah, crazy.

253
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,500
 Crazy stuff. It's good that he turned himself in. He was planning on hitting another facility, and he was like, "Nah, I'm good."

254
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 Crazy creepy world out there, guys. Crazy creepy world. You never know what lunatics gonna kick down your bedroom door, and want to cleanse you from the earth, for whatever bizarre, sick reason.

255
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:51,500
