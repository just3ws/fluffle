1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 Just when you thought babies weren't the creepiest thing ever, another story to remind us that

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,360
 they are.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,840
 They're so weird, kids are creepy.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,820
 And then we traveled to Arizona to take a look at a man who enjoys spending his days

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
 and nights hiking through the desert.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,960
 But on one of these hiking expeditions he discovers something that he was never meant

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,520
 to see and now they're after him.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:43,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,600
 I'm your host Jason Garvenor, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
 Hope you guys have some cool plans for the weekend.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,880
 I don't know what I'm doing honestly.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,080
 No idea what I'm doing this weekend but I hope it is cool whatever I decide to do.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,760
 Probably be a 72 hour nap.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,040
 But someone who always has something awesome to do walking into Dead Rabbit Command is

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,000
 one of our legacy Patreon supporters, longtime supporter of the show, active member of the

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,720
 Patreon Discord and always on the live streams as well.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,080
 Everyone give it up for Rudy Jazz.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,600
 Woohoo, yeah, walk on in.

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 Yay!

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,360
 Hey guys, jumping on into Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,000
 Rudy, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
 Patreon, I totally get it, I do.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,760
 Just helps spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 That helps out so so much.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,160
 Rudy, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,040
 Drive us all the way out to a daycare center.

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,560
 Place leisurely drive to this daycare center.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,920
 We don't have a specific location for this because if they ever give out the location

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,880
 to this place no one would ever let their kids go there ever again.

33
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,480
 Well, you know, it's interesting that I say that because I guess it would depend whether

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,760
 or not you believe in this phenomenon.

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,440
 I'm sure like, there's so many bad daycares out there.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,920
 You're constantly reading about the news.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,720
 I think at a certain point you're just like, I'm going to have my baby strapped to my back

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,160
 until they're 18 because there's just too many horrible things that can happen and then

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,720
 you're mountain climbing, you're like, oh, this is okay.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,040
 And then you fall directly on your offspring.

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,480
 I guess basically the moral of the story is kids are always going to get injured or have

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,880
 creepy occurrences happen to them.

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,840
 Let's take a look at this story because this is a weird one.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
 And think about it.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,640
 Would you think about it from two points of view?

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,760
 Then if you heard that this was happening at your kid's daycare center, would you let

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,080
 your kid go back there?

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,960
 You're like, I at least want to discount.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
 At least want, I don't know, 40% off.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
 You got to give me a discount here, guys.

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,160
 Would you let your kid go there?

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:05,240
 And then also, because it's Friday, imagine that you yourself are the baby or the kid

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
 or whatever.

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
 I don't know.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,720
 All of a sudden, look who's talking three.

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 Let's go ahead and get into this.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 There's this little baby guy walking around the cigar.

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
 Let's go ahead and get into this.

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,600
 Just imagine yourself as a baby and a, never mind.

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 Just listen to the story.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
 Just listen to the story.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 You're all watching the dishes.

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 You're like, what?

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 This is way too much.

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,760
 This is way too much right now.

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,840
 I'm actually doing real life chores.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,160
 We're in this daycare center.

68
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,280
 We're going to go ahead and call the person who posted it didn't use the real name.

69
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,720
 We're going to go ahead and call her Elizabeth.

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,560
 She works at the daycare center with toddlers.

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
 I had to look this up.

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,160
 A toddler is not a baby per se.

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,200
 It's like one to three years old.

74
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,560
 All of the characters in this saga are one to three years old, except the daycare workers,

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 of course.

76
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,640
 They're adults, but toddlers.

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,960
 That's the time span.

78
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,320
 Not like tiny little baby people, but tiny people who still need their diapers changed.

79
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,880
 At this daycare center, a little baby walking around and they pooped in his diaper.

80
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,880
 And then the daycare workers, I'm sure, do a very, very intense game of rock, paper,

81
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,200
 scissors to decide who has to clean out that baby's diaper.

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,160
 And you go, you put the baby on the changing table, change the diaper.

83
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,840
 The baby's just kind of, it's not baby.

84
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
 It's a toddler.

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,560
 So toddlers sitting there thinking about Scooby-Doo and stuff while their diapers getting changed.

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,360
 Standard toddler stuff.

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,920
 But Elizabeth said at this daycare center, there was one particular girl.

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,340
 We'll call her Patty.

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,440
 There's one particular little baby, baby Patty.

90
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,960
 She goes, one day we picked Patty up.

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,120
 She pooped her pants or peed.

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,360
 She wasn't specific on the bodily function, but she takes the baby, takes baby Patty to

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,080
 the changing table.

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,000
 They have this changing station set up and they put baby Patty down.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,360
 And all of a sudden Patty starts going, no, no, no, no.

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,760
 And she's like, swatting away using her little legs and like crotty chop and doon baby crotty

97
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 chops on Elizabeth.

98
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,960
 And Elizabeth is like, we need to change your diaper, honey.

99
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
 Let's just change your diaper.

100
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,320
 No, no, the man is watching.

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
 The man is watching.

102
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,040
 I don't know why she sounds like Edith Bunker from all in the family.

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,320
 But she's the man.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,880
 The man is watching.

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
 No, no.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,560
 And Patty would point up at the ceiling.

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,600
 Now you understand that there's no man in the ceiling as adults.

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,040
 We understand that there's not a man in the ceiling.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,320
 But you would look.

110
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,640
 If you were walking on the street and someone goes, dude, there's a T-Rex right behind you.

111
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
 And they ran away.

112
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,120
 You wouldn't be like, I'm not going to matter what happens.

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm not going to turn around.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,560
 Even though you know that there's not a T-Rex behind you, you would look.

115
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,680
 You would turn around and double check.

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,560
 And now if the guy goes, there's T-Rex behind you.

117
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
 Look, look, look.

118
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
 And he's not running.

119
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,440
 Now he's just going to steal my wallet or something like that.

120
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,480
 But if he's like, if I'm the brown shaking, I hear the roar behind me and I'm like, sorry,

121
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,000
 you're not going to get my wallet as he's already like a block away from me.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 If someone goes, look, look.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,840
 Okay, maybe T-Rex was a bad example because that would cause like seismic disturbance.

124
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,840
 You'd hear police sirens and military helicopters all around.

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,000
 If someone came out of your bathroom was like, dude, I don't know how to say this, but there's

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,280
 a man in your shower and you live all alone.

127
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
 And you're like, what?

128
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
 Oh my God.

129
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,840
 You're like, can't we dance over right now?

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,480
 And he likes to take showers when people go to the bathroom.

131
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,160
 If someone said, you came out of the back and you made up these hypotheticals and then

132
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,160
 I wonder why my episodes are so long.

133
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
 Basically you would look.

134
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 And that's what Elizabeth did.

135
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,720
 And little toddler's going, there's a man watching a man.

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,640
 And Elizabeth would look up and it's just a tile, like a ceiling, just a ceiling with

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,280
 those tiles.

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,360
 And she goes, here's the thing.

139
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,400
 There would be times because it doesn't sound like the most well constructed daycare center.

140
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,840
 I mean, the one thing you want to, well, two things you want at a daycare center is competent

141
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,400
 workers and a building that won't collapse at any given moment.

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,000
 But apparently she says, if you open the back door, if you open and close the back door,

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,040
 it causes a gust of wind to move through the building, which is fine, right?

144
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,960
 You, if you slam a door, you can feel the wind, but it moves the ceiling tiles.

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,400
 There's so much force of air coming in that sometimes the ceiling tiles move, right?

146
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,480
 So sometimes there would be gaps up there.

147
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
 You know, they'd fix them.

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,480
 They'd get the broom and kind of knock them around your back.

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:59,040
 Sometimes there would be gaps up there, but something that's never up there is a man.

150
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,800
 It's not a man watching, but of course you would, I just out of, I don't even know if

151
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,280
 it's curiosity, just someone points at something for the most part you're going to look and

152
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,200
 a little kid going, there's a man watching and you'd look up and there'd be no man up

153
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 there.

154
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,080
 But Patty refused to let her diaper get taken off on the changing station.

155
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
 She refused.

156
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
 She put up such a huge fight, she'd be kicking and screaming the whole time.

157
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,240
 And then once they got her changed, cause they would still do it, you know, you, you

158
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,960
 little baby's kicking you, you can still go on a diaper.

159
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,640
 They'd let Patty go after the diaper changed and she'd just go about her business walking

160
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
 around the daycare center.

161
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,320
 But then when Patty pooped her feet again, it's, oh man, are you kidding me?

162
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 What are you doing with this screaming infant?

163
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,400
 I think it took them a while to realize.

164
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,600
 I think the first time she did it, that was weird.

165
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,000
 But by time 10, she's done this so many times, they're like, dude, if we pick her up and

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,920
 put her on the changing station, she's going to scream and cry and fuss.

167
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,640
 So eventually, every time, every single time they put her on that changing station, there's

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,080
 a man, there's a man up there, he's watching us.

169
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,200
 So eventually they just say, you know what, let's just change Patty on the floor.

170
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,040
 Don't tell her parents.

171
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,000
 Don't tell her parents that we're going to be, the kids are building forts around her,

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
 they're all trying to change the diaper.

173
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,840
 The kids are like, wee, jumping on her and stuff like that.

174
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,720
 They're like, she's not trampolating, she's laying on the ground.

175
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,800
 It doesn't make her a toy.

176
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,120
 But they change her on the floor.

177
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,040
 The parents, when Patty gets home, the parents are like, that's, why is there a penny in

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
 my daughter's diaper?

179
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
 She's just picking up all that debris.

180
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,360
 She's like straight up dirty because that back door keeps throwing dirt around whenever

181
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
 you open and close it.

182
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,080
 Anyways, Patty was totally fine with being changed on the floor.

183
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,960
 She thought it was great.

184
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,440
 She no longer screamed about a man watching her.

185
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
 Kids are weird, right?

186
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
 Kids are super weird.

187
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,200
 Kids are going to say all sorts of goofy things.

188
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,280
 You just deal with it.

189
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
 You just deal with it.

190
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:14,640
 A year later, that daycare has moved on like those kids have gone to preschool at this point.

191
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,760
 So she was probably like a three-year-old because then now they're going to preschool.

192
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,040
 A new group of kids come into this daycare center and one day Elizabeth takes this little

193
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,160
 boy, we'll call him Joey, and she's like, Joey, did you go poop poop in your pants?

194
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,320
 And he's like, maybe.

195
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,920
 And she takes Joey over to the changing station and lays him down and starts to take off the

196
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
 diaper.

197
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,240
 And all of a sudden Joey's little body starts to tremble and he points up at the ceiling

198
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,360
 tiles and goes, no, he's watching.

199
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,440
 He's watching.

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,200
 No.

201
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,520
 And she goes, these two kids didn't know each other.

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,600
 These two kids did not know each other at all.

203
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,840
 And it was the same thing with him.

204
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,040
 We could not change him on that changing station.

205
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
 He fought us every single time.

206
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,520
 We're like, we're just doing it on the floor.

207
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,040
 Let's just change little Joey on the floor.

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
 And it's interesting to apparently other people have witnessed this phenomenon.

209
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,560
 Elizabeth wasn't the only worker who was having to change these kids and they would be saying

210
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,240
 there's a man in the ceiling watching us.

211
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
 There's a man up there.

212
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,920
 The first time you would think it was a kid's overactive imagination, but when you have

213
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,120
 two kids that are saying the exact same thing in the exact same location under the exact

214
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,760
 same set of circumstances, you have to think that there is, well, here's the thing.

215
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
 She knew.

216
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
 Elizabeth knew for a fact there was nobody in the ceiling.

217
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,640
 She's like, I don't know how she knows that.

218
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,040
 I don't know if they ever spent the night in the daycare center telling spooky stories

219
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,360
 and then walked up into the area.

220
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,520
 You could also just look up and go that would not support the weight of an adult.

221
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,480
 Looking at this cheap ceiling in this rundown daycare center, an adult would fall through

222
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 that ceiling.

223
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,440
 And that's normally how it is with those.

224
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:20,600
 Kind of like, listen, if opening and closing a door makes your tiles shift around, leave

225
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,480
 gaps big enough that you can just see into the darkness, it's not going to hold the

226
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,960
 weight of a 180 pound man.

227
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,240
 I would argue it wouldn't hold the weight of a couple toddlers.

228
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,880
 I think we can put that to a test.

229
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,360
 We got a bunch of them down here.

230
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,760
 Let's put them up and we'll have a little safety mat form on the ground.

231
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,920
 We'll see how many we can put up in the ceiling before they all come below.

232
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,200
 At that point, you would have to go.

233
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,640
 It doesn't hold the weight of a man.

234
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,600
 When the first kid was seeing it, you would think it was just overactive imagination.

235
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,560
 When the second kid seen it, you would then start to think paranormal.

236
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,920
 This was posted online by someone with the screen name of Moonschild86.

237
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,080
 And you have to wonder, thanks for posting it.

238
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
 It was pretty interesting story.

239
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,640
 You have to wonder, what would you do?

240
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,120
 Not, I mean, as a daycare worker, your options are pretty limited.

241
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,840
 This is what I was talking about in the beginning, like, as a reasonable adult, if your kid came

242
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,600
 home and said, hey, they're like, hey, how was this daycare?

243
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
 And they're like, hey, it was okay.

244
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,000
 But there's a creepy guy in the ceiling.

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,560
 I mean, definitely if your kid told you that, you're headed down there with a shotgun that

246
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,840
 night and you're getting in the front door just shooting under the tiles.

247
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,880
 But then after you get bailed out of jail, your toddler goes, no, no, no, no, I mean,

248
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,280
 I think he's a ghost, maybe?

249
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,040
 I just learned that word.

250
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,600
 If you thought that the daycare that your toddler was going to was haunted by the ghost

251
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 of a pervert.

252
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,880
 Because I think that's what's implied here, right?

253
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,760
 Would you let your kid go to that daycare?

254
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,440
 And it's not an easy question because on the one hand, the answer is no, right?

255
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
 The answer is no.

256
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,480
 I don't want a creepy ghost staring at my kid, taking their clothes off.

257
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,640
 I mean, I don't even think I, I don't think any reasonable person does.

258
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,160
 But this is the thing.

259
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,680
 I would not allow it.

260
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,320
 I would not allow it.

261
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,800
 But what if one, they're the only daycare in town?

262
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,280
 The other one's like miles away and you're like, well, listen, we could spend, we could

263
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,000
 spend an extra $10 a day on gas to the non-perverted daycare center.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
 Well, see, here's the thing.

265
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,440
 If it was a real pervert, you wouldn't deal with you to go down there with a shotgun.

266
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,680
 The situation would be over with.

267
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,840
 But if it's a ghost pervert and like, how would you explain that to your significant

268
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
 other?

269
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,400
 They're like, dude, seriously, we can't be driving all the way across town to go to this

270
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,720
 different daycare.

271
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,720
 You would say, but honey, there's a pervert ghost in the ceiling of this one.

272
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,160
 And I don't want my kid being stared up by some perverted spirit.

273
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,520
 Most adults would say, what in the world are you talking about?

274
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,080
 These kids have overactive imagination.

275
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,520
 The other day they said that there was a monster under their bed.

276
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
 Like, do you believe that?

277
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
 And you're like, oh no.

278
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,320
 You're all running around the house.

279
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,880
 You're all boarding up the bottom of each bed.

280
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,800
 You have to be very careful what they say to certain adults.

281
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
 They'll believe everything.

282
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,680
 But you know what I mean?

283
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:35,160
 At what point would you say, I'm not going to have my kid at this ghost pervert daycare

284
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 center?

285
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,960
 And the answer is not as easy as you think it is.

286
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,400
 I would say, because I don't have a kid, I would say no dice, never, ever, ever.

287
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,280
 But if that daycare center was the closest to me and I'd still would drive out of my

288
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,040
 way or just put them on a backpack like my original idea, take them to work.

289
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,960
 What if your significant other or the people you live with go, dude, don't be an idiot.

290
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,920
 There's no such thing as ghosts for one.

291
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,680
 And then two, there was what can the pervert ghost do?

292
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,400
 That's when you realize all your roommates are pervert ghosts.

293
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,600
 You're like, ah, you're part of the problem.

294
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,760
 I wondered why you were always leaving to go to work at the same time I was dropping my

295
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
 kid off.

296
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,240
 Shouldn't be roommates with a bunch of pervert ghosts.

297
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,880
 They always take that side.

298
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,120
 But you know what I mean?

299
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,800
 Would you be able to logically explain to someone, hey, why are you late to work today?

300
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,840
 You're like, boss, I told you my daycare.

301
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,880
 It takes me an extra 20 minutes a day to drive my daughter to the daycare.

302
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,800
 And your boss is like, but there's a perfectly good daycare right in your neighborhood.

303
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 And you go, yeah, but there's a ghost.

304
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,120
 There's a ghost out there.

305
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,960
 I mean, like, I love talking about paranormal.

306
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
 We all love talking about paranormal, looking at it.

307
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,720
 So to us, it's not a huge issue.

308
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,560
 But the thing is, is like, to most people, even people who believe in ghosts and supernatural

309
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
 stuff like that, they still don't talk about it out loud.

310
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,920
 So to most people, if you try telling your boss, I'm going to be late to work for a while

311
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,520
 because I don't want to take my daughter to a haunted daycare.

312
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,240
 I'm trying to find a non-perverted, non-haunted daycare for her to go.

313
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,720
 Your boss will think you're insane.

314
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,240
 Most people would.

315
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
 Most people would.

316
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,280
 It would be better off lying and say, oh, asbestos.

317
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,120
 They found asbestos in the ceiling and lead in the water.

318
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,080
 They're like, oh, yeah, no, totally.

319
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 Take your time.

320
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,560
 Find another daycare center.

321
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,680
 And you'd be like, oh, God, sweet.

322
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,600
 When you then have two kids both saying that there's a creepy pervert watching them change,

323
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,560
 I think you have the duty as a parent to move your kid.

324
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,000
 That I will, I think that's probably a good idea.

325
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,280
 I think people are like, yes, Jason, we all agreed with you.

326
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
 We don't know why you talked about that for the past seven minutes.

327
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 There's not a single person who would go, you know what?

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,800
 That drive, that can meet too long.

329
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 Sorry, kid.

330
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,360
 You gotta stay at the haunted pervert place.

331
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,760
 Nobody would say that, Jason.

332
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,720
 Why were you doing this big hypothetical thing?

333
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,880
 Everyone just kind of shook their head at the same time and go, I'd be making work.

334
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,400
 Rudy Jass, go ahead and catch the keys of the world famous carboner copter we are leaving

335
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,480
 behind this daycare center.

336
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:30,160
 Play us all the way out to Arizona.

337
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
 The year is 2015.

338
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,640
 We're in northern Arizona in the middle of nowhere.

339
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:45,680
 We're out in the desert and we see a truck pull up.

340
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:51,180
 And out steps a man who enjoys being out in the middle of nowhere.

341
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,960
 He did not give his real name when he was writing this account.

342
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,960
 We're gonna go ahead and call him Charles.

343
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,320
 But this is what he loves to do.

344
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 He loves to just get out and spend time in the desolate wasteland of northern Arizona.

345
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,240
 I mean, I say that, but there's like shrubs and probably like birds and stuff like that.

346
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,880
 Maybe coyotes, lizards, lots of lizards.

347
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,680
 And he just likes walking through the area.

348
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:23,700
 I mean, he'd actually park his pickup truck and just kind of explore the landscape.

349
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,380
 And he's done this multiple times before.

350
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,380
 This isn't the very first experience he's had out there, but he's enjoying it so much

351
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,540
 that he goes, you know, it's actually getting kind of late.

352
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,260
 I'm just gonna sleep in my truck tonight.

353
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,580
 Maybe do some more hiking tomorrow.

354
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,060
 But for now, sleep.

355
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,460
 So he hops in his pickup truck.

356
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,740
 Oh yeah, stretching out.

357
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,120
 Rolls down his windows for some fresh desert air.

358
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,680
 Charles is just sitting out there in the middle of nowhere with the windows rolled down, full

359
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,000
 moon lighting up the desolate wasteland that surrounds him.

360
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:07,080
 When all of a sudden he sees movement outside of his car.

361
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,440
 He goes, I'm sitting there and I see my driver side rear view mirror, like that external rear

362
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
 view mirror.

363
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,140
 I see something moving behind the car.

364
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,140
 It's interesting.

365
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,180
 He's very calm while he's looking at this thing.

366
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,620
 But that changes.

367
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,740
 That changes fairly rapidly.

368
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,740
 He sees something.

369
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,900
 He goes, I would estimate it was about four to six feet behind my truck and it was walking,

370
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,380
 just walking behind my truck without a care in the world.

371
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,660
 And he described it as an eight foot tall humanoid.

372
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,660
 Didn't get a good look at its face.

373
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,280
 Didn't get a good look at a lot of the features of it.

374
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,480
 He goes, the way that the moon was is I could perfectly see it silhouette.

375
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,880
 Couldn't tell you how big the eyes were.

376
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,440
 Couldn't tell you what a lot of that stuff was, how big the nose was if it had a nose.

377
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,640
 He goes, I saw this eight foot tall humanoid walk by.

378
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,840
 Incredibly skinny.

379
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,280
 Very very skinny, very very tall.

380
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,420
 Long arms dangling down.

381
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,980
 He said the elbows were kind of in an odd spot.

382
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,440
 They weren't where, even if you gave a human long arms, the elbows seemed to be in the

383
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,940
 wrong spot.

384
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,180
 Tall skinny long arms.

385
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,380
 He goes, the neck alone was a foot long or a foot tall would probably be a better way

386
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,620
 to put it.

387
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,060
 So this is not just like an emaciated human.

388
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,260
 I mean like, oh, I've been less in the desert.

389
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
 I need water.

390
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,300
 And he's like, ah, it wasn't like that.

391
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,000
 Like this was definitely some sort of creature.

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But you couldn't say it was a great alien.

393
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,840
 You couldn't say it was really alien at all.

394
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,520
 It's just something, he's trying to make sense of this thing.

395
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,520
 One interesting, I mean the whole thing.

396
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,680
 There's an eight foot tall monster walking around in the desert, right?

397
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,720
 But what I think is interesting is a lot of times we see similarities and sometimes it's

398
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,480
 interesting to see these stark differences.

399
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,880
 It had, because when I was seeing this I go, maybe it's one of the crawlers.

400
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,660
 I had experiences with these things.

401
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,380
 I saw two of them and I didn't even know there was a term for them.

402
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,580
 I didn't even know what I was looking at.

403
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,260
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

404
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,780
 This thing, this wasn't that.

405
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
 This wasn't that.

406
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,180
 Because those are just these long or tall, long, because they walk on all fours.

407
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,100
 These weird looking human, that's creepy.

408
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,020
 Just to even remember seeing, being close to one.

409
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,180
 I only saw the hind quarters of one, but it's this long tall.

410
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,380
 It's like if you took a human and made him walk on all fours and never fed him anything

411
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,120
 and he super maciated and his skin is gaunt.

412
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,560
 And that is kind of what he's describing, but this one's walking on two legs.

413
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:55,680
 And it had a four foot long tube, or what he believed was a tube.

414
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,720
 Again, he's just looking at this in the silhouette.

415
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:08,320
 A four foot long tube-like object protruding from its jaw.

416
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,220
 And he said it actually dangled all the way down and then came to a point at the bottom

417
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,700
 as if it was a beard.

418
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,180
 But he didn't say it was a beard.

419
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,580
 It didn't move like a beard.

420
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,780
 He described it as being a tube.

421
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,040
 Looking off of this thing's jaw.

422
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:37,880
 This humanoid walked very slowly, very deliberately, not like a predator stalking prey.

423
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,280
 Charles said it almost looked like it was having difficulty moving.

424
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,880
 It was very painful for this creature to even have any sort of locomotion.

425
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,260
 He goes the way that a walk seemed like walking was a struggle for it.

426
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,980
 Now he's taking all of this in.

427
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,460
 He sees the silhouette, he's taking in how it's moving and all that stuff.

428
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,300
 And Charles was like, "Okay, this is creepy.

429
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,180
 I've never seen anything like this before.

430
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,620
 I'm just going to roll up the window.

431
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,700
 That'll clearly protect me from the eight foot tall monster in the desert."

432
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,140
 Well he goes to roll up the window and he has one of those new-fangled cars with the

433
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,440
 automatic windows and the car shut off because he was just enjoying the solitude.

434
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,040
 He goes to do that and it's just like click, click, and the window's not rolling up.

435
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,600
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot.

436
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 I forgot.

437
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
 I forgot.

438
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,760
 I live in the year 2015."

439
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,480
 Most cars now have automatic windows.

440
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,760
 Well when he's clicking this button, the creature turns and looks his way.

441
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,440
 And he said even the way it turned its head was just kind of this very slow, deliberate

442
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,040
 turn staring right at Charles.

443
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,540
 And Charles is sitting in the car.

444
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,880
 He's watching all this out of the rear view mirror.

445
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 He still can't see what this thing's face looks like, but I mean you can understand

446
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
 movement and motion and you go, "Oh, okay, now it's looking at me."

447
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,100
 Like just the way the silhouette has turned, it's looking at me and he starts to think,

448
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,880
 "Okay, I'm going to die."

449
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,040
 This is the end of me.

450
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,040
 He goes, "This thing is clearly going to kill me and it's going to kill me for one reason.

451
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,200
 It's starving to death.

452
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,880
 I don't know what it is, but it is starving.

453
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,760
 I can see how emaciated it is.

454
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,880
 It's going to kill me and eat me."

455
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,440
 He goes, "My only option I could think of at the time was if this thing takes one more

456
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,760
 step towards me, I'm going to turn on my car, roll up the window, and just drive away as

457
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,920
 fast as I can."

458
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
 Which is not a bad plan.

459
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,320
 I probably would not roll up the window first.

460
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
 I probably would start driving first, but anyways.

461
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,920
 And you figure he'll just speed out of there anyways, but it's nighttime in the desert.

462
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,400
 Sure, he has headlights, but he's going to be driving through.

463
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,840
 It took him a while to get here in the first place.

464
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,080
 He's driving his truck over this terrain and then he gets out and walks around in the middle

465
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
 of nowhere.

466
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,160
 So it's not like he's on a city street.

467
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,720
 He's like, "See you later, sucker!"

468
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,560
 And there's like, he can make all these quick turns and lose it.

469
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,400
 So he goes, "I'm going to roll my window up and drive out of here and safely get back

470
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,920
 home."

471
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,840
 He puts his hands on the keys.

472
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,120
 They're in the ignition.

473
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,400
 And this figure is still just staring at Charles.

474
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,480
 And then it just slowly turned its head and walked away.

475
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,720
 Continuing on its journey, it was moving, just walking by the back of the car, right?

476
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
 He totally was ignoring it.

477
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,240
 This creature, whatever it was, was totally ignoring it.

478
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,240
 Stopped, looked at Charles, and now just his continuing on his journey.

479
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,600
 He made no movement, no threats, nothing.

480
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,720
 Towards Charles, he just mows his own by.

481
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,280
 Charles said that he waited for about a minute and then he drove away.

482
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,960
 It's a minute longer than I would have been there, but anyways, he said he waited a minute

483
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:13,200
 and he drove away and that was that until you got to go back, right?

484
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,160
 You would have to go back in this type of situation.

485
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,840
 Your curiosity would be piqued.

486
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:25,800
 Again, if you saw a UFO, if you saw a ghost, if you saw a Bigfoot, you know what those

487
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 things are.

488
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,240
 And most of those, you may go back as well.

489
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 Check them out.

490
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,400
 But you know what those are, but when you see something totally unexplainable, it's not

491
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,160
 like you can even really talk to anyone about it.

492
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
 How do you categorize this?

493
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,440
 So curiosity would get the best of you and he realized this thing may know threatening

494
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,320
 actions towards him, right?

495
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,360
 Maybe he'd go out there and find out it was some weird trick of the light.

496
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,600
 On these particular nights, there's always a cactus in the exact same position, and

497
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,360
 a bunch of squirrels hanging out on it and it makes the shape.

498
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,480
 You would go, you would be curious to go back.

499
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,800
 And also remember, this is his turf.

500
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,240
 He goes out into the desert all the time and hiking and you wouldn't want to be afraid

501
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,080
 to go back out to the place where you find peace.

502
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,400
 I think both of those, I think curiosity and then also, you know, kind of reclaiming what

503
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,640
 you own, what you love.

504
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,880
 About a month later, he goes back out there during the day.

505
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 He's not an idiot.

506
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,560
 He is going back out there when he's not an idiot.

507
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,720
 He goes back out there during the day and he finds the exact same spot he was at.

508
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,480
 And he parks his car and he gets out.

509
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,960
 And here's the thing, he was like, what was that?

510
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
 And where did it come from?

511
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,880
 Not just from a metaphysical sense, like what plane of existence, but like, no, literally,

512
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,720
 where did this thing come from?

513
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,360
 It just appeared out of the middle of nowhere.

514
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,280
 Sure, it was night.

515
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,840
 But like, where would it have come from?

516
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,400
 There's nothing around here.

517
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
 I don't understand.

518
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
 I've never seen anything like that before.

519
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
 And then all of a sudden I see it.

520
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,160
 It's right next to me.

521
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,400
 Well, he begins to just hike around this area, this area in particular.

522
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,720
 And he's just going, exploring, looking at all this stuff.

523
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,480
 And he comes across something that he had never seen before out here.

524
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,880
 But it's a vast desert.

525
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,380
 It's not like he's been everywhere.

526
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,320
 Of course, there are going to be things you haven't seen.

527
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,640
 And what he's looking at, he can tell this has been here for a long time.

528
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,800
 This has been here longer than I've been hiking.

529
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,160
 So it's not that it's happened recently.

530
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,880
 I've just discovered it.

531
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,080
 But maybe this is a clue.

532
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,560
 He describes this place looking like an old crash site.

533
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,400
 Now, he doesn't say that he sees debris.

534
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,880
 He doesn't say that he sees pieces of metal or anything like that.

535
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,600
 He goes, the reason why he's using that terminology, he goes, because clearly there is a, a, a

536
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,200
 depression in the ground.

537
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,760
 It looks like something impacted here.

538
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:09,880
 It's not a deep hole, but in the crater, I guess would be another good word for it.

539
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,680
 Not a giant crater, but in this crater, there are rocks with scorched marks.

540
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:23,600
 But there were also bushes growing in and around this crash site.

541
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,320
 So he goes, whatever happened, happened a while ago.

542
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,520
 I mean, definitely nature has reclaimed the land, but there's still evidence that something

543
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
 crashed here.

544
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:37,600
 Whether it was a plane, a meteorite, or something else, this is a unnatural deformation of the

545
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 ground.

546
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 He's kind of standing around.

547
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
 He's looking at this thing.

548
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,600
 Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

549
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
 He's looking around.

550
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 He's like, what?

551
00:30:51,600 --> 00:31:02,600
 Beep, beep.

552
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 He's standing in the middle of the desert.

553
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,280
 He's standing in a place that he's never been before, and he enjoys the middle of the desert.

554
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:20,600
 And he can clearly hear, because it's so quiet out there, the sound of a truck backing up.

555
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:29,600
 Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

556
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:40,480
 And as well as hearing the beep, beep, beeping of a truck backing up, he hears heavy machinery.

557
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,600
 And he goes, it wasn't like a guy was just driving a dump truck somewhere.

558
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,960
 I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

559
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,880
 Someone was driving a dump truck somewhere, but he goes, the amount of different noises

560
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,760
 that I'm hearing, I'm not even just hearing one truck going beep, beep.

561
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,160
 I'm hearing five, six, a dozen.

562
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:07,640
 He goes, it sounds like somewhere, somewhere there is a huge construction project going

563
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
 on.

564
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,640
 He goes, not the volume level, but the amount of different noises.

565
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,520
 He goes, you can hear all of this heavy machinery going on.

566
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,240
 You hear all these trucks moving.

567
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,920
 Not the volume, but the amount of different noises would be akin to you walking by a construction

568
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,920
 site.

569
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,440
 So he's like, someone's building something out here.

570
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
 That has to be what's going on.

571
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,600
 So he actually, he has to get to the bottom of this mystery, right?

572
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,520
 You have to figure out what's going on.

573
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,240
 And really at this point, just to realize that you're not insane, but also curious.

574
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
 You're right.

575
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,640
 Maybe you don't mind about being insane, but you're also super curious about it.

576
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,360
 He hiked back to his pickup truck and began driving all around the area, looking for this

577
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
 construction site.

578
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,400
 They're building something in the middle of the desert.

579
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,520
 He wants to know what it is.

580
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,960
 Can't find anything.

581
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
 Finds nothing.

582
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,000
 He's driving around for miles.

583
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 He's looking.

584
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,360
 He has a perfect view of everything around him.

585
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,240
 And if he can't, if there happen to be like a plateau in front of him, he just drives

586
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
 around it.

587
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,640
 So on his pickup truck, he's driving around for miles and miles and miles.

588
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,760
 He cannot figure out where they even would build anything.

589
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,280
 I mean, technically you could build it anywhere, but where in the world are, where in the world

590
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,480
 are these noises coming from?

591
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
 But here's the thing.

592
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,400
 He's realizing too, the more he drives out, he can't really hear the noise.

593
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,080
 He doesn't, it's not like he can hear the construction sounds as he's driving around.

594
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,040
 When he jumps out of his pickup truck, he's walking around.

595
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,400
 He can't hear the construction noises.

596
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,800
 It's not like they're echoing through the desert.

597
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:55,560
 And he, again, has to realize, okay, this is insane, but he hops back in the pickup truck,

598
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:08,520
 drives back to the crash site, gets out of his pickup truck, and just stands there motionless.

599
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:18,520
 Beep, beep, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

600
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:18,520
 shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

601
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
 shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

602
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,520
 shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, sh

603
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:39,520
 shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

604
00:34:39,520 --> 00:35:09,520
 shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

605
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:39,520
 shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,
