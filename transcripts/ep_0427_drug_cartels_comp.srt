1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
 Indonesia takes an interesting approach to fighting the coronavirus, and then we take

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,380
 a look at a story of a werewolf that stalking the streets of a town in Mexico.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,580
 Is there really a creature of the night howling off in the distance?

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,820
 And if so, is it possible it was created by drug cartels today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,620
 [Music]

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,860
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,980
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,980
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,980
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,980
 It's hot.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,820
 It's hot in here and there's a storm coming.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,580
 Last night was a big windstorm in Hooded River.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,580
 Really loud.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,260
 I left the windows open and I just sat there and was goofing off on the computer reading

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,700
 and oh man.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,140
 The elements, the elements just really kind of fly through the gorge.

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,500
 Big storm coming though.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
 Look out my window.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,660
 I can kind of feel like I'm in prison.

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,100
 I can kind of like crane my head just a bit to look off into the distance.

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,700
 Big storms coming.

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,900
 So we'll see what tonight brings.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,140
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons.

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,900
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to Scott Stewart.

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,540
 Scott, thank you so much for supporting the show all this time.

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,140
 Really really means a lot.

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,460
 Really really helps.

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,460
 Really really appreciate it.

29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,900
 So you're going to be flying us around.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,220
 You're going to be our pilot captain.

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,740
 Whatever vehicle we use, you're going to be in charge of that.

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,180
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too guys.

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,740
 I totally understand.

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,300
 You can help just by spreading the word about the show, giving the show a good review, all

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,900
 sorts of stuff.

36
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,860
 You can use to support the show and I appreciate all the assistance I get from you guys.

37
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,020
 I really really do.

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,740
 So Scott, thank you so much for your support.

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,220
 We're giving you, you're going to be the captain today on the Dead Rabbit Dreadnought.

40
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,780
 It's a brand new vehicle actually.

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,740
 It's a massive warship.

42
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,740
 Dinky little rowboat.

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,460
 We'll save that for swimming across the lakes.

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,380
 I guess we don't need to swim, we'd be in a boat.

45
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,620
 But anyways, Dead Rabbit Dreadnoughts are massive warship.

46
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,300
 It's one of those ones with all the oars and stuff like that.

47
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,500
 We have a bunch of Greek fire.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,660
 I'm just like cooking marshmallows over it.

49
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,420
 The chemicals make it taste so much better.

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,980
 We're sailing from the United States.

51
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,100
 We're headed all the way to Indonesia.

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,780
 And there we're going to see a little village.

53
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,420
 We parked the boat and then we all like hop out.

54
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,420
 That's how boats work, right?

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,700
 You just like bring them right up to the beach.

56
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,740
 We hop out, we walk into Kepa Village.

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,740
 It's on Java Island in Indonesia.

58
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,540
 And everyone's kind of hanging out in their houses because it's quarantine time, right?

59
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
 You know that, right?

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
 You're like, no, I what?

61
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
 I didn't know that.

62
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,020
 You're jogging down the street listening to this podcast.

63
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
 I didn't have phones.

64
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,660
 You're like, oh, I was wondering why my town was super empty.

65
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,060
 I'm wondering why it looked like a zombie movie.

66
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,460
 Yes, we're in quarantine for the most part, not everywhere, but they're doing quarantine

67
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,260
 in Indonesia right now.

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
 How do you keep people inside?

69
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,700
 There's a couple of different ways you can like, I think the weirdest thing going on

70
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,260
 right now is you can get arrested for violating quarantine.

71
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,980
 But if you're currently in jail, they're letting you go so you don't get coronavirus in jail.

72
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,300
 That's a weird, I think that's one of the weird things about this whole virus thing.

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,580
 And I guess in Florida, they let a guy go and a day later, he murders somebody.

74
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,580
 There's going to be a lot.

75
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,940
 If we look back on this thing, there's going to be a lot of overreactions.

76
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,220
 I mean, obviously murdering a guy is an overreaction, but the idea of like letting people out of

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,180
 jail and then arresting people who go to church is just going to be a weird, that'll be one

78
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,220
 of those things that people kind of look back and go, what were we thinking?

79
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,100
 But we're panicked right now, right?

80
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,860
 Speaking of panic, the government of Indonesia decided this.

81
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,180
 Let's keep people inside by scaring them, which actually seems to work for pretty much

82
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,580
 everywhere else, right?

83
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,380
 You're scared to catch this thing yourself or you're scared to give it to one of your

84
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,380
 loved ones.

85
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,380
 And that's why we're all kind of obeying the quarantine for now.

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,020
 They decide to go the route.

87
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,140
 Let's dress people up as pokongs.

88
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,580
 You're like, what's a pokong?

89
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,540
 Let me tell you, whoa, dude, don't don't don't interrupt me, bro.

90
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
 You want to a pokong?

91
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
 I'm just joking.

92
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,540
 Put my arm around you.

93
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,540
 I'm just messing with you.

94
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,540
 Give a little nookie.

95
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,460
 A pokong is a trapped spirit of the dead.

96
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,460
 It's an Indonesian belief systems, Indonesian mythology, however you want to put it.

97
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,020
 They have a thing called a pokong.

98
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,860
 It's a spirit of the dead, basically a wraith, someone who's been trapped on earth, a ghost,

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,900
 a tortured ghost.

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,140
 So anyways, people were dressed up as pokongs and basically it's just they have white sheets

101
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,140
 wrapped around them.

102
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,380
 Not this super ornate costume.

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,140
 They're not like, they don't look like Power Ranger monsters or anything like that.

104
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,300
 They're just like, dude with a white sheet wrapped around them.

105
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,460
 They'd walk down the street and the idea was that you would either one think these were

106
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,260
 actual phantasms and you would stay in your house to stay away from the ghost.

107
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,540
 That's terrifying, right?

108
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,020
 One thing for your government to say, this disease can hurt you and your loved ones,

109
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,980
 it's another thing to say, the dead have risen.

110
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,340
 They're coming after you.

111
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,660
 The other idea is that it's just to remind you that death is outside.

112
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,540
 That's also quite terrifying.

113
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,660
 The government was saying basically not necessarily trying to trick people into believing there

114
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,620
 was paranormal activity going on outside, but just as a reminder, just like a cigarette,

115
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,220
 when you buy a packet of cigarettes in other countries, they'll have pictures of like cancerous

116
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,220
 mouths and stuff like that to really put the shock in your system, this might happen to

117
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
 you.

118
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,020
 Backfired, if you can believe that because what would happen was people would see the

119
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,780
 ghost and they would leave their houses.

120
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,380
 They'd be like, "Hey, let's go see the ghost.

121
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
 Come on, kids.

122
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,780
 Hey, grandma, let me get your oxygen tank.

123
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,780
 Yeah, hold on to that.

124
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,940
 We'll put you in the wheelchair."

125
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,980
 It's wheelchairs kicking up a bunch of disgusting dust.

126
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,180
 Everyone was hopping out of their house to see the ghost.

127
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,740
 It became a sightseeing thing.

128
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,900
 Eventually, though, people in town wised up.

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,620
 I guess like when the first article hit, they're like, "The people in town, this is encouraging

130
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,220
 them to go out and they're basically playing Pokemon Go."

131
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,020
 But there's just people and ghosts walking around and they're like, "Hey, got you."

132
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,020
 And they're like, "Let go of me.

133
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,260
 I'm already infected with the disease."

134
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,860
 Now, people, maybe they've just gotten, I was reading an article recently and they said,

135
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,660
 "Nowadays the people see them and they go, "Yeah, yeah, let's stay indoors."

136
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,180
 It could also be that they just got bored because how many times could you see a ghost?

137
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
 That's a good question.

138
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,180
 How many times could you see a ghost before you started getting bored of them?

139
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,980
 You could say, "Jason, never."

140
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,660
 If every time you walked home, there was a hot ghost chick sitting in your favorite chair

141
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
 and then she disappeared.

142
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,780
 The first time, it's going to terrify you.

143
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,140
 Second time, you're going to be curious and you're going to start setting up cameras and

144
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,380
 EVP and stuff like that.

145
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:45,300
 By the 1,573rd time, before you put your key in your lock, you're going to be like, "Are

146
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
 you walking the door?"

147
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,020
 And she's just sitting there and then she disappears.

148
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,780
 The smell of sulfur, once again, fills your apartment.

149
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,300
 It would get boring.

150
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,500
 How many times do you have to see a squirrel?

151
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,980
 Never mind, I love seeing squirrels all the time.

152
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,700
 I could never get bored of seeing a squirrel.

153
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,100
 So maybe I never get bored of seeing a ghost.

154
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,580
 What's interesting is that, and this is the reason why I wanted to cover this, this totally

155
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,140
 grosses me out.

156
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,340
 This is apparently working, but in some regions in Indonesia, they wear, they're like mounted

157
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
 police.

158
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,460
 They do this in India too and they wear helmets that have the image of the coronavirus on

159
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
 them.

160
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,220
 They look like characters from the 1990s Nickelodeon cartoon.

161
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,740
 For whatever reason, these things are like green and red and they're super cartoony and

162
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,340
 they're made out of like plaster of Paris or maybe just paper mache, I don't know.

163
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,780
 But it's like, you see a cop on a horse and they're wearing this massive neon green hand

164
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,460
 painted homemade model of the coronavirus.

165
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,660
 You know what grosses me out about that?

166
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:51,700
 We as a society, I haven't done it and you may not have done it, but I'd say the media

167
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,420
 has done it.

168
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,460
 They've created the image of the coronavirus.

169
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,900
 Have you guys all seen what this looks like?

170
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,940
 And you're like Jason, that's science, right?

171
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,980
 Are you going to deny the fact that this is, no, no, lay off.

172
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,060
 Dude, you're going to be real touching today, bro.

173
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,540
 I'm just trying to find out a podcast.

174
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,420
 No, I just get you in the headlock again.

175
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,540
 I'm just messing with you.

176
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,900
 Give you a little tummy rub.

177
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:21,340
 The idea is this, that, I get it, it exists and this is a 3D model, but like if you go

178
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,660
 to a website, you go to YouTube, does it, and you watch anything that mentions the coronavirus,

179
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,900
 they'll have a little coronavirus infobar and then a picture of the virus.

180
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,620
 You go to major news sites, it'll be like coronavirus update, a picture of the virus.

181
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,940
 The picture is everywhere of what this virus supposedly looks like.

182
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,500
 We've created a meme of it.

183
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,740
 It's a computer generated image.

184
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,780
 It's not an actual photograph of it.

185
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,740
 If you showed us a photograph of it, it would be this really grainy gray, I mean it's not

186
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,180
 a photograph, like a microscopic, be a really grainy gray thing.

187
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,740
 We've turned it into a symbol.

188
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,980
 Symbols have power in the human mind.

189
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,780
 And I hate that we've made this a symbol because it gives it more power.

190
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:11,940
 I can, just by being my age, just by being 43 years old and living through things like

191
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,940
 this before.

192
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,460
 I didn't live through the Spanish flu, but I've lived through things like this before.

193
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,300
 I'm gonna make a couple predictions.

194
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,860
 Dead Rabbit Radio is gonna predict these things.

195
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
 One.

196
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,940
 At least one.

197
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,380
 This probably has already happened.

198
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,260
 And this is a minor prediction.

199
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,380
 At least one heavy metal group, death metal group or whatever, will name themselves coronavirus

200
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,140
 and have their CD, if they still even make CDs or their cover art, to basically be a

201
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,420
 stylized coronavirus.

202
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,540
 That's not even a prediction.

203
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,620
 That's just something that's probably happening right now.

204
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
 Two.

205
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,060
 This is gonna become a fetish.

206
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,580
 I'm not talking about corona Chan.

207
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,220
 I'm not talking about drawing a hot Asian girl and giving her a little corona adornments

208
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,300
 on her dresses.

209
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,180
 There are going to be young people now who are in the developmental stage that in their

210
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,180
 twenties and thirties are going to want to bang this image.

211
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,900
 Again, not as a lark, not ironically, not as something funny to post online.

212
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:17,940
 There is going to be, in a generation of men and women, you're gonna see one to two percent

213
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,660
 of them have a sexual attraction to the virus itself.

214
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,740
 100% predict that.

215
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,980
 We will see that in our lifetime.

216
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,940
 In the next 15 to 20 years, there will be people saying, "Well, I deserve equal rights

217
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,060
 because I want to bang a disease that killed a million people or whatever the end result

218
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
 is.

219
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,700
 I imagine it's going to be fairly low in the end."

220
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,980
 But that is going to be out there.

221
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,860
 There are going to be people who actually are sexually attracted to the image of the

222
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,020
 virus itself.

223
00:10:48,020 --> 00:11:01,220
 I believe as well that this image will play into a future iteration of the Illuminati theory.

224
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:08,820
 This image will somehow be turned into an image of a death cult.

225
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,940
 Still or imagine, there may actually be right now a cult of death worshipers or dark magic

226
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,460
 practitioners or whatever that are already worshiping this symbol.

227
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,060
 Again, I'm not talking about Kronachan.

228
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,620
 That's an ironic attempt to meme this thing.

229
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,820
 I'm not talking about that.

230
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,540
 I'm talking about serious adherence of dark arts either currently worshiping a stylized

231
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,220
 version of that.

232
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:42,060
 And I think going forward, some major conspiracy theorists, be it David Ike or Alex Jones,

233
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,540
 might, Alex Jones, here's my prediction.

234
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,980
 Alex Jones is probably going to retire in the next five years.

235
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,740
 I think he's going to realize it's just not worth the trouble or he'll do a course correction

236
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,740
 on this thing.

237
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,820
 But we'll see someone basically say, "If the coronavirus symbol, if you look at it

238
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,940
 clockwise or whatever, it has 13 spikes and it represents the 13 families."

239
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,620
 It will, because it's getting, you can't go a day.

240
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,900
 If you go online to any news site, YouTube does it too, you will see this image constantly,

241
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,300
 constantly, constantly, constantly.

242
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,580
 To the point that some people, let's say in the past month, if you're not a religious

243
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,900
 person, you may have seen this symbol more often than you've seen across.

244
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,540
 You've seen a menorah, then you've seen the crescent moon.

245
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:36,420
 This easily could become a fixture in the subconscious of humanity.

246
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,820
 And I don't like that, because symbols are so powerful.

247
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,820
 Symbols are so powerful.

248
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,860
 So you know, and it's funny now to think about, I don't really have any crosses.

249
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,700
 I, myself and the Christian, I don't have any crosses in my house or in my, on my jewelry

250
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,020
 or anything like that.

251
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,220
 I do have one on my ring, but I don't wear it all the time because I'm trapped inside.

252
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,060
 So I've definitely seen the corona symbol more often than I'm seeing any sort of religious

253
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,140
 iconography.

254
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,980
 And that's my religious iconography.

255
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,980
 And again, talking about the star of David, talking about the crescent moon of the Muslim

256
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,180
 faith, all of this stuff.

257
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,740
 It's, we've created a symbol out of it.

258
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,220
 That's funny, this segment became a little more serious than I thought it was going to

259
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,940
 be, but we've created a symbol out of a disease.

260
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,540
 And I don't think that's good for the psyche.

261
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,340
 I don't think that's good for the metaphysical well-being of humanity.

262
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,340
 I don't think it's good for just our psyche in general.

263
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,100
 I think it turns, do you know what the Spanish flu looks like?

264
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,820
 Do you know what Ebola looks like?

265
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,540
 I know what Ebola looks like because I've seen images of it with the whole Ebola chain.

266
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,140
 When the internet was like, hey, let's make, it's the same thing.

267
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,580
 They're trying to turn Ebola into this sexy female thing.

268
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,460
 So again, it's like a little worm.

269
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:58,620
 But even that, and microscopic thing, but even that was nowhere near as popularized as the

270
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,020
 image of the coronavirus.

271
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,580
 And it's damaging.

272
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,460
 I believe it's damaging.

273
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,420
 You're taking a thing that people are terrified of, rightly so, because right now, I think

274
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,140
 now we know more about it than we did just a month ago.

275
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,740
 But now we know that it can be defeated very easily with soap and water.

276
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,340
 We know the risk factors and what to look out for, how not to catch it.

277
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
 We know these things now.

278
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,540
 We didn't know these things in February.

279
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,540
 It was interesting.

280
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,540
 I was watching a press conference with Andrew Cuomo, very telling how little he, I don't

281
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,740
 think he meant to reveal this.

282
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,380
 Sorry, this is becoming more coronavirus-centric than I expected it to be.

283
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,180
 Very telling interview with Andrew Cuomo.

284
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,780
 He's a governor of New York.

285
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:44,540
 He said, I'm paraphrasing here, but again, I don't think that he understood what he

286
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,340
 was saying, the impact of it.

287
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,940
 And no one really commented on this.

288
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,980
 He goes, when this all started, we didn't know.

289
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,060
 We didn't know how you could get this.

290
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,860
 He goes, I feel better now.

291
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,980
 I feel safer now because I know if I wash my hands and I practice social distancing, I'm

292
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
 not going to get it.

293
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,660
 He goes, but in the beginning, we didn't know.

294
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,180
 For all we knew, you could be in your house and it came underneath your door.

295
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,140
 For all we knew, everyone was going to get it no matter what.

296
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,940
 And that's creepy because we didn't know.

297
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,140
 China wasn't giving us accurate information, really.

298
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,540
 China really was too overrun to do a lot of testing, not testing, but to do a lot of

299
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,660
 studies on it.

300
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,300
 They're just trying to stabilize their nation.

301
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,900
 So when it came here, and again, I believe it was here in November, December, and I think

302
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,380
 it was just passing pneumonia deaths, but as we really put it under a microscope, in

303
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,260
 the high levels of the government, they probably thought, we don't know how this is spread.

304
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,820
 For all we know, this could be 100% airborne.

305
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,740
 It could be within 50 feet of, if one person coughs, 10 people are going to get it.

306
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,380
 There's no protect.

307
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,460
 And he said, he goes, we didn't know.

308
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,140
 That's creepy.

309
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,820
 Now we know that you can defeat it very easily.

310
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,100
 Now we know that it looks like the death rate is actually going to be extremely low.

311
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,340
 People talk about reinfection rates, but most likely that's bad tests.

312
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,540
 Most likely it's people who pass a test and then they fail a test and it turns out that

313
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,100
 the first test was a false negative.

314
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,460
 That's really what it looks like.

315
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,340
 Anyways, we shouldn't symbolize it.

316
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,860
 We shouldn't symbolize it.

317
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
 And I apologize actually.

318
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,860
 I try to avoid, I'm trying to avoid covering a lot of coronavirus stuff because we're getting

319
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,060
 inundated with it, but I thought it was an interesting story.

320
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,260
 Apologize that it took so long though.

321
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,540
 Let's go ahead, and I hope you found it interesting as well.

322
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,060
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

323
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
 Our next story.

324
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,260
 Now our next story, this is going to be a long episode.

325
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,860
 Our next story is an interesting one.

326
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,700
 I came across it just kind of going through the internet.

327
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,220
 There's a website call, it was kind of a paranormal type website.

328
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,940
 It's called the Daily Grail.

329
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,500
 This was written by a journalist named Red Pill Junkie.

330
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,300
 Actually, most of this information I got from three particular sources.

331
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,740
 Daily Grail, I got a report from kron4.com and I got a report from nature.com.

332
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,020
 And the reason why I want to shout that out is a lot of times my research takes me to

333
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,180
 multiple places I just put in the show notes.

334
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,380
 But this story is pretty much made up of those three places particularly.

335
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,140
 There's a lot of really good journalism involved in all three of those resources.

336
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,860
 I really think, thank you guys for that.

337
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,540
 Let's ditch the dead rabbit dreadnought, Scott.

338
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,540
 Let's hop on board the carbon helicopter, the world famous carbon helicopter.

339
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,500
 We're leaving behind Indonesia, taking off.

340
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,340
 We're flying over the Pacific Ocean and we're headed to Mexico.

341
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,700
 We're specifically going to a place called Ocozolatia Espanizo.

342
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
 Oh dude, what?

343
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,500
 That was actually pretty good.

344
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,100
 I know my Hispanic listeners are out there.

345
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,620
 They're like, dude, he got it on his first try, I think.

346
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
 It's also known as coita.

347
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,780
 You're like chasing, oh, he mispronounced that word, the little word.

348
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,420
 Coita apparently is what it's pronounced.

349
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,140
 It's a town of 40,000 people.

350
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,420
 That's a pretty big town, honestly.

351
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,180
 And I live in a town of 10,000 people.

352
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,060
 So 40,000 is big.

353
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,380
 They're having a problem over there.

354
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,620
 A problem of the lichen kind.

355
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,500
 So we land our helicopter in Coita.

356
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,300
 And there people are like, oh dude, I'm so glad you came here.

357
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,940
 World famous paranormal investigator, Jason Carpenter.

358
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,300
 Nice to meet you, thank you so much.

359
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
 They're shaking your hand too.

360
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,220
 Oh, I don't know what your name is.

361
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,580
 You're supposed to say your name there.

362
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,860
 Oh yeah, nice to meet you.

363
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
 I heard so much about you.

364
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,860
 So anyways, we're walking through the town.

365
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
 Hey, so what's going on?

366
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,260
 And they're like, dude, you won't believe it.

367
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,340
 So we've been having problems with a werewolf.

368
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,660
 And we're like, oh, interesting.

369
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
 Do you have any proof?

370
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,740
 Yes, yes.

371
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,900
 We have Twitter video.

372
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,380
 And this is in the show notes.

373
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
 Here's the Twitter video.

374
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,820
 And you hear a wolf howling in the distance.

375
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,100
 That's clue number one that a werewolf may be involved.

376
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,260
 Do you have any-- that could also just be a regular wolf.

377
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,380
 It could be a no werewolf.

378
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
 What?

379
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,380
 Uh?

380
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,740
 Looking at you guys in every response.

381
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,380
 Okay, sorry, tough crap.

382
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,740
 Anyway, so now that we have that joke out of the way, do you have any more evidence?

383
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
 And they do.

384
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,540
 They have like, foot-- giant footprints in the dirt.

385
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,060
 They have footprints on roofs.

386
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,540
 Okay, so I mean, easily faked stuff, right?

387
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
 Photographs of these things.

388
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,660
 They're just not articles saying-- and they found a footprint.

389
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,460
 There's footprints everywhere.

390
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,020
 What's interesting is the footprint on the ground, one of the things is like, when archaeologists

391
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,340
 and other nerds are doing stuff, they take photos of stuff, they toss them.

392
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
 They toss quarters on the ground.

393
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,020
 They're like, no, not on top of that amoeba squish.

394
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:40,300
 They place quarters very nicely on the ground, so you have a sense of scale.

395
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,860
 How big this is.

396
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,180
 There's a close-up photo of a giant paw print, or it could just be a medium size or a small

397
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,180
 paw print.

398
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,300
 I don't know how big it is.

399
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,220
 There are photos of what it looks like paw prints on a roof, but they look fake.

400
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,700
 And you can look at the photos yourself as well.

401
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,100
 Now am I automatically discounting the wolf story?

402
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
 No.

403
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,880
 It's very possible that there is a wolf or a werewolf in this town and one person decides

404
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,260
 to paint some paw prints on a roof.

405
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,820
 Or it's possible that I don't know how werewolf prints normally look, so they may look like

406
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,820
 that.

407
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,820
 I don't know.

408
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,340
 The residents in town, though, can't sleep.

409
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,340
 They're up all night and not in the cool Gilbert Gottfried USA way.

410
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
 No.

411
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,380
 They're afraid a werewolf is going to eat them, to a point where a local priest says,

412
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,140
 "Guys, just set a candle and go to sleep."

413
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,820
 Which actually is really bad safety advice.

414
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,740
 I mean, I'm not trying to be, like, sacrilegious, but aren't you nuts of us to sleep with candles?

415
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,540
 To be fair, though, the priest may have also said, "Set a candle, then blow it out and

416
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
 go to sleep."

417
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
 I don't know.

418
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,460
 But the point is, is that the town hasn't burned down yet.

419
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,620
 There's been no deaths attributed to the werewolf.

420
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,820
 However, in Red Pill Junkies article, he did say, "This was a kind of a gross point

421
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
 to put in here.

422
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,940
 Two children were recently found dead in a well."

423
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,780
 And I guess David Paulides and his Missing 411 theory has something to do with wells

424
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
 or water.

425
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,600
 I've heard, yeah, I've dis- I've really, I used to really be into Missing 411, really

426
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,820
 for starting a new traction.

427
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,940
 I lose faith in it constantly.

428
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,980
 There's actually a really good, there's a website called Chaz of the Dead.

429
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,260
 He did a really good write-up on Missing 411.

430
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,380
 He reviewed the book itself.

431
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,740
 When people talk about the Missing 411 conspiracy theory, and it's this idea that the National

432
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,780
 Parks of America have a massive amount of disappearances and the government doesn't

433
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,460
 want them to keep track of them and it may or may not be related to Bigfoot or some sort

434
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,620
 of paranormal activity.

435
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,860
 The theory is actually more interesting than the books the theory are based on.

436
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,020
 I really think you guys should read this article.

437
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,900
 I'll put it in the show notes by Chaz of the Dead.

438
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,060
 He's a paranormal investigator.

439
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,500
 He kind of covered this in depth and he kind of reinforced what I had already heard as

440
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 well.

441
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,300
 The book is, is unsourced.

442
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,500
 Just a bunch of short stories that may or may not have ever happened.

443
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,060
 So anyways though, but Red Pill Junkie brings up the idea that two kids found in water, so

444
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,060
 therefore werewolf.

445
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,700
 Like, I didn't really understand that part of it.

446
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,740
 But anyways, people in town, there's basically three theories as to what this thing could

447
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
 be.

448
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,620
 One is that people are on edge because the coronavirus is flowing around out there, everyone's

449
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,140
 freaking out.

450
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,500
 And so basically that magically makes wolf print.

451
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,580
 No, that bait, people are already freaking out so they hear a wolf in the distance, make

452
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,780
 some thing of werewolf, all these things are happening and then the prints are getting

453
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,020
 faked or they're just regular wolf prints.

454
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
 That's theory one.

455
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,500
 Theory two.

456
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,060
 Some people believe there's a big national forest.

457
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:42,420
 There's a big nearby protected forest reserve that recently trespassers have been moving

458
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,260
 in and out and doing all that stuff.

459
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:52,220
 And it could be a natural elemental coming to wage war against the humans for infringing

460
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,540
 on its territory.

461
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,020
 I mean possible, right?

462
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,220
 I actually think that's kind of the lamest one because otherwise the world would be overrun

463
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,180
 by nature elementals.

464
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,860
 We're constantly stomping everywhere.

465
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,460
 And then there's the most popular theory in town is that it's a gnaw hall.

466
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,580
 A gnaw hall that's a shaman who has the ability to shape shift.

467
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,220
 And they believe that it's stuck in this wolf form.

468
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,900
 Apparently it shape shifts by ripping its flesh off, leaves it in a nice tidy pile, runs

469
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,260
 around, does wolf stuff, comes back in, puts its skin on.

470
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,140
 But if you salt the skin, can't get it back in its skin.

471
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,220
 Now we've covered a lot of like cryptids and stuff like that.

472
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,420
 That's probably the most rational weakness.

473
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,420
 Like we've covered, there's that horsewoman in Brazil that she tries to kill you because

474
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,860
 she sees your shiny teeth.

475
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,460
 So you gotta like lay face down so she doesn't see your teeth.

476
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
 Like what?

477
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,860
 And then there's the one where, I think it might have been the same one where you have

478
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,980
 to pee on yourself to get away.

479
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,940
 You're like why would that have anything to do?

480
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
 That makes sense.

481
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,940
 If you took your skin off and was running around as a wolf and you're like, "Oh, I'm

482
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,020
 tired, time to put my skin back on."

483
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,660
 And it was covered in salt.

484
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,460
 You'd be like, "Uhh, unbearable pain and being a human but being, having salt inside

485
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,180
 of me or just sticking around as a werewolf, I'll be a werewolf a little bit longer."

486
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,980
 Like that actually is a reasonable weapon against something.

487
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,300
 Nobody, imagine having sand in your shoe.

488
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,780
 Now imagine instead of having sand in your shoe, you have sand in your skin and it's

489
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,580
 everywhere, like inside of you.

490
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,940
 But I have another conspiracy theory.

491
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,820
 One thing that was interesting when I was reading this was they said not only are there

492
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,740
 being kept up by the sounds of the werewolf howlin', but gunfire as well.

493
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,060
 Now some people have said they've seen this thing straight on and they've watched it could

494
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,540
 jump like nine feet in the air.

495
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,540
 It's jumping on top of roofs.

496
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,660
 It's jumping over giant walls.

497
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
 They're shooting at it.

498
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,500
 The bullets pass right through it.

499
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 But I did find it weird that at the beginning, that's fine, that may account for a couple

500
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,780
 of the gunshots, but I thought it was weird in the beginning how they said, "They're hearing

501
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,540
 the sounds of the wolf and the sounds of gunshots."

502
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,020
 That's what's keeping everyone up at night.

503
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:06,820
 So I'm going to present a theory of my own right now.

504
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,820
 What if you have drug cartels organized crime creating superhumans?

505
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,500
 Hear me out, hear me out on this.

506
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,660
 Let's assume for the first place that these things could biologically exist.

507
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,380
 Now the idea of a man turning into a wolf, well actually that's an interesting thing

508
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:30,100
 because we see a lot of drug cartels, specifically in Mexico, South America.

509
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,900
 We see a lot of drug cartels that are linked to black magic.

510
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
 Not all of them.

511
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
 Not all of them.

512
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:41,340
 But there are some that go to black magic practitioners for the ability to be invisible

513
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,100
 to law enforcement.

514
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,220
 Technically you should just ask for the ability to be invisible, period.

515
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,660
 Because then law enforcement, they're like, "Oh where'd those guys go?

516
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,660
 I can't see them."

517
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,340
 "Oops, time for me to clock out."

518
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,340
 Click.

519
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,220
 "Right over there, right when I clocked off and I'm no longer a law enforcement officer."

520
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,860
 There you are, you see him materially.

521
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:05,160
 But you can find stories, even in other countries too, of warlords and stuff like that reaching

522
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,300
 out to black magic practitioners for protection spells.

523
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,060
 So why not reach out and say, "Can you build me a werewolf?"

524
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,500
 But that's a little far-fetched, however possible, right?

525
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,900
 You could go to some high level shaman and say, "Really what I'm getting at is this.

526
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:32,180
 What drug organization, what organized crime unit would not want a werewolf on their side?"

527
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,060
 Or any of these beasties we talk about.

528
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,540
 Could you imagine you walk, you go to your local drug deal, you're going to re-up, you

529
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,660
 walk in there and there's like a couple dudes just sitting there smoking weed on the porch.

530
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:48,820
 Knock on the door, another person opens the door, that person goes, "Ah, he's in apartment."

531
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,020
 Says what apartment he's in, then you walk across the apartment complex, you go to that

532
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,220
 one, and Bigfoot's standing inside that one.

533
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,500
 "Mmm, me see you need more drugs."

534
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,780
 Yeah, yeah, Bigfoot, come on man, can you just tell me what apartment he's in now?

535
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,500
 He's in this one, Bigfoot's just like a foot long joint.

536
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,980
 This is just to maintain.

537
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,420
 That would be the best, right?

538
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,100
 That would be the best to have a cryptid on your site.

539
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,140
 Imagine if you had drug shipments being run by the Loch Ness Monster.

540
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,460
 Don't believe he exists, so you wouldn't even bother looking for him.

541
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,260
 Drug cartels have all the things they need.

542
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,260
 Okay, maybe it's far fetched, let me get back into the realm of things.

543
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,500
 Here's the thing, the militaries of the world would love to create superhumans.

544
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,180
 Every one wants to create superhumans, but militaries of the world, unless you're going

545
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,860
 real deep black box stuff, are accountable for things.

546
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,620
 A lot of drug cartels have more money just laying around than a lot of governments on

547
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,500
 the world, not all of them, but a lot of them.

548
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:58,760
 So if someone says, "Hey, if you give me $50 million, I can create a child that is bullet

549
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 proof."

550
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,380
 And then you could hold that child up, bullets would bounce off of you, but eventually the

551
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,700
 child will grow up and be a bullet proof drug runner.

552
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,140
 All is going to cost to say $20 million for all this genetic testing.

553
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,900
 Pablo Escobar had so much money, so much money.

554
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,860
 He had to spend $10,000 a month just on rubber bands to band it all.

555
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
 And he lost like 10% of it.

556
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,540
 Over every year he lost 10% of his cash just due to mice eating it.

557
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,420
 He said, "Oh, okay."

558
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:32,940
 Because you have tons and tons, we're talking like high level cartel organized crime mafia

559
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,300
 stuff, you have tons and tons of cash.

560
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,980
 And here's the thing, if someone comes to you and says, "You know, I can start doing

561
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
 this genetic testing, I can do this stuff."

562
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,060
 And you can have like the black magic person, but you can actually have a scientist say,

563
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:51,340
 "We can create a race of half human, half simians, like Stalin tried doing, but that

564
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,300
 was back in the 50s now, and he actually did try doing that.

565
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,700
 We can do that now.

566
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,460
 If you're a drug lord and he fails, you can just kill him and get your money back or at

567
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,820
 least get a little bit of vindication for having to waste $10 million.

568
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,940
 Best case scenario is, you now have an army of mutants.

569
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,820
 You have an army of enforcers.

570
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,380
 They have unlimited funds.

571
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,260
 They just absolutely do.

572
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,940
 They can afford top scientists.

573
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,660
 I'm actually surprised that we've never, I am honestly shocked about this.

574
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,420
 It makes me think that they don't exist honestly.

575
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:32,180
 That we haven't had a drug organization get a hold of a quote unquote suitcase nuke.

576
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,820
 And there's been a lot of debate over whether or not those things actually exist.

577
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:45,100
 Now could you imagine the impact if a drug cartel just nuked another group of drug dealers?

578
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:51,900
 Like out in the middle of this village in South America, a small tactical, very small

579
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,620
 tactical nuke goes off, clears 15 miles of foliage.

580
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
 Everyone's dead.

581
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,540
 They would send, now you could say, "Well Jason, they may have those, but they don't

582
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
 want to use it."

583
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,580
 There's been debate over whether or not a suitcase nuke's whether or not they actually

584
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,980
 exist or it's just Tom Clancy nonsense.

585
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,660
 But you have unlimited funds.

586
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,060
 I remember reading that book Monster, the autobiography of an LA street gangster.

587
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
 It's a really good book.

588
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,340
 I'm trying to remember, it was an autobiography this guy wrote in prison.

589
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,500
 And he was one of the original Crips.

590
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,940
 And he tells his story at one point, one of his friends from the Navy gets an experimental

591
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:34,820
 flare gun or something like that that he stole and he gave it to Monster.

592
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,900
 But he used it to shoot someone, light them on fire at like LA's county fair or something

593
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
 like that.

594
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,580
 And then when in the 80, because it takes place in the beginning of the LA, like before

595
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,060
 the bloods were around the Crips and there was all these, it's really, really interesting

596
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
 book.

597
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,220
 It was before the bloods were around.

598
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,460
 I think the blood showed up at the end of the book.

599
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,740
 Anyways, he's this big level drug dealer and he's buying these weapons.

600
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:01,260
 He goes, "First we use to break into people's houses and get revolvers and rifles.

601
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,220
 And then we got so much money we started ordering crates of AK-47s."

602
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,660
 Like it was no longer, a lot of gun control laws are written because of stuff that happened

603
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,460
 in the 70s and 80s where you'd have a gun, your gun would get stolen and it would be

604
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,340
 used in a robbery.

605
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,180
 Then people just started ordering the weapons straight from Russia or straight from Vietnam

606
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,060
 or straight from the Middle East.

607
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,940
 This LA street gangster, this guy, I think he was like 24, 25 at the time, this guy shows

608
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,580
 up with these crates of AK-47s and he's like, "Yeah, sure, here's the cash."

609
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,020
 And the guy goes, "Hey, you know, while I'm here, would you like this grenade launcher?"

610
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:39,820
 The guy looks at me and goes, "What am I going to do in LA with a grenade launcher?"

611
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,340
 But nowadays, I'm sure a lot of people would go, "Oh yeah, yeah, totally dude.

612
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,740
 How much extra for the grenade launcher?

613
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,980
 Do you get that awesome bandolero?

614
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,860
 Do I get that awesome strap around my chest like Chewbacca that has grenades in it?"

615
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,420
 Yeah, sure, I'll take two of those.

616
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
 That would be awesome.

617
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,660
 The stuff's available.

618
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,980
 The technology's available.

619
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,100
 The scientists are available.

620
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,420
 People who need money, mad scientists, people who need money to fund their work.

621
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,100
 They could go, "I'm going to create this half human half wolf."

622
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,300
 And America would go, "What?

623
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
 That's insane."

624
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
 And they're like, "Oh, he's onto us."

625
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,060
 And they have their black book project doing that.

626
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,620
 It goes to Russia, they're doing it, and you go to a crime cartel and say, "I can create

627
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,540
 a soldier for you right now that has the ability to jump nine feet."

628
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
 And howl.

629
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,540
 They're like, "What?

630
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
 That's nothing?"

631
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,980
 And they're like, "Oh, but it'll also psychologically scare people so your drug patrols can go through

632
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,220
 areas and stuff like that."

633
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,300
 Oh, yeah, that's pretty spooky.

634
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
 That would work.

635
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
 It'd keep people away.

636
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:40,100
 Or, best case scenario, not best case scenario for humanity, but for the cartel, we can create

637
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,700
 a monster that when you're in the middle of one of these wars, one of these drug wars

638
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,220
 between you and another cartel, and you're shooting it out, all of a sudden out of nowhere,

639
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,340
 some lithe, furry creature just kind of sprints out of your ranks and then jumps in the air

640
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,540
 and lands on a rival cartel member and begins ripping them to pieces.

641
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,420
 And then just the shock of that will give you the upper hand, everything like that.

642
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,700
 So I think it's possible.

643
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
 I think it's possible.

644
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,460
 Again, for it to be possible, we have to accept that any of this can actually happen, that

645
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,940
 you can just create superhumans and you can do genetic engineering and you can fuse man

646
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,860
 and beast and all this stuff.

647
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,540
 None of that stuff is proven by science at all.

648
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
 Right?

649
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,540
 Stalin did try making women bang gorillas.

650
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
 It didn't work.

651
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,540
 It might have actually, it's funny because he probably could have went the other way

652
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,460
 and had dudes bang monkeys and it'd probably be a lot less like violent, but it probably

653
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,140
 still wouldn't work.

654
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,580
 It wouldn't be less violent for the monkey.

655
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,580
 But you know what I mean?

656
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,500
 Like, having a woman getting banged, I don't have to go into details.

657
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,660
 The point is, is that it didn't work.

658
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
 It didn't work.

659
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,980
 And as far as we know, it doesn't work.

660
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:54,380
 We've done experiments with men and hamsters though, humans and hamsters.

661
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,060
 And it does look like that might work.

662
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,660
 So it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.

663
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,540
 A shaman creating a spell and having like a magical creature jump up and start, you know,

664
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
 running drugs for you.

665
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
 That's far more farfetched.

666
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,580
 We don't see any proof of that.

667
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,020
 But again, there could, you could have 99 shamans out there that are frauds that are just ripping

668
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,500
 off the cartel.

669
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,980
 And then you have one real one out there who actually knows what they're doing.

670
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:24,380
 But this story isn't all speculation because of course, I, what happened was I read this

671
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,100
 story about the werewolf and then I popped in my mind and go, that would be interesting

672
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,900
 if the cartels were actually working on that.

673
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,900
 Cartels do actually, this is one, this is where I got the article from nature.com and

674
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,900
 the one from K-Ron.

675
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,500
 The cartels are actually having a big impact on the world of science.

676
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 This is weird.

677
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
 It kind of makes sense.

678
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,660
 It's just kind of sad overall.

679
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,580
 The large millimeter telescope, it's in Puebla State in Mexico.

680
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,220
 It's been abandoned.

681
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,780
 It's a giant telescope that's used to study supernovas, the creation of the cosmos.

682
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,820
 They've had to shut it down because cartels are, they diversify stuff.

683
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
 It's not all drugs.

684
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,340
 They're doing tons of fuel theft, fuel smuggling.

685
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,980
 There's a massive fuel pipeline that goes by this volcano that's in the middle of nowhere,

686
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,740
 which is why they built this observatory in the middle of nowhere.

687
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,980
 No light pollution, cartels are showing up, breaking into the pipeline, stealing the fuel.

688
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,180
 One of the workers at the telescope got a car jacked near the worksite and the government

689
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
 shut it down.

690
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
 It's just not safe.

691
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
 You're in the middle of nowhere.

692
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,500
 We got these cartels running around.

693
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,700
 There was a group of scientists studying endangered parrot called like a militant macaw, which

694
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,500
 if that's not the name of a wrapper right now, it should be.

695
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,780
 Or M&M maybe?

696
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
 Militant macaw.

697
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:51,500
 But anyways, these scientists were studying militant macaws out in the middle of nowhere.

698
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,700
 Cartels are like, "Hey, we need to move stuff through that area."

699
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,020
 But there's a bunch of like people watching.

700
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,940
 People with monoculars in the bushes looking up at trees.

701
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,860
 Even though this is a Scooby-Doo cartoon, we can't doot, doot, doot, like sneak around

702
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
 behind them.

703
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,860
 So they started sending death threats to the scientists.

704
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,500
 Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.

705
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,500
 It was ended.

706
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,700
 The study was ended so people can't study these parrots anymore.

707
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,580
 You had agricultural scientists working with indigenous people in Mexico, showing them

708
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,940
 how to make their crops better, treatment of the soil, stuff like that.

709
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,180
 Trying to help give them a better life.

710
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,740
 One of them, these one was kind of the reverse.

711
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,820
 The military showed up and began harassing them, thinking they were cartel members.

712
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,740
 And one of the people almost got dragged off to prison.

713
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,780
 So they were like, "We're done."

714
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,020
 That's scary too, right?

715
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
 That's scary too, right?

716
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,700
 You don't want to get falsely accused and just kind of disappear into the justices.

717
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,700
 So that stopped as well.

718
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,820
 It's having a real effect on scientific exploration in the country of Mexico.

719
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,940
 And that's not even the most tragic part.

720
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:07,420
 Now, like I said, a lot of these drug cartels, it's all about bottom line.

721
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:13,700
 So morals are secondary to them getting their profits.

722
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,060
 Tijuana, Mexico, there's two journalists.

723
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:23,140
 There's Manuel Alea and photographer Jo Beth Terriquez.

724
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
 They did this investigation.

725
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,860
 Finding homeless people just dead in the street.

726
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,540
 Heroin overdose.

727
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,700
 Heroin overdose because there was fentanyl mixed in with the heroin.

728
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,460
 And that's pretty popular nowadays.

729
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,140
 What happens is they'll take the fentanyl and make the fentanyls cheaper to produce

730
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,700
 and it makes the already existing heroin far more powerful.

731
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,100
 So they're addicted to your particular brand.

732
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
 Very dangerous.

733
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,420
 I found this out recently because I was going to that subreddit for opiates.

734
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,940
 I guess this is a problem.

735
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:59,220
 People are pressing their own pills like Xanax or pain pills, hydrocodone or whatever.

736
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,700
 They're pressing these pills and they'll use a little bit of actual Vicodin dust, whatever

737
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:11,340
 the actual stuff is, oxy stuff, and then put fentanyl in it.

738
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,220
 And so this stuff, it's imprecise.

739
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,420
 You just have a bunch of powder there and you kind of like mix it up.

740
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,100
 You put some of the real stuff in and then some of the fentanyl stuff in and you mix

741
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,980
 it up and then you're pressing these pills.

742
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,820
 You may end up getting a pill of pure fentanyl, which will kill you.

743
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,500
 Or you may get a pill that has more of the Vicodin stuff in it.

744
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,260
 And it was interesting because I was on that subreddit for the opiates and the one guy

745
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,140
 was talking about, "I got these pills and they're pressed."

746
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,140
 So homemade.

747
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,780
 And I'm going to crush them up and snort them.

748
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,260
 And someone goes, "That's how people die."

749
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,100
 I guess that's how Lil Peep died.

750
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,420
 He was a rapper.

751
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,260
 They did with Xanax though.

752
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,260
 They'll press Xanax bars with fentanyl in them.

753
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:00,540
 And you may break it up in just the right way that you get a line of just pure fentanyl.

754
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
 Kill you.

755
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,540
 It's absolutely nuts that people are even chancing that.

756
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,420
 And they hope that it has a little bit of fentanyl in it because it's stronger.

757
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,380
 But anyways, they're finding these dead homeless people in Tijuana overdose heroin and fentanyl.

758
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:22,580
 And they're also laboratories on the Tijuana River, inside like the Nooks and Crannies River,

759
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,460
 where they're making fentanyl and they're producing this stuff.

760
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:33,460
 And the going theory that the journalist put forward is that what happens is, if the batch

761
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,540
 is too strong, it'll kill you.

762
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,900
 And you don't want your customers to die.

763
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,140
 But you don't want to make it too weak either, because then they'll just buy from another

764
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,020
 dealer.

765
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,820
 So what the cartel is doing, again, allegedly, and this is being put forth by this journalist,

766
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,100
 is that they're making batches of this and then giving it out to free to the homeless

767
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,540
 people to test it.

768
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,020
 And they keep track.

769
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,900
 This guy got batch number 105.

770
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,060
 Here you go, sir.

771
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,580
 Enjoy.

772
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,340
 This guy got batch 106.

773
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,820
 Here you go, sir.

774
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,300
 Enjoy.

775
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,540
 This guy got that.

776
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:18,220
 And so the next day when they come back through, guy who took 105, "Oh yeah, man, it was so

777
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
 good, dude.

778
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,220
 I haven't been that high in so long.

779
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,540
 Oh, it felt so good."

780
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,100
 106, dead.

781
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,100
 Okay, reformulate.

782
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,660
 106, go on to the next guy.

783
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:40,180
 They're basically running lab experiments on homeless drug users in Tijuana.

784
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,820
 So they may not be creating beasts of the netherworld.

785
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,660
 They may not be creating genetic super soldiers.

786
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,260
 But organized crime is having an impact on the world of science.

787
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,700
 Whether it's shutting down observatories, running out agricultural specialists, or any

788
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:05,100
 other examples of the cartel interfering with research work.

789
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,260
 That is definitely happening.

790
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:14,620
 But they're also running human tests to see if they can turn their deadly product a little

791
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,380
 less deadly for maximum profit.

792
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:26,180
 Sometimes the real monster isn't the one you hear in the darkness that's unseen.

793
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:33,220
 Sometimes the real monster is the one holding out a little baggy with a smile on his face

794
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,420
 saying here, "This will make the pain go away."

795
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:44,580
 And then waiting to see what really happens.

796
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,220
