1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
 A terrifying encounter with part of a ghost.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:12,100
 A spectral spirit warns a young woman of an upcoming tragedy.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,300
 And then we are going to travel to the deserts of the Southwest United States.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,760
 It may seem like an odd choice, but if you want to see Bigfoot, that's really where you

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,360
 need to go today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:34,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,520
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,120
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're not going to be chit-chatting too much here.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,240
 Actually, we're not going to be chit-chatting at all.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
 We're done with the intro.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,720
 Let's go ahead and jump into the first story.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,560
 Now, the first story is really short, but it's super creepy.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,120
 And there's a hotel that is listed as being haunted, and it only has one sighting.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,000
 But the sighting is so creepy that that's all you need.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,640
 We're going to Arizona.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,800
 Aren't we just in Arizona?

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:15,240
 Oh yeah, the big skeleton dude and the phantasma Colorado, the camel one.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,800
 In Arizona, there's a hotel called the Lost Trail Hotel.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,120
 In 1976, the year I was born, actually.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
 Pretty awesome.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,280
 I'm a little baby during this story.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,640
 I'm just like a newborn baby.

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,280
 I'm like, "Ummmmmm."

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,040
 The whole story, I just want you to imagine me crying and pooping my pants, or my diaper.

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,680
 So anyways, that aside, we're in the Lost Trail Hotel.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
 The year is 1976.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,360
 Hey wait, that was the year I was born.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
 I was just joking.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:49,360
 Okay, so 1976, there's a couple sleeping at the Lost Trail Hotel, and they hear a "Ahhhh!"

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,720
 Just a scream.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,880
 That hurt my throat.

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,020
 They heard this screaming in the hallway, and they're like, "What the hell is that?"

35
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,120
 So they hop out of bed, they open the door, and when they look down the hallway, they

36
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,880
 see a severed woman's head just floating, floating in the middle of the hallway.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,600
 Long black hair, bright red lips, eyes full of pain and fear, and an open mouth.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,840
 "Ahhhh!"

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,880
 And they're watching, they're just looking at this dumbfounded, and the head slowly begins

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:34,680
 to fade away, and as it's fading away, "Ahhhh!"

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,040
 That is terrifying.

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,560
 That is the only ghost, again, ghost walking around in the middle, you know, walking around

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,400
 in the middle of the night, that doesn't scare me.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,720
 A severed human head screaming in pain just floating there, even if it's laying on the

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 ground.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
 It could be sitting in front of the television on the couch screaming in pain.

47
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,680
 It's so terrifying, because then you start thinking, they don't know where the head came

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,320
 from, they don't know who it was or anything like that.

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,780
 What happened to this person?

50
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,720
 What is happening to this person now?

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,480
 Are they stuck in some sort of hellish landscape where they're just a screaming head for eternity?

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,800
 Is that a comic book or the name of a band or something like that?

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,480
 But it's just horrifying, and it doesn't specifically, there's two ways you can picture it.

54
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,320
 You can picture it as a, if someone was wearing like a green screen suit and everything was

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,200
 chroma keyed out so you just see like a head floating there, or most likely there was like

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,680
 guts hanging out from the bottom of this head.

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,760
 But whoever this was, whatever this is for eternity is just a screaming head.

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,120
 I bet you that it's some horrible soul trapped in the hell dimension.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,080
 And Satan's like, dude, you know what?

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,040
 You just give me, dude, just give me five minutes of peace.

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,400
 It's been screaming for like 80 years down there, and he's like, oh my God, I'm going

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
 to lose my mind.

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,760
 So he's just like, that's it.

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
 Here you go, throws it up into earth.

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,880
 And it's like, oh, and Satan's like, oh my God, five minutes of peace.

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,280
 And then he hears it start and rematerialize, and he's like, I hate my job.

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
 It sucks.

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,840
 You know how hard it is to run a marketing firm when there's a screaming head next to

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
 you?

70
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,200
 Anyway, so I thought that story was worth covering.

71
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
 I find it absolutely terrifying.

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,320
 The next story we're going to talk about is an interesting one, and it actually is going

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
 to lead into a story we do tomorrow.

74
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 But it's a complete story.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,000
 I don't like doing two parters, but it's just kind of a lead in.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,920
 We're in Southern California, and there is a house known as the Harlow House.

77
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,400
 And it's known that because Jean Harlow used to live there with her husband, Paul Byrne.

78
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 Some of you are already like, oh, I know what this story is.

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,360
 So Jean Harlow lived there with Paul Byrne.

80
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,920
 And you know, they had a weird relationship where they loved each other, but he was also

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,040
 super abusive.

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,800
 He was small and there was rumors that he was impotent.

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,840
 And Jean Harlow was like this bombshell movie star.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,840
 Apparently he felt inadequate, but it was this very, very stormy relationship.

85
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
 He beat her a lot.

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,240
 He ended up eventually from punching her so much he caused her kidneys to fail.

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
 That's what eventually killed her.

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,180
 But before she died, he ended up shooting himself.

89
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,800
 And she was totally like heartbroken.

90
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
 She tried killing herself and all this stuff.

91
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,640
 He killed himself in his house.

92
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,240
 Now we're going to fast forward a few years where a new homeowner bought the house.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
 And you know, this is down in Southern California.

94
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,560
 It's basically around Hollywood, very, very posh area.

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
 New guy buys the house and he has a young friend.

96
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,800
 They used to date, but they're not dating anymore, this young woman.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,320
 She's like, dude was out of town and the new owner was out of town and she's like, hey,

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,720
 can I spend the night there?

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
 You know?

100
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
 And the dude's like, yeah, yeah, you know, I'm in New York for the weekend.

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
 Go ahead, stay there.

102
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,040
 So she goes into the house and she's sleeping.

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,360
 And in the middle of the night, she's woken up.

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,080
 She doesn't know why, but she just like wakes up at the start and she sees in her bedroom

105
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,720
 a short ghost and she recognizes him immediately.

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,360
 She recognizes it as the ghost of Paul Byrne because she also works in Hollywood and he

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,480
 was a big agent and she knew that this was previously his house and he's now running

108
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,800
 around in the bedroom, just frantically like bumping into stuff, opening stuff, just like

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,360
 running around her bed.

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,120
 She's flipping out.

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,520
 She jumps out of bed, dodges him, steps over him, goes out of the bedroom and she's on

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
 the second story.

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,020
 I guess I should have mentioned that earlier.

114
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,320
 She's on the second story and you have to go down these stairs to get to the bottom,

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,080
 which is how does normally work?

116
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
 But at the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrible sight.

117
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:40,720
 She sees a body tied to the bottom banister and she can't tell if it's her or the home

118
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,080
 owner in New York.

119
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
 She knows it's one of them.

120
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 In her mind, she's looking at it and she knows it's one of them and she's thinking, "I have

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
 to be dreaming."

122
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,640
 Like, that might be me and I'm here, but she has an emotional connection to that body.

123
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,520
 And it is a body because it's not just someone tied to a banister.

124
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,880
 It's someone tied to a banister.

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,160
 Their throat is slit wide open.

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,120
 They're just drenched in blood.

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,520
 But she has to walk down the stairs because little dude is still banging into stuff in

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
 the bedroom.

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
 She's terrified.

130
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,640
 She walks down the stairs, past the body, just slumped over and she still can't see

131
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,080
 its face or doesn't want to see its face.

132
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,920
 But she still knows it's either her or the home owner.

133
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
 She's like, "I need a drink."

134
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,280
 But she hadn't really been in the house before.

135
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,080
 She couldn't find the bar.

136
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,880
 This is a true story, by the way.

137
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
 She couldn't find the bar.

138
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,640
 She has something in her head tell her, look by the bookcase.

139
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,320
 She goes to the bookcase and there was a hidden bar, like a little private bar behind the

140
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
 bookcase.

141
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
 It moved over like straight James Bond style.

142
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,160
 And she makes herself a drink.

143
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,400
 Now, as she starts to make herself drinks, she still hears the noise upstairs of whatever

144
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 the little ghost dude bumping into stuff and she can still sense that body still on that

145
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
 banister.

146
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
 She's like, "I'm straight up dreaming.

147
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,800
 I'm just going to drink until I pass out."

148
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,120
 As she's drinking, she's looking around and she sees this gaudy wallpaper and she starts

149
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
 peeling at it.

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,040
 And this is like by the bar, she starts peeling at it.

151
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,560
 And she's just kind of like trying to keep her mind thinking of anything else other than

152
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
 the whore that's going on around her.

153
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,320
 She eventually drinks herself to sleep.

154
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,720
 She wakes up the next morning and there's no body tied to the banister.

155
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 The house is quiet.

156
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,800
 And she's like, "Well, it just, I don't know what happened."

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
 And she's like, "I must have just been dreaming.

158
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
 Like I must have been sleepwalking or something."

159
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,880
 And then, but she wasn't dreaming because when the homeowner came back, he was like,

160
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,000
 "Hey, who was in my bar?

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,200
 Who was peeling at this wallpaper?"

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,040
 And she's like, "I got to tell you this story.

163
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,880
 I got to tell you the story of what happened."

164
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,840
 Now she, this woman told this, she was really into the paranormal.

165
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,200
 And she started telling the story around town.

166
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,800
 There's multiple witnesses that she told this story to.

167
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,440
 When the homeowner came back and he's like, "Yo, what happened?"

168
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
 She told him about the dream.

169
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,840
 Now the homeowner was Jay Sebring and her name was Sharon Tate.

170
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,960
 And three years later, they were both murdered a mile away by the Manson family.

171
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,680
 And the story has always gone like this.

172
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,080
 Was that a premonition of her own violent death?

173
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,160
 When she would tell the story, she would say, "I don't know who the body was at the bottom

174
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
 of the stairs.

175
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,240
 I felt like it was either me or Jay."

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
 She would tell the story around town.

177
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,320
 There's multiple accounts of the story being told.

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,200
 And three years later, they were lashed together as the Manson family were killing them.

179
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
 They were tied together.

180
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
 Very, very interesting story.

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,960
 The idea is that Paul, he beat his wife, but he also loved her.

182
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,400
 He just had these horrible issues.

183
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:36,320
 The theory is that Paul was a loving person, but he just had inadequacy issues and he took

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
 him out on his wife.

185
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,760
 And he was trying to warn Sharon Tate of the danger that was coming.

186
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 That's why he woke her up that night.

187
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
 But who knows?

188
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
 The first thing is like, did she make up the story?

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,960
 Did she somehow make up a story that kind of foretold her own death?

190
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,120
 Did it really happen?

191
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
 And she actually told it to people?

192
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
 Or did people just make it up on their own?

193
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
 When I said it was a true story, it is a story that is circulated through Hollywood.

194
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
 People have told the story.

195
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,360
 I personally believe it.

196
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,440
 I think that that's possible to have a premonition like that.

197
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,400
 That's a quite horrifying one.

198
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
 But yeah.

199
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,200
 I think the most interesting part is that she couldn't identify the body, but she had

200
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
 a feeling it was either her or Jay Sebring.

201
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,360
 And it was more of just an essence, an emotional essence of a dead body rather than seeing Jay

202
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,520
 Sebring like, "ugh."

203
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,000
 I think that would have been less creepy rather than just seeing almost like a soul dead.

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,160
 And she knew it was a soul belonging to her or her ex-boyfriend, the person she had a

205
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
 close emotional connection to.

206
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,920
 Very, very creepy story.

207
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,520
 And that ties into a story we're going to do tomorrow as well.

208
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,440
 We're going to do a little paranormal story about the Manson family.

209
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,920
 Very, very interesting one that I've been looking into for quite a while.

210
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,840
 But let's go ahead and move on to our main story today.

211
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,520
 Now, I said in the intro, generally Bigfoot is known to be a forest creature.

212
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:58,000
 You have like the Yeti up in Canada and you have the, no sorry, you have the Yeti in like

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,560
 the Himalayas and you have the Windigo, which is more of like a ghost type of thing.

214
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
 You can, a human can become a Windigo.

215
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,600
 It's more like a curse, but that's like in Canada.

216
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,480
 So Bigfoot's are generally known in California, Oregon, Washington.

217
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,520
 And then you have like Swamp Bigfoot type creatures down south and then you have some

218
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,920
 other Bigfoot type creatures in Montana.

219
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,200
 But it's funny because some of the biggest Bigfoot sightings by hundreds of people at

220
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
 a single time have been in the desert.

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 So it makes you think like if Bigfoot exists, are there different subspecies that are acclimated

222
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 to different climates?

223
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
 Oh, I bet you guys are impressed.

224
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
 I said that word correctly.

225
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,360
 And I used it correctly as well.

226
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,080
 In the 1950s in Fontana, California, they built this huge raceway.

227
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,600
 It's just all flat land.

228
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
 You can drive as fast as you want.

229
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 There's no cops.

230
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,840
 Not like there's cops in NASCAR.

231
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,640
 They're like Tony Stewart would have won the race if he didn't get pulled over on the

232
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
 third lap.

233
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,000
 Anyways, they built this huge raceway out there.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,840
 Now people would go to see the race.

235
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
 That's not true.

236
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,600
 They'd go to see Cars Crash.

237
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,960
 I used to be a big NASCAR fan, but I just don't have time to watch sports anymore.

238
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
 They'd go to watch the race.

239
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,640
 So it was basically just like this big, flat raceway.

240
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,840
 I think, yeah, well, yeah, I would have been flat.

241
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,760
 They don't have hills and like loop-de-loops.

242
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,240
 It's not a Hot Wheels track.

243
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,120
 But anyways, so the people would be out there to watch the races and they would see Bigfoot.

244
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
 Bigfoot just walk on by.

245
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,520
 Now it would be off in the distance.

246
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,040
 It wouldn't be like at the concession stand.

247
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,440
 One popcorn please.

248
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,200
 They're like, sir, how are you going to pay for this?

249
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,920
 It pays for them for like goat pelts.

250
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,840
 They'd seem like walking in the distance, but you would have 50, 100 people sitting

251
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,040
 there watching a...

252
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,040
 And then just in the distance, you just see Bigfoot walk by.

253
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,840
 And it was so common in the area they nicknamed it the Speedway Monster, which is a badass

254
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
 name.

255
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 That's way better than Bigfoot.

256
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
 Speedway Monster.

257
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,960
 I'm sure there should be at least 10 bands named that at least.

258
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,880
 There should be a governor named that, Governor Speedway Monster.

259
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,320
 So anyways, you'd see the Bigfoot guy just walk in the distance and it happened fairly

260
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
 regularly.

261
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,560
 Now, of course you're going to say how come no one took a picture of it.

262
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
 I don't know.

263
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
 I don't know.

264
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
 That's a good question.

265
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,720
 In the same area in 1952, these stories all interestingly involved very aggressive Bigfoot.

266
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,960
 They're not just kind of like walking lazily through the woods all blurry.

267
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
 That's a joke.

268
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
 That actually stole that joke from a comedian.

269
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,760
 I don't remember his name.

270
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,080
 He's a really funny comedian.

271
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,520
 But anyway, so they don't normally just walk through the woods and stuff like that.

272
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,320
 These ones are quite aggressive.

273
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,960
 So in 1956, this boy's walking home.

274
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
 This is creepy.

275
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,480
 These are all actually all these stories are creepy.

276
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,520
 These are creepier than the normal Bigfoot stories.

277
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,240
 And that's why I picked them because I don't just like talking about stuff that's just

278
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
 kind of lame.

279
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,360
 The boy's walking home just has like his little fishing pole on.

280
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
 It's 1956.

281
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,480
 So he has his fishing pole on his back, a little tackle box.

282
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,640
 All of a sudden, huge hairy arms reach out of the bushes and grab onto him and try to

283
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,960
 pull him into the foliage.

284
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,320
 And the boy gets away and runs home and goes, "Mom, mom!

285
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,360
 Giant hairy man tried to pull me into the bushes!"

286
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
 And the mom's like, "That's weird.

287
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,840
 Your uncle Jimmy's at work."

288
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,000
 But that story is creepy because the idea of a creature, like what was it going to do

289
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 to the kid?

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Eat him?

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,080
 Like sell him into like Bigfoot slavery?

292
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
 We don't know.

293
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,720
 What's interesting, what I kind of think about that is how did this boy get away from a Bigfoot?

294
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
 They're these massive creatures.

295
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,560
 And how does a Bigfoot hide in a bush?

296
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,200
 I mean, if maybe it was like an eight foot hedge, he might have a chance.

297
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,280
 That would actually explain why the Bigfoot wasn't able to pull the kid in because the

298
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,480
 kid kept like hitting the thick branches of the bush.

299
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,320
 Bigfoot's like, "Can't get him.

300
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 Angle him right."

301
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
 And the boy's like, "Get away.

302
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 Get away."

303
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
 And he runs away.

304
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
 "Uncle Jimmy, mommy told you to stop that!"

305
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,560
 So anyways, now, oh, and that same year, these are all reported in local newspaper.

306
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,200
 Same year, a girl was sitting in her car in the middle of nowhere.

307
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,320
 Yeah, right.

308
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,160
 I think she was probably doing something else, but she's apparently innocently sitting in

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,800
 her car in the middle of nowhere.

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,400
 This creature smashed through her driver's side window and tried to pull her out and

311
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,920
 she gassed it and took off.

312
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,000
 The creature's like shaking its hand in the air, "Get you next time!"

313
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,200
 Now, again, I mean, maybe these big feet have less upper body strength, I don't know.

314
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,680
 But I think it probably should have really just like ripped your arm off of its socket.

315
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,800
 I'm glad it didn't.

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,280
 I'm just saying that.

317
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,320
 Those stories can kind of be taken with a grain of salt.

318
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,400
 The next story we have in that area in 1975, Boy Scouts just hanging out, doing Boy Scout

319
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,200
 stuff, cooking marshmallows in the middle of the night telling ghost stories.

320
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,440
 Bigfoot just walks through the middle of their camp and just trashes the place.

321
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,840
 You can imagine all these kids are like, "Isn't this fun?

322
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,280
 We're hanging around the middle of nowhere and we got all this chocolate and these marshmallows."

323
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,160
 I mean, just leave ways to the camp.

324
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,080
 Didn't kill any of the Boy Scouts.

325
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,280
 But I mean, that's just being a dick, dude.

326
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,680
 Like you could have went around their camp.

327
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,920
 Their camp wasn't three miles long.

328
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,920
 It was basically big enough to hold 12 young boys and you had to walk through the middle

329
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,320
 of it, tore everything up.

330
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,200
 But the boys ran back to town and said, "Hey, our camp got destroyed by a speedway monster."

331
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
 And the cops like that.

332
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,640
 It's such a badass name.

333
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,080
 He's like writing it down on the police report.

334
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,000
 He trials like a little car with like flames coming off of it.

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
 We're still in the Southwest.

336
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,040
 Now we're at the Borrego Badlands.

337
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,960
 Now this is a place that when it's very inhospitable, there's a bunch of like deep underground caves.

338
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,400
 There's a lot of canyons and crevices and things like that.

339
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,480
 And when Spanish missionaries came to the area, the natives in the area were like, "Hey,

340
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
 welcome.

341
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,040
 Like, you know, let's talk.

342
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
 Let's chat.

343
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
 We can do this stuff."

344
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,640
 Don't go to the river.

345
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,000
 The Spanish missionaries are like, "Why can't we go near the river?"

346
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,320
 And he's like, "Because there's a bunch of big feet down there and they'll totally mess

347
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
 you up.

348
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
 We don't even go there.

349
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 They're hairy devils is what we call them."

350
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,000
 And the Spanish dudes are like, "Okay, yeah, here."

351
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,080
 They're like, "We won't go down there."

352
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
 And they didn't.

353
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
 They didn't.

354
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,520
 They very wisely were like, "These people have been here for a while.

355
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,400
 They probably know something we don't."

356
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,160
 In 1876, though, as more Europeans started to pour into the area, gold, Russian, all that

357
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,120
 stuff, they did start going to the river.

358
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,320
 They're like, "Hey, you know, let's go get a drink of water."

359
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,080
 And the Native Americans like, "Single tear coming down their face."

360
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
 They're like, "No, don't do that."

361
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
 Prospectors are like, "Whatever.

362
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 I'm going down the river."

363
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,720
 Of course, people started disappearing.

364
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,320
 First sighting was in 1876, dudes walking to the river.

365
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
 And it's weird, actually.

366
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,960
 Maybe these guys do have something.

367
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,920
 He sees a creature, an inhuman creature with the face of a human, but a big hairy body

368
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
 staring at him from some bushes.

369
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:52,560
 It was Uncle Jimmy's ancestor in the bushes, and the creature's like, "No, I'm Bigfoot."

370
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
 Dude runs away.

371
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,120
 Okay, he didn't talk, obviously.

372
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,520
 So as civilization began to grow in that area, people started disappearing.

373
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,840
 People started dying, and their bodies being found horribly mutilated.

374
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,920
 And the Europeans, at this point, they would have been the Americans.

375
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,560
 They had heard the legends of the hairy devils, but they didn't believe them.

376
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,320
 But since people started dying or disappearing, the legends, people are like, "We better,

377
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,920
 like, there's something about this."

378
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,640
 People have said they've seen them hiding in the bushes.

379
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,360
 People have said, "Help me, help me, and die.

380
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
 We can't find them."

381
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,560
 So it was interesting, too, because one of these, and around this time, these two, this

382
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,680
 was in the local newspaper, these two men came across a giant creature who was just

383
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,720
 sitting on a rock.

384
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,640
 And they said, you know, a typical description, he had the face of a human, but the body

385
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,140
 of an ape.

386
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,200
 And they looked at him, and they didn't know what to think of it.

387
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
 And they begin to address him.

388
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,520
 First they try to talk to him in English, then they try talking to him in Spanish, and then

389
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,760
 they try talking to him in the native tongue in the area.

390
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,640
 Very learned prospectors.

391
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,360
 And the creature stands up and starts walking towards them, and at that point, they're like,

392
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
 "Okay, first contact is over."

393
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,520
 They pull their guns out, and he runs away.

394
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,880
 But because they're having these issues, and so they're, of course, report, "Hey, we saw

395
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,200
 one of these things, they're real, they're these giant creatures."

396
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,440
 People begin trying to hunt them and kill them, because they're putting two and two together.

397
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,760
 We moved in, we were warned to stay away from the river, we were warned about hairy devils,

398
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,640
 we're seeing them, and people are getting murdered.

399
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,040
 So people go to start trying to shoot these things.

400
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,200
 In 1888, these two guys, they're like, "Let's go kill it."

401
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,040
 Or all of them, we don't care, we're gonna go out there.

402
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,040
 Right up, I'm Rambo, you're the Terminator, and the other guy says, "What do those words

403
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,040
 even mean?"

404
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,880
 And the dude's like, "I don't know.

405
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
 Anyways, just go with it.

406
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,400
 Let's load up on bullets."

407
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,360
 And then he turns, and it goes, "I'll be back."

408
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,640
 And everyone in the saloon is totally silent.

409
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
 They're like, "We don't get the reference.

410
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
 It's 1888."

411
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,200
 He's like, "Whatever."

412
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,280
 He walks out.

413
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
 So they both walk out.

414
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,760
 Rambo and the Terminator walk out.

415
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,600
 And they come across one of these things, and they gave an interesting description.

416
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,320
 And they said, "Same thing, face and body like an ape."

417
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,320
 But they go, "The way that it climbed was pure ape."

418
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,520
 They said, "I mean, just it moved up there, watching it climb up a canyon, completely

419
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
 unhindered.

420
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,800
 Like, it grabbing on rocks, moving up as fast as a monkey can climb up a tree.

421
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,920
 They were completely flabbergasted."

422
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,280
 And so they shot it.

423
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,920
 They opened fire on the thing.

424
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
 They shot it.

425
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 They killed it.

426
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,000
 The body weighed 400 pounds.

427
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
 They dragged it back to town.

428
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,560
 One steals the body.

429
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,680
 So that story, you can say, "Well, that probably didn't happen."

430
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,800
 Or somebody could have stolen the body.

431
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,600
 Now there's always been that conspiracy that the Smithsonian Institute is hunting, or like,

432
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,040
 trying to find giant mummies and close up the vaults and stuff like that.

433
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,720
 And we'll cover that on a later episode.

434
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,960
 But there's always been this story that there's a part of the scientific community that actually

435
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,680
 goes out, goes, "Oh, Bigfoot sighting?

436
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,120
 Yeah, let me see what you got."

437
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,200
 And then they destroy the evidence for whatever reason.

438
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,760
 We'll cover that on a later episode.

439
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,440
 The last big sighting we have is in 1964, so it's been a while.

440
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,280
 They may have been sighted on and off, but this is the last one that I saw.

441
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,600
 A father and son were walking around in the area, and all of a sudden rocks started falling

442
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
 on them.

443
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 And they're like, "That's weird.

444
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
 This wasn't on the weather report."

445
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,400
 And there was a bigfoot, a hairy devil, just throwing rocks at them, and they ran away.

446
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,400
 So, I mean, maybe after the last one got shot, they're like, "Hey, maybe we're just not mutilating

447
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 people.

448
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 They're just going to keep hunting us down."

449
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
 They're just going to keep on hunting us down.

450
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

451
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

452
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

453
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

454
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

455
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

456
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

457
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

458
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

459
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

460
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

461
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

462
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

463
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

464
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

465
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

466
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

467
00:21:46,400 --> 00:22:06,400
 There's a 1970s, it's Edwards Air Force Base.

468
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 They're going to keep on hunting us down.

469
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,560
 Now you may see them during the day as well, but when you're looking over the desert with

470
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,400
 Night Vision goggles, it's really going to pop up.

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,960
 It's really going to show.

472
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,040
 There was reports that the creatures would walk up to the base.

473
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,360
 There were reports that the creatures would walk through the base and oddly enough, and

474
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,240
 they couldn't figure out how they were doing this, underneath Edwards Air Force Base they

475
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,120
 had maintenance tunnels.

476
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,160
 There were sightings of the Bigfoot creature in the maintenance tunnel.

477
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,400
 Now seeing a Bigfoot across a field would be terrifying.

478
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,880
 Seeing a Bigfoot in a bush would be horrifying, but I don't think anything that would be a

479
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,000
 creepier encounter than being in a building with a Bigfoot.

480
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,720
 Because there's nowhere to go.

481
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,120
 You're in a long tunnel with a creature who's tried is three times yours.

482
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,680
 He will catch you.

483
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,560
 But the Bigfoot would just walk away.

484
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,080
 When the enlisted men would report this to their commanding officer, the story goes.

485
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,160
 Now this could all be fake, this could all just be rumors, but the story goes is that

486
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,760
 these enlisted men would talk to their officers and say, "I'm seeing these weird things through

487
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
 these goggles."

488
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
 And I'm pretty sure that guy over there who's still pissing himself just saw one in the

489
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,400
 tunnels under the base.

490
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,120
 And the story goes, the officers would say, "Yeah, don't ever shoot him, don't ever harass

491
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
 him.

492
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
 This conversation is classified."

493
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,620
 And that's the end of it.

494
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,600
 I don't want to hear about it again.

495
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,120
 And the story goes that these creatures are actually picked up on the security monitors.

496
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,520
 Because they're around the base.

497
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,880
 They're on the perimeter of the base.

498
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,240
 They're under in the maintenance tunnels where of course they're going to have cameras.

499
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,840
 And seeing it walking through the middle of the base, they're all being picked up on cameras.

500
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,720
 All the footage is taken, shipped off somewhere, classified.

501
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,920
 Now, it just becomes something's classified.

502
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,960
 Once someone leaves the military and it's been like 15 years, they may tell the story

503
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
 and stuff like that.

504
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
 They can still get in trouble for it.

505
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,900
 But it doesn't necessarily mean the story's never going to get out there.

506
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,340
 Is that story true?

507
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,060
 I don't know.

508
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,940
 Now if that story is true, if there are military videotapes of bigfoot creatures moving around

509
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,980
 their bases, that would be the best evidence that bigfoot ever existed.

510
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,820
 Because you'd have it come from a place where they're not, it's not like from a 7-Eleven

511
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,300
 where some teenagers like messing with the video cameras and telling his friend to like

512
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,820
 walk around in a monkey suit outside.

513
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,080
 These are military security cameras.

514
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,600
 They're not going to run them through a video editing program.

515
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,240
 But if we have a group that comes in and goes, "Hey, nice bigfoot body.

516
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,560
 Hey, nice bigfoot hair.

517
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,760
 Oh, you got those prints.

518
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,360
 Let's take them to the lab and see what it is."

519
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,520
 And then they just send back dog hair and say, "It's just dog hair."

520
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,360
 If that group exists within the US government, is that where those tapes are being sent?

521
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:48,700
 Or somewhere to keep the truth of a separate species from the rest of humanity?

522
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 Okay.

523
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,700
 Thanks.

524
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:50,700
 Bye.

525
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,280
 (upbeat music)
