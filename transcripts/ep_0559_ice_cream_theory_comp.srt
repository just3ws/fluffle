1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 A bizarre crime wave strikes a small town in Africa.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,700
 And then we travel back to the conspiracy theory iceberg to take a look at the mystery

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,980
 of why McDonald's ice cream machines aren't working.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,580
 But while people were investigating that rather benign conspiracy theory, they may have uncovered

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,340
 something far more mysterious.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,900
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:33,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,460
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,460
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,860
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,020
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,820
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna roll right into this little rolly bullies.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,660
 So apparently that's the only thing that rolls.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,340
 First off, let's roll in our newest Patreon supporter, Spiced.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,340
 Everyone give a round of applause to Spiced.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,180
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,180
 Really really helps out a lot.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,500
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

19
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,380
 Just help spread the word about the show.

20
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,060
 That also helps a lot.

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,820
 So Spiced, let's go ahead and put you in a little Captain suit.

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,820
 Little cute little Captain suit.

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
 It's like Donald Duck.

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
 There's no pants.

25
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,180
 It's just like a sailor shirt with a top and a little hat.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,700
 So anyways, we're all hopping in the Dead Rabbit Robo.

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,100
 You're gonna be our Captain Spiced.

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,020
 We are rolling out from America all the way to Nigeria.

29
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,100
 Put your back into it.

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,100
 I can't row.

31
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,700
 I actually injured my back really badly this weekend.

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,980
 Barely holding on.

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,500
 But I do have a daily podcast to put out so I can't nap all day long.

34
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,940
 So I'm just laying back.

35
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,340
 You guys are rowing me around.

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,380
 Hopefully my back feels better.

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,300
 But for now I'm in a lot of pain.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,300
 So anyways, eventually we do get to Nigeria.

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:50,340
 Eventually we're headed to the Dado region that's in Benu State, Nigeria.

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
 So we get there.

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,460
 There's a bunch of people kind of milling about.

42
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,460
 We notice as we're walking through the city it's mostly women.

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,820
 We're like, that's kind of hot.

44
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,860
 I mean, not that women are odd in and of themselves.

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,980
 But the fact is most cities have an even split, right?

46
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,260
 Unless you're in Antarctica or Alaska, you know.

47
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,260
 Turn your head to the left.

48
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,660
 You see a woman turn your head to the right.

49
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,940
 You see a man, I don't have to explain demographics to you.

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,340
 This is not a demographics or statistics podcast.

51
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,620
 But anyways, we notice that it's a lot of women walking around.

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,620
 I don't know, this is interesting.

53
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,420
 But then we soon solve the mystery.

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,580
 Because we look at the clock and a calendar at the same time.

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,900
 We look at a calendar.

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,380
 We notice it's that time of the year.

57
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
 It's that time of the year.

58
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,220
 That's why all the men are sequestered at home.

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,860
 They're guarding something very, very precious.

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,940
 I found this website called pulse.com.gh for Ghana.

61
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,420
 It's an African news website.

62
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,900
 And I don't remember, I was researching something else and I stumbled across this website.

63
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,700
 And it is a news website in the sense like, I think the headline right now is about African

64
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,220
 government leaders congratulating Joe Biden and world events stuff.

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
 Stuff like that.

66
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,460
 It's just like, here's the stuff that's going on in the world.

67
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:13,140
 And then maybe like the next story down, you have this story.

68
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,380
 Angry youths burned down pastors buildings.

69
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,580
 That's unfortunate.

70
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,380
 Because seven men can't find their penises.

71
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,180
 Now we've covered penis theft before.

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,380
 We've covered it on the show before.

73
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,540
 It's one of those topics that is not super rare.

74
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,660
 There was some funny, that wasn't funny actually.

75
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,420
 I got brutally murdered or beaten up because someone else thought that they were standing

76
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,140
 around in the group and then the guy looked down and his penis was missing.

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,420
 So he beat up this other guy.

78
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,900
 He accused him of stealing his penis, which listen, I don't know if penis theft is real,

79
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,540
 but if you can steal it in broad daylight in a group of people, you deserve a medal.

80
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,980
 Like he didn't deserve getting beaten up for that.

81
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,660
 Covered it before though.

82
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,660
 And this story, this website is awesome.

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,020
 I love this website.

84
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,700
 This story starts off apparent now.

85
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,780
 Again, I thought it was a thing obviously.

86
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
 I don't know if it's real.

87
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,460
 We'll get into that in a second.

88
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,460
 You're like, Jason, of course it's not real.

89
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,580
 Hold on, hold on.

90
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,740
 But I do love the way this article started off.

91
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,980
 The very first sentence of this.

92
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,260
 This is a news website.

93
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,020
 This was the first line of this article.

94
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:25,220
 As Christmas approaches, the annual stories of people's penises disappearing mysteriously.

95
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,740
 As opposed to those ones that disappear and they know the answer.

96
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,940
 They're like, there's no mystery, sir.

97
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,700
 The annual stories of people's penises disappearing mysteriously in Africa have started emerging.

98
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,580
 So is this an annual thing?

99
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,460
 I thought these were like one-off things.

100
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,020
 You're hanging out with a group of guys.

101
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,220
 You don't know two of them.

102
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,420
 Someone in your friends group is missing a penis.

103
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,820
 Like that's just a weird one-off coincidence.

104
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,060
 And I know these stories have popped up.

105
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,500
 I didn't know it was an annual tradition.

106
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 As the leaves start to turn yellow, everyone's like, uh-oh.

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,340
 Who's losing their penis this year?

108
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,260
 And I was like, oh, not me, not me.

109
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,380
 A pair of eyes.

110
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,580
 Let me finish this story before I analyze it real quick.

111
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,660
 So these youths, it's that time of the year.

112
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,500
 It's the most wonderful time of the year for penis thieves.

113
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,460
 In the Dado community, seven men realize their penises are missing.

114
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,820
 They very quickly track down the thieves.

115
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,020
 They turns out to be two ministers.

116
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,220
 One of them works for a church known as the Divine Shadow Church.

117
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,220
 That's pretty dope, dude.

118
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,620
 I think every church should go by the name Divine Shadow.

119
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:39,540
 But anyways, these guys who are missing their penises descend on these ministers.

120
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
 Give us back our dicks.

121
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,220
 And the minister's like, what are you talking about, dude?

122
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,220
 And they get beat up.

123
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,220
 They've been arrested, actually.

124
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,540
 It wasn't this vigilante action.

125
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,540
 The local police investigated it.

126
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,100
 And they came to the conclusion that, yes, these two ministers stole these men's penises.

127
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
 They're in jail now.

128
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,100
 And then the dudes whose penises are missing, you know, what are you going to do?

129
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,460
 Hopefully find a new penis.

130
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,660
 But they threw the ministers in jail and then these kids burned down their church.

131
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,540
 Their Divine Shadow Church.

132
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,360
 So I'm starting to think, because I've been seeing stories about penises disappearing

133
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,060
 for a long time.

134
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,420
 And the fact that it's an annual tradition, I'm wondering if there's something lost in

135
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
 translation.

136
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,420
 I'm wondering if it's not physically gone, because that's impossible.

137
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
 That's 100% impossible.

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
 Right, right, right.

139
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,260
 Convince me, convince me, right?

140
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,500
 That's impossible.

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,420
 I'm wondering if it's a translation error for sexual prowess.

142
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,620
 My sex drive is gone.

143
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,780
 So those ministers took it.

144
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,420
 I mean, it's still not a good reason to burn down a church.

145
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,700
 But are they looking in their pants and they are physically missing?

146
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,260
 Are they straight up kindle down there all of a sudden?

147
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,380
 Yeah, that almost seems like mass hypnosis at that point.

148
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,100
 For seven people in the same community to be able to look and not see any dicks.

149
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,460
 And then you gotta wonder, so they go to the police department and they're like, officer,

150
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,780
 officer, you gotta help me, my dick's gone.

151
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,660
 The cops are like, oh, it's that time of the year, they look at the calendar.

152
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
 Have a little advent calendar.

153
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,540
 Each day they flop it up, there's a little penis in it.

154
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,900
 If you look down and you have some sort of psychotic delusion that your penis was missing,

155
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,020
 I can understand that.

156
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,060
 But how can you drop your pants in front of law enforcement?

157
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,100
 And they don't see your penis either.

158
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,900
 If a guy came up to you today, someone you knew, not just a weirdo on the street, if

159
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,700
 someone you knew, Jerry showed up at your house and goes, I think my penis is gone.

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,020
 You would want to check, right?

161
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,140
 And what would you do if you looked and he had a penis and he's like, look, it's gone.

162
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
 It's gone.

163
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
 And he's like playing with it and stuff.

164
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,180
 You're like, whoa, stop it, stop it.

165
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,660
 He's like rubbing his area this episode.

166
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,540
 This episode does not save work.

167
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,820
 He's rubbing his place where his penis originally was and he sees his hand just rubbing on smooth

168
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,820
 skin.

169
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,180
 And yeah, also now, now I'm really dissecting it.

170
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
 Is it smooth?

171
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,660
 Is it like a little smooth bump?

172
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,260
 Or is it like a hole where it was formally ripped out?

173
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
 I don't know.

174
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
 I don't know.

175
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,140
 There's more penis questions I have.

176
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,660
 I should have paid attention during health science class.

177
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,780
 But the point is, is that seven people said their penises.

178
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
 I don't know.

179
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,260
 As the time of this recording, we do not know if their penises were returned to them.

180
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
 Do their penises?

181
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,780
 I'm thinking it's a euphemism for sexual prowess.

182
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,780
 So you could go to the cop and you're like, dude, I used to be super homophobic.

183
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,820
 I'm not horny, but I'm not horny anymore.

184
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,380
 And the cops are like, lock them up.

185
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
 Lock them up.

186
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,380
 And they're marching through the street.

187
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,740
 And everyone's like, ah, it's that time of the year.

188
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
 People stop.

189
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,300
 A couple of people stop getting less horny.

190
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,660
 And the world ends.

191
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,060
 This website, pulse.com.gh, it'll be in the show notes.

192
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,860
 Here's some other articles real quick from this website.

193
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,260
 They're not, I'm not going to do a full segment on them, but I just want to highlight what

194
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,420
 you're missing by not going to pulse.com.gh.

195
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,860
 There was a guy, they're very, very sex oriented newspaper.

196
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,540
 Again, world news.

197
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,300
 It's again, it is not just some sexy website I found.

198
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,980
 They make coffins in Africa.

199
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,540
 In parts of Africa, they'll make coffins based on what you do.

200
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,180
 So if you're like a soccer player or a footballer, as they call them, this guy got buried in

201
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
 a giant shoe.

202
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,940
 They didn't make a giant adidas and stuff them into a stinky shoe.

203
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,100
 It's a coffin in the shape of a shoe.

204
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,660
 If you're a librarian, you could be in a coffin that's like a book.

205
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,020
 There's also a photo of a coffin.

206
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,620
 It's the shape of a giant penis.

207
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,820
 So those are for people who are womanizers.

208
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,500
 More people who loved stealing penises.

209
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,820
 They're like, I want to be buried in the thing that I stole the most.

210
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,540
 But here's my, this segment's going on super long because now I'm questioning this one

211
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,540
 as well.

212
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,020
 If you're sleeping around with a bunch of women, wouldn't you want to be buried in

213
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,140
 a bunch of boobs or a vagina?

214
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,660
 You know, I don't even, like, if I'm sleeping with a bunch of women, I'm not like you and

215
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
 me, buddy.

216
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,500
 You and me, buddy, till the wheels fall off to my, to my dick.

217
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,580
 But if I had to be buried in genitalia, if that is the fate of Jason Carvender, I think

218
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,540
 I would choose boobs because they like a real tight tank top.

219
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,420
 I just don't want my covena look like.

220
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,980
 I want it to be a big set of knockers because Ronnie Dangerfield is going to give my eulogy

221
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,020
 a big set of knockers.

222
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,220
 And it's like a tank top.

223
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,300
 So it's like a really, really tight tank.

224
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
 Take notes, guys.

225
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,540
 I want to see sketches.

226
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,820
 I want to see measurements of this.

227
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,980
 It's like a, I like, I like spaghetti straps, spaghetti straps or tank tops, stuff like

228
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
 that.

229
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,980
 And then like you have to like, just boobs.

230
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,660
 I guess you don't, I guess it doesn't really matter what outfit she's wearing.

231
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,740
 Make sure it's Abercrombie and Fitch.

232
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,260
 Anyways, I want to want to be, what I'm trying to say is I would not want to be buried in

233
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,380
 a giant dick.

234
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:10,140
 Like even though my reputation sometimes precedes me, I'm not so much of a player that I don't

235
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,500
 want to be buried in giant dick.

236
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,780
 Basically, I guess that's what I'm saying.

237
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,020
 That's not the image I associate with my love life.

238
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,340
 It's not a giant penis to be buried inside.

239
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,740
 So Spice, let's go ahead and leave behind Nigeria.

240
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,380
 We are headed out to good old California USA.

241
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,120
 Helicopter is flying back across the world.

242
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,660
 We get to California, we're at a McDonald's driving.

243
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,180
 Helicopters are pushing everyone away.

244
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,900
 Rotors are cutting up other cars in front of us, but it doesn't matter.

245
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,460
 We need sustenance.

246
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:54,420
 So order some chicken nuggets and stuff and then I want a large fries and then my treat,

247
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,620
 I'm being very generous today, who wants a McFlurry?

248
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,780
 Everyone's like, yeah, McFlurries, woo.

249
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,620
 Those are the people in the helicopter saying that.

250
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,020
 Everyone outside the helicopter has been chopped up by the rotors at this point.

251
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,560
 So we go to order McFlurries and the machine isn't working.

252
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,800
 So can we fly to another McDonald's to buy McFlurries?

253
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,360
 Spice, bring us up and take us outside on old Fresno or something like that.

254
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 Nothing.

255
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,120
 Hey, can you take us up to Santa Rosa?

256
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
 Nothing.

257
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,040
 So anyways, we're sitting in this McDonald's parking lot.

258
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,560
 The sun is setting, the lights are turning on.

259
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,180
 This one's on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

260
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,420
 I think it's towards the top of the tier.

261
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
 It's not a super obscure one.

262
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,300
 There's actually been mainstream articles written about this.

263
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,140
 It's called the Great McDonald's soft serve ice cream conspiracy theory of 2016.

264
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,780
 And by typing that in, you can find a ton of articles on it.

265
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,980
 It's not obscure at all.

266
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,820
 But there's been some new developments in this.

267
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,380
 But before we talk about the new developments, let me give you a quick rundown of what is

268
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,580
 the story itself.

269
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,520
 What happened was back in 2016, people were realizing that every time they went to a McDonald's,

270
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,480
 the ice cream machine wasn't working.

271
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,920
 Now the ice cream machine is used not just to make soft serve cones, but it's also used

272
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
 to make McFlurries.

273
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,600
 And it can make McCafe drinks, which are actually pretty good.

274
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,920
 People were realizing during that year, especially people were going into McDonald's to get an

275
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,040
 ice cream cone.

276
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
 Machine doesn't work.

277
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
 McFlurry machine doesn't work.

278
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,520
 McCafe machine doesn't work.

279
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,600
 What the problem, there was a couple of problems, but I'm going to tell you right now the observational

280
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,100
 problem is, when's the last time you had an ice cream cone at McDonald's, right?

281
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,620
 But as the ice cream options grew and the machine was being used more and more, the chances

282
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,500
 of you going there and it not working were higher.

283
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,860
 Because the chances of you, no one over the age of eight is like, you know what I want

284
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,500
 today, I'm going to go out of my way to buy just buying an ice cream cone, right?

285
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,260
 You may add it to your, I'm not going to say there's other only ice cream cones, I will

286
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,740
 add them to my order from time to time.

287
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,140
 And sometimes, they're having times where I've walked into McDonald's specifically to

288
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,000
 buy a McFlurry or McCafe.

289
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,640
 As the options grew, there were more choices for you to show up and the machine wasn't

290
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,720
 working.

291
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,280
 But in 2016 it came no ahead and people were complaining all over.

292
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,040
 Every time they went to their McDonald's, the machine was broken and they would go to

293
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,840
 other McDonald's and those machines would be broken.

294
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,160
 And this conspiracy theory started.

295
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,580
 The idea was, is the machines weren't actually broken, but those items are more labor intensive.

296
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,660
 Again, not the ice cream cone, but the McFlurries and the McCafes.

297
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,620
 You have to make those on a case by case basis.

298
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,060
 Fast food is fast because they grill a ton of burgers, they have all the refried beans

299
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,980
 and the sauces ready to go at Taco Bell, they have all this stuff that shh, put in a bun,

300
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,620
 warm it up a bit and give it to you.

301
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,860
 A McCafe stuff like that, that is made to order.

302
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:00,960
 Like you have to do more stuff and when you're looking at an 8 hour day, a lot of those is

303
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,200
 going to take more time than cooking 100 burgers.

304
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,560
 So the theory was that the machines weren't broken, they were just telling people that

305
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,840
 because they didn't want to do it.

306
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,260
 Which is possible.

307
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,320
 But people actually started looking into this.

308
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,200
 You had journalists actually look into this, like I said you can find a ton of articles

309
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,480
 about this conspiracy theory in and of itself.

310
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,460
 Some people say, some people say it's not true at all, that the machines were never

311
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
 offline.

312
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,900
 But what was interesting was the number one complaint generally with McDonald's is poor

313
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
 service.

314
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,660
 The staff, I've actually never had trouble with the staff at McDonald's, I think they're

315
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,660
 always been really excellent, but apparently that's always been the number one complaint.

316
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,980
 Just poor customer service.

317
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:48,460
 In the year 2016, the number one complaint by a wide margin, ice cream machines weren't

318
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
 working.

319
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,240
 But the first time that complaint or really any complaint overtook shoddy customer service.

320
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,840
 So there was an actual reason.

321
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,560
 This wasn't an internet meme, people were actually having these problems enough that

322
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,300
 they were complaining to McDonald's about them.

323
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,360
 But then you had all these other theories, we already talked about the one where they

324
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,360
 were just lying.

325
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,440
 One of them is that this is amazing.

326
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,520
 Apparently, apparently there is a 3 hour maintenance required on this machine for maintenance.

327
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,240
 And then every two weeks you have to do a deep clean.

328
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,660
 But you have all this stuff going on, you have people saying that there's a rational

329
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,900
 answer for it, that they're lying, the problem never existed.

330
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,700
 And I looked into it when I saw it on the conspiracy theory iceberg and I go, "Oh, mildly

331
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
 interesting."

332
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,260
 And I moved on.

333
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,620
 But one of the fun things about conspiracy theories is there are people who believe in

334
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,540
 them accidentally.

335
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,380
 We researched this stuff, we have a lot of fun with this stuff, but there are people

336
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,080
 out there who stumble across things on accident.

337
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,400
 Never knew they were a conspiracy theory investigator.

338
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,000
 Spiced, let's leave behind this empty McDonald's parking lot.

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,680
 I want you to take the carbonar copter out into the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

340
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,200
 We're just going to do a little sight scene while I continue to tell you the rest of

341
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,880
 this story.

342
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,960
 We see a little tropical fish swimming around and then like, I don't know, dolphins.

343
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
 What else is in the ocean?

344
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,500
 What else is in the immeasurable depths of the blue ocean?

345
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,460
 I don't know, just tropical fish and dolphins.

346
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:25,220
 We're flying over the Pacific Ocean.

347
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,260
 Now we recently got a development on this story.

348
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,420
 There was a man named Rashik Tahid.

349
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,980
 In October 22nd, 2020, he revealed this amazing invention.

350
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,180
 It may change your life forever.

351
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,600
 It'll definitely change the lives of all you eight-year-olds out there.

352
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,520
 You can now go to his website called McBroken.com and it will tell you if the ice cream machine

353
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,320
 is working in your area.

354
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,680
 It'll actually tell you if an ice cream machine is working anywhere in America.

355
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,200
 We built this bot that's constantly going to McDonald's websites like local McDonald's

356
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,360
 websites and placing orders for McFlurrys.

357
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,520
 So then you just go in and pick it up and leave.

358
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,700
 And he goes, "I just put the item in the shopping cart and never pay for it.

359
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,100
 I'm not ripping them off any money.

360
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,740
 They're not ripping me off any money."

361
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,940
 But if the item can't be put in the shopping cart, it'll say, "Sorry, this item is not

362
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,940
 available."

363
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,620
 It pings back on the website and says the McDonald's on Fulton Avenue, their ice cream machine

364
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,700
 is not working.

365
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,780
 And it's constantly doing this for every McDonald's in the United States.

366
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,060
 And you can pull up this map.

367
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,860
 You can go to this website and it'll actually show you which ones are working, which ones

368
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,860
 are not.

369
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,240
 Again, it's fascinating because this guy, as far as I know, is not a conspiracy theorist.

370
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,560
 He might be the biggest conspiracy theorist ever, but he invents this program and if it

371
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,240
 was just a, oh, it's just observation bias, they're not really closed, which is what some

372
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,680
 of the articles were saying, this website should just show that they're all working.

373
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,760
 Or maybe there's one not working sometimes in the middle of Chicago or something like

374
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 that.

375
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,280
 At any given time in the United States, between 7 to 9% of the ice cream machines aren't working.

376
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,660
 You can look at major cities.

377
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,740
 At the time as I was researching the story, 17% of all the ice cream machines in New York

378
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
 were not working.

379
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,020
 So this is definitely, those are way higher numbers than I would have thought.

380
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,500
 What's odd is that San Diego had 0% broken.

381
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,860
 So good on you San Diego.

382
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,580
 You did something good other than that massive human trafficking problem you have.

383
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,820
 But the ice cream machines work on time.

384
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,460
 So it is true, there actually is a problem with, I mean problem in air quotes.

385
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,320
 You can go without your ice cream cone.

386
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,520
 But it's an interesting thing to see a conspiracy theory pop up on the conspiracy theory iceberg

387
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,800
 of all places and verifiable proof that there is an issue.

388
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 That's not where the story ends.

389
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,820
 I thought this was a great way to wrap this up.

390
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,440
 I remember when I saw this website come out on October 22nd, I go, oh, maybe I'll cover

391
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,720
 that now with, because it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

392
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,520
 It's a nice little spin on it.

393
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,600
 I was on Reddit.

394
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,240
 There's a user named X1BitJ.

395
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,980
 And they noticed something with the McBroken.com website.

396
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,940
 It shows the location of every McDonald's in the United States.

397
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,140
 Every McDonald's in the United States, I should say that is hooked up for this pre-order thing.

398
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,580
 But it's set up to ping everything to see if their ice machines are working.

399
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,220
 This dude on Reddit realized something.

400
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:27,340
 There are McDonald's in locations where there is nothing else.

401
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:33,120
 The reason why I had spiced flies out to the middle of the ocean is we are specifically

402
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,880
 over this point, I don't know, hundreds of miles off the coast of Santa Rosa, California.

403
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:45,480
 And we're looking down and we just see beautiful blue water, much tropical fish and a few dolphins.

404
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,760
 And I turn to you and I say welcome to the farthest McDonald's location off the coast

405
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,120
 of the United States.

406
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,280
 Welcome to the Moroccan Mole Lab.

407
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,660
 Carbonary copter is just hovering there over nothing.

408
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,060
 There are three locations.

409
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,940
 There's one on the west coast, which I could find, which I was able to find this one.

410
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,860
 Apparently two on the east coast.

411
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,380
 They're all listed as being, because it'll show on the McBroken.com website, it'll show

412
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,820
 like little dot and it'll say like Fresno.

413
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,140
 It'll say even if you're looking at a map of the United States and you know where Fresno

414
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,800
 California is at, when you hover over it, it'll still tell you the location.

415
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,080
 In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and the two on the eastern side, but again I wasn't

416
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,640
 able to verify those ones, the location is Pune, P-U-N-E.

417
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,720
 But there's no island by that name.

418
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,600
 Pune is actually a city in India.

419
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,640
 Reddit user of Toos Radiator, recognize the name Moroccan Mole Lab.

420
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,040
 They go, that's from Secret Squirrel.

421
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,500
 There was this old cartoon about a squirrel who kept secrets, he's really good, you can

422
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,940
 tell him your deepest desires.

423
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,660
 He's like, that one's kind of gross, you want to be buried in a penis shaped coffin?

424
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,260
 But okay, I'll keep it.

425
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,860
 I'll keep that secret.

426
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,060
 That's that whole cartoon.

427
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,860
 He was a spy.

428
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,540
 And they, in that cartoon, it was like in the 60s, his hand up our bear.

429
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,180
 In that cartoon there was a place called the Moroccan Mole Lab.

430
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,900
 Now there, when people were talking about this on this Reddit board, it's, this subreddit

431
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,360
 is called RBI or Reddit Bureau of Investigation.

432
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,120
 It's sometimes pretty interesting.

433
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,400
 A lot of times it's just, help me find my grandpa.

434
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
 Which are like, Jason, that's incredibly interesting.

435
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
 They want to find their grandpa.

436
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,760
 But you're always wondering, is it actually their grandpa or are they trying to dox somebody?

437
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,160
 So it's kind of a weird subreddit.

438
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,440
 But they have some standout stuff like this.

439
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,520
 People start looking into this.

440
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,840
 And they go, and this was kind of the most obvious one.

441
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,280
 And I know this for a fact, when I was a pizza delivery driver, you come across it all the

442
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
 time.

443
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,740
 Map making companies make fake maps all the time.

444
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,420
 It's how they copyright a map.

445
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,540
 Because you can't copyright geography.

446
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,540
 You can't copyright like a fact.

447
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,220
 So if you have a map of Chicago, what's to stop me from taking that map that you worked

448
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
 so hard on?

449
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,660
 Because you're going to have to be in Chicago getting stabbed everywhere, going to addicted

450
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,000
 to heroin before you got eight blocks away.

451
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,700
 But eventually you are able to stop getting stabbed and you've narrowed it down to just

452
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,480
 a fentanyl addiction.

453
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,200
 You have this map of Chicago now, what's to keep someone else from simply photocopying

454
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,160
 it and then selling it at a cheaper rate.

455
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,880
 So what map companies will do, this is actually pretty ingenious, they make fake streets.

456
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,120
 They don't make, they don't change the names of existing streets to get you lost.

457
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,400
 But they'll draw streets on there that don't exist.

458
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
 And it'll be like Randall Way.

459
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,480
 So when you make a photocopy of that map and they're suspicious of it, they can look right

460
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,940
 to AE and they go Randall Way doesn't exist, we made it up.

461
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,980
 So people have said that's what happened here.

462
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,260
 Someone who made this map was copywriting it and putting stuff in it so it couldn't

463
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
 be copied.

464
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
 Case closed.

465
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,100
 It was kind of the common theme here was that that is something that map companies do, that's

466
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,540
 what they did with this.

467
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,580
 Into the discussion, that may all be well and good and I do know that map companies do that.

468
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:14,680
 Map companies also don't set up fake McDonald's servers to prove their maps are real.

469
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:24,120
 Because what his bot is doing, it is crawling through every McDonald's online order website,

470
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,280
 placing orders and pinging back.

471
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,000
 Whether the map was real or not, his bot would have never landed in the middle of the Pacific

472
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Ocean.

473
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,360
 There is no island here.

474
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,620
 There is nothing here.

475
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:45,460
 But his bot is recognizing there is a McDonald's location and assigning it the name Moroccan

476
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,180
 MoLab which it's getting from geographical information.

477
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:54,780
 How is this bot pulling information that doesn't exist in the middle of the ocean based on

478
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,380
 a 1960s cartoon and related to a city in India?

479
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,620
 Could Racheek have created it as a joke?

480
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,160
 Could Racheek have created it as his way of copywriting the map?

481
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
 Possibly.

482
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,480
 Those are the two most likely ones.

483
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,640
 Even though he didn't really create the map, again it's just pinging stuff.

484
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,800
 But unlike a fake road on a map which he would never go down because it doesn't exist, if

485
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,120
 he was putting fake stuff on the map it would actually make it seem like more of it could

486
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
 be fake.

487
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,400
 That it could just be a way for him because he's asking for donations.

488
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,240
 He's like if you like this get donation.

489
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,440
 If he's faking information then you'd have to question all the information on that.

490
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,540
 Maybe you planned a flight out to Pune and got out there and didn't exist.

491
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,940
 I think, here's my conspiracy cap idea and we'll wrap it up like this.

492
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:46,780
 There is a secret facility out in the middle of the ocean.

493
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,900
 You know CIA headquarters has a Starbucks in it and the people who work there have to

494
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,300
 have, this actually might be an urban legend now that I said it so authoritatively, but

495
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:03,720
 I've heard that CIA headquarters has a Starbucks that they basically have to be, I'm not saying

496
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
 CIA agent level.

497
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,840
 I'm not saying that she trained the CIA and they're like here's your post and you're

498
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,640
 like oh man I'm making cookies.

499
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,160
 Yes, that's what I've always wanted to do with the CIA.

500
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,440
 I thought it was the cookie intelligence administration.

501
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,040
 They're basically like, I don't think there's a bunch of security precautions they have

502
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,200
 to go through.

503
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,800
 I think like they don't have name tags.

504
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,300
 They don't get the employees names on the cups or anything like that.

505
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,780
 Which I guess isn't that secure.

506
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,940
 But my point is that we do know that people love coffee and people love McDonald's and

507
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,500
 if you had a facility out in the middle of nowhere, like literally in the middle of nowhere

508
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,020
 or even underwater, is it easier every time you have a hankering to get some burgers or

509
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,040
 something like that to get in your unidentified submerged object and fly around and go to

510
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,920
 Fresno and get some burgers, go back.

511
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,080
 No, you would build a McDonald's because that's believable, right?

512
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,440
 You have a secret underground underwater facility that you build a McDonald's in.

513
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,920
 Your facility is totally secret, but at night there's like a glowing yellow from the Golden

514
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
 Arches.

515
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:20,700
 You have a secret facility that you have set up for online orders because the facility

516
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,940
 is big.

517
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,300
 So let's say I'm really rich, I'm really rich in this one, but let's say you're on the opposite

518
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:33,980
 end of the facility, it's like a mile long and you're like, "Ah man, my hover car is

519
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,020
 broken or something like that."

520
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,420
 And then you're sitting there, you're like, "Sit and we get it.

521
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
 We get it."

522
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
 No, I gotta wrap it up.

523
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:46,900
 You're there in your bunk and the McDonald's is a mile away in your underwater base.

524
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,340
 A very poorly designed base.

525
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,080
 But anyways, you're in it and you're in your bunk and then you get a hankering for some

526
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,220
 filet of fish because you're not tired of looking at fish all the time.

527
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,780
 So now you could walk all the way to the...

528
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,740
 Wait a second, you're gonna have to walk there anyways.

529
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,420
 It doesn't matter whether or not you order it online.

530
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,060
 Okay, so then you just read a book.

531
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:12,020
 My point is that there may be a McDonald's under the water.

532
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,980
 That was the whole point of the last six minutes of this and I think I said it back then.

533
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,940
 I think that this guy's website is a really cool thing and at least it's very fun.

534
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,780
 It's changing the way mankind's looking at frozen milk.

535
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:33,820
 It's an amazing website, but it also may have unveiled three secret underwater bases

536
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,980
 that have McDonald's placed in them.

537
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,620
 Sure, I know that eventually the McDonald's would run out of food and you'd have to keep

538
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,180
 going by potatoes and stuff like that.

539
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,460
 I know logically it doesn't make sense.

540
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,020
 Yeah, and I know, I know there's still a lot of holes in this theory.

541
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:54,260
 But my point is, is that sometimes people who don't believe in conspiracy theories may

542
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,940
 stumble across the deepest truths of all.

543
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,820
 And then someday you're gonna ask that guy who uncovered this grand conspiracy theory

544
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:08,340
 about underwater bases that people have been trying to explore for years when he finally

545
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,860
 becomes accepted into the conspiracy community.

546
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,660
 We're gonna go, "Hey man, how do you like it?

547
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,260
 How do you like hanging out with all these conspiracy guys?"

548
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,860
 He looks at you and he says, he puts his hands on his shoulder.

549
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:32,580
 He gets really close and he goes, "I'm loving it."

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,380

553
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,060
 DeadRabberRadio.com, I'm not on pain medication for my back either.

554
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,020
 I don't know why that I would say one off the rails.
