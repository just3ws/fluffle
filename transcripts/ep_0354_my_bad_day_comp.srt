1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 My day sucked and I'm gonna tell you about some other sucky sucky days

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,260
 I've had and then because this is a show about the paranormal conspiracy and true crime

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,460
 I'm gonna tell you short story about a guy who gets abducted by aliens. We're gonna make it work today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:28,120
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,820
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. Yeah, I'm not having a good day

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,760
 You know what the thing is is I hope you're having a good day and I hate breaking openings

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440
 I like to keep the openings the same. It's funny because as a listener of stuff of consuming stuff

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,680
 You have a routine and you want to hear the same thing all the time. That's why I've never changed the intro

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,760
 I've never tried. Oh, let's do something different like it's been the same since episode one. The only thing that's changed

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,240
 It hasn't been the same since episode one the format's been pretty much the same

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,000
 I've just kind of tweaked and I think we're at now, but I don't want to lie to you guys either

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,740
 Today sucked so today's episode. I actually didn't plan on doing it. It's 9 30 right now at night

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,040
 And I was like I'm not gonna release an episode not gonna release an episode and I thought

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:17,960
 99% of life is just showing up. So just show up. You did say you're gonna take some extra days off this season because your

15
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,000
 Vacation was kind of wacky, but just show up Jason even if it means you got to go a little off topic now

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,700
 Maybe at the end of this I'll have a better day. Maybe the end of this you'll have a better day

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,980
 Maybe your day suck you see the thing is just like my day and sorry this first part is gonna be kind of vloggy

18
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,380
 So if that's not what you're here for if your new listener, I apologize

19
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,100
 That's not what you're here for and you're an old listener. You're like Jason just tell a story about a ghost

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,340
 Fast-forward or listen to it at a high speed, but if you just want to hear about my bad

21
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,620
 Which I don't know if any of you do anyways, let's talk about it woke up. Did you jitsu and that one great?

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,360
 That one totally fine no jiu jitsu for next week though

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,300
 I had a doctor's appointment today that I'd planned the long time in advance. It snowed

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,620
 I couldn't make it my ride couldn't take me to the city that it's in I

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,580
 Ended up not going to work because of the

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,220
 Doctor's visit, but then I could go to work, but I left my glasses at home

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,040
 So I couldn't go to work and I broke my phone. I

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,020
 Was goofing off and I broke my phone now. I have two phones. I have two phones. You're like Jason

29
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:29,400
 It's not a bad day. That's not a bad day at all. You had the day off work and you didn't have to go to the doctor

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,120
 There was snow involved so that sucked and you have two phones

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,120
 I'm playing about breaking this one phone the phone that I broke I've had for like four years

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,260
 I have two phones because one I don't even have it activated. It's where I put all my music on and

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,120
 Then I have a phone so I never have to worry about listening too much music that my phone dies or talking to too many people that which never

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,580
 Happens, but you know, it's also I'm on the phone on the internet the other phone

35
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,040
 I'd use the listening music so it just sucked losing my phone and I just was having I came home

36
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,400
 And you're like, yeah Jason you have the damn work. He didn't have to go to work boo-hoo poor Jason

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,960
 I came home and I sat here and I just

38
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,960
 Was sad I was sad

39
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
 Didn't feel good

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,760
 So I thought now I'll tell you this right now the bad day experiences you'll probably find quite humorous to me though

41
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,600
 I was like I'm at home. My mom sent me a Christmas present. She sent me her Christmas

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,160
 Jason that's not the definition of a bad day. You're getting Christmas presents

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,480
 I admit the Christmas present had been sitting here for a while and I said I'm not having a good day

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,680
 I'm really sad. I'm going to open up my Christmas present. Maybe that will cheer me up now mom

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,760
 If you listen to all the episodes she doesn't she listens to one every so often if you're listening to this episode

46
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,320
 I totally love you and I totally love your gift

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,200
 But I do have to say that as I was already kind of sad

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,880
 I owe you guys really Jason. You're so ungrateful

49
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,680
 I opened up the present and I got a shirt, which is what I wanted. I got a sweater

50
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,280
 Which I actually have that exact same sweater. They step those sweater stain real

51
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,840
 Really easily you're like Jason you're super ungrateful. No, no, no, no, I love the sweater

52
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,720
 I won't get a stain on this one because I have the exact same sweater with a huge stain on it

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
 She buys me a pair of socks, which I asked for I said

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,240
 Can I get some nice warm socks because she sent them to me about two years ago? I lost them already

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,440
 She sends me socks, okay, and it's just one of those things

56
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,280
 You know when you're already having a bad day everything is is seems to be wrong

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,680
 She sends me there's these socks and I look at them and it's size

58
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,880
 13 to 15 socks

59
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,480
 Now again on a normal day if I had opened that up on Christmas Day

60
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,040
 I would have simply laughed but because my day was already just a series of

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,640
 Unfortunate incidents. I'm thinking just my mom know who her son is. I'm not Shaq

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,520
 Who has size 13 to 15 socks and so they're pretty comfy though

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,360
 So I'll give her that and then my mom and I feel really bad about this one actually my mom sent me two gift cards

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 and

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,680
 Everyone else has no presents right now. They're like, I don't even have presents. He sends me two gift cards and

66
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,860
 It's $15 each one for Dairy Queen and one for Taco Bell and I would looked at him and I'm like

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,040
 But I'm on Keto too. I can't even spend these right now and I remember sitting back

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,800
 So I'm so ungrateful. I love you mom so much. I remember sitting remember it just happened today

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,480
 I sit back in my chair. I'm looking sitting back in the chair and I'm looking at these gift cards

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,720
 I'm thinking I can take a break off the keto. This is fine. Like this isn't like super

71
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,600
 This isn't a bad present. It just goes it's it would I'd have to stop doing my diet to eat these places

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,240
 But also it's snowing. So I can't even leave my house

73
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,480
 I can't even leave my house to walk the mile two miles to the restaurant to use these things today

74
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,480
 You know, you know, you don't have to you don't have to eat today

75
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,040
 But then I'm thinking well, this is my problem. I think if I'm gonna break my keto on day X

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,880
 I'm just gonna break it now. So if I know that I may have a birthday party coming up or a

77
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,960
 celebration Christmas party on Friday compelling podcasting. I know if I have a

78
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,960
 If I have a party on Friday and it's Wednesday, I'll just go well, I'm gonna break the keto on Friday

79
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,020
 I'll just break the keto now, which is stupid

80
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,680
 But that's what I do. So I get a gift card for

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,760
 Taco Bell gift card for Dairy Queen and then I order a I had a free Domino's Pizza

82
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,560
 If for because I ordered Domino's pizzas in the past. You're like, he's no new pieces

83
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,160
 You have to order before a corporation gives you a free pizza. So anyways, so I go I'm going to eventually

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,360
 But go to Taco Bell. So I'm just gonna eat pizza today

85
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,020
 I order a Domino's pizza and I just devour it and then I went and I hung out with the friend

86
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,160
 I went took a nap because I still feeling quite miserable

87
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,200
 I did end up going to hang out with a friend for the past couple hours and I came home

88
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,580
 And that made me feel better and then I came home and said I'll record this podcast

89
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,280
 So you're like Jason. Are you really gonna spend eight minutes telling us about how crappy your day is?

90
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,520
 Yes, actually, well no because I'm gonna spend more time and the reason why and we're done with that day

91
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
 The reason why I'm telling you these bad day stories is because maybe you're having a bad day today

92
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,700
 Maybe you're having a bad holiday. Maybe you're having a bad holiday. So I want you to hear some funny

93
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,900
 Stories miserable Jason stories that I think are quite humorous

94
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,620
 So let's see if I can get both of them in and maybe it'll cheer you up. Maybe it'll make your bad and don't worry

95
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,340
 I'll talk about aliens. I got an alien story at the end. Don't worry. Don't stop listening to it yet

96
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,260
 So that was my bad day today and again, you're sitting there thinking Jason that is not a bad

97
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:54,940
 You're not okay. So this was my bad day. I had jujitsu, which was totally fun. I got the day off work

98
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
 I didn't have to go to the doctor's office

99
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,100
 I ate a pizza

100
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:06,780
 And opened a Christmas present and I'm like oh my day suck here check this bad day story out

101
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,320
 So one day I was suit this probably about two or three years ago

102
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,500
 So I was 350 pounds at the time and I was super poor

103
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,540
 I had very very little to no money at this at the point of the story

104
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,860
 I had a zero money all I had was a

105
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,700
 Subway gift card that I think my brother gave me now

106
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,600
 I didn't subway on before I had enough money on the subway gift card for one sandwich

107
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,500
 It was like seven or eight bucks left on the card. No other money on me zero a lot of times people go on broke

108
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,140
 They have like a couple thousand and savings. They're like whoa. I'm not touching my savings like I mean

109
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,580
 I'm my checking accounts bro. No, I was flat broke. I didn't even have cans to recycle broke

110
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,660
 So I go to subway and I buy myself a footlong spicy Italian

111
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,260
 Which is what I ate back then and I have this big green jacket. I had this jacket

112
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,860
 I think I bought it like shortly after 9/11 so the jacket is like 18 years old

113
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,540
 It's this giant jacket with these giant pockets and it's just like just drapes over me

114
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,980
 It looks like the jacket the bad guy wore and blade to so that's always I always pretend

115
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,540
 I'm that dude. I don't remember his name, but I'm always hiding in the shadows

116
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,900
 Distending my jaw so I'm why that was a good movie actually the first one is the best to play through it was terrible

117
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:27,140
 But I am this is not a movie show. I'm walking. Oh, I saw the trailer for the new grudge movie that movies

118
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,740
 Terrifying we'll talk about that later, but you're like no Jason talk about the now. That's more on topic

119
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,860
 I'm walking from subway home and at this point I have like maybe 35 cents on my subway gift card

120
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,820
 No other money. This was my dinner

121
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,180
 This was the only food that I had available because I was broke and so I walk home

122
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,960
 It's about a mile and a half again two miles from the fast food restaurants to my house

123
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,960
 I walk home. I come into the apartment. I start taking my stuff off. I go

124
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,820
 I guess I should have said earlier

125
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,680
 I put my sandwich in the jacket pocket

126
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,860
 put the sandwich in my jacket pocket and walked and listened to my music on my old phone that's broken out

127
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,500
 Thanks, but the story reminds me that I'm well

128
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,940
 I get really attached to stuff like that because it's been on so many adventures with me. I'm walking down the street

129
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,300
 I have this sandwich in my pocket big foot long the its jacket giant jacket huge pockets

130
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,660
 You're like Jason. I don't think you have foot long pockets

131
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,540
 Well, the pocket had a hole in it

132
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,660
 So it went into the interior of the jacket

133
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,260
 So use basically like a normal hole like a pocket hole and then you could put your hand through the hole

134
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
 And then you could be inside the jacket

135
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,300
 So it's basically a jacket

136
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,620
 It's basically a jacket with a giant hole in the pocket into the interior of the jacket

137
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,700
 Does that make sense? You're all of you at one point said yes

138
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,220
 And then so I put the giant foot-long sandwich in the in my jacket and it kind of is sticking out

139
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,340
 It's sticking basically in my jacket. I remember one day actually got to tell this story too. I always put food in my pockets

140
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,160
 I remember once I had this big jacket on and I just bought like three bean burritos at

141
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,380
 Taco Bell I put them in my pocket put the whole bag in my pocket

142
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,300
 I'm walking on the street this young guys walking on the street. He's walking towards me. I'm walking towards him

143
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,300
 This is happening a couple years ago in Hood River - he's kind of like, you know, he's a tough guy, you know walking on the street

144
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,740
 And I'm walking I'm like a tough guy walking on the street. We're getting closer and closer. I'm sizing him up like

145
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,100
 Oh, you know, could I take him like what if he did this? Could I do this? You know what guys do and

146
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,580
 Well, he's getting closer and then I just bust out laughing I start laughing so hard because in my

147
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,680
 mental exercise of whether or not I could fight this guy and I imagined him

148
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,740
 Punching me doing a gut punch and just be free. I was just shooting out of my pocket

149
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:51,180
 It would be the most bizarre thing if you were in a fight and you just swung super hard and you felt just goo

150
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,860
 And just a bunch of just refried beans shot out of a dude

151
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,280
 Like oh no, he runs away. Anyways walking on the street with a subway sandwich. I get home

152
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,180
 I go to grab my subway sandwich. It's not in my pocket

153
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
 Now I'm thinking

154
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,500
 This is the only food I have in the world right now. I have no other food

155
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,980
 So I must have set it down. I must have like the first thing I did instinctually empty my pockets

156
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,060
 I'm looking around my apartment. Where's my subway sandwich? It's kind of hard to miss something that is a foot long

157
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,580
 But I'm looking around looking on the table. I keep patting down my jacket. Where's my sandwich? Where's my sandwich?

158
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,700
 And after about five minutes, I make the grim

159
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,500
 Not discovery I come to the grim conclusion that I must have dropped the sandwich somewhere again

160
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,380
 The only food that I had in existence at this point with no money to buy more and you're thinking Jason

161
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,780
 You could just gone a day without eating. Well sure good, but I

162
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,420
 Really wanted that sandwich

163
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,380
 And I go I got a backtrack and I'm thinking could I go to subway? This was my logic

164
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,380
 I'm gonna walk all the way to subway

165
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,420
 Because I obviously it's not before subway

166
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,880
 It's not moving on its own and maybe I'll get to subway and I'll explain the situation

167
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,420
 Hey, just bought the sandwich and I lost it

168
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,440
 Maybe they'll give me another one because I was a regular there, but I was really obviously I was depressed because I hadn't eaten that day

169
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,420
 I had no money to buy food

170
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,140
 I was really looking forward to the sandwich that I could get with the little money that I had and

171
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,700
 I

172
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,460
 Had lost it so I walk and I remember going out leaving my apartment

173
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,820
 I remember the sky being particularly gray that moment and I thought listen best case scenario is

174
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,560
 It's laying on the side best case scenario

175
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,300
 It's right there the worst case scenario is it fell out of my pocket while I was walking across the street

176
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,020
 It's much of cars have run over it and then there's no salvaging it. I

177
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,940
 Walked for a mile just scanning the ground

178
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,260
 Scanning the ground every time I'd be like oh there it is. It's just a balled-up newspaper

179
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,020
 I

180
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
 Walk a bit further. Oh there it is

181
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,340
 Just a watt. I didn't realize how dirty would river us until I was trying to find a foot long

182
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,780
 Wrapping because it was in like that sandwich bag when napkins wrapped around it. So I knew it would be long and white

183
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,460
 and walking I

184
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,260
 get about a mile out and

185
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,180
 I see a

186
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,020
 Subway napkin on the ground and I go aha. I'm closed

187
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,260
 I felt like basil the great mouse detective. I think his name was basil. I think basil is a

188
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,500
 Not a fruit. It's a spice

189
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,820
 And I go aha close. I can smell it. I can smell the pepper chainies from here

190
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,020
 There my sandwich was a couple feet away

191
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,140
 in the gutter

192
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,220
 Just sitting there now now it had fallen out of the back

193
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,740
 So the bag is just blown away at this point, but in the gutter

194
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,220
 There is a perfectly wrapped subway sandwich with a napkin still attached to it the other napkin had blown away and

195
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,540
 I remember thinking I'm very

196
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,380
 Very very grateful that it wasn't raining because the gutter was told and you're like Jason this story is not going

197
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,660
 Or I think it's going as I'm approaching my prize. I

198
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,500
 Remember thinking well, it wasn't raining the gutter is dry bone dry

199
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,940
 There's a couple leaves blown around the sandwich is perfectly wrapped

200
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,020
 It hasn't even been touched not even a squirrel had come over in the half hour this whole journey has taken I

201
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,620
 Felt like Frodo

202
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,700
 That doesn't make sense Frodo wasn't looking for something Frodo was trying to destroy something

203
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,900
 Technically Mount Doom was my stomach

204
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:44,540
 This sandwich was the ring and now I was ready to complete my task. What's funny is across the street. There was a house

205
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,500
 And I remember as I bent down to pick up the subway sandwich

206
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,100
 I imagine someone in that house was probably watching television flipping through channels and

207
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,460
 For some reason that had caught their eye

208
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,960
 There was something white just sitting in the gutter a foot long white object sitting in the gutter and they're like

209
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,660
 I don't know what that is not gonna worry about it. They're flipping the channel and then a short time later

210
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,860
 They see a 350 pound man walk up

211
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,660
 Stare down at the object in the gutter

212
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,820
 Now like what what I wonder what that was

213
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,340
 Guy reaches down picks it up

214
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:26,220
 Looks at it and at that point you recognize that it's a foot long sandwich in the gutter and

215
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,900
 Then you watch the three this 350 pound man

216
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,500
 Put it in his pocket

217
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,380
 And walk down the street dude that sandwich tasted delicious

218
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,180
 Because I had to work for that sandwich and I was grateful

219
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,540
 I was super super grateful that even though I had to go backtrack to get that sandwich

220
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,300
 I was able to eat that night. That was a bad day

221
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:56,460
 That actually was a pretty crummy day, but you're like Jason the poor you got the sandwich. Yeah

222
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,900
 Yeah, but I felt so miserable even having obviously like I've been poor most of my life like right now

223
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,300
 I'm actually doing pretty good for myself, but I've been there's been a most of my life

224
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,620
 I've been like do I eat today or do I drink a Coca-Cola?

225
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,860
 Like I've had long stretches of my life like that be and here's why I'm not very good with money

226
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,860
 Like even when I was making good money

227
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,820
 I made poor money choices now I make less money than I have in the past

228
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,300
 But I make much better money choices not perfect money choices

229
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,460
 But a big part of being poor is

230
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,660
 Making good money choices. It's not gonna solve all your problems

231
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,060
 Sometimes you are actually underemployed

232
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:46,020
 But for me now that I'm making better keto helps a lot actually because I've just buy meat and bulk

233
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,700
 Yeah, I make better money choices now. So I there's very it's not as likely that I'm completely out of money

234
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,500
 I was completely out of money a couple months ago, and that's why Chris K

235
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,700
 The founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade. He's like he got a start a patreon and

236
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,060
 He gave me some money because I was talking about not having food or something like that

237
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,300
 That used to be a regular occurrence for me now. It's once in a blue moon

238
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,220
 I I will always appreciate Chris K reaching out to me like that. That was great

239
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:19,260
 But yeah, I would be like do I do I buy a dollar hamburger at Walmart today?

240
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,100
 Or do I buy a Coca-Cola a refreshing cocoa?

241
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,220
 It's been a lot of my life like that childhood and

242
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,780
 Adult life like that. It's only been recently that I've been more stable with my finances, but anyways

243
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,420
 That's why I just it was a reminder of just the abject poverty. I had placed myself in

244
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,900
 But anyways, so that was a bad story. I think I have enough time for one more

245
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,060
 You're like Jason. Do you have a sad story that actually involves you being sad at the end of it?

246
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,980
 If you get it we want to hear a story where you're completely miserable at the end but a funny story

247
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,020
 Well, here's another one. I remember this was Thanksgiving or the couple days before Thanksgiving

248
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,100
 I was absolutely miserable. The weather was garbage. This was a couple years ago

249
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,100
 The weather was absolutely garbage. I

250
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,940
 Was miserable. I was homesick. I don't get homesick often, but it does happen. I was homesick

251
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,380
 All my friends had moved away recently. I was very lonely. I wasn't happy with my life

252
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,300
 This was way before the podcast. This is probably I think might have already said this was like three or four years ago

253
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,340
 And like I did at this Thanksgiving

254
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,180
 I generally will do Thanksgiving by myself. I buy everything and I think this might have been actually the first time

255
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,300
 I was doing full Thanksgiving by myself. I think that's might have been why it was so miserable

256
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,600
 I wasn't going anyone's house wasn't

257
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,940
 Going to any like local relatives anything like that and I remember

258
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,900
 But I'm really bad at like putting stuff in shopping carts

259
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,280
 I'll shop just by putting stuff in my arms and then I'm like, oh, I need this I need this and eventually

260
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,020
 I'm just like carrying all this garbage through the store now. I'll tell you this

261
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 it actually I

262
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,060
 You guys might call me wrong on this my female listeners might call me wrong on this

263
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,500
 But women seem to be impressed by you being strong enough to carry all that stuff

264
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
 So

265
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 Men if you're looking for love go to Safeway and just grab bunch of stuff and walk through the aisles right now

266
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,300
 I just heard the sound of 500 female listeners shake their head. They're like, no you look like an idiot when you do that

267
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,380
 You just get a shot in the car

268
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,780
 But anyways, I remember I was like, okay

269
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:25,220
 I need mashed potatoes and I need stuffing and I need green beans and I need like these meat dishes like these turkey edible thingy

270
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,460
 Well, there it's all edible. But like these prepared turkey thing

271
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,760
 Loading all this stuff up and I go I

272
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,500
 Need gravy and I don't know how much gravy I need it. So I got three jars of gravy

273
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,460
 And I'm walking through the store and I'm like trying to hold all of this stuff

274
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,260
 I'm trying to hold a non-prepared Thanksgiving feast in my arms is what I'm attempting to do

275
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,660
 And I remember I'm walking through and I just was miserable. I wasn't having a good time

276
00:20:52,660 --> 00:21:00,140
 Super just disappointed in life and in myself. I'm walking but I'm going to have Thanksgiving. So everything will be okay

277
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
 I'm walking and walking and then I hear

278
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,740
 And

279
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,460
 I turn around and what had happened was one of the jars of gravy

280
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,900
 slipped out from my arm and

281
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,260
 It made this

282
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,060
 Sound as it did it was like if someone was trying to grab a wet melon

283
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:27,660
 But made a glass and containing gravy and it smashed into the ground spreading brown gravy all over the middle of the Walmart aisle

284
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:33,700
 And I just stood there and I was like oh great

285
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,460
 Horrible and then I was like this is bad. So there's like junk chunks of glass in here

286
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,700
 I remember waving over one of the employees and I was like, hey, sorry about this

287
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,820
 I knocked this over or just fell out of my arms and the boys like I you know, whatever that's fine

288
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,740
 And I then I debated should I go buy another one I already have this too and I thought I don't know how much gravy

289
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,940
 I need for one - I need to put this stuff down

290
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,340
 I just can't go grab another jar of gravy start walking through the store drop that one too eventually

291
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,140
 There's just a dotted line of broken glass through the store, but I feel really bad for breaking it

292
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,740
 It was just another reminder of how crappy you life was going right now

293
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,220
 So I went I bought all my stuff I throw it in my backpack now

294
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,940
 I have a tendency because I wear big jackets to put stuff in my pockets just like the subway story

295
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,640
 Helps distribute the weight nowadays when I go shopping

296
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,620
 I'll buy like two or three six packs of dye root beer or dye Pepsi and some of it

297
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,900
 I'll put on my backpack and other ones I'll put in the pockets of my jacket or in the pockets of my pants

298
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,680
 So I can carry a lot of stuff just distributing it. I'm like a real-life death stranding character

299
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,060
 except without a little fetus attached to my chest the

300
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,340
 It's funny. I've never played that game, but I think about it all the time

301
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,780
 Especially when I'm walking in the snow how you have to keep your balance the I throw all my stuff in and I remember thinking this is again

302
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,980
 When I was 350 pounds, so I was like I'm gonna eat I'm gonna eat on the way home

303
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,200
 That's how you get to become 350 pounds because I was like I'm gonna cook this stuff

304
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 I think the food was for tomorrow or the I don't think it was Thanksgiving Day

305
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,900
 It was this was the day before Thanksgiving. I was going to take this stuff home

306
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,640
 But I wanted to get Taco Bell

307
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,840
 To eat before I had to walk home because I was 350 pounds and that was a long walk

308
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,600
 I carried as much as I was so I go to and I also I felt like garbage and carbs was gonna help me feel better

309
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,020
 I go to Taco Bell and I'm just sitting there

310
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,420
 Eating my burritos all alone

311
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,180
 Sad not feeling good not feeling good about myself

312
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,580
 Not feeling good about life, but as I'm eating these carbs

313
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,640
 I'm on my phone like searching around on stuff on phone

314
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,420
 Just reading funny stuff, and I'm starting to feel better and certain feel better getting distracted

315
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,740
 Okay, this isn't gonna be so bad. I got a good meal in me now

316
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,340
 I think that also had a lot to do with my moods. It was a tendency to go

317
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,220
 I don't never eat in the morning

318
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,600
 I never eat in the morning and then I would be like noon and I would eat something then I would tend to over eat

319
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,460
 So I'd already be a little not feeling good from not eating in the morning

320
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,300
 And then I'd overeat and then I'd feel bad after that, but anyways I

321
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,140
 ate my Taco Bell

322
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,900
 Ready to go so I get all my stuff throw away my garbage at

323
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,820
 Taco Bell I go to put my jacket on and I have this tendency to kind of swing my jacket around this ultra

324
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,700
 Dramatically way put it on jacket same jacket from the subway story to green jacket with a big hole in the pocket

325
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,060
 And as I'm swinging the jacket on I hear a

326
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,060
 *gasp* a boop!

327
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:36,640
 And I remember just standing there with my back to what I knew was standing behind me

328
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:42,940
 I immediately knew I recognized that noise. I just heard it about 45 minutes earlier and I

329
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:49,300
 Understand physics. I realized that I had put the two cans of gravy two bottles of gravy in my jacket

330
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,420
 And when I swung it around dramatically one of them flew out of the jacket

331
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,140
 smashed onto the ground

332
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,380
 And I remember just kind of just kind of hanging my head

333
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,000
 Now there's nobody else in the Taco Bell except me and there's maybe two or three employees behind the counter

334
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,720
 And I turn around and I'm looking at a smashed jar and

335
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,060
 gray brown gravy just

336
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:22,420
 And I knew from the experience of Walmart when I was apologizing to the employee there when he was trying to clean it up

337
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,420
 How hard it is to clean up gravy

338
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,020
 Super hard. You can't really sweep it up. You can't mop it up

339
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:34,300
 You're kind of boned either way and I remember I picked up the glass immediately because I didn't want someone to walk in

340
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:40,100
 And then I walk up to the counter and said hey really sorry about this, but I accidentally dropped a jar of

341
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,420
 I accidentally dropped a jar of gravy over in the area there and

342
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,620
 The guy goes oh, that's fine. We'll take care of it

343
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,420
 I was like, oh, okay

344
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,080
 So then I go over there and I kind of finish putting stuff on it and this is it's gravy dude

345
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,900
 It is a danger. It's something that someone's going to slip on first off now

346
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,820
 Taco Bell smells like great

347
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,180
 You could the second you walk in or you're just in there. You just smell gravy

348
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,400
 And I'm looking and I'm just standing there and I stood there for probably about five minutes of the people behind

349
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,580
 People behind the counter weren't helping I walked back up. I go hey, can I like borrow a broom or some paper towels?

350
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:25,480
 I'll clean it up and they're like no no no we'll get it. It's totally fine because this is the thing as I was leaving the Taco Bell

351
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,740
 I go this this is the problem here

352
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,020
 I'm the only one in the Taco Bell

353
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:38,180
 Eventually someone else is going to walk into the Taco Bell and they are going to smell gravy which is going to be odd

354
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:44,340
 That's the one thing you don't that's really the one flavor. You don't expect to smell in a Taco Bell

355
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,180
 But then you're going to imagine this you walk in a Taco Bell in the middle of the day

356
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:56,320
 You look and on the floor in the middle of the floor is a brown ooze just sitting there

357
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,620
 In a place that sells no gravy

358
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,660
 It's never had gravy ever in a KFC. You wouldn't even bat an eye

359
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,260
 But you're at a Taco Bell you walk in there is a brown there's 16 ounces of brown ooze

360
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,380
 Just sitting on the floor in front of you. What would what would go through your head?

361
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,180
 Now I don't you could go. I would just assume somebody spilled gravy some idiot

362
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,000
 Brought gravy into a Taco Bell and then spilled it

363
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,220
 But I remember leaving and I thought that would be that would be so puzzling to me

364
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,260
 it'd be the same thing as if you walked into McDonald's and

365
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,940
 There was a chicken fried burrito or a quesadilla just sitting on the floor

366
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,620
 You'd be like what where did this come from and it's just sitting there the employees are completely ignoring it

367
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:50,380
 You would think that it was a Mandela effect now Taco Bell has always served gravy. What are you talking about? It's always been here I

368
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:59,140
 Walked home now to jars of gravy short completely miserable again felt like

369
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:06,580
 I just was not on a good path and I remember walking and I get to my apartment complex and right then I

370
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
 hear a hey, buddy and

371
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,980
 I look up and my buddy Jonas who had been in LA for probably about a year at this point

372
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,700
 He just walked up to my apartment knocked on the door to see if I was there and I wasn't obviously I was

373
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,900
 Contemplating my horrible existence walking on the street

374
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,860
 And he walked out and he goes hey, I was just at your apartment seeing if you're home

375
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,180
 I walked up to him. I just gave him the biggest hug and I'm like I'm so glad you're here today

376
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:38,660
 Because that was the day I needed some cheering up. So now we're sitting at a fireplace. I'm puffing on a big

377
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,700
 Pipe and you're like Jason

378
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,540
 Those are stories. Yes, they are all sad stories. They're kind of funny. They're kind. I think they're funny

379
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,060
 They're you're like oh, they're kind of funny

380
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,600
 But they all ended happily they all ended happily that's I've had worse days than you Jason and yes

381
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:05,060
 You have and obviously I've had worse days than the stories. I've told I could tell you miserable days

382
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,260
 Where I've lost loved ones or people made horrible decisions that affected their lives or ever I'm not gonna tell you those stories

383
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,100
 Puffing on my pipe because this isn't a competition. This isn't a competition the story

384
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,460
 There's point of this odd episode where recording isn't I have worse days than you

385
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,620
 It's that the point of the episode is one

386
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,980
 there's an episode being recorded tonight and two I

387
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,580
 Even when we have bad days

388
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,260
 We don't know how they're going to end. We don't know how they're going today

389
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,580
 I was really miserable, but it had a good ending the sandwich

390
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,980
 Subway sandwich story had a good ending the the gravy story in the end in the end

391
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,740
 Actually that one jar of gravy when I poured it it had three jars of gravy in it

392
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,400
 It was a Thanksgiving miracle. He may know was it was just one jar gravy, but it was enough

393
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,460
 It was enough for me. I don't know why I thought I needed three jars of gravy

394
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,860
 so

395
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,820
 You may be having a bad day. You may be having a bad weekend

396
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:10,660
 But you don't know how it's gonna end so keep going keep walking keep looking for that subway sandwich in the sewer

397
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:17,940
 Because things might work out. I think things always work out in the end. Sometimes it takes a long period of time

398
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,700
 But things still get done. I planned on not doing an episode today

399
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,660
 I 100% by the time 3 p.m. Rolled around I said nope not doing an episode. I am not doing an episode today

400
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,980
 I'm so crummy. I'm feeling so bad. I'm not doing an episode today

401
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,380
 Took a nap did everything to avoid doing it and here we are recording an episode and you're like yes

402
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,340
 You know quote air quotes episode. Let me tell you an alien story real quick

403
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:50,100
 You're like yes, you're settling in you're putting on your alien pajamas. You're like, all right. I fast forwarded fast all this stuff

404
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:56,140
 For this I found a website. It's specific the part of the I'm sure it does more than this

405
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,540
 But the website part that I saw was specifically alien encounters in the year

406
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,460
 1988 so I got some good ones

407
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,380
 Now this one takes place in Salzburg, Pennsylvania

408
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,700
 You're like ooh, this sounds awesome March 18th 1988

409
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,060
 This UFO comes down

410
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,820
 It's shaped like a V flying around

411
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,280
 Wait says on my notes. No sound was heard so

412
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,220
 There you go UFOs falling down so this guy

413
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,780
 We've got to make this quick because for a time you're like Jason. No, don't you dare make this quick

414
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,260
 You just spent all that time talking about eating food out of the sewer

415
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,780
 Technically was the gutter not the sewer but anyways, so this guy is traveling to his friend's house

416
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:52,500
 It doesn't say if he's walking skiing driving. It's from 1988. What do you expect this guy is going to his friend's house?

417
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,200
 The next thing you know is he's walking around in a grocery store. He's super disoriented. Oh, I don't know where I'm at

418
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,060
 I'm super hungry. It's basically me. He's basically me two years ago. He walks in the grocery store

419
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,260
 Disoriented he's hungry. He's thirsty and then he looks at his watch and he's like oh

420
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,100
 My god two hours have passed. I've just left for my friend's house. I know it

421
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,620
 But now I can't see anything

422
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:24,140
 Low blood sugar. He's eating food eating Twinkies. They're like sir sir. He didn't pay for that

423
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,740
 He's like a alien abduction get out of my way. He realizes two hours have passed now at first off

424
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,800
 He doesn't think that aliens are abducted. He does remember seeing

425
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,500
 Something fly over his car. So that kind of scared him then his car stalled

426
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,740
 But he's like it might have been connected to that

427
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,660
 It could have just been you know my watch broke and I'm just really really hungry

428
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,940
 I aren't eating all this food dropping gravy

429
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:51,440
 They're like sir. No, he's like, I don't know aliens are making me do this knocking gravy over

430
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,320
 Anyways, it's weird enough. He can't figure it out that he goes to a hypnotherapist and this is what he recalls

431
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,820
 He remembers his car stalling out in the middle of nowhere and then a fourth

432
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,780
 This is quite short honestly a four foot tall alien

433
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,020
 Wait, and he's not a gray because graze are normally short

434
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,260
 But it's his four foot tall alien with like a long head and pinchers

435
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:21,300
 Staffs have to have to have he walks up to the car. He walks up to the car. He's wearing clothes graze are always naked

436
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,220
 I've always heard that theory that you know the the idea that aliens are

437
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,620
 Demons that's a common theory, but the reason like reptilians will tend to wear clothes

438
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:36,060
 The reason why gray aliens don't wear clothes because they never were exposed to original sin

439
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,900
 It has to do with how humans ate the apple according to the Bible story humans ate the apple

440
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,780
 And then they realized they were shameful because they were naked and they started wearing clothes

441
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:52,180
 Other alien races wear clothes the reason why graze don't wear clothes is because they were never exposed to original sin

442
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,400
 I should actually do some more research on that. I think that'd be an interesting topic for show

443
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,460
 They're

444
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,780
 They're they're pure. They're pure beings

445
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,580
 They don't have shame in that sense that other species do but anyways

446
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:10,020
 I mean nudists there nudists you can say don't have shame, but it goes more deeper than that into the psyche

447
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,700
 So anyways this reptilian. He's wearing a purple robe purple bluish gray robe

448
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,100
 I don't know where I got purple from forget. I said purple bluish gray robe with a fringed bottom

449
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:27,100
 I gotta say this if a four foot tall alien with pinchers was coming at me. I'm not looking at the bottom of his robe

450
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:33,020
 I don't know where that deal to detail come from. It also had an insignia on its chest doesn't get a lot of detail

451
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,860
 This whole story doesn't have a lot of detail. This is where I thought was the most interesting and I honestly got a little too excited

452
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,360
 Because I misread it here's from this report

453
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,060
 The witness was then placed in a jar like object and then taken inside a large

454
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:55,360
 Cigar shaped craft so now I'm imagining like from a 1950s comic book a dude in a jar

455
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,820
 Like no, let me out

456
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,780
 It's like a cover of like a guy in a jar banging on it

457
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:06,100
 There's like an evil scientist or an alien standing over it pointing at it and it's like amazing tales 10 cents

458
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,620
 You can't tell me you didn't just picture that

459
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,460
 comic book cover in your head

460
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,420
 I was like dude a guy being placed in a what's a jar like object. Just say it's a jar. I guess there

461
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,180
 I guess a jar what he's in a jar of gravy. So now that's the cover. He's like whoa

462
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,940
 He's swimming in gravy. There's a scientist

463
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,100
 There's an evil guy pointing at a jar gravy and then in the background you see me running

464
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,860
 He's see me running towards the jar gravy to rescue him to knock it over. But anyways a jar

465
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,500
 I don't know what the difference is between a jar and jar like object, but anyways

466
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,660
 So this guy he realizes he's putting a big old jar and he's like pounding on the glass comic book covers going on and

467
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,380
 then

468
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,780
 I'm gonna read this sentence the way that it's written

469
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,020
 And then I'm gonna read it the way that I read it

470
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,860
 And he'll realize why I was more excited about doing this story

471
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,540
 So this is how it's written the next sentence and this is the last sentence actually of this description

472
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:05,180
 Inside the craft the witness was apparently examined by several similar beings

473
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,100
 So, you know, he's in a jar and then he sees a bunch of other four-foot aliens come up and tap on the glass selling

474
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:18,060
 Now when I read it originally I was like hot dog and story is gonna be amazing and I did a bunch of other research

475
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,460
 I couldn't find any more information about this encounter and what I just read you, but I was like this is amazing

476
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:30,640
 I'm super excited because this is what I thought that last sentence said inside the craft the witness apparently saw

477
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,100
 Several similar beans. So I was like, oh, there's other people in jars, dude

478
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,140
 So it's like he wakes up and he's in a jar and he looks there's like

479
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:46,980
 50 100 maybe a thousand jars of different alien species all banging on the side. That's so awesome, dude

480
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:53,500
 He's no I miss just misread it. He's just in a jar. There's aliens poking at it. I was like, damn it

481
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
 I was just reading it

482
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,700
 Actually before I started recording this episode that you know what that goes perfect with my bad day because I honestly thought I was

483
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:10,340
 Going to tell you a story about a guy trapped in a jar with a bunch of other aliens like these aliens were collecting species from around the

484
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,100
 Cosmos and they're all putting them in jars and then 10 minutes before I decided to record this episode. I

485
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,220
 Looked this story up. I read the last sentence and I went

486
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:24,980
 Still an interesting story. How many times do you hear about people being put in jars when they're still alive?

487
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,620
 But it would have been more interesting if there was a bunch of jars everywhere

488
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:35,640
 So that's the episode that's the episode I

489
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,100
 Liked it. I hope you guys liked it too. I'm having a better day. So I'm gonna go ahead and do my intro now
