1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 Is there really a train in Sweden that will take your soul if you step inside?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,900
 And then we traveled to Florida to take a look at a private school that attracted students from all over the world.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,900
 It was once known for taking bad kids and setting them straight.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,900
 But in the end it is remembered as a school that was taken over by demons today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,900
 *music*

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,900
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,900
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Zech.

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,900
 Zech, thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really helps out a lot. You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

10
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,900
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:00,900
 Zech, let's go ahead and start off in the Jason Jet, one of our newest vehicles. We're gonna leave behind Oregon.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,900
 We are flying all the way out to Sweden.

13
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,900
 *blows air*

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,900
 Breaking free of these dismal clouds. We're up in the bright blue sky.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,900
 We're flying high. We're headed out to Sweden. This was actually a recommendation from a Patreon supporter, Stefan Wallnerström.

16
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,900
 Very, very interesting story, so thank you so much for pointing the story out to me.

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,900
 And I got most of my information from an article written by a journalist named Eric Grundhäuser.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,900
 So I wanted to give him a tip of the hat as well.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,900
 Shorter. We are specifically going to Stockholm, Sweden. And the year is 1965, so we got on all our old clothes.

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,900
 1965 clothes we're just wearing rags now. We're walking around Sweden looking like a bunch of Oliver Twist characters.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,900
 The year is 1965. So as we're walking around begging people for porridge, we have to get into the city center.

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,900
 And to do that, we're gonna take the Stockholm Metro system. So this is our mass transit system.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,900
 So we're standing in line with a bunch of other people and we're waiting for the train to pull up.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,900
 Now, in Stockholm, all their trains were painted green, very, very well kept.

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,900
 Nice and clean as people polishing the windows. Very well kept up trains.

26
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,900
 But as we're standing here waiting, we see a train in the distance.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,900
 I don't think it wasn't Thomas Tinkens. And it's like a subway car, right?

28
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,900
 So much of subway cars. But anyways, we see it has a big face on the end of it.

29
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,900
 We see it coming down the track, but it's not green.

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,900
 We kind of look at each other. We're like, "What? That's kind of weird."

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,900
 It's not the only thing that's weird. It's not just that. This is a different color train.

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,900
 The end. This train is coming and it's green. So that is weird, but that's not the only weird thing.

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,900
 And then it comes up to the station.

34
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,900
 The doors open up wheel. Kind of hesitantly walk towards the door.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,900
 Even people who are longtime Metro users are like, "What? Intarnation? Is this?"

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,900
 Doors open up. We look in and these trains are not well kept up.

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,900
 It looks inside. It looks like someone did their best attempt at cleaning it.

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,900
 But you could tell where there used to be graffiti, had been quickly painted over.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,900
 Little bit of chewed gum had been quickly scraped off.

40
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,900
 Look at each other. We're like, "I thought these trains were supposed to be clean."

41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,900
 And I thought they were supposed to be green. So both of those things are weird.

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,900
 Now, a weird thing happens. Nobody wants to get on this train.

43
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,900
 This isn't what the trains are supposed to look like. Everyone's a little creeped out by this thing.

44
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,900
 One passenger goes, "I gotta get to work. I'm a hard surgeon and the guy's dying right now.

45
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
 I'm gonna get on the train right now. I'm not scared of no ghosts."

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,900
 He gets on the train, but everyone else stays on the platform.

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
 And the doors close.

48
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:34,900
 Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugg

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:04:04,900
 Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,900
 It was a ghost train. It stole the souls of those who stepped on it.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,900
 That poor, poor heart surgeon. The poor, poor guy who needed the heart surgeon more so.

52
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,900
 But if you stepped on the silver arrow, you'll never get off.

53
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,900
 Since it didn't have a regular schedule, it wasn't something that people could predict.

54
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,900
 It's not something someone could go, "Uh-oh, I'm gonna miss the green train."

55
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,900
 And you're trying to get to the station real quick and you're like, "Oh, man, that's the soul-sucking train."

56
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
 And as it comes around, you're like, "I'm gonna be late for work again."

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,900
 You just didn't know when it was gonna show up. You'd be waiting for a train.

58
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
 And sometimes you would get a train at your work.

59
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,900
 And sometimes you'd get a train to eternal damnation.

60
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,900
 And all of these myths started spreading.

61
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,900
 Eventually, somebody found out where the train car headed.

62
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
 Kim Ling Station.

63
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,900
 Now, Kim Ling Station was a station... was a deserted train station.

64
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,900
 That Stockholm Metro had started building at one point because there was supposed to be this business expansion in the area.

65
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,900
 And then they just never finished it. It's a full train station that's pretty much abandoned, covered in graffiti.

66
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
 That must be where the silver arrow is dropping people off at.

67
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,900
 The rumor begins to spread now that that station as well was cursed.

68
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,900
 So these rumors grew over the years. The train will steal your soul.

69
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,900
 If you're lucky, it'll drop you off in the bad side of town.

70
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
 It's just on the outskirts, right? Then you gotta walk back to your job or something like that.

71
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
 But also that train station was cursed.

72
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,900
 What's interesting about this story is it's 100% true.

73
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
 The facts behind it is 100% true.

74
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,900
 There really is a silver arrow train, and that train station really does exist.

75
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
 The train station, I kind of gave away the ending.

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,900
 So the train station was built and they just never had the corporate expansion in the area.

77
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,900
 So Stockholm Metro just said, "We're not gonna send any trains there."

78
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,900
 That train station is out of order. It's a fully built, fully functional train station,

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,900
 but since no one's gone there, it's been taken over by the Hobo Empire.

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,900
 The silver arrow is actually a real train. It's not a phantom.

81
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,900
 It's not something that people made up. What happened was in 1965, Stockholm Metro goes,

82
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,900
 "You know what? We have these really nice green trains. They're quite expensive."

83
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:22,900
 Maybe, maybe we could save some money by buying this old unpainted train.

84
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,900
 It's an old silver unpainted train. We got eight cars. You got it as a discount.

85
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
 You buy four cars. You get the next four free.

86
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,900
 So we're just gonna put it on our lines and then, you know, people in Sweden,

87
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,900
 they're not a bunch of superstitious rubes, right?

88
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
 When it pulls up, everyone will hop on it.

89
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
 They might complain that obviously it looks a little more junky,

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,900
 but it saved us so much money, everything's cool.

91
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,900
 What happened was nobody wanted to ride it.

92
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,900
 It was actually that I'm costing them more money because now they have a fully operational train

93
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,900
 on different routes that nobody will use.

94
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,900
 We all know. We've been talking about urban legends and stuff like this for a long time.

95
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,900
 First off, a lot of times we cover urban legends that have no factual basis,

96
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,900
 like the melon heads, which was a great story, but they're like in Ohio

97
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,900
 and states next to Ohio, not a big geography guy,

98
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
 but these guys are giant melon heads running around and sometimes they're cannibals

99
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,900
 and sometimes they were mutants or they were always mutants.

100
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,900
 People just weren't born with melon heads and by hunting them off to work,

101
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
 gonna go eat people, there were always mutants living in the wilderness,

102
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,900
 but sometimes they were mutants created by doctors,

103
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
 sometimes they were in bread hillbillies.

104
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,900
 There was no factual basis for that story outside of an older brother

105
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
 trying to scare his younger brother.

106
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,900
 That was it. Making these stories up for generations.

107
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,900
 This story was real. There really is that station that's still abandoned to this day.

108
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
 There really was that train.

109
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,900
 They took it apart. It no longer exists,

110
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,900
 but the way these legends work is that now it is a ghost train.

111
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,900
 So now the younger generations totally believe that this is a real thing.

112
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,900
 That if you stand at a train station for too long,

113
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,900
 or you've done something wrong, or your soul is ripe and ready to be devoured,

114
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
 the silver arrow pulls up.

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,900
 Even though it physically doesn't exist at all anymore, the legend still does.

116
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
 And that actually helps the legend.

117
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,900
 Obviously if you told your little brother that if you get on that train,

118
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
 you never get off.

119
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
 And then you see a silver train get on and you really, really have to go to the bathroom,

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,900
 and the only bathroom is three miles away,

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
 and you're like, "Oh, this doesn't devour my soul,

122
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
 'cause it's gonna devour a full bladder as well."

123
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
 The train takes you and then drops you off at a McDonald's

124
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
 and you hop out and go to the bathroom.

125
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
 Then you know the curse isn't real.

126
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
 You know that it's fake. You've actually tested it.

127
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
 Because the train doesn't exist, you can never test it.

128
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,900
 You will always be told the story about Sally Steverson,

129
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,900
 who got on the train in the sixth grade and was never seen again.

130
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,900
 'Cause you can't test it anymore.

131
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:57,900
 It's very, very interesting when we can find the origin of a curse,

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
 or a ghost story, or some sort of item,

133
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
 and it be true it wasn't completely made up.

134
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
 And now that it's destroyed,

135
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,900
 the legend will just grow and grow because it can never be disputed.

136
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,900
 So if you ever are in Sweden and see a silver train nowadays,

137
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
 don't get on it. Don't get on it.

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
 In 1965, you would have been totally fine,

139
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,900
 but nowadays, that one may end up stealing your soul.

140
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
 Probably not.

141
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
 It's probably just Sweden trying to save some more money,

142
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,900
 but that is the story of the Silver Arrow.

143
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
 Great name for that.

144
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
 Interesting story. Thank you, Stefan.

145
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
 So we are now walking around Sweden.

146
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
 It's pretty dope.

147
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,900
 Walking around Sweden, we're eating bags of Swedish fish.

148
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,900
 We're like, "Oh, I was wondering where this disgusting candy came from."

149
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,900
 Now we just have to find out where candy corn comes from

150
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
 and nuke that country.

151
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
 And while we're walking around Sweden,

152
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
 I point at a movie theater,

153
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
 and I'm nudging you. I'm nudging you.

154
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
 I'm like, "Hey, dude, look. Look at that movie theater."

155
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
 You're like, "Yeah, dude, it's a movie theater."

156
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
 I'm like, "No, look what it says on the marquee."

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
 And then I turn to you.

158
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
 I go, "Don't look at the movie theater."

159
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,900
 Now look at this, and I hold up

160
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,900
 a set of DVDs. Here we go.

161
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900

 and much, much more.

184
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
 You might say, if you don't purchase this collector's pack,

185
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,900
 you can tell him off-script.

186
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,900
 You could say, you could say,

187
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
 if you don't buy this collector's pack,

188
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,900
 you just might be Psycho.

189
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,900
 I added that in.

190
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,900
 Don't blame Universal for that.

191
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
 Just wait until the next one.

192
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
 I'll make a puns for the other.

193
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
 I don't know what I'm going to do about Rear Window.

194
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
 But I'll figure out something.

195
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
 I'll make a puns, hopefully I'll remember too for the rest of the week.

196
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
 Zech, let us leave behind Sweden.

197
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
 We are headed out to sunny, sunny Florida.

198
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,900
 We're leaving behind Sweden and our carbon helicopter.

199
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,900
 We're heading out to Florida.

200
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,900
 I actually found this article just recently.

201
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
 I got it on Medium.com.

202
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
 It was written by Jeff Maitz.

203
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
 That's where I got all my information.

204
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
 So again, I always like to credit the journalists

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
 who do on the ground reporting.

206
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
 Bring that carbon helicopter nice and low.

207
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
 We're now flying over sunny, sunny Florida.

208
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,900
 It's October 25th, 1979.

209
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,900
 We're headed to Little Havana, Florida.

210
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,900
 And in Little Havana, there is a school, a private academy,

211
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,900
 known as the Miami Aerospace Academy.

212
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
 It's the middle of the school day.

213
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
 We're going to land that carbon helicopter

214
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 a considerable distance from the school

215
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
 because I know what's going to happen.

216
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
 We walk up to the school.

217
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
 I guess we could have landed closer

218
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
 because now we're walking to the school.

219
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
 We're walking to the school

220
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
 and we're looking through the chain link fence.

221
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
 It's just a normal thing.

222
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,900
 We see a man named Joseph Wolfe.

223
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,900
 His designation was disciplinary instructor.

224
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
 So that should kind of let you know

225
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
 how this school was operated.

226
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
 It was his job.

227
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,900
 His only job was keeping students in line.

228
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
 So he's out in the schoolyard

229
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
 leading around a bunch of kids doing drills,

230
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
 doing like physical fitness drills.

231
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
 Then all of a sudden,

232
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
 even though they're outside in the field,

233
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,900
 they start to hear a commotion in the school.

234
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
 It sounds like panic.

235
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
 It sounds like hundreds of kids

236
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,900
 screaming, yelling, and running.

237
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
 They had really heavy shoes on.

238
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
 You could hear that from outside.

239
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
 And then all of a sudden,

240
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
 (imitates gunshot)

241
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
 Joseph looks up and on the second story of the school,

242
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,900
 he sees a kid jump through the window

243
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,900
 and fall directly on a school bus.

244
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
 (imitates gunshot)

245
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
 Joseph looks at that and he thinks,

246
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,900
 "That kid is crippled for life."

247
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
 Like that fall, the impact on top of that bus,

248
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
 he's done for.

249
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
 And then that kid stands up

250
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,900
 and just begins to casually walk off the bus.

251
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
 Let's go back in time,

252
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,900
 or back in Florida right now,

253
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,900
 and there is a man named Evaristo Marina.

254
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
 He was the general director of public order

255
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,900
 in pre-Revolution Cuba.

256
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,900
 He worked his way up to that position.

257
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
 He was a power hungry man.

258
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
 And in pre-Revolution Cuba,

259
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
 the world was his oyster.

260
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,900
 In college, Marina had an arch enemy,

261
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
 someone that he debated politics with all the time.

262
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
 The friends would be like,

263
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
 "Oh great, those two weirdos are at it again.

264
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
 Let's go to the bar."

265
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
 And these guys would argue for hours and hours.

266
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,900
 Marina's arch enemy in college was Fidel Castro.

267
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,900
 Not good to pick fights with future dictators, right?

268
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,900
 So when Fidel Castro does actually overthrow

269
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,900
 the government of Cuba,

270
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,900
 Marina is one of the first dudes on his hit list.

271
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
 So Marina fleets the country, he goes to Florida.

272
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
 Now in 1959, he ends up in Miami.

273
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 He tries to go into politics

274
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
 and he tries to build up a reputation

275
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,900
 so he enters the Army's Junior Reserves Officer Training Corps.

276
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
 So he has this nice uniform.

277
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,900
 He feels like he's on his way back into a seat of political power.

278
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,900
 But until he gets there, he comes up with an admittedly brilliant idea.

279
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,900
 So in Florida, apparently, anyone could start a private school.

280
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,900
 Like you show up a couple bucks, you could set up a private school.

281
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
 And he's sitting there and he goes,

282
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
 "You know, I should set up a military academy.

283
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
 Because I got this nice uniform.

284
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
 I'm actually in the military.

285
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,900
 So I have those connections."

286
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
 It's not like he was a hybrid in general, but I can do this.

287
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
 I can set up this military school.

288
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,900
 He sets up the Miami Aerospace Academy.

289
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,900
 He has the students wear military uniforms.

290
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,900
 He drills into the kids, hard work equals hard results.

291
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,900
 And if you goof off, you're getting beat up.

292
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
 They had a paddle called Big Bin.

293
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,900
 It was a cricket bat with holes drilled in it

294
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 that cuts down on wind resistance.

295
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,900
 And he would have his disciplinary instructor walk around with this paddle

296
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,900
 and just beat kids up with it.

297
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
 It was horrible.

298
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,900
 But the parents loved it because they were taking these kids who were bad kids

299
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,900
 and they were coming home and they're like, "Yes, sir. No, sir."

300
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
 They weren't saying no at all.

301
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
 They're like, "Yes, sir."

302
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,900
 The parents are like, "Whoa, dude, this is really working out.

303
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
 Like our kid was having trouble with school before.

304
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
 Now he's accelerating in all of his classes.

305
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
 He has a hard time sitting down.

306
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
 But other than that, everything seems to be going A-OK.

307
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,900
 The Miami Aerospace Academy begins to get an influx of students.

308
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
 He begins advertising in South America saying,

309
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,900
 "Send your kids up to my academy. I'm going to turn them around.

310
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
 If they're already on the straight and narrow,

311
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 I'm going to put them on an even more straight and narrow.

312
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,900
 My students excel at everything."

313
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,900
 Plus, there was this promise of an Aerospace Academy.

314
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
 See, maybe it would lead to greater things.

315
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 So he had all these students coming in from South America.

316
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
 He had all these local students coming in.

317
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,900
 The parents loved this dude.

318
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,900
 But the students weren't a huge fan of him.

319
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
 Now some of them really looked up to him.

320
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
 He called himself L-General.

321
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,900
 A lot of these students really looked up to him as a powerful man.

322
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
 They didn't have fathers.

323
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
 He was that father figure.

324
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,900
 But he also ruled by force and paranoia.

325
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
 Very, very dangerous combination.

326
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,900
 You knew that the disciplinary instructor was walking around with big bins,

327
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
 so that would kind of keep you in line.

328
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,900
 There was also a rumor going around that there were hidden microphones everywhere.

329
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,900
 Every word you said he would hear.

330
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,900
 So you didn't ever speak bad about him or the facility at all.

331
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,900
 Which would create an air of total obedience.

332
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
 If you thought something was up at the school,

333
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,900
 you thought maybe we shouldn't be getting beat for these minor infractions.

334
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
 If nobody else was saying that,

335
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
 you would just assume you were the oddball, right?

336
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
 You're like, "Oh, no, I hope that isn't...

337
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
 I hope being an oddball is not on the infraction list."

338
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
 He ended up buying an F-84 jet.

339
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,900
 People say they don't know how he got this.

340
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,900
 And a funny side note, as he's having the jet brought to the academy,

341
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
 they actually had it drive down.

342
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
 It wasn't like a guy taxiing it down the road,

343
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 but they had it on a truck, on a flatbed.

344
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,900
 And as it was going through Miami, it was scraping cars.

345
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,900
 Because it's a plane! It's a giant fighter jet, right?

346
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,900
 So its roads aren't built to have combat aircraft go down it.

347
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
 So it was all scraping up cars and stuff like that.

348
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,900
 There's nothing to do with storage. I just thought that was super funny.

349
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
 But anyways, he has this jet. He puts it right out in the front entrance.

350
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,900
 Kids are always like, "Oh, maybe someday I'll fly a jet like that."

351
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,900
 But we start to see this go from a very strict atmosphere

352
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 to people rebel in the only ways that they can.

353
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,900
 And the only way to really rebel against this environment

354
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
 was to tell stories about it.

355
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,900
 Kids would be standing out and they'd be looking at that F-84.

356
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,900
 You know, the guy who was in this plane originally,

357
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
 he burned to death.

358
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,900
 When this plane landed, it was on fire.

359
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,900
 The pilot couldn't get out. He burned in the cockpit.

360
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
 His plane's haunted.

361
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,900
 You know some of the teachers practice Santoria.

362
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,900
 Oh, I paused there so you guys could get that song out of your head.

363
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,900
 You know some of the teachers here, they practice Santoria.

364
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
 I found this burnt penny.

365
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,900
 And that's a sign of a Santoria protection spell, burned pennies.

366
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,900
 Now it was a little more than just burned pennies and rumors of this haunted jet.

367
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
 People were finding dead chickens.

368
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,900
 I mean, I guess I'm going to start it with this part right.

369
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,900
 People were legitimately finding dead chickens with red ribbons wrapped around their neck,

370
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
 which is a Santoria spell.

371
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,900
 Now in this community in Little Havana, and it may be everywhere Santoria is practiced,

372
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,900
 but the Santorians, I don't know if that's what they're called,

373
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,900
 but the people who practice Santoria would wear all white.

374
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
 Kids would go, "Maybe the teachers wear white when they're at home,

375
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
 see at school they have to wear this uniform."

376
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 And you can't tell who's actually practicing Santoria.

377
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,900
 We know somebody does though, because we're finding all these dead chickens and burnt pennies.

378
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,900
 So in this atmosphere of total rule, total power,

379
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 kids begin to rebel by spreading these rumors.

380
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,900
 It's not helping that there's ribbon chicken every day in the cafeteria.

381
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
 Red ribbon chicken, Monday through Friday.

382
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,900
 But they also then begin to practice magic themselves.

383
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,900
 So kids would show up and hush tones so the microphones don't pick them up.

384
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,900
 They'd bust out a Ouija board when they were all alone,

385
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,900
 try to communicate with the departed.

386
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,900
 Girls would be in the bathroom playing that classic game Bloody Mary.

387
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,900
 They never really knew what would be scarier if Bloody Mary came out of the mirror,

388
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,900
 or if a disciplinary instructor found out what they were up to,

389
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,900
 but see the danger made it even more enticing.

390
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,900
 There was rumors that teacher was doing tarot readings in the class.

391
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,900
 In early 1979, Joseph Wolfe comes on board.

392
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
 Now he said, "I'm not down with hitting the kids."

393
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
 When he came in, he goes, "I don't want to use Big Ben.

394
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,900
 I think we can just focus on the kids, yell at them a bunch,

395
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
 and we can get them in line.

396
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
 I'm not down with hitting these kids."

397
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
 The previous disciplinary instructor just disappeared one day.

398
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
 She never showed up at work.

399
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
 Big Ben sat there in Marina's office.

400
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
 Hadn't been used since.

401
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,900
 The kids were curious about what had happened to such a powerful figure at the school,

402
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
 but who would they ask?

403
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,900
 Just asking the question would result in disciplinary action.

404
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
 But Joseph Wolfe comes in and he goes,

405
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
 "I'm not down with that whole corporal punishment thing.

406
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
 There's another way to deal with this stuff."

407
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,900
 October 25, 1979, it's 12.15 p.m.

408
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,900
 And there's this teacher she's leading her students out of one class

409
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
 down the hallway to another one of their classes.

410
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
 And as they're walking down the hallway,

411
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,900
 [humming]

412
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,900
 they hear a girl crying in the girl's bathroom.

413
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
 The teacher's like, "What? Oh, man.

414
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
 So what's going on in there?

415
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
 [humming]

416
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
 What's going on in there?"

417
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
 [humming]

418
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
 Eventually, the teacher has to force her way into the bathroom.

419
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,900
 And there's this young girl sobbing in front of the mirror.

420
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
 She grabs the girl she brings her out and she's like,

421
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
 "Listen, we'll just walk with my whole group of students.

422
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,900
 I'm going to drop off my students and I'll take you to the office."

423
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
 The girl's hysterical at this point.

424
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,900
 Now, as she's dragging this crying girl down the hallway with her class,

425
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,900
 they hear what could only be described as a ruckus.

426
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,900
 The sound of a bunch of boys getting wild.

427
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
 Like a pack of animals.

428
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900
 They don't know exactly where it's coming from, but they hear the noise.

429
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
 Now, her class is starting to get a little antsy.

430
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,900
 There's a crying sobbing girl next to them.

431
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,900
 Now, they're just hearing rampaging kids somewhere in the school.

432
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,900
 They start to panic and she's like, "Just go through this hallway door.

433
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,900
 We'll get you to your other class. I'll figure out what's going on."

434
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,900
 As they go through this main hallway door, the cafeteria is empty and out.

435
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
 Lunchtime is over.

436
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,900
 And you have two groups of kids kind of push into each other.

437
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,900
 Now, they all hear the noises.

438
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
 The girl's crying is getting louder.

439
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
 Nobody knows what's going on.

440
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
 Panic sets in.

441
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,900
 You are trapped in a mass of bodies.

442
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,900
 And you just hear sobbing and chaos all around you.

443
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,900
 Students at random fall to their knees and begin to sob uncontrollably

444
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,900
 as other kids split off in every direction trying to figure out a way to get out of there.

445
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,900
 They're not curious about what's going on.

446
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
 They need to leave this building.

447
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,900
 Joseph Wolfe is outside the building with his kids that he's doing drill exercises with.

448
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,900
 And he hears that crash of the window and sees the boy fall.

449
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,900
 No, really, jump out of the second-story window and land on top of the bus

450
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,900
 and then get up like it was nothing and gets off the bus.

451
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
 Joseph runs over there.

452
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,900
 He knows this kid needs medical attention.

453
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,900
 And he goes to grab the boy to hold him in place, figuring the kids in shock.

454
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,900
 He grabs the kid, the kid shrugs him off, and that really shocks Joseph

455
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,900
 because he knows how strong he is in comparison with the teenager.

456
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,900
 So he goes to grab this kid again, the kid shrugs him off again.

457
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
 He can't understand it.

458
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,900
 He ends up getting behind the boy and getting the kid in a bear hug.

459
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,900
 He's like, "If the bus is impacting to kill you, I will."

460
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,900
 He gets the kid in the bear hug and holding on to him is almost impossible.

461
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,900
 This kid is superhumanly strong.

462
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,900
 Joseph Wolf said that as he's holding on to this boy, trying to contain him,

463
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:06,900
 the boy's head rotates around so it's looking at him in the eyes.

464
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,900
 Joseph Wolf lets go of the kid and the kid just runs across the field,

465
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,900
 hops a fence and disappears into the neighborhood.

466
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:23,900
 That part, that part honestly sounds unbelievable, physically at least, unbelievable.

467
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,900
 And I think I would be more willing to discount it if another student had seen it.

468
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,900
 And if this guy, Joseph Wolf, did work at the school and he hadn't told the story for 30 years,

469
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,900
 he did end up telling the story for the article, but he did work there.

470
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:46,900
 It sounds unbelievable, but what he's implying is that this kid was possessed by some sort of demon.

471
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,900
 But he actually has bigger problems right now because, well, you just saw a kid's head rotate around

472
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:00,900
 and then run off after falling on top of a bus because now he's hearing more windows shatter behind him.

473
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,900
 And kids are running out of the school in every single direction. It is utter chaos.

474
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,900
 Kids are screaming, "The demon's in there, the demon's in him, the demon's in me."

475
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,900
 It got out of the Ouija board. No, it didn't. It's Bloody Mary. She's here to kill us all.

476
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,900
 It's utter chaos. This is an interesting detail to the story as well. As this is all going on,

477
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,900
 you have a bunch of kids that might be in the midst of some sort of mass panic episode,

478
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,900
 but as kids are talking about demons and Bloody Mary and stuff like that and they're totally flipping out,

479
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,900
 you know what the teachers are doing? They're quitting on the spot.

480
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,900
 They're just like, "I'm done." And they're walking and they're getting in their cars, they're leaving.

481
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,900
 They're leaving the kids there. If you thought it was just a bunch of kids going crazy,

482
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:50,900
 I think you would do your best to try to wrangle them in. However, if you thought there was a bunch of demons running around,

483
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,900
 you'd quit. You'd be like, "No, I'm done. I don't need to come back here. There's a bunch of demons.

484
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,900
 You don't get workman's comp when you're possessed." Teachers are quitting on the spot and they never return to the place.

485
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:10,900
 Now, Joseph Wolfe is still trying to figure out what's going on. He runs into the building and he sees all the chaos that's been caused.

486
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,900
 At this point, most of the kids are outside of the building, almost all of them.

487
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,900
 He gets to a room and he sees a teenage boy and a teenage girl sitting in the room and between them is a Ouija board.

488
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:26,900
 It's like, "What are you doing? We were just looking at it. We weren't playing with it. We were just looking at it."

489
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:33,900
 He's like, "I don't know if you guys have ears or eyes, but the whole school's evacuated

490
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,900
 and everyone thinks there's a bunch of demons running around. I don't think you should be next to the Ouija board."

491
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:44,900
 So he takes them out of the classroom. Now, they ask him to take her home.

492
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,900
 They're a boyfriend and girlfriend, this teenage girl and teenage boy. And he does.

493
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,900
 He says, "Yeah, I'll take you guys home." At this point, parents are picking up their kids and they're saying, "My kid's never coming back here."

494
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,900
 Marina thinks this is all some sort of stunt because he's currently in the midst of a political election.

495
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
 So he was always trying to get that political power.

496
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,900
 He believes that this was all fake, that his political enemies put the students up to this or something like that.

497
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:14,900
 Joseph's like, "I don't really care about that stuff right now. I'm going to take these kids home because the parents are not picking them up."

498
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
 So he takes the kids back to the girls' house.

499
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,900
 The girl says, "Can you wait till my parents get home because it's kind of spooky?"

500
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, just a little spooky, right?"

501
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,900
 She saw a kid survive a near fatal fall and then wrestle me off.

502
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,900
 He said he was there until about 8 p.m. He's sitting there with these two teenagers.

503
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
 And the power goes out.

504
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,900
 Coincidence? Yeah, possibly, right?

505
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,900
 They're sitting in this-- Probably not, though, considering the events early in the day.

506
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,900
 Joseph said he's sitting in this house with these two teenagers. The power's completely out.

507
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,900
 And in the darkness, he hears the boy and the girl begin to cry.

508
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,900
 He's probably a little close himself, honestly.

509
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,900
 But he goes, "What's going on? Like, why are you guys upset? Why are you guys crying?"

510
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,900
 And that's when the boy admits, "We weren't just looking at the Ouija board. We were playing with it."

511
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,900
 And Joseph realizes that something's really, really awk-ing.

512
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,900
 His spidey sense wasn't working this day. He shouldn't have ever taken the kids home, but he realizes something's wrong.

513
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,900
 He said in the darkened house, which he'd never been into before, he's trying to find the front door,

514
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,900
 and when he does find it, it won't open.

515
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,900
 He said he almost had to kick the door down to get out of the house.

516
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,900
 He runs, he gets in his car, he turns the key, and he said it felt like my car didn't even have a transmission.

517
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,900
 Nothing worked on it. And I'm sitting outside this house.

518
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:47,900
 And then finally the car starts up. He goes, "I left that house, and I never ever saw those kids again. I quit the next day."

519
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,900
 The school, for the most part, was finished at that point.

520
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,900
 It ended up, they lost that facility. A bunch of parents told their kids out of the school.

521
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:00,900
 I mean, of course, right? Even if it was a mass panic, you'd be a little worried about that.

522
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,900
 People started questioning, "Hey, what actually happened?" Like, "I might be willing to put my kid back in school."

523
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
 "If you can explain what happened."

524
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,900
 My son says, "You have secret microphones everywhere."

525
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,900
 "You should be able to hear like your political enemies whispering into kids ears."

526
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,900
 Like that guy from Willy Wonka trying to get the gop stopper.

527
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,900
 You should be able to hear what happened leading up to these events.

528
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,900
 And that's when it turns out there were no microphones.

529
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,900
 It was a lie to keep kids on edge.

530
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,900
 He was able to keep some form of the school going.

531
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,900
 He had to move it to an abandoned, like, strip mall.

532
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:40,900
 And it was there that a six-year-old boy one night broke out of the school, and the cops got a call.

533
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,900
 And they caught this six-year-old boy trying to climb the fence.

534
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,900
 And as the cops were taking him back to his dorm, the boy said, "Don't. There's monsters in there."

535
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:57,900
 Unfortunately, though, these are the monsters we all know exist, whether you're skeptic or not.

536
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:06,900
 In his need to rebuild the school and to get more students, he began taking in kids with serious criminal records.

537
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,900
 Including one of them who had murdered his own father at the age of, I think, 15.

538
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,900
 And so you had a group of sexual predators in this school.

539
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,900
 And they were molesting the weaker, younger students.

540
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,900
 That was the end of Miami Aerospace Academy.

541
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,900
 The demons you could go, it was mass panic.

542
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,900
 It was something people were-- one person freaked out and then everyone freaked out.

543
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,900
 This was an ongoing crime, one of the worst crimes possible.

544
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,900
 That was the end of the school and Marina's political career.

545
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,900
 That's the story of Miami Aerospace Academy.

546
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,900
 It has a dark ending with that, with the real monsters out there.

547
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,900
 But let's go back to the demon story real quick here.

548
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,900
 Because I find that there-- I think there's a fascinating note in it.

549
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,900
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second. Let's wrap it up like this.

550
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,900
 Those two kids sitting at the Ouija board, Joseph says that he recognized him.

551
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,900
 He didn't remember their names and he took them home. Lights went out.

552
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,900
 He bounced, left the two kids there.

553
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,900
 They didn't attempt to follow him out, either.

554
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,900
 They stayed in the darkened house as he's kicking down the door, gets in his car, drives away.

555
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
 They stay in the house. Conspiracy cap on.

556
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,900
 Those two kids weren't students of that school.

557
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:31,900
 He'd see the students around the school, in the cafeteria, in the back of a classroom, walking down the hallway.

558
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,900
 But they weren't students.

559
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,900
 They were summoned by the students' pain, though.

560
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,900
 They could have been tulpas. They could have been demons.

561
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:48,900
 They could have been brought into existence through the use of dark magic rituals.

562
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,900
 When you're powerless, you will use anything it takes to have a tiny shred of power.

563
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,900
 And there are a few things more powerful than hate and fear combined.

564
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:08,900
 These kids came into our world for one reason.

565
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,900
 To free the rest of the student body.

566
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
 And they held up there into the bargain.

567
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,900
 But what does a spirit of vengeance do when that vengeance has been wrought?

568
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
 Do they just disappear?

569
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,900
 Or does it seek for more hatred and more fear to feed on?

570
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,900
 They didn't have parents to pick them up, because they didn't have parents.

571
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:42,900
 That house was just a house of some random family that wasn't there when Joseph Wolf pulled up with these two kids.

572
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,900
 And they sat in that house after Joseph left.

573
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:50,900
 They sat in the dark, wondering what was going to come next.

574
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,900
 When the family that did live in that house came home, everything was perfectly normal.

575
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:03,900
 They thought it was a little weird that the door seemed to be a little wobbly from repeated kicking, but nothing that could be fixed.

576
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,900
 They walk into a house, it's exactly how they left it.

577
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,900
 And that night, the parents go to bed, their young children go to bed,

578
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,900
 and their teenage daughter is sitting in her bedroom working on her homework.

579
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,900
 And that's when she hears a noise in the hallway outside of her bedroom.

580
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,900
 She sits up, she hears it again.

581
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,900
 She walks down that hallway and sees the bathroom light is on.

582
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,900
 She tests the knob and it's unlocked.

583
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,900
 She walks into her bathroom, and no one's in there.

584
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:44,900
 But then, she sees the image of a young girl in her mirror.

585
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,900
 A girl she's never seen before.

586
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,900
 She should be startled, but she feels comforted.

587
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,900
 She feels like this image in the mirror is her friend.

588
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,900
 Because despite all outward appearances, this house is not a peaceful house.

589
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,900
 Bad things happen here sometimes.

590
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,900
 And she feels like the girl in the mirror knows all the secrets of her family.

591
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,900
 And as she stares in that mirror, she starts to wish her life could be different

592
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,900
 and that she could be free from this misery.

593
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,900
 She doesn't say it out loud, but the reflection can almost read her mind.

594
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:35,900
 Because right when she thinks it, the reflection smiles.
