00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 Today all those recent egg jokes will make sense as I cover an excellent conspiracy theory.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,120
 And then we take a look at the newest conspiracy theory going around.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,840
 Did Sean P. Diddy Combs write a book? That's not the conspiracy, although that's bizarre enough.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,240
 Did Sean P. Diddy Combs, famous East Coast rapper/producer,

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,680
 did he recently write a book called The Adreno Chrome Witch that finally exposed the secrets

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,280
 of the dark ones today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:44,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,560
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm gonna have a really great day

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,720
 if I can get all these episodes recorded in time to go on vacation. You guys won't even notice

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,520
 I'm gone. We'll have one week of repeats. But in the real world, I will be sipping my ties

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,440
 on a couch in California watching every sci-fi channel movie ever. A couple of Polina brothers

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,680
 throwing in there. It's gonna be great. Now as the marathon begins and I try to get these

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,720
 episodes recorded, not rushing them, they're quality episodes, I want to give a shout out to our newest

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,520
 Patreon supporter, David Laz. David, thank you so much for supporting the show. We're all saluting,

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,440
 you thank you. That means a lot. Since you've supported the show, today you're going to be our

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,280
 captain, our pilot, our escort through these crazy stories. If you can't support the Patreon,

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,440
 that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. That will really, really help out a lot.

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,560
 David, let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We're going for a ride. We're headed down to San Francisco.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,280
 We're in San Francisco and we're gonna meet a guy named Josh Tetrick. And we walk into his lab.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,280
 We're like, "Hey, what's up?" "Shh. I'm working on something." He says as he adjusts his nerd

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,320
 glasses over his face. "Hmm. What are you working on, Josh? I just told you to shhh."

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,080
 Puts his finger to our lips. All of our lips, everyone who's listening right now has a finger

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,400
 on our lips. And he's steady in this empty jar of mayonnaise and he goes, "There is a way. I had a

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,200
 dream. An angel came to me in a vision last night. Did you know that eggs are a required ingredient

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,680
 in mayonnaise? You have to have at least one egg in it. And 65% of it has to be vegetable oil."

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,360
 And then as disgusting as it is, that's 100% true for the FDA to declare it as mayonnaise.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,920
 Basically, it's just a jar of vegetable oil and one egg cracked in it. But he's like,

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,200
 "But for the vegetarian market, I must find a better way. I must find a better one."

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 I'm glad he sounds like the Riddler trying to figure out a plan to be Batman. I must find a

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,320
 better way to get this available for kids. It's not fair that vegans don't get to eat this disgusting

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,120
 food, right? It's just not fair. So he makes his own mayonnaise using like chickpeas and a bunch of

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,640
 other like vegetarian stuff. Carrots, whatever. Puts it in there. He comes out with this product.

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,320
 The product in Zygostria Different Names. I think it was originally called like Beyond Mayo.

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,280
 Now it's called Just Mayo. And he's like, "Ta-da!" And he's like holding his suspenders.

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
 He got during the montage of him developing it. Now he's holding his suspenders. He's a little

36
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,800
 entrepreneur. He goes, "Now I have Just Mayo." And it starts flying off the shelves. Vegans,

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,800
 vegetarians, people who have no taste buds. Everyone are running to the store to buy Just Mayo.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,520
 But according to the FDA, like I said, it has to have an egg in it. And you can mess with classics,

39
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,560
 but sometimes the classics have allies. The lightning storm. There's a huge building

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,000
 somewhere in America. It's in a swamp. It's in the shape of a giant egg. It's basically the

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,200
 Legion of Dooms headquarters, but an egg. And inside this headquarters, there's an 18-person body

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,280
 called the American Egg Board. And at the head of it is Joanne Ivy. She's the chief executive.

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
 And she's standing there. She has like this long purple cape on. She has these little

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,960
 henchmen running around her. She turns around. She's like, "Drats! Just Mayo is biting into our

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:18,720
 profits because we get a percentage for every egg shipped, but there's less eggs being shipped.

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,920
 If you do the math, we're getting less money. If eggs aren't being used in Mayo, and people are

47
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
 buying this Just Mayo, then we're losing money. So we got to do something about that.

48
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,920
 Now while they're trying to figure out what their battle plan is to take down Just Mayo,

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,960
 Helmins actually sues Just Mayo. They say it's false advertising. You have to have an egg in it.

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,520
 That's not an egg. And I mean, it's so ridiculous. Basically, you actually had a trial. Like you had

51
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,640
 like juries get selected for this. You had a judge. Had to look through this on its dock. And

52
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,280
 he's like, "Ugh, wish I had another one of those triple homicides, but black Mayo. I hope they

53
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,520
 don't make us taste it. I hope they don't do a taste test during the trial. It's all going on

54
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
 because you can't call it Mayo because it's not real Mayo." And he's saying it's Just Mayo. It's

55
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,200
 not even close to Mayo. Eventually though, the company, Just Mayo says, "Okay, fine. We're going

56
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,040
 to stop declaring our Mayo." This is so weird. I'm surprised that this worked. Basically,

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,000
 we're going to stop calling it Just Mayo. And Helmins is like, "Okay, that works."

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,200
 They change the name to Just Mayo as in justice. As in bringing about justice to the world. So it's

59
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,120
 no longer Just Mayo. It's Just Mayo. I'm going to start a cereal called Cheerios. I'm going to

60
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
 start marketing my own cereal called Cheerios. People go, "You can't do that." I'm like, "No, no,

61
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,960
 no. I'm saying cheer Eos." As in I'm trying to bring cheer to the world. And lawyers are like,

62
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,920
 "Well, there is a precedent for that. You can sell Cheerios." No, no, no. Cheer Eos, Mr. Carpenter.

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,800
 Thank you. Thank you very much. So you think the story's over, right? Everything kind of got resolved.

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,400
 Just Mayo is still sitting on store shelves. You think the story's over, right? They quote,

65
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,480
 unquote, changed their name. The lawsuit was finished. They no longer claim to actually be

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,480
 main names. And that would be the end of the story if it wasn't for an expose on the American

67
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,720
 Egg Board. The reason why I've been making those American Egg Council jokes, which was a name

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,760
 change to avoid getting sued, because you can't actually say you're sponsored by somebody, even

69
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,960
 joke you can, but you better have a good lawyer. Mine was the American Egg Council. The American

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,440
 Egg Board, it turns out, took the threat of just Mayo incredibly seriously. Incredibly seriously.

71
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,200
 And eventually some emails came out where two executives, to be fair, they were joking. Everyone

72
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,840
 said these guys are just joking. But jokingly, they said, "Hey, maybe we can get all our money

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,520
 together and hire Hitman to kill Josh Tetrick." So that's pretty bad, right? But that's not

74
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,440
 where it ended there. And they were just joking. Everyone, all sides agree they were just joking.

75
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,720
 But the American Egg Board, they ended up getting really worse off than just foods,

76
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,600
 because they started a whisper campaign. They began putting out feelers. First off,

77
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,320
 they were buying Google ad results. So if you looked at stuff like Beyond Foods,

78
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,560
 which was the original name of the company, if you googled that in, stuff about the American

79
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,040
 Egg Board would pop up. They were buying Google keywords. So if you were looking for just Mayo,

80
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,880
 or if you're looking for Beyond Foods, they might have even done it for his name. Stuff would come

81
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
 up about American Egg Board. You're like, "Well, that's no big deal. Like, you type it in, you're

82
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
 trying to find Josh Tetrick, and then you see an ad for eggs." It wasn't just them. They began

83
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,200
 trying to get people to talk more about eggs. That's what they're supposed to do. Hold on,

84
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,400
 hold on, hold on. This is why I was making those egg jokes, okay? Because I want a big,

85
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,320
 fat paycheck from the American Egg Council/Bord. Because listen to this, listen to this, because

86
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:59,280
 they were so scared of Josh Tetrick and his just the Mayo, they were paying food bloggers

87
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:08,960
 to talk about how awesome eggs were and how yummy eggs were. $2,500 a post. I'd do that, dude. I might

88
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,480
 do not talk about eggs ever. But if they were paying me $2,500, I would do nothing but talk about eggs.

89
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,600
 Okay, maybe not that. I would find a way to ruin the middle of a true crime story. I'm like,

90
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,480
 and then the family was horribly butchered. But before that, they sat down to a delicious

91
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,800
 plate of eggs. When the autopsy was done and they looked at the contents of their stomach,

92
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,560
 they found purebred American eggs, the best eggs on the planet. They started this whisper

93
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,480
 campaign and they were trying to recruit high level celebrities and just normal food bloggers.

94
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,280
 And they were paying them to talk about how great American eggs are. Now, that's against the law.

95
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,720
 There's not like some big brother out there. You're in shopping. You're like, "Oh, I heard

96
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
 this brand of eggs is good." And you get grabbed by the Gestapo. You can talk about eggs all you

97
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,520
 want. You can't because the American Egg Board, it's so weird. It's a quasi-private organization.

98
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,640
 It's the American, a bunch of egg growers decided to get together and said, "We want to market eggs

99
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,960
 back in the 1970s." But the government has to appoint the 18 people in the council. It's really

100
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,600
 weird. So they have a limitation. It's not a government organization, but they're involved in it.

101
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,960
 You can't do that. Like, you can market your own product, but you can't talk trash about other

102
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,960
 people's products. Eventually, Joanne Ivy, the chief executive, she took an early retirement

103
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,480
 because of this scandal. And then everyone else was required to do, quote, "Additional training"

104
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,160
 to learn. Uh-uh, don't do that. That's that story. That's that story that I built up for two episodes

105
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,960
 with my stupid egg ads. I want my money, dude. I want my money. I want $5,000. Think about it.

106
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:58,080
 I would have earned $5,000 for those bogus ads had this podcast been around in 2011, dude. I

107
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,520
 would have gotten paid. And the reason why I wanted to cover this story, because I think it's

108
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,080
 hilarious, also I have to add this because it's written in my notes. In 2012, the American Egg

109
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,440
 Board had a contest. This is just dragging this segment on too long. But I love this fact.

110
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
 The American Egg Board had a contest. You would record yourself singing the song "The Incredible

111
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,040
 Edible Egg." And if you did, these are the prizes you could win. You could win an iPhone 5,

112
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,680
 that's the top of the line, guys. Oh, if that's not enough, that's that cutting-edge technology

113
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,040
 isn't enough. An Xbox 360. And, I mean, I get it. At the time, those were probably good prizes,

114
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,040
 right? At the time, that might have been the most pr- best prizes. But you win an iPhone,

115
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:48,800
 an Xbox 360, and 12-month supply of eggs. Where are you going to- where are you going to put

116
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,720
 12 months worth of eggs? Do I get a- can I sell my Xbox and get a new fridge for that?

117
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,880
 Anyways, that probably can't edit it out this segment's going on too long. I wanted to cover

118
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,200
 that story, one, because I want my $5,000. And two, I always hammer this point home. We always

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,160
 talk about these conspiracy theories. These are the ones that affect real people. The government

120
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,320
 was basically the quote-unquote, like, this private organization was kind of chasing this

121
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,080
 guy around. It's so funny, because every- the stories that I don't ever worry about, like,

122
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,400
 the next story coming up, I'm not worried about covering, it's the stories that involve private

123
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,520
 entities that I'm always like, "Ugh." I'm always like- like the eBay stalking story, that one was

124
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,760
 a good one, these guys- these are the ones that I'm more worried about coming after me than,

125
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,560
 you know, Hillary Clinton breaking into my house with a baby under each arm. That's actually a

126
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,640
 perfect segue to our next story. "David, let's hatch a plan and blow this joint." I can't think

127
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,920
 of any egg-based puns other than that, and that one is barely an egg-based pun. David's shaking his

128
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,680
 head. "You know what we're going to do right now? Call in that carpenter copter. We are flying out to

129
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,640
 New York City." Me and David, we got on glasses, we're wearing all-white suits, we're doing

130
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,440
 dances to a zoom lens. If you're under the age of 30, you did not get that joke, it's possible no

131
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,800
 one got that joke. We're in a Puff Daddy video, remember? Remember back in 2000 when music was,

132
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,480
 like, happy and fun? Remember 2000 when you actually had, like, music videos and TRL and stuff like

133
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:30,000
 that? I can't stop- now, uh, 'cause I'm too cool. I never listened to East Coast rap.

134
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:39,440
 I was West Coast, dude. 100%. I despised East Coast rap. And I did not make an exception for

135
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,440
 Wu Tang either. Don't get me wrong. I understand why people like Wu Tang Clan, but even now,

136
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,680
 I've never listened to 36 Chambers. I've never listened to- I've listened to maybe two or three

137
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,640
 RZA songs. Like, the only time I ever came across anything from Wu Tang Clan is if it was on the

138
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,320
 radio or they were guest rapping on a rap- a West Coast Rappers album, which didn't happen a lot.

139
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,000
 I've never heard Ready to Die. Never- I've heard only radio songs. I've never listened to Ill Mottic.

140
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,360
 I've never listened to a single Naws album. But I'd hear him when he's rapping with DMX

141
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:26,160
 on Grand Finale. So I was not into East Coast rap. It just wasn't my style. So- but- so full

142
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,040
 disclaimer here. We're going to visit- the reason why I said all that stuff- DMX like,

143
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,240
 "What are you taking off his white suit? What are you talking about? Why are you talking about

144
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:42,400
 rap all of a sudden?" Because sir, we are going to visit Puff Daddy, aka P-Ditty, aka Diddy, Sean

145
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,960
 Combs, head of bad boy entertainment. Helicopters flying in between the buildings of New York.

146
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,360
 We see this sterling high rise in the sky and it's all like flashing. We ain't go nowhere.

147
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,000
 We can't be stopped now. Cause we're bad boys for life. Helicopter's flying around.

148
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,120
 And this is P. Diddy's building. We're gonna fly. We fly next to the building. Put on autopilot.

149
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,560
 We jump into the building. Quite dramatic entrance, right? We're from the West Coast though. So you

150
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,760
 know, we- we don't take the stairs, man. We're from the West Coast. We're walking around P. Diddy's

151
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,040
 building. We're brushing glass off of our clothes. The reason why we're here is recently

152
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:32,800
 Mr. Combs has written a book. Written a book called The Adrenal Chrome Witch. Now obviously when I saw

153
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,360
 this pop up I go, "Oh that's fake, right? Like that was my first instinct. But I gotta check it out.

154
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,640
 I gotta see what's going on with Puff. It's not just that Puff Daddy wrote. I'm like, "Puff Daddy wrote

155
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,200
 a book. Puff Daddy, before you- I'm not saying Puff Daddy's stupid. And I- I always call him Puff Daddy

156
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,520
 just cause I'm older. So I'll try to correct that. P. Diddy is not- I'm not saying P. Diddy's stupid.

157
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:05,040
 He famously said in- in Bad Boys for Life, that song, "Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks."

158
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,480
 Which is a great line. And he's basically saying, "I'm not a lyricist. I pay people to write my songs

159
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
 because I make that much money." And I remember- I remember where I was. I'm such a huge rap fan.

160
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,560
 I remember where I was when I heard that line. I was sitting at Josh Moore Meyer's house and that

161
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,120
 video came up and he dropped that line and I went, "Ohhhh!" Like straight up out of a movie. Because that

162
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,400
 was a killer line and I think everyone knew it was true. So when I'm laughing about P. Diddy

163
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,240
 writing a book, I imagine that him just not writing rhymes but writing checks would extend to his

164
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,680
 literary career as well. He's obviously a very savvy businessman, despite the fact that I have

165
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,160
 a West Coast/East Coast rivalry. But recently he wrote a book. He wrote- I just always get stumbled

166
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,440
 when I say that. Sean Diddy Combs wrote a book called The Adrenal Chrome Witch. Or did he?

167
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 Now this book appeared on BarnesandNoble.com and it popped up and it made a massive splash. Like

168
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
 right away people were really delving into this mystery. Let's look at some of the key details

169
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,360
 here. The cover of the book. Just a picture of P. Diddy. Right? That's all- that's all you need to

170
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,560
 buy, right? Especially if the book's called The Adrenal Chrome Witch. Just a picture of P. Diddy.

171
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:28,720
 It is seven pages long. Whoa dude, must have a- it must be either free or the best book ever,

172
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
 because it only needs seven pages. How long's the Declaration of Independence? It's not a 300-

173
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,400
 it's not a Harry Potter novel. Just have a couple- I don't know how long- Declaration of Independence

174
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,440
 is technically one page. I think it's like King George is reading and he's like, "I'm too busy to

175
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,680
 turn the page. Give him what they want." Pretty sure it's just like a scroll, right? Weren't they

176
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,520
 still using scrolls back then? Anyways, he writes a seven page book. Sean P. Diddy Combs

177
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,760
 writes a seven page book called The Adrenal Chrome Witch. It's either amazing, everything's

178
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:05,200
 compacted into seven pages, or it's free. It's not free. It's $100. It's a $100 seven page book

179
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,760
 written by Sean P. Diddy Combs. The cover again is just P. Diddy holding his chin, looking suave.

180
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,840
 Here is the description of the book. In case you just thought maybe Adrenal Chrome is- I guess for

181
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,120
 you guys who, like, this is your first episode, you're not making a conspiracy theory world,

182
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,440
 I should tell you. Adrenal Chrome- and we'll get a little more into it, but just so this makes

183
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,960
 sense, Adrenal Chrome is this chemical that supposedly, Satan worshipers and the Illuminati and

184
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,040
 the elite and reptilians and stuff, drink. It comes out of the human adrenal gland. They drink it,

185
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,120
 and it either gives them eternal life, gets them high, they get addicted and they need it to have

186
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,920
 eternal life, all three. It really depends on the mythology you're following, but that's what

187
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,640
 Adrenal Chrome is. We'll get a little more into that. So Sean P. Diddy Combs writes a book called

188
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
 The Adrenal Chrome Witch. Here's the description. Seven pages, 100 bucks, here's the description.

189
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,320
 Quote, "The Adrenal Chrome Witch is a true story about the elite secret society

190
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:12,880
 and their bizarre eternal youth rituals, not for the faint of heart." This book is no longer on

191
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,640
 BarnesandNoble.com, so that should give you an idea of what happened here. I'm looking at this,

192
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,440
 read the description, I'm looking at a photo of P. Diddy, and I'm like this, obviously this is fake.

193
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,200
 Now you can set up a book, let's say you're going to BarnesandNoble.com, you can put up an e-book

194
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,160
 and put written by George Washington, and it's called The Story of How I Oh Jason Carpenter 20

195
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,880
 bucks. And then I'm basically like, "Hey, I'm like going to his relatives. I'm like, you know, with

196
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,240
 interest, that's like $15 million. Look at this book. You can put whatever off their name you want.

197
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
 It can be up there as long as it doesn't get noticed." That's what happened here,

198
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,800
 because the book got taken down and actually all the author stuff got taken down, and we actually

199
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,600
 found out, I don't know if this is the real name of the author, but this is another name the author

200
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,000
 goes by, Candy Michelle Johnson. Because there's a bunch of other books, because you were new,

201
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,840
 and you click on the Sean P. Diddy Combs, it took you to like an author page, and you start seeing

202
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,440
 some P. Diddy books, some by this Candy Johnson character, and other books were written, The

203
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,400
 Illuminati was a book, The Illuminati Foundation, separate book, don't get them confused, two

204
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,560
 completely different plots, and then Daddy Warbucks' house, and that had a picture of

205
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,800
 P. Diddy with his daughters, weird, and then some book called French Kisses. That did not have a

206
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,840
 picture of P. Diddy and his daughters, thankfully. So it seemed to just be this collection of all

207
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,520
 those other books, and there was a few other ones, but all of them have been taken down now.

208
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,240
 What happened was Barnes & Noble obviously got alerted to this, he probably got tons of emails

209
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,760
 about it, "What, tell me, have P. Diddy's email me the secrets personally?" Whatever, they took it down,

210
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,800
 and that just fueled the fire of the conspiracy. What's gone on with this is completely insane.

211
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,880
 Within a day or two, we went from the world where P. Diddy did not write a book called The Adrenal

212
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,160
 Chrome Witch, to now this being, because there's screenshots going around, now this being a real

213
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,560
 part of the overall mythos involving Adrenal Chrome, involving the elite, I have found full

214
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,720
 Twitter threads where people are like, "Thank God, someone finally took a step towards revealing

215
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,320
 the Adrenal Chrome." And then other people go, "No, no, no, he knows that Q's about to shut him

216
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,960
 down, so he's trying to get ahead of it." No, no, no, he's trying to expose it, and all this

217
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,120
 argument over a screenshot of a book that no one read, because it was $100. Now there is the look

218
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,800
 inside function of the book, so you can read three pages, you can read half of it, right?

219
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,440
 Seven pages, you can read half of it, and it starts off, it's basically just like stuff you know,

220
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,200
 if you're a lunatic, like if you follow this stuff like we do, not saying we're all lunatics, but

221
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,840
 if you believe in the stuff, the adren-- and we're gonna, I don't want to just gloss over the Adrenal

222
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,840
 Chrome, because we're gonna end with that, but it's stuff like, you know, the elites take this

223
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,000
 Adrenal Chrome, and they get it out of the Adrenal Glance, and da-da-da-da, all this stuff. And then

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,920
 one page is lyrics to a song I didn't recognize, and then the other page quoted the song "Hotel

225
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,080
 California," which is the most boomer conspiracy theory that I've come across. It's been around

226
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,440
 since I was a kid, "Hotel California," that song by the Eagles. "Hotel California" is about telling

227
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,320
 your soul to Satan for fame. I don't know, I don't particularly-- it might be, but I don't-- if it

228
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,080
 is, I don't think it's a hidden message. I don't think they're like, you know what, no one will

229
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,000
 ever discover this. They're writing this, "You can check in, but you can't check out." It could

230
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,800
 have been-- it could have referred to drug addiction, it could refer to just life in general misery.

231
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,520
 We've heard a lot of different things, but anyway, that's been going-- I mean, my stepdad was talking

232
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,280
 about "Hotel California" being a song about selling your soul to the devil in like 1998. That's not

233
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,040
 a new revelation, so P.D.A. you only got seven pages to tell this story, dude. Super boomer, but

234
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,560
 that's that book. Now, what's funny is we have this thing going on, and again, the idea is this

235
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,080
 whole idea about Adrenal-- so, he-- no, he did not write that book. You'll see-- I think you'll see

236
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,600
 this go on for a while. I think you'll see this part of the conspiracy theory go on for a while,

237
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,600
 but here's what-- here-- this is what's really interesting about this. On the Twitter thread,

238
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,320
 someone goes, "Pfft, you know," and they were saying it unironically. They actually thought

239
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,760
 they had exposed something, but really what they exposed was a massive flaw in the Adrenal

240
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,360
 Chrome argument. They're like, "Yeah, those sickos, those perverts, you know you can buy Adrenal Chrome

241
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,440
 right from China." Okay, I've heard that myth before. I heard that the coronavirus was actually a bad

242
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,800
 batch of Adrenal Chrome, and that's why celebrities got it, or that's why Tom Hanks got it or something

243
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:53,760
 like that. He's like, "Mmm, mm, mm, sweet human, human adrenaline, ah!" And that-- first it was that

244
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,640
 they spiked it on purpose. Someone had spiked the supply on purpose and gave everyone coronavirus,

245
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,560
 or it was an accident, whatever. So I had heard that conspiracy theory before, but I hadn't seen a

246
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:10,080
 screenshot. I had not seen a screenshot from the online marketplace Alibaba of Adrenal Chrome.

247
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:19,360
 And again, I go, "That's fake, but I better check it out." Dude, you can buy so much Adrenal Chrome

248
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,720
 from Alibaba. Actual Adrenal Chrome. Because Adrenal Chrome is real. This episode might go a

249
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,880
 little long. This is-- I find this very fascinating, though. The chemical Adrenal Chrome is real. The

250
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,680
 question is, does it do what the mythology says it does? Can it give you eternal life? Spoiler

251
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,920
 alert. Well, actually, that-- I can't give a spoiler alert on that, because that's an

252
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,720
 interesting question. You can buy Adrenal Chrome straight from Alibaba. They will ship it to your

253
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:55,680
 house. I'm tempted to buy it with a caveat. You cannot-- you cannot use this stuff. They take

254
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,480
 Adrenal Chrome and they slightly alter the chemical compound to make a derivative of it.

255
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,280
 Adrenal Chrome, with the chemical that you can buy, is used as a blood clotting agent. So it's

256
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,760
 medical grade stuff. You can buy it. You can 100% buy it. I did not see any restrictions.

257
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,880
 It is legal. It comes in the form of a powder, and it is cheap. And that's the thing. When

258
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,680
 Adrenal Chrome thing is like, "Oh, out of one human body--" I was watching this YouTube video on it.

259
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,600
 On one human body, you can get 10 cc's of Adrenal Chrome. Adrenal-- I know this is kind of rambly,

260
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,720
 but Adrenal Chrome, what it really is, outside of the derivative that you can buy on Alibaba,

261
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,920
 when the human has an Adrenaline response, it floods the body with Adrenaline. As that Adrenaline

262
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,040
 decays, it becomes Adrenal Chrome and then it eventually just disappears. It dissipates.

263
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,640
 Adrenal Chrome is a real chemical. It is created by the human body. The conspiracy theory is that

264
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,840
 you can pull it out of the base of the neck, or you can pull it straight out of the adrenal glands,

265
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
 which-- neither of those are true. It's flooding your body. Adrenal Chrome is basically flooding

266
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,560
 your body. It's Adrenaline. It's not pure Adrenaline. It's Adrenaline that's starting to decay.

267
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,680
 And you can get 10-- according to this YouTube video, you can get 10 cc's out of a single human

268
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,000
 body. So what they do is the elite, they kidnap people and they scare them and they torture them

269
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,040
 and they make them all super panicky, and then their blood is super sweet, and then that's when

270
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,200
 they take it out. It doesn't make sense. You have to wait till the Adrenaline starts to decay.

271
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,640
 So you'd have to be like torture them and then you're like, "No, no, no, here's like a stuffed

272
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,440
 animal. Let's watch some Charles in charge." And they're like, "Oh, this isn't so bad."

273
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,280
 "Oh, my spine!" Like, you have to wait until it starts to decay. So that's what Adrenal Chrome is

274
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:43,200
 in our body. The Adrenal Chrome you can buy through China is that compound fixed a bit and it acts as

275
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
 a blood clotting agent. So definitely don't be like, "Oh, I'm gonna be like the elites. I'm gonna

276
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:56,000
 eject. I'm gonna eject this into my arm." Or snored it or whatever. You can buy though from Alibaba.

277
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,600
 You remember, 10 cc's that have a human body. It takes 10 cc's to get this out. But somehow China

278
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:11,440
 is able to sell you 10 metric tons for about 400 bucks. You can buy, like for 200 bucks, you can buy

279
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,080
 like 10 kilograms of it, which is still quite heavy, but I would love to just have it as a

280
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,240
 conversation piece in my house. Invite people over. "Hey, yeah, here's my Bigfoot painting.

281
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,400
 Here's this awesome rabbit cup from Lana. Look at this. Oh, yeah, no, no, no, don't touch that.

282
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,360
 That's 25 kilograms of Adrenal Chrome straight from Alibaba. You can buy it. A conversation piece

283
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,480
 to say the least. But somehow they're able to take this 10 cc's and turn it into 10 metric tons

284
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,280
 and then sell it to you for $450. So what that did was that post made me go, "Well, yeah, it is

285
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,600
 Adrenal Chrome. Adrenal Chrome is real." And I honestly think I've said in past episodes,

286
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,120
 I didn't even think the chemical was real. I would have misstated that. I don't think the

287
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,760
 effects that were being told of it is real. Because really, when you look at people saying

288
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,640
 about Adrenal Chrome, first off, the story was Adrenal Chrome gets you higher than you've ever

289
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,920
 been before. And all of that stuff comes from fear and loathing in Las Vegas. And Hunter S. Thompson

290
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,840
 said, "Totally made it up. Totally made it up. That drug that Johnny Depp wore in the movie, but

291
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,080
 the drug that I did in the book, I made it up. I made it up. He told the director, Terry Galium,

292
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
 I just made it up. There is no drug." And in the movie they go, "You take it straight from the

293
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,120
 adrenal gland of a living human." And that started this myth that Adrenal Chrome was a real drug.

294
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,760
 In the first episode of a British television show called "Louis," which was a spinoff of

295
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,200
 Inspector Morrell, the first episode aired in 2008, that they were trying to break up a

296
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,200
 drug ring that was draining adrenal fluid from humans. So it's an old story. It was from way back

297
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,520
 when fear and loathing in Las Vegas, the book was written. This is how the mythology grows.

298
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:59,440
 You have someone make adult, Adolphus Huxley, was the first person to talk about it. And he goes,

299
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,280
 "There's this thing called Adrenal Chrome." In the mainstream, there's a thing called Adrenal Chrome.

300
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,400
 And it's from the oxidization of adrenaline in the body. Huxley wasn't claiming that it did

301
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,560
 anything supernatural. And then Hunter S. Thompson talks about it in his book, and talks about it

302
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:22,240
 being this amazing high. But he's like, "I never did it. Like, there's no such thing as that."

303
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,000
 But you see how that myth evolved. And nowadays we have people putting up fake books solely in the

304
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,880
 good name of Peeditty. We have people releasing YouTube videos and all this stuff claiming that

305
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,320
 if you ever see a rich person with a black eye, it's because that's the Adrenal Chrome thing.

306
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,080
 They're either going through an Adrenal Chrome withdrawal, or they get it injected into their

307
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,640
 eye. And if it goes wrong, gives them a black eye. You'll see these photo montages of all these.

308
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,200
 Over the course of 50 years, photos of rich people with black eyes. They're not Iron Man.

309
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,880
 People get black eyes. But anyways, you can pick out these photos of Bill Clinton in 1992

310
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,360
 and Kevin Specy tomorrow with a black eye. I gave that one to him, by the way. But you have this

311
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,320
 montage, right? And so you'll always see that connection. And so the mythology has evolved.

312
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,000
 What's dangerous about this? What's dangerous about this? First off, I would hate to see someone.

313
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,240
 A lot of people, it's so weird. A lot of people who investigate conspiracy theories

314
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,720
 would love to join the Illuminati. That's a trend I've seen over the years.

315
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,400
 Like, they hate them and they're always talking about it. But if it comes down to it, a lot of

316
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,000
 them will want to join. So I'm afraid that someone's actually going to buy some Adrenal

317
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,160
 Chrome from Alibaba and go, "Well, you know if it's good enough for Katy Perry and snored it,

318
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,920
 or inject it and just instantly die, because it will clot their blood."

319
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,600
 My concern is this. There was this documentary I watched a couple years ago. I don't remember

320
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,640
 the name of it. But it was about how the movie Godfather, and gangster movies in general,

321
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
 shaped gangster culture. Because before you would just be an Irish gangster,

322
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,640
 you'd be an Italian gangster and you'd be like, "Yeah, give me your-" And you could even go back

323
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,800
 further than the Godfather. But you'd be an Italian gangster and you'd be like, "Hey,

324
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,880
 you know if you should give me some money because I protect the neighborhood

325
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,080
 and your shop's in my neighborhood, it would be horrible if it wasn't protected." And the shop

326
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,320
 owner's like, "Yeah, I kind of get what's going on." Irish gangster would be like, "Hey, you,

327
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,000
 give me all your money." And as movies started to really hit the culture, and you started to have

328
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,280
 these gangster movies, specifically movies like Godfather, it'd be like, in real life,

329
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,480
 gangsters were emulating the gangster movies. The gangster movies were based on like broad

330
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,960
 stereotypes. This documentary, and they were interviewing real gangsters. They were interviewing

331
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,000
 these old Italian gangsters and they were like, "Back before Godfather, we acted differently."

332
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,080
 Because they're older now. They're like, "We were just a bunch of dumb kids and then all of a sudden

333
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,000
 we were walking around in our suits and we were doing all this stuff and we were trying to be like

334
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,320
 the gangsters we saw on the movies." The whole pirate accent "errr" comes from one movie. One movie.

335
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,400
 I think it was Treasure Island. I don't remember off the top of my head, but it was one movie.

336
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,520
 Before that, if you look at old pirate movies, nothing. They weren't like, "Errr, say all the seven

337
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,880
 seas, matey." It was one actor. That was an acting choice he made. An entire subculture was based

338
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,440
 around that one movie. So you can have these mo- you can have, obviously there were pirates

339
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,480
 before that movie came out. And then you have a movie come out and then everyone goes, "Errr, matey,

340
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,440
 I got a patch and a peg leg and a parrot." It's all from that movie. Not saying that pirates didn't

341
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,760
 have those things, but it would be super rare if they did. This is my worry. This is my worry.

342
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,800
 You have a dolphin, you have Huxley talk about it in his book. You have Thompson talk about it in his

343
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,080
 book. Then you have this whole theory going around that it'll make you immortal and stuff like that.

344
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,200
 People who would have never thought about doing this before now will. You never ever thought,

345
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,240
 "I wonder what it's like to inject another human's adrenaline into my body." Maybe, maybe, maybe if

346
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,640
 you're sick of it, that thought crosses your mind. But now imagine you are super wealthy and you're

347
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,280
 bored. You have no morals and you're bored and you're reading this stuff online all the time.

348
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,320
 "Oh yeah, you know the elites do it. That's why Hillary Clinton looks like she's 27."

349
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,000
 Because she injects adrenochrome into her skin all the time. That's why the elites have all this

350
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,720
 power and so on and so forth. It's the best high ever and you have to do it all the time. And you

351
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 have people who are researching this, who are stumbling across this information. It's totally

352
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,600
 fictional. It doesn't happen. But people with the means and the lack of morals are looking this and

353
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,840
 they go, "I wonder if this is true?" And the next time that they have the opportunity, they're gonna

354
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:49,440
 try it. Just to find out. That's out of the means of you and me and 99% of the normal human population

355
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,360
 who would never do that. If you have enough money, if you have the means and you have the lack of

356
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,240
 morals, and the opportunity presents itself to you and you never thought about it before, but you'd

357
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,720
 been reading online all of this stuff. Mark Marin. He's not doing this. Mark Marin, he's the guy who

358
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,000
 does WTF podcast. When his career was in the dumps, I remember listening to an episode a long time

359
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,680
 ago, when his career, he was a stand-up comedian, tried to get in on SNL stuff, wasn't working out

360
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,160
 for him. He was talking about an episode, he goes, "When I was, when my career had stalled and I was

361
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,360
 just sitting there, he goes, 'I was doing research on the Illuminati and I was thinking, 'I wonder if

362
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,440
 this stuff is real.'" Because his career, he was, he felt like he was an outsider, he felt like he

363
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,680
 was working as hard as he could. He wasn't going anywhere. He's thinking, "I wonder if the Illuminati

364
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,040
 is real. I wonder if that's why I'm not successful, because I'm not in the in-crowd and things like

365
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,680
 that." So, and now he is super successful. It's not because he joined the Illuminati, but you have

366
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,640
 powerful people who look into this stuff as well. Maybe they weren't powerful when they were looking

367
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,080
 in the way, but you'll have people like these subjects. People like reading about this stuff.

368
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,000
 My fear is that somebody's reading this stuff now, they're buying into the hype,

369
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,920
 they believe P. Diddy's trying to expose the truth, and they have the ability

370
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:14,320
 to find a human victim. The story, I believe, is fake today. But stories like this don't stay fake

371
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,440
 for long. Eventually, we will come across the serial killer. We will come across somebody who

372
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,720
 is taking the adrenaline out of a human body and injecting it into their own veins. We can make

373
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,480
 the myths real, and that's the scariest truth of all.
