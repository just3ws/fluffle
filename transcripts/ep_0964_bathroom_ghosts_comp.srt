1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 When a conspiracy theorist gains control over a town's water supply, the residents are left

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,120
 to ask, "What?

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
 What are you talking about?

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,200
 Why are you doing stuff to our water, man?"

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then we travel to Colorado to take a look at the story of two young kids using the restroom

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
 at a department store.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,240
 That's normal.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,840
 Kids always go to the bathroom.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,840
 But what happens when they never come out?

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:45,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,940
 I hope you guys don't listen to Monday's episode because man, that was gross.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,880
 Someone who never grosses me out walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now was one of our

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
 newest Patreon supporters.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,720
 Everyone give it up for Brandon Schlob.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 Yeah!

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
 Come on!

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
 He's shaking his head.

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 He's like, "That's not how you pronounce my name."

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
 Well, Brandon, come on into Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,000
 If you guys can't swear to the Patreon, that's totally fine.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I totally get it.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I do.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,320
 Just help spread the word about the show, please.

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,400
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,260
 If this show gives you any value at all, please spread the word of Dead Rabbit Radio.

33
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,100
 Brandon, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,820
 Let's get this adventure started.

35
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,060
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,300
 Drive us all the way out too.

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,580
 Richmond, Virginia.

38
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,580
 [imitates engine]

39
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
 [imitates engine]

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,580
 [imitates engine]

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,540
 Now, this is a story we started yesterday.

42
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,420
 If you missed yesterday's episode, that's totally fine.

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,180
 You don't have to listen to every episode, but I actually got sidetracked.

44
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,960
 And I talked about a story involving the Smithsonian Institute and how they were covering up or

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,600
 ignoring proof that other civilizations from Europe and the Middle East and Asia may have

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
 been visiting the Americas along before Columbus.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
 And because of one man, John Wesley Powell, he crafted the Powell Doctrine, which changed

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,240
 the way the Smithsonian investigated this stuff.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,660
 Very, very interesting story.

50
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,780
 Very, very cool story I've been wanting to tell you guys for a while.

51
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,380
 And it actually dovetails into this one.

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,540
 Because what we're looking at is when one person lets their own personal prejudices

53
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,820
 or personal beliefs interfere with everyone else's lives.

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,540
 So we're headed out to Richmond, Virginia, and we get there.

55
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,060
 It's just a normal little town.

56
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,200
 We're walking around.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
 We're buying trinkets.

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,920
 We're like, hey, is this place haunted?

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
 Is this a place we're standing in right now?

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 We're standing in the graveyard.

61
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,840
 They're like, yeah, it's pretty haunted here.

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
 We're walking around.

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
 We're looking for ghosts, right?

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
 That's what I do everywhere I go.

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,280
 As we're sitting there, we're like, man, I'm really thirsty.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
 You thirsty?

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
 Yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,320
 Hey Brandon, why don't you drive us over to the water shop?

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,120
 It's a place where we can drink nothing but water.

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,720
 We're drinking glasses of water.

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,480
 Mmm, this is so good.

72
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,700
 We ever said regarding water.

73
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,300
 I love this taste of nothing.

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
 We're drinking the water.

75
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,940
 We're like, dude, try this glass.

76
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
 We're pouring it.

77
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
 We're pouring it on each other.

78
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,100
 It's a wet teesier contest.

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,660
 All of a sudden, I win.

80
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,860
 And we got our bellies full of water, right?

81
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,100
 We're like, man, there sure was a lot of delicious water.

82
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,100
 This place is so good.

83
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,060
 Let's live here just based on the water alone.

84
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,060
 So we're hanging out.

85
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,420
 You quit your job.

86
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,700
 You leave your family behind.

87
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,740
 Now we're all hanging out in Richmond, Virginia.

88
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,740
 And every day is the same.

89
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,360
 We're just drinking this sweet, sweet, delicious water.

90
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,200
 And we start to notice something.

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,320
 We're walking around town.

92
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,440
 And I go, hey dude, you know, I know we've been spending a lot of time together down

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,480
 at the water shop.

94
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,040
 And I don't mean to like pry, but I've noticed your teeth look a little brittle.

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,240
 And you're like, what?

96
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
 That's horrible.

97
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
 But I've noticed it was true.

98
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,680
 The other day I was eating mashed potatoes and a tooth broke.

99
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
 I go, what?

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
 And he goes, yeah Jason, I don't want to tell you this, but your teeth, they're looking pretty

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 jacked up too.

102
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,140
 Like I can see the enamel falling off of them.

103
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
 And I'm like, no, not the enamel.

104
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,940
 Okay, so that might be, it might be taken into an extreme.

105
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,020
 I don't think what this guy did is going to make your teeth dissolve in two weeks.

106
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,500
 Just because, and I'm about to get into some stuff and there's a huge controversy surrounding

107
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 all of this stuff.

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,220
 So I might have exaggerated a bit.

109
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,620
 I'm not saying if you visit Richmond, Virginia for more than two weeks, your teeth will shatter

110
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,480
 and you need to play to mashed potatoes.

111
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
 I'm not saying that.

112
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
 Let's get to the actual story.

113
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,160
 It was supposed to just be an intro and it just became ridiculous.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
 This story is true though.

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
 This story is true.

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,360
 And I got to give a shout out to Lisa Rathke.

117
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,880
 She wrote an article for the Associated Press that it got most of my information from.

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,320
 And then I dug up some other stuff about the conspiracy theory itself.

119
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
 We'll get into that.

120
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,720
 But Lisa Rathke recently wrote this article for the Associated Press.

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,640
 And what happened was in September of 2022.

122
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,060
 This is a very recent story.

123
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,180
 It's still going on.

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,780
 In the town of Richmond, Vermont.

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
 So not Virginia.

126
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,980
 How many times did I say Virginia?

127
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,980
 Alright guys, I apologize.

128
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
 I apologize.

129
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,900
 Anyways, Richmond, Vermont is where we are at.

130
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
 Richmond, Vermont.

131
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,660
 Walking around, teeth are falling out, drinking the water.

132
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
 Richmond, Vermont.

133
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
 It's a small town.

134
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,340
 It has a population of only about 4,100 people.

135
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:48,640
 And what has happened is there has been an uproar in this town because Kendall Chamberlain.

136
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,160
 He is the water and wastewater superintendent of Richmond.

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,920
 What happened was he decided, basically he says, I got some information, whether that

138
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,240
 was reading articles, reading stuff online.

139
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,520
 Who knows what his sources were.

140
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,660
 He said, I started to come to the conclusion that we should not be putting fluoride in

141
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,780
 our water.

142
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,280
 Now not because of the old school boomer conspiracy theories that it's some sort of

143
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,940
 like government plan to calcify the pineal gland.

144
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,960
 Not any of the, it's going to turn us all into zombies.

145
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,500
 Those are old school conspiracy theories about fluoride in the water.

146
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:37,180
 He says what I had learned is that America gets its fluoride from China and it's not

147
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,400
 being tested.

148
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,600
 And they're just shipping it to us and we're putting it in our water supply and who knows

149
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,760
 what's in it.

150
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
 Who knows what's in it.

151
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,400
 It's not being tested.

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
 They're shipping it over to us so I made the decision to stop putting it in the water

153
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,720
 supply.

154
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,860
 Now there's a lot of controversy still about fluoride and there's honestly, because I

155
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,060
 looked this up, I read this article by Lisa that is really interesting, but then obviously

156
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,180
 we're conspiracy theory podcasts to start looking at the other side.

157
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,980
 There are concerns from people about the fluoride that comes from China.

158
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
 There is.

159
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,700
 There was one city to compare this.

160
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,140
 So we have this one in Richmond, Vermont.

161
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,260
 They said we're not going to put fluoride in our water anymore.

162
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,960
 There's another city, Amsbury, Massachusetts back in 2010.

163
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,760
 The Department of Public Works director Rob Desmaris pulled the fluoride out of the water.

164
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,080
 He personally reached into every glass of water and he's like I'm pulling it out and

165
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 pulling it out.

166
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,840
 He said listen, we're getting this fluoride from China and it's not dissolving.

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,480
 We're putting it in our reservoirs.

168
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,760
 We're putting it in and it's clogging up the pumps.

169
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 It's not dissolving.

170
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,300
 We go sometimes only 60% of it would dissolve the way it's supposed to.

171
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,780
 So he goes I don't even know what this stuff is.

172
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,700
 We just have these clumps in here and it's actually breaking the machinery.

173
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,500
 So I'm pulling the plug on putting the fluoride into our water until we can get this figured

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,780
 out.

175
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,180
 So he did that in 2010.

176
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,060
 I looked up, Massachusetts has a state guide of all the cities and what their fluoride levels

177
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,220
 are.

178
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,320
 Because of 2021, Amsbury does still not have fluoride in their water, but there's a difference

179
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,480
 between the two.

180
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:31,200
 Because at the end of the day, there are questions about how effective fluoride is in the water.

181
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,920
 Some doctors and dentists say it is one of the biggest public health benefits that we've

182
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
 ever seen.

183
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,800
 By putting this in the water, it has improved teeth health enormously.

184
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,940
 And there are people who go well, it has a mild effect on teeth, but it's not as great

185
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,180
 as other people say.

186
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,100
 And then there are questions about not the zombies, not calcifying the pineal gland,

187
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,500
 which those are conspiracy theories out there, but there are questions about the fluoride

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,020
 coming from China.

189
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,260
 What is in it?

190
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,740
 The CDC says it's fully tested, but other groups say the FDA is supposed to be the one testing

191
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,500
 it and they're not testing it.

192
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,020
 We're getting these huge bulk orders in.

193
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,160
 We've had, remember there was a huge controversy with toys coming over and they had lead paints

194
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,840
 on them, so they go based on the past.

195
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,640
 We don't want to put this stuff in our water supply when we do put it in our water supplies

196
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,840
 clogging up these pipes.

197
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,480
 There are things on both sides, right?

198
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 Is it good?

199
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
 Is it bad?

200
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 Just fluoride in general.

201
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,060
 And then the secondary question is, it's coming in bulk from China.

202
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
 Is it pure?

203
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
 Is it not?

204
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:42,620
 But the difference between Amesbury and Richmond is that Amesbury told the people, "Hey, we're

205
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,500
 going to stop putting fluoride in our water."

206
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,260
 So if you have young kids, you've got to make sure you're using toothpaste with fluorides.

207
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,020
 Young kids can take fluoride supplements.

208
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
 And adults can too.

209
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,220
 You can just buy supplemental fluoride.

210
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,580
 So there's this state guide for the state of Massachusetts and it lists Amesbury as one

211
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,780
 of the towns that says, "If you live in this town, make sure you supplement your fluoride."

212
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,140
 Because the water doesn't have it in there.

213
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,460
 The difference is, is that Kindle didn't tell anybody.

214
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,160
 Nobody knew outside of the water treatment board.

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,460
 Nobody knew that he did this.

216
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,240
 He just made a unilateral decision based on stuff that he had read.

217
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,100
 No feedback from the public.

218
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,580
 Didn't tell anyone.

219
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,220
 So these kids are sure going to the dentist and they have these cavities.

220
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,660
 The dentist is like, at one point a parent goes, because she was speaking out of this

221
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,660
 meeting.

222
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
 My kids have cavities.

223
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,660
 And yeah, they eat sweets.

224
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,100
 They eat sweets just like every kid does.

225
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,180
 But I specifically asked my dentist, "Should I start to supplement fluoride?"

226
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,900
 And my dentist said, "No.

227
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,020
 There's enough fluoride in the water.

228
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,340
 They're getting enough fluoride."

229
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,380
 That's really what makes this story interesting.

230
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,300
 It's not the fact that he stopped putting fluoride in the water, because a lot of cities

231
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,260
 and counties in the United States don't have fluoride in their water.

232
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:07,380
 Oregon, where I live, is in the top three least fluoride-friendly states.

233
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,380
 So it's not abnormal that you have cities and communities saying we don't want fluoride.

234
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,940
 The difference is not telling anybody that you're doing it.

235
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,980
 Reading stuff online, maybe talking to some water treatment people in other cities.

236
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,220
 And it should be noted, Kindle Chamberlain does not live in this town.

237
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,220
 He doesn't live in this town.

238
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,140
 He's at work and they're like, "Hey, you want a glass of water?"

239
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,140
 And he's like, "No, I'm good."

240
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,580
 And then he drives home, he goes to his town, and he's like, "Mmm, mm, mm, sweet, sweet fluoride."

241
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,660
 His teeth are all, "Bing!"

242
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,060
 He doesn't live in this town.

243
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,580
 He took the fluoride out of the water.

244
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,860
 He didn't tell anybody.

245
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,860
 And all the townspeople just went around drinking non-fluoridated water.

246
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,060
 Now, does that mean that their teeth are going to shatter when they eat mashed potatoes?

247
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
 No.

248
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,060
 Does it have any, like, huge effects outside of kids getting cavities?

249
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
 Not really.

250
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
 Right?

251
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,260
 It's not a life-altering thing, but I found this story so interesting because these are

252
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,220
 the stories we find out.

253
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,020
 Like I wouldn't want a flat earther to be the pilot of my plane, but at the end of the

254
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,180
 day, I mean, he's still going to land you in Beirut.

255
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,300
 He just thinks that he's flying around in a big circle to get there.

256
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:25,780
 But imagine if somebody believed that space was fake, like you had a judge who goes about

257
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,540
 his day constantly doing, like, "Yeah, traffic court, sure, you get a ticket.

258
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,660
 You know, you ran a red light, you get a ticket."

259
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:39,980
 But he also, in his spare time, believes that space is fake.

260
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,980
 That it's all...

261
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,660
 And here's the thing, like, I say that and you go, "Jay, there's no judge."

262
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,380
 You'd have to be an idiot to believe that space is fake.

263
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,620
 And it's all a hologram, and space is made up to keep humans from realizing that God

264
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,180
 created the universe, because that's what that theory is.

265
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,060
 If we knew space was fake, then it means that only God could create a floating disk.

266
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,540
 It's so bizarre.

267
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,540
 But you'd go, "Only an idiot would have believed in that."

268
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,780
 Well, guess who some of the judges are, man?

269
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,620
 They're idiots.

270
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,620
 They're idiots, right?

271
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,500
 You have idiots and morons in all layers of society.

272
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,740
 And I'm picking the dumbest guy.

273
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,740
 I don't think, saying I don't want to put fluoride in the water, I don't think that's

274
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,020
 an idiotic conspiracy theory.

275
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,500
 I was actually interested to find there's still a debate about it.

276
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,460
 Not telling people is the problem.

277
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,980
 If I went before a judge and I have a big...

278
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,220
 I'm in an astronaut suit, I got arrested for pretending to be an astronaut to pick up

279
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,020
 chicks at a bar.

280
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,900
 And it turns out the judge, which actually, if I'm not guilty, is like, "What space isn't

281
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
 real?"

282
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,700
 Obviously, you can't be an astronaut.

283
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,420
 You'd want to know what type of lunacy people believe them.

284
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,180
 And again, does it affect you?

285
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,220
 If there's an architect who believes that 9/11 was an inside job and he's designing my house,

286
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,340
 it doesn't affect me at all, right?

287
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,460
 It doesn't affect me at all.

288
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,020
 He has that belief.

289
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,100
 He's looked at that evidence.

290
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,700
 He came to that conclusion.

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,100
 Okay, but you spilled my house, bro.

292
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,780
 I don't care.

293
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:15,140
 But what happens when someone like that is in charge of a project that does affect people's

294
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
 lives?

295
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,540
 Well, I can't think of one.

296
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,820
 I can't think of one.

297
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,820
 But I did find it really fascinating that this guy believes this and then tells anyone and

298
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,940
 just changed the water supply and he didn't live there.

299
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,540
 I find it really interesting, conspiracy.

300
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,700
 Again, also, I guess here is the big one.

301
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,980
 It doesn't really affect you or me, hopefully not.

302
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,900
 But people who believe in conspiracy theories and then murder people.

303
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,660
 I'll put this in the show notes.

304
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,860
 I was going to cover it, and I still may, but there was a guy recently who took a spear

305
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
 gun.

306
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
 Different.

307
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,900
 We covered a guy who used a spear gun to kill his family.

308
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,460
 This was a more recent story.

309
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,140
 A guy with a spear gun killed two of his daughters.

310
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,420
 We might have actually talked about it briefly in the show.

311
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,700
 He killed two of his kids and the police caught him in Mexico and he believed that they were

312
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,460
 going to turn into reptilian, half human, half reptilian monsters, or they already were

313
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,260
 these things.

314
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,580
 But he had to kill them to stop the reptilians from taking over the planet.

315
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,820
 And then I read a follow-up article.

316
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,180
 It was really heartbreaking where he was in prison now.

317
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,700
 He's still awaiting trial, but he was in jail and he's slowly becoming less delusional because

318
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,300
 he's not reading the internet.

319
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,980
 He's not getting all of this stuff that was backing up his theories.

320
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,940
 But he's like trying to figure, he's like he still believes it, but now that he's not

321
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,660
 getting that constant feedback loop, that echo chamber about these reptilian overlords,

322
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,100
 he's like starting to question should I have done that.

323
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
 Fascinating story.

324
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
 So yeah, there you go.

325
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,340
 The death of those two children, yeah, and other people who've been killed because of

326
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,700
 conspiracy theories, gangstalking and stuff like that.

327
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
 Fascinating and grim stuff.

328
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,140
 This guy just made it so a couple kids got cavities.

329
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,660
 That's not too bad on the grand scale of things.

330
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,660
 But Brandon Shlob?

331
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
 Shlob?

332
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,860
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dune buggy we're leaving behind

333
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,340
 Richmond Vermont.

334
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:24,340
 Take us all the way out to a local bookstore.

335
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,740
 The reason why we're shopping by this bookstore, I want to do a real quick Dead Rabbit Recommends

336
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:33,340
 on a very rarely recommend books, but I came across one.

337
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,540
 It's a good book with a bizarre controversy around it.

338
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,100
 This is a kids book.

339
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,980
 The book is called After the Fall.

340
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,660
 After the Fall, and it's the story like the subtitle is how Humpty Dumpty got back up

341
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,180
 again.

342
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,900
 And it is pretty much what it says.

343
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,140
 It's a children's picture book.

344
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,780
 Humpty Dumpty fell off a wall, smashed open.

345
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
 We all know that part.

346
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,060
 We actually did an episode on Humpty Dumpty.

347
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,500
 But this is a different one.

348
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,140
 Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall, he's a big old egg, falls off the wall, cracks open,

349
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,380
 and then the medics, the kings horses and the kings men, fix him.

350
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,100
 And then what we get is a book about PTSD.

351
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,940
 It's about PTSD.

352
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,220
 It's about depression and fear.

353
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,620
 It's a kids book.

354
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,980
 It's probably like, I don't know, 20, 30 pages.

355
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,220
 And Humpty Dumpty is now afraid of heights.

356
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,020
 He's walking around town and he's trying to deal with his crippling depression.

357
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,060
 He's holding an egg beater to his own head.

358
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
 That's the final page.

359
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,740
 Well it's funny, I made that joke.

360
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,100
 But that kind of is how it ends in a way for some people.

361
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,060
 I'm going, if you don't want it spoiled for you, if you don't want this children's book

362
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,820
 spoiled for you, just Dead Rabbit recommends After the Fall how Humpty Dumpty got back

363
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
 up again.

364
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,060
 I guess the spoilers and the title.

365
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,140
 But anyways, recommended it's a good book.

366
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,020
 The story though goes like this.

367
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,020
 He falls off the wall and then he's like, dude, my life sucks.

368
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,220
 I'm scared to do anything and everything I love is really high.

369
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,220
 They show him at home.

370
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,220
 He has a bunk bed.

371
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,740
 He sleeps on the top bunk.

372
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,380
 He's like, oh man.

373
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,860
 He goes to the supermarket to buy cereal and he goes, all the best flavors are on the top

374
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,660
 shelf and there's like a ladder going to the top shelf and it's like all of these delicious

375
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,140
 like Lucky Charms and Frosted Flakes and Captain Crunch.

376
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,500
 And where he's at it's just like gray boxes, gray boxes and they just say stuff like corn

377
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,420
 or oatmeal and just like all of these gross things like he's too scared to go up and get

378
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
 what he loves.

379
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,540
 And he explains the reason why it was on the wall in the first place is I love to bird

380
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
 watch.

381
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,420
 I love to sit up on the wall and watch birds.

382
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,580
 But ever since I fell down, I don't go up there anymore and there's page after page

383
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,980
 of him just kind of looking up at the sky and you see these birds way up there.

384
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,980
 And so he gets a pair of binoculars and that's not enough for him.

385
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,060
 He wants to be up there with the birds but he can't be so he decides at one point to

386
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:12,260
 make a paper airplane and he spends hours upon hours making this paper airplane.

387
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,620
 He goes, this will make me feel like I'm flying again.

388
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,620
 I'm up there with the birds.

389
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,060
 So he's thrown his paper airplane around its shape like a bird.

390
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:24,740
 He's thrown it around town and then it flies on top of the wall.

391
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,620
 There's a giant wall that surrounds the egg city.

392
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,260
 He watches his paper airplane land on the top of the wall.

393
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,300
 He's like, ahhh.

394
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,780
 He's like, you should just walk away right?

395
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
 Like I can't go up there.

396
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:46,740
 But he goes, no I spent so long making that and fear, fear of heights has kept me from

397
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,020
 doing the stuff I love.

398
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,140
 So he climbs that ladder.

399
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,540
 They show him climbing this giant ladder up to the top of the wall and he gets up to the

400
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:05,100
 top of the wall and he grabs his paper airplane and he's like, yes, yes, now I am free.

401
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:11,060
 And then you turn the page.

402
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,660
 When I read this I was like, wow that was a really cool ending which I will tell you

403
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
 in a second.

404
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,380
 That's a really cool ending like I never ever thought about that.

405
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,020
 I mean it makes total sense but it never once occurred to me.

406
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,220
 That could happen.

407
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,780
 Then you'll look at Amazon, there's a bunch of one star reviews and they said, this book

408
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,060
 traumatized my child.

409
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,860
 My child ran out of the room crying.

410
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,740
 I can't believe anyone would write a book like this.

411
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
 This is so traumatic.

412
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,900
 Like there's multiple one star reviews that say that.

413
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,280
 The final page.

414
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
 We learn.

415
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,460
 I never ever thought about this.

416
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,020
 This is why I don't write children's books.

417
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,580
 We learned that Humpty Dumpty, did you know Humpty Dumpty was an egg?

418
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,540
 And inside the egg was a bird.

419
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:05,540
 So when he climbs back up to the wall he shatters open and this beautiful bird flies out of

420
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,860
 him to join his brethren in the sky.

421
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,600
 He's finally free of the depression, he's finally free of the fear.

422
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,160
 And as the egg parts of his body fall to the ground below it doesn't matter what Humpty

423
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,280
 Dumpty was.

424
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,320
 An egg who fell off a wall who was scared.

425
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 He's now this bird.

426
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,280
 He's soaring through the air.

427
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,240
 And I remember seeing that last page and I was like wow.

428
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,120
 Like that's a really cool way to end that story.

429
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
 The other way to read it.

430
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,360
 A bunch of people thought that he finally got over his deep-seated fear of heights and

431
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,480
 when he climbed to the top of the wall to get his paper airplane a bird smashed into

432
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
 him killing him instantly.

433
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,100
 And his body parts rained down on the city below.

434
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:03,720
 They thought that the bird didn't erupt from him, that the bird crashed into his fragile

435
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,320
 egg form and killed him on the spot.

436
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,400
 There's a lot of one-star reviews for the book saying this book traumatized my kids.

437
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
 They will never eat chicken or an egg ever again.

438
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,880
 Fascinating book though.

439
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,120
 I really recommend it.

440
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,920
 It's a really cool look at depression and at fear and how those things hold you back

441
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,340
 from doing the stuff you love.

442
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,400
 And again, they're talking about twist ending.

443
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,840
 I never once thought that Humpty Dumpty had a bird inside.

444
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,800
 I just assumed it was an egg.

445
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,160
 It was a fairy tale, right?

446
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
 Fascinating book.

447
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
 I just wanted to tell you that story.

448
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,680
 I thought it was cool and the way people can see things differently is also interesting

449
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 as well.

450
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,920
 Brandon Schlaw, but let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous Carbenter

451
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
 Coptor.

452
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,320
 We are leaving behind this bookstore.

453
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,120
 We're eating scrambled eggs in front of kids.

454
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,360
 We're like, "Ha ha, here he goes kids.

455
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,040
 The bird killed him and then he's in my tummy."

456
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,360
 Take us all the way out.

457
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,960
 The Colorado Springs, Colorado.

458
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,960
 It's the 1990s.

459
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,600
 We're headed out to Pike's Peak Avenue.

460
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
 Maybe.

461
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,760
 This might be the location of it.

462
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,600
 Because like so many ghost stories and just reality in general, right?

463
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 Buildings are torn down.

464
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
 New buildings are built.

465
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,080
 Businesses fail or replaced by other businesses.

466
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,760
 This is just the way of the world.

467
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,560
 So as of right now, if you're in Colorado Springs, Colorado, I tried looking this up

468
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,800
 on the map.

469
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,400
 We may be standing outside the UC Health Building, which is a Memorial Administrative

470
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,040
 Center, UC Health.

471
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,160
 And I'm very curious as to whether or not they get any more of this haunting phenomenon

472
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 there.

473
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,600
 But back in the 1990s, it was a Montgomery Wards.

474
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,840
 Do you guys remember that?

475
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
 It was the department store, Montgomery Wards.

476
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,680
 It was one of the biggest department chains in the country.

477
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,000
 But now, if it even exists, it's a handful of stores.

478
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,120
 When it was a Montgomery Wards, though, it was reported to have a haunted bathroom.

479
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,400
 So when you walked through the store and you went back there and you had the women's bathroom

480
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,920
 and the men's bathroom, people would report that both of these bathrooms were haunted.

481
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,280
 And again, we talked about this on yesterday's episode.

482
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,760
 Very, very classic bathroom hauntings.

483
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,280
 As in the bathroom sinks would turn on and off, the lights would turn on and off as well,

484
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,120
 and the toilets would flush by themselves.

485
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,840
 Now what's funny is all three of those are now automated in most restrooms.

486
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,320
 Motion sensors on the lights, motion sensors on the faucets, motion sensors on the toilets,

487
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
 but luckily there's also a button you can press when you gotta do the courtesy flush.

488
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,640
 And when I was reading the story, I thought, "Well, here's a conspiracy theory for you.

489
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,520
 What if the reason why all of those have been invented is to cover up the existence of bathroom ghosts?"

490
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,000
 You're like, "Jayson, okay, you're not gonna talk about this for the next 10 minutes.

491
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,640
 No, no, no, no, no, no, I got some other stuff about this bathroom, but..."

492
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
 What if, right?

493
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,040
 I mean, sure, they could all be waged so some 10-year-old doesn't turn on the water,

494
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,720
 faucet and leave, and then 10 hours later you're like, "Oh, man, was this running all day?"

495
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,680
 Like, it just turns on for a little bit.

496
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,440
 It's a water saving thing.

497
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,320
 It's electricity saving thing to have motion sensors on the lights, but I'm just saying,

498
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,720
 what if there was some sort of government council and they're like, "We have a real problem,

499
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 ladies and gentlemen.

500
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,120
 The bathroom ghosts have gone up 800 percent."

501
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,920
 And people are like, "Oh, no, not the bathroom ghosts."

502
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,960
 And he's like, "The only way to cover up the existence of the afterlife is to install

503
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
 motion detectors in all of these devices.

504
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,880
 It may even save a little bit of electricity and it'll save a lot of water, but it will

505
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,880
 mostly save people from finding out.

506
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,440
 Don't die in a bathroom if you die anywhere.

507
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,840
 You don't want to die in a bathroom in there.

508
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,000
 I'll clap into the meeting."

509
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Just a conspiracy theory.

510
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,080
 I don't have any proof to back that up, but that's not what we're specifically here for.

511
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
 I just thought that was kind of interesting.

512
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,440
 The reason why we're at the Colorado Springs Wards is, back in the 1990s, there was a

513
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,760
 story that happened.

514
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,040
 There was a family that went shopping at the wards.

515
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 The story goes like this.

516
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,080
 Some versions, there's two kids, a son and a daughter.

517
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,760
 Some versions, there's just the son.

518
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,360
 Whatever however many kids there were, here's the story.

519
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,600
 You have a father will do the son, we'll just do the one kid.

520
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,120
 We'll have a father and a mother and their son, they travel to Montgomery wards to do

521
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,600
 some shopping.

522
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,280
 Eventually, the son goes to the bathroom, right?

523
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,880
 You're shopping for a prolonged period of time.

524
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,120
 You got to go to the bathroom.

525
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,640
 So you go in there, you're like, "What?

526
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 What's a bathroom?

527
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
 Huh?

528
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,280
 He's going to tell us some cool stuff."

529
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,480
 I never heard about this place.

530
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,560
 No, you know what a bathroom is.

531
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,080
 The kid says, "I got to go to the bathroom."

532
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,880
 And dad's like, "Sure, I'll take you there."

533
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
 We don't know how old this kid was, but let's say eight, right?

534
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
 Maybe you don't want your eight-year-old walking around Montgomery wards all by himself.

535
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,600
 The dad walks with the kid and the son's like, "Okay, I got this from here, dad."

536
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,880
 And he goes into the bathroom and the second the door shuts, all of a sudden, the father,

537
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:32,840
 who's standing outside hears the worst blood-curdling scream he could ever imagine coming from inside

538
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
 the bathroom.

539
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:43,640
 And to make it 10,000 times worse, this horrifying scream is coming from his son.

540
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:51,040
 He recognizes his son's ear-piercing scream of terror, right?

541
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,880
 It's not just he's excited the Jonas Brothers are in town.

542
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,800
 It's not just the normal screaming, because he watched a scary movie.

543
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,440
 This is one of those screams that most people live their entire life without hearing.

544
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,560
 And he's hearing it coming from his son, who just entered into this bathroom.

545
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,600
 So the father rushes into the boy's restroom at this Montgomery wards.

546
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:21,960
 And his son's gone, vanished, never saw his son again.

547
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,520
 Now there's another version of this story where it's not a single son, it's a son and

548
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,920
 a daughter, and they go into, you know, boy goes in the boy restroom, girl goes in the

549
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,760
 girl restroom, and they never come out.

550
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
 There's no screaming.

551
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,760
 One of the ones where the kid's screaming for his life, I'm like, "Now that's entertainment."

552
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,400
 There's another one where these two kids just go into the restroom, they never come out.

553
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,320
 And they never saw the kids again.

554
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,800
 We don't know how much of this is urban legend.

555
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,840
 I'm just trying to look it up, like I always do.

556
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,160
 I'm like looking up, trying to find old news report on this.

557
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,960
 I could not find, when I Google searched, Colorado Springs Montgomery wards missing kid, nothing

558
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
 came up.

559
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,480
 Okay, but again, evidence of absence is not absence of evidence.

560
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 Is that the other one?

561
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
 Or is it the other way?

562
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

563
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
 Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

564
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,560
 The point is, is that I couldn't prove that the story existed, but I couldn't prove it

565
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,320
 didn't.

566
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,880
 And we have this haunting at this Montgomery wards.

567
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,800
 But what is fascinating about this is the ghosts in the restrooms, because remember there's

568
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,680
 one version, it's just a boy, and the other version, it is a boy and a girl, because both

569
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:43,600
 restrooms are haunted, the ghosts of the bathrooms at Montgomery wards were the parents.

570
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:51,080
 It wasn't the son, or in the other version, the son and the daughter.

571
00:29:51,080 --> 00:30:01,720
 It was the ghosts of the parents, their psychic pain over their missing child or children.

572
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,640
 That is what you're experiencing when the water's turning on and off and the lights are

573
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,240
 shutting on and off and the flesh is.

574
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,440
 That is not the ghosts of the children.

575
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,400
 It's not even the ghosts of the phenomenon that may have snatched the child in the first

576
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,240
 place, because at the end of the day, we have these missing kids.

577
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,680
 No, the ghost is actually the ghost of the parents who lost a child or children that

578
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
 day.

579
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,040
 So that's an interesting little twist to that.

580
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,440
 You might call that a Humpty Dumpty, that's my new term for a twist.

581
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,560
 Humpty Dumpty, there's a bird in him, did you know that?

582
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,160
 They're like, what in the world are you talking about you lunatic?

583
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,960
 They Humpty Dumpty-duss.

584
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,680
 The ghosts are not the boys, and really we're kind of painting over the pigeon in this one.

585
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,720
 What is, that's my new catchphrase, I don't know what it means, but what was the thing

586
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,720
 that kidnapped these kids in the first place?

587
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,360
 What in the world was that?

588
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,400
 Like something that could just make people disappear?

589
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,840
 Were there other missing people reports?

590
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,880
 When Gummery Awards, when Gummery Awards, they're like, man sales are up this year,

591
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,080
 but missing children is also up.

592
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,040
 We should probably do something about the whole missing kids thing.

593
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,760
 The boss is like, nah, nah, as long as the parents are spending money.

594
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
 What was that?

595
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
 What was that force?

596
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,360
 Did they know clip?

597
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,280
 Was this the original back rooms?

598
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,480
 Did they fall into some alternate universe?

599
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,280
 Nothing but yellow hallways?

600
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
 Did the human get them?

601
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
 Ghosts get them?

602
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
 What happened to the kids?

603
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,600
 We don't have any answer to that.

604
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,480
 The building's not there anymore.

605
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,880
 There may be a bunch of missing nurses from this UC health building.

606
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,680
 But I'm just curious to see, like there's so many interesting, and again the story could

607
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,680
 totally be made up.

608
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,200
 I found it on theshadowlands.net.

609
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
 I found it in one other location as well.

610
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,240
 And that was that.

611
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,920
 What was the force that kidnapped the kids?

612
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,120
 Where did the kids go?

613
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,880
 And I find it so funny because those are both unknowable things.

614
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,680
 Those are both unknowable things.

615
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
 Very creepy.

616
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,760
 But I find it so interesting that the kids there, the parents, in a way they never left

617
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
 that area.

618
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,720
 Like their psychic residue just stained that whole area.

619
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,600
 They were the ones interacting with everything.

620
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,280
 And it's a creepy story just in and of a ghost story, but I wanted to wrap it up like this.

621
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,040
 What is it?

622
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,000
 If I told you a story about a little boy who went into a restroom and never came out, just

623
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 vanished.

624
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,160
 I did that story a long time ago.

625
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,800
 This was a story I remember hearing as a kid.

626
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
 And it terrified me.

627
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,760
 I'll put it in the show notes, but it's horrible.

628
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,800
 A kid, this is 100% true.

629
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,360
 A kid walked into a rest stop bathroom or was it like a gas station bathroom?

630
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,080
 The dad was outside the bathroom and the kid walked in.

631
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,280
 And the kid didn't come out and the kid didn't come out and the kid didn't come out.

632
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,800
 And then the dad went in there and his kid's throat had been slit from ear to ear.

633
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 There was just like some maniac in there.

634
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,280
 He killed like this 12 year old kid who just walked into the bathroom.

635
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:09,080
 I don't know why I always drop these horrifying true crime stories like right after a semi-lighthearted

636
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,560
 paranormal one, but that story terrified me as a kid.

637
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,640
 It's a 100% true crime story like the maniac was caught.

638
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,400
 My question is this though, after I basically terrified you with that story, my question

639
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,280
 is this, why are bathrooms so scary?

640
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,960
 Because if I told you a story about a kid who walked into a department store bathroom

641
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,880
 back in the 90s and never came back out, he walked in, you hear an ear piercing scream,

642
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
 you run inside, it's empty.

643
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,880
 If I told you that story, most people would go "Yeah, that makes sense."

644
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,800
 Yeah.

645
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,960
 And even if you don't believe in the paranormal, even if you thought in one area that was completely

646
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,000
 ludicrous Jason, people just don't disappear.

647
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,480
 In the back of your mind you're thinking "Yeah, that kind of doesn't make sense.

648
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
 Bathrooms are creepy."

649
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,080
 Why are bathrooms creepy?

650
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,000
 And I think you could look at it from a psychological level and people can go "Well, that's where

651
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,560
 the most vulnerable.

652
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,120
 Normally our pants are down around our ankles and that's me of the year and all.

653
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,320
 I'm standing there with my pants down around my ankles."

654
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:18,360
 You know, basically you're exposed on a predator/prey level when you're pooping, when you're

655
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,840
 peeing, is when you're the most vulnerable.

656
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,000
 So is it a psychological thing?

657
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,680
 When we're, whether we're going to the bathroom in our own restroom or in a public restroom,

658
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,920
 it's both creepy.

659
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
 It's both creepy.

660
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,560
 Like it has all the stuff you could not want as far as like creep level goes.

661
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,120
 That was a weirdly constructed sentence but I think you know what I mean.

662
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,040
 Mirrors are creepy.

663
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,520
 Water is a little creepy.

664
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
 Remember last story?

665
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,680
 There's cavities man!

666
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,080
 It's causing cavities.

667
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,280
 Water and ghosts have a really strong connection.

668
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,280
 Water and the paranormal have a very, very close connection.

669
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:03,800
 There's a lot of paranormal lore that says that any body of water will attract spirits

670
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 more than anything else.

671
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,160
 And that's funny because yesterday we were talking about ghosts are constantly thirsty.

672
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,480
 Running water, lakes, rivers, coastlines, whatever.

673
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,120
 They seem to have a really strong draw on the world of paranormal.

674
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,080
 So that little bit of water in your toilet, like I don't know, maybe there's a ghost in

675
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
 there.

676
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,520
 And then, actually I just thought about it, what about that huge thing behind you, that

677
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,320
 huge ceramic thing full of water?

678
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
 There might be a ghost in there too.

679
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,840
 Just kind of hanging out.

680
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,680
 And then so, and then you're naked, right?

681
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
 You're naked.

682
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,960
 You're sitting there, you're pooping, and you are physically vulnerable.

683
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,560
 You got all the stuff that you don't want, right?

684
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,240
 And the doors are super flimsy.

685
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,080
 You go, think about when you go to a public restroom, you've already sat on the podcast,

686
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,360
 you're like, "Okay, this is the next 10 minutes, he's just talking about nonsense, see you tomorrow

687
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,440
 bro."

688
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:04,100
 You go into a public restroom, you have the flimsiest of doors that have like an inch gap.

689
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,080
 You can see through.

690
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,800
 It's just such a vulnerable place, it's a vulnerable state, and they're creepy.

691
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,720
 Like when you go into a public restroom, part of you goes, "Man, I hope no one else is in

692
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,720
 there because I want to be able to poop and pee."

693
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,160
 But then you get in there and then you're like super spooky.

694
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,360
 You can't wish there was a guy in the next stall that you can be like, "Hey, did you

695
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
 see Smile?"

696
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,880
 You can't even see that movie, man.

697
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,440
 If you've read the spoilers for Black Adam, then you hear that guy doesn't even wipe,

698
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,740
 he just gets out of the stall and leaves, really.

699
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,860
 Yeah, I guess he doesn't like superhero movies.

700
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,100
 Bathrooms are creepy, even your own personal bathroom are creepy.

701
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,780
 Public restrooms are really creepy, and again, not creepy because some guy might be in there

702
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,620
 with a razor blade to slit your throat.

703
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:54,100
 Although that, that is a concern as well, but why are public restrooms just spooky?

704
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,340
 Is it because there's always a bunch of doors that you can't see through?

705
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,780
 Is it because of the horror movies?

706
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,200
 Is it because of the things that we've seen?

707
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,520
 Or is it real stuff?

708
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,320
 Is it you have all of these closed doors?

709
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,560
 You don't know if there's any threats nearby.

710
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,360
 You're having to take your clothes off.

711
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,560
 You're going to the bathroom.

712
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,280
 You're super vulnerable.

713
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,920
 And best case scenario is you're all alone, and worst case scenario is you're all alone.

714
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,520
 Like there is just something intrinsically spooky about public restrooms.

715
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,760
 Your own restroom, yes, but public restrooms specifically.

716
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,780
 So when I read this story about this kid disappearing, I go, "Yeah, that could happen."

717
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,100
 Like if it happened in the middle of a restaurant and the kid's just like, "Ahh!" and he like

718
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,580
 disappeared, I still do a story on it.

719
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,180
 I'm still covering on my paranormal podcast.

720
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,740
 But I'd be like, "Yeah, it's a little weird."

721
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,220
 You know, he was in the middle of a public restaurant.

722
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,620
 He's in the middle of a McDonald's and he dematerialized.

723
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,980
 That's not cool for the kid, but it gave me something to talk about.

724
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,560
 But it would just kind of be an outlier, but the fact of someone going into a bathroom

725
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,640
 and never coming out again, maybe it is because I read the action now, the thing about it

726
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,480
 might be because I got traumatized by that true crime story when I was a kid.

727
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,120
 But this story really resonated with me.

728
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,880
 I could totally see this happening.

729
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,680
 If you're going to disappear anywhere in a civilized world, I'm not talking about you're

730
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,080
 walking in the middle of a national park, or you're climbing through mountains in Russia,

731
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,160
 or you're out in the middle of the desert.

732
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,060
 If you're going to disappear anywhere in modern society due to a paranormal phenomenon, I

733
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,820
 believe it would be in a public restroom.

734
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,340
 I don't know why I believe that.

735
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,820
 I don't feel like I can put in words.

736
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,940
 I feel like I've been trying to put in words for a while.

737
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,820
 But there's something deeply unsettling to me about public restrooms.

738
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,220
 It could just be because of horror movies.

739
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,060
 It could be because of urban legends like Bloody Mary.

740
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,660
 It could be because of true crimes that I've actually come across in my research.

741
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:58,200
 Or it could actually be that the act of humans sitting on these porcelain seats and defecating

742
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,800
 into them, and then you leave and then someone else poops into them and someone else poops

743
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
 into them.

744
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,520
 This, I mean, how much of this is a ritual?

745
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,800
 How much of this could you accidentally be performing some sort of weird ritual?

746
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,060
 We did an episode a long time ago about there is this demon who he feeds on our excrement.

747
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,780
 The way it works is like every time you poop you're giving him an offering.

748
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,980
 And so is it something weird like that?

749
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,300
 Is there something more disturbing about being in a public restroom as opposed to your own?

750
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,860
 Which household restrooms are creepy too, but is it because of that?

751
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:45,120
 It's because you have hundreds of pounds of poop from hundreds of butts being produced

752
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:52,800
 every single day and there is some sort of weird mystical psychic energy being generated

753
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
 there.

754
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,280
 But there may not be a demon necessarily to feed off of that, but you are having all

755
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,760
 of this physical residue being washed away, but the psychic residue stains the area and

756
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,520
 it weakens the walls between the real and the unreal.

757
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,660
 That's kind of what I was getting at.

758
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,780
 That's kind of all of that long winded stuff.

759
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,420
 That's kind of what I was trying to put it into words.

760
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,660
 Is there something with this repeated act of defecation and urination?

761
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,460
 And to us it is a biological thing, but you can't tell me you don't feel weird when you're

762
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,260
 in these public restrooms.

763
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,340
 Or maybe you can.

764
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:36,300
 Maybe it's just me, but I'm wondering if it is this constant purging of our own bodies

765
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,960
 is doing something to the barrier in these places.

766
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
 Not all of them, right?

767
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,880
 But you may have these places that have been around for so long and this has been going

768
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,400
 on for so many years.

769
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,640
 These so many strangers, so many butts that it actually is causing.

770
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,160
 If not something so dramatic that people walk in, scream and are never seen again, definitely

771
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,640
 causes an easier way for the ghosts to interact with, right?

772
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,660
 In the haunted bathrooms they do seem to pop up a lot throughout the lore.

773
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,500
 I won't say it's the most popular place to hunt, but you'll find a ton of them.

774
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,860
 And you could go chase some faulty pipes, that's why faulty lights, that's why it's just...

775
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
 maybe.

776
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,060
 But I don't know.

777
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,820
 Public restrooms are spooky.

778
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,460
 I've always thought they were spooky.

779
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,820
 And yeah, when I was a kid I read a story about a little boy who got his throat sled in one.

780
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,420
 And that could be the reason why.

781
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,920
 But I also think it might be the other thing.

782
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:43,760
 It might be that no place on earth was meant for that many butts to produce that much poop.

783
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,680
 But we've been doing it for so long, it actually is.

784
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,640
 And all of these hotspots all over the world, these public restrooms, it actually is allowing

785
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,520
 the unreal to become real.

786
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,320
 It's creating these doorways for the world of the paranormal to intrude on our own.

787
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,340
 So the next time you're out shopping, after a large meal of Taco Bell, and you feel that

788
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,820
 seven layer burrito pushing against your lower intestine, I say hold it in, I say hold it

789
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,620
 in bro.

790
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,020
 Don't take the chance.

791
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,100
 Don't take a chance, because sure you might be able to relieve that horrible feeling in

792
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,820
 your body and purge yourself of all of that Taco Bell, but it's worth it that there's

793
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,700
 a couple that make it shoot.

794
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,360
 I'm encouraging you to have a blockage in your lower, you go to the hospital, they're

795
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 like, dude it looks like you haven't gone to the bathroom in like two weeks.

796
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,240
 The goblins, the goblins, I listened to this podcast, Dead Rabbit Radio, recommended it

797
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,480
 to the doctors as he's doing surgery on you.

798
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,920
 He told me that there's a chance that if I go to the bathroom, the public can go, they

799
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,320
 might give me in there like what?

800
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,880
 I totally got it, what?

801
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
 That's insane.

802
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,480
 I totally got to check out that podcast and you're like giving them a thumbs up.

803
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,260
 And then the doctors are goblins, he's through goblins wearing a mask.
