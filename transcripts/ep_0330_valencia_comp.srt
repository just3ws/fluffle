1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 I, Jason Carpenter, have discovered a new intoxicating drug.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,000
 I found it out myself!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Firefighters, I don't know why I was so excited that I may be the inventor of Jinn 2.0.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,560
 Firefighters go to a farm in the middle of the night to put out a fire and end up in

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,720
 a sticky predicament.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,720
 And then we take a trip on the SS Valencia, a passenger ship that ran aground off the

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,040
 coast of British Columbia.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,320
 And to this day, the horror stories of that night are still etched into the soul and the

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,400
 sand of a lonely beach.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:53,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,640
 So I discovered a new drug.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 Shake it up here.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
 Shake it up.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
 Shake it up.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,680
 That'll be the theme song for the, when I start advertising this drug, when I become a drug

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
 baron.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,200
 Actually, why am I telling you guys about this?

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,480
 I should probably patent it first.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,640
 It is saying something.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,640
 It's a public patenting something.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,480
 I'm gonna walk out and I'm like, "Self driving wheelbarrow."

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,640
 And then everyone's like, "Damn, I can't do that now."

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,080
 Let me take a sip of my new drink.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,600
 This is the true Jason juice, by the way.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
 If you drink this, you will feel like me.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
 Because when I drink it, I feel like, "Whoa, whoa, okay.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
 That's a side effect.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,400
 It wants to explode."

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,800
 So I discovered this.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,720
 Actually I don't think I can patent it because I bought it.

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,000
 But if you take a sparkling water drink, like none of that gross stuff like Bubbly or LaCroix,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,880
 get a real drink.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
 I choose sparkling ice.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 Cherry limeade.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
 Sparkling ice, cherry limeade.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,480
 Or clear American ice, which I think they're discontinuing.

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 Cherry lemonade.

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,680
 And then you take 500 milligrams of turmeric with ginger in it.

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
 It's the little pills you can buy.

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,320
 I'm not asking you to go to the steps of Mongolia and start picking turmeric yourself.

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,240
 You can just buy little turmeric supplements or the powder itself.

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
 It doesn't matter.

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,400
 And then you insert, you break open the pill if you have the pill and you put the powder

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
 in your drink.

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,480
 And then I'm going to take a drink here.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,480
 Here's the thing.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,120
 Either I've discovered that a combination of sparkling water and turmeric has a, I wouldn't

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,400
 say intoxicating, but definitely a light-headed, pleasant effect.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,640
 Or I'm giving myself an allergic reaction to turmeric.

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,880
 But I've taken turmeric before.

55
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,640
 I've been taking turmeric supplements for a while in pill form.

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,840
 And then one day I got some powdered turmeric and I was like, pour it in your drink for

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,960
 a boost of energy.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,400
 So technically I can't pan it because someone else did it.

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,480
 But I did it and I was like, whoa, man, where's the floor, dude?

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,080
 Why are we like on a ball in the darkness of space, man?

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,360
 Like, I was like, good thing I don't have a car because I was not feeling good.

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
 Well, I was feeling great.

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
 That was the problem.

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,320
 I had a turmeric, sparkling ice or clear American ice, whatever flavor.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,040
 But I know for a fact the cherry limeade stuff works or the cherry lemonade.

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
 And yeah, dude, it's really weird.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,440
 It's almost, I don't want to say like I'm already floating through the void, but we'll

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 see.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,440
 And it's hard to overdose.

70
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,440
 Okay, let me rephrase that.

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,920
 You can overdose on it, but it's like the overdose is like 1500 milligrams.

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,800
 So you'd have to do it three times a day.

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,440
 Which to be fair, as good as it can make you feel, it's probably not hard to do.

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,320
 But anyways, turmeric, clear American ice, please don't everyone go up.

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,240
 What if this becomes the new face eating drug?

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,960
 This is bath salt 2.0.

77
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,920
 I just haven't figured that out yet.

78
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,760
 I think I'm feeling like super chill and everyone else is like hiding the silverware from me.

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,600
 I'm like, yeah, dude, I'm feeling good.

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,920
 Okay, let's go ahead though and get started with the actual episode.

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 Let's go ahead.

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,080
 We're going to hop into a fire truck.

83
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,320
 We're going to sneak on.

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
 We're going to get all, you can get on my shoulders and we'll wear a giant fireman's

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
 costume.

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 What are they called?

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 The uniform.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,040
 That's normally what they're called.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,080
 Hey cop, nice costume.

90
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,440
 Yeah, I don't say that.

91
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,560
 You get on my, I'm assuming we're both only like three feet tall.

92
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,160
 So we're like the little rascals.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,680
 You get on my shoulders and you're like Jason, that's very, very kind of you.

94
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,840
 Normally you make me carry you around.

95
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
 And I'm like, I know, right?

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,040
 I am a good host, blaming on the Jason Jews.

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
 So I put you on my shoulders.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
 We're both three feet high.

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,400
 So it takes both of us to fit into one fireman's costume, walking into the fire station and

100
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
 I'm being extra wiggly.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,760
 You're all, and the firefighters, we are actually in Yaram, which is in Victoria, Australia.

102
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,240
 So Yaram is probably the city in Victoria's, the state or province.

103
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,400
 Australia.

104
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,040
 So imagine everything's upside down in this story.

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
 It's September 2019.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
 So very, very recent.

107
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,480
 And we're all sitting in the playing cards and I'm kind of like falling asleep.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,720
 You're like, oh, my legs are asleep.

109
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,880
 And you're just kind of like, waking me up because the alarm goes off and it's like,

110
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,560
 and so anyways, all the firefighters are getting up and they're running around.

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,120
 They were wondering why you were wearing your fireman's giant jacket that whole time.

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,240
 I imagine they never think about it.

113
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,080
 Firefighters don't wear the giant jackets anymore.

114
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,520
 They go all the way down to their ankles.

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,440
 They may not have ever worn them.

116
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,400
 I think I just saw them in a cartoon or something.

117
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,560
 It's 3 a.m.

118
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,280
 We're riding with the firefighter crew.

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,280
 We get a call out to a barn, well to a farm.

120
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
 It's multiple barns.

121
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
 It's not just one.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,120
 It's a very successful farm.

123
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
 And it's called Yaram Herd Services.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,720
 So Yaram, the firefighter truck, fire engine, it's the name of it, drives past the signs

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,440
 as Yaram Herd Services and we all jump out.

126
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,600
 Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, getting the hoses ready.

127
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,880
 And I'm making sure we're getting super close to the fire.

128
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
 You're like, no dude, stop.

129
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
 I don't even have a hose yet.

130
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
 I'm like, hehehehe.

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,840
 Because I know what's going to happen here.

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,920
 Yaram Herd Services, what they do is they provide breeding services.

133
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
 Breeding services, right?

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,040
 So there's all these cylinders lining the farm.

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,800
 They're all giant.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,680
 They're all these giant cylinders.

137
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,800
 They're all full of bull semen.

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
 And they're on fire.

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,880
 And so they're full of boiling bull semen.

140
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:51,880
 [Bulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbulbul

141
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:10,320
 It's not like some dubstep song, but it's not.

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
 It's bubbling, boiling bull semen.

143
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 And it's so hot that the lids are exploding off the cylinder and bulges is just flying

144
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
 all over the place.

145
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,920
 It's like the Indian Ghostbusters when the marshmallow man blows up.

146
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,560
 But not that.

147
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
 It's not that substance.

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,560
 You're like, I've been slimed and then your whole body becomes HPV.

149
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,120
 Actually, I wonder, I know animals can get, actually no I don't.

150
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,960
 Can animals get STDs?

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,600
 Like I'm sure, monkeys can have AIDS, but it doesn't affect them, right?

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,360
 Can a dog have gone real?

153
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,600
 Just stating that question made my stomach hurt.

154
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
 Ugh.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 Ugh.

156
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 Ugh.

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,160
 I'm not acting.

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,400
 Just that visual is making me...

159
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,480
 Let's table that discussion.

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,200
 I think that's a dead rabbit radio first, where I'm just like, nope, I can't go down that

161
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
 path.

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
 Anyways.

163
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,720
 Oh my god, that's disgusting.

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,280
 Anyways, I'm sure animals can have some sort of STD.

165
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,880
 We'll just leave it at that.

166
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,200
 Anyways, bull semen's gone everywhere.

167
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,000
 Now, I didn't know this.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,920
 You there, here's some bull, so they put the fire out.

169
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,600
 It's not still raging.

170
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,720
 There's not boiling bull semen epidemic.

171
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,920
 It's traveling across Australia.

172
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,200
 But here's some bull semen tidbits.

173
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,120
 One of them is not about STDs, that's disgusting.

174
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,840
 Bull semen is measured in straws.

175
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 Which is disgusting.

176
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,600
 Like, don't measure it in something that you put your mouth on.

177
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,040
 If you have a disgusting, you're like, hey, how many feces do we have?

178
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
 Oh, we got about three mouthfuls.

179
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
 Like what?

180
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
 No.

181
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,840
 Don't measure it and why a straw?

182
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,800
 Jason, because it's a tube, name it a tube.

183
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
 I got 35 tubes of bull semen over here.

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,160
 Because if you say I got 35 straws of bull semen over here, the visual is you are ready

185
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
 to go.

186
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,800
 It's not a straw, it's something you put in a milkshake.

187
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 It's not something that you feel full of bull semen.

188
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 Here's a bull.

189
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
 You're like, Jason, when did your podcast become paranormal, conspiracy and bull semen

190
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 tips?

191
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 I just got one more.

192
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
 I just got one more.

193
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,880
 Bull semen.

194
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,040
 So this guy's bull semen wasn't that valuable.

195
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,000
 This per straw was about $5 to $95 per straw, which is more valuable than a straw full of

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,040
 my semen, sure.

197
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,480
 But I would be disappointed if I had a bull that I raised and it was like my prized bull

198
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,200
 and you only got five bucks for some of the semen.

199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,040
 I'd be like, oh man, I'd be disappointed.

200
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,320
 And then this other guy's bull can get 95 bucks for a little bit of a semen.

201
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,560
 So I just find that weird.

202
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,480
 So this guy, but that was like bottom of the barrel stuff.

203
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,600
 That was like lame-o semen because some of these straws go up for $8,000.

204
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,200
 And it's like wagyu beef.

205
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,560
 Wagyu beef, it's that special beef they eat in Japan.

206
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,680
 You get them big bowls, those perfectly bred bowls, $8,000 for a little bit of their semen

207
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,960
 so you can go inject it into a, not inject it, you can pregnae, be the proper term.

208
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,560
 Into a female cow and then have little wagyu babies.

209
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
 But anyways, so there you go.

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,600
 There is your daily bull semen.

211
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,920
 I'll have more bull semen tips tomorrow on Dead Rabbit Radio, the Daily Paranormal Conspiracy

212
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,640
 and Bull Seamen Podcast.

213
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,760
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

214
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,080
 We're taking off our uniforms and you're going to go take a shower.

215
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:04,000
 And when you're done, you're going to meet me on the deck of the SS Valencia.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Birds are flying by.

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,360
 Do birds fly at night?

218
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,080
 Anyways, no.

219
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
 Birds aren't flying by because it's midnight.

220
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
 It's 1906 so it's old, tiny.

221
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,220
 Everything smells like sepia tone and it's January 22nd, which is not a good combination.

222
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,520
 You're in the middle of the night.

223
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,920
 January 22nd, which means it's going to be cold.

224
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,960
 Oh, we also were in British Columbia, so Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

225
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,960
 So winter up north, midnight, not a good combination, right?

226
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,240
 We like those things, except like the wind to go.

227
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,680
 The SS Valencia is a passenger steamer.

228
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,800
 56 crew members, 108 passengers.

229
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,440
 So everyone, it's midnight.

230
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,120
 The only people who are really awake are the crew.

231
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
 No one else is kind of dancing around.

232
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,180
 It's not the Titanic.

233
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,040
 Just everyone's asleep at this point.

234
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,960
 Now they've been having some problems.

235
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,320
 The weather was bad.

236
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,080
 They had navigation tools, but their navigation tools were based on the stars.

237
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,240
 So at this point they had to do a thing called dead reckoning, where they're like, if we

238
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,520
 were headed in this direction before we lost all this visibility, we must, we have to assume

239
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,280
 we're still headed in this direction.

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 Very, very dangerous way to pilot a ship, but it's what they have to do.

241
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,160
 It's midnight and the boat is going through the water.

242
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,960
 The SS Valencia is going through the water.

243
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,120
 Apparently also a giant is walking across the landscape.

244
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,720
 So we have a storm that's picking up.

245
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,920
 We have midnight.

246
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
 It's winter.

247
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,280
 The boat can't see where it's going.

248
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,320
 And then of course, tragedy strikes.

249
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,880
 So the boat ends up hitting a bunch of rocks.

250
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,000
 So they're like, well, we were headed in the right direction because we were trying to get

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,960
 to land, but not this way.

252
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,000
 The boat just gets tore up in the bottom immediately begins taking in water.

253
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Now the captain comes out.

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,680
 Everyone at this point, everyone is awake.

255
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,600
 And if they were dancing, they definitely stopped boats taking water.

256
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,360
 And the captain goes, okay, this is not good.

257
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,880
 I'm not, I've been in the captain for long, but I'm pretty sure boats are supposed to

258
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,000
 be on top of the water.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
 Let's, and there's no way, they're just massive damage.

260
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,640
 So he goes, okay, this is what we're going to do.

261
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,160
 100 yards out.

262
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
 They can see it.

263
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,880
 100 yards out is a small beach.

264
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,000
 We're going to crash the boat onto the beach on purpose because otherwise we're going to

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,640
 sink and everyone's like, are you sure captain?

266
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,200
 And he's like, yes, I just said that I'm not spitballing.

267
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
 This isn't a committee.

268
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 Let's just do it.

269
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 I'm not a captain.

270
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,800
 And that's not a bad plan.

271
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,080
 I mean, at that point, the boat had taken so much damage that they weren't going to be

272
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,400
 able to repair it.

273
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
 And land was only a hundred, a football field away.

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,960
 So they decide to go and purposely crash the boat into the land, but they don't get far

275
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
 at all.

276
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,000
 They end up crashing into more rocks.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
 And now they're actually stuck on the rocks.

278
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,280
 The waves are so high.

279
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,040
 The storm is so bad and now they're not moving up and down with the ocean.

280
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,560
 Now they're actually stuck to the ground and they can still see the beach still around

281
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,200
 100 yards in front of them.

282
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,880
 The waves are so high at one point.

283
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,200
 So after the boat hits the rocks the second time, a bunch of people came up out of the

284
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,280
 hole of the ship to see what was going on.

285
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,320
 And as people were coming out of the door, a wave came over the ship, washed like 10 people

286
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
 overboard, killed them.

287
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,560
 At this point everyone's like, "Oh my god, this is not a good situation for us to be

288
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
 in.

289
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,920
 We're stuck and these waves are actually bigger than the boat.

290
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,800
 We're not moving with the ocean anymore.

291
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,480
 We're basically its prey."

292
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,200
 Wave after wave of just this cold January water is just smashing into this boat.

293
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,200
 And unless you were holding onto something or inside the boat, you were going overboard.

294
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,040
 The problem is the inside of the boat was filling full of water.

295
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,640
 Winds of up to 35 miles an hour, people are dressed in their nightgowns.

296
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,880
 Their little booties, little pajama slippers, little sleepy time cap, freezing cold winter

297
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,800
 water is attacking them from both above and below.

298
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,000
 Here's a quote from one of the survivors.

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,640
 Screams of women and children mingled in an awful chorus, with the shrieking of the wind,

300
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,760
 the dash of rain, and the roar of the breakers.

301
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,320
 As the passengers rushed on deck, they were carried away in bunches by the huge waves that

302
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,240
 seemed as high as the ship's mast heads.

303
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,240
 The ship began to break up almost at once, and the women and children were lashed to the

304
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,760
 rigging above the reach of the sea.

305
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,320
 It was a pitiful sight to see frail women wearing only nightdresses, with bare feet on the freezing

306
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,920
 rat lines trying to shield children in their arms from the icy wind and rain.

307
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,240
 If you weren't in a safe area and they were quickly running out of safe areas, they were

308
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,440
 tying you to the ship.

309
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,200
 So you would get hit by that water and you'd get frozen, not like in place, but you'd get

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,040
 really really cold, but at least you wouldn't be going overboard.

311
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,400
 Because people were just getting knocked overboard.

312
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,240
 Captain goes "Ok guys, I mean this is not good, obviously people are getting tied to

313
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,400
 the boat."

314
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,560
 Captain goes "Let's lower the lifeboats, let's get the lifeboats ready, we're not going to

315
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,000
 drop them yet, but we're going to bring them down and get them ready so when we're ready

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,680
 to drop them, we can drop them."

317
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,680
 Am I clear?

318
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,680
 And everyone's like "Yes sir."

319
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,360
 And then the power goes out.

320
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,880
 So now they're in the pitch black, middle of the night, just huge problems going on.

321
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,600
 And people start seeing the lifeboats come down to the side of the ship.

322
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,040
 So passengers begin to jump into the lifeboats.

323
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,560
 They're like "Oh come on, finally, here let's take this rope off my hand, come on get the

324
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,440
 kids on the boat, come on, doot, that was the sound of someone being put in the boat,

325
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,840
 doot doot doot doot, more people being put in the boat."

326
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,760
 And the captain's like "What is, hey guys, no no no no, we're not lowering the lifeboats

327
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,400
 yet, don't lower the lifeboats."

328
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,840
 But people in the lifeboats were yelling "No no no, lower it, lower it, lower it."

329
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,880
 And the crew, in the middle of the night, in this huge super loud storm, couldn't really

330
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
 figure out what the order was.

331
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,280
 There's seven of these lifeboats.

332
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,960
 As the captain's trying to figure out what to do in this huge storm, people are like

333
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,400
 "They're telling me to lower the lifeboats, so I'm going to lower the lifeboats."

334
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,240
 So they start lowering these lifeboats full of people.

335
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,920
 And as they're lowering these lifeboats, whether it was a snag, human incompetence,

336
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,480
 the storm, whatever.

337
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,160
 The captain was right to say "They don't lower those lifeboats yet."

338
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,840
 Because there's seven of them.

339
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,960
 Six of them have people in them.

340
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,160
 The first three flip over as they're being lowered.

341
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:05,280
 And you have 10 to 20 people per boat fall onto the rocks, mostly women and children,

342
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,440
 and smash into the rocks that have trapped the boat in the first place.

343
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,360
 Killing them instantly.

344
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:18,240
 Those that didn't die by hitting a rock was just swept out into the cold wet darkness.

345
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,480
 Three lifeboats snag, jump, jump, jump, just emptied their contents, screaming people falling

346
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,400
 into the darkness.

347
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,720
 Now the captain realizes what happened at this point and is flipping out.

348
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,080
 Obviously the crew, everyone's panicked at this point.

349
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,760
 Because you think about a lifeboat is supposed to be your way.

350
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
 It's a lifeboat.

351
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,520
 It's the way you get out of these bad situations.

352
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:49,440
 And that safety mechanism has failed so catastrophically that they are watching women and children

353
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,600
 fall into the ocean.

354
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,440
 The other three do get successfully launched.

355
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,920
 So it really was luck of the draw.

356
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,380
 You had 50/50 chance whether or not you just fell under the dark water or ended up in one

357
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,600
 of the other three boats.

358
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,240
 But those boats, two of them capsized.

359
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,320
 Because it was not, you're lowering them onto basically rocks.

360
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,080
 And then they had to get off the rocks because that's where the boat is locked in, into the

361
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 water.

362
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,840
 Two of them get in there capsized.

363
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,040
 Now these people, they didn't smash in the rocks but they drowned very, very quickly.

364
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,480
 The third lifeboat never seen again, some say.

365
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
 And we'll get to that.

366
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,880
 We'll get to the legends in a bit.

367
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,240
 But this is a 100% true story.

368
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
 This isn't a legend.

369
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,480
 Out of the lifeboats on the other side, 12 men were able to survive.

370
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,040
 The women and the children in those boats too, absolutely dead.

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
 Absolutely dead.

372
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,840
 So now the only people you have, you have the crew on the ship, you have the male passengers,

373
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,720
 you have the remaining women and children who stayed on the boat, smartly stayed on

374
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,600
 the boat and were getting tied down to it.

375
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,480
 And now you have these 12 men who have tried to go on a life raft and it capsized and everyone

376
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,440
 else died on it but them.

377
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,600
 One of the men finds himself on a wet rock that's poking out of the ocean, he's holding

378
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,880
 onto it.

379
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:18,120
 Just wave, wave, land is less than a hundred yards away.

380
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,640
 You can look at it.

381
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:27,240
 And after an hour of holding onto that rock, a wave finally smashes into him and everyone

382
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,760
 just sees now an empty rock.

383
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,720
 I think that honestly is the worst.

384
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,960
 Like it's one thing to be like, "Ahhhhhhh!"

385
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:40,000
 Fall on a rock but for an hour hold onto a rock and then eventually lose, that would

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 suck.

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 That would be the worst.

388
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 That would be the worst.

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,840
 First off, I don't really like doing anything for an hour.

390
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,680
 I don't even like standing up for an hour.

391
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,440
 So the fact of holding onto something, but each minute passing and going like, "No, no,

392
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
 no, I don't want to go, I don't want to go."

393
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
 After about 45 minutes of that I'd be like, "Yeah."

394
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,680
 But just to tear an hour long.

395
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,360
 So out of the 12 people, 12 men in that boat, one of them got washed away on a rock.

396
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,640
 Two of them ended up getting separated from the group.

397
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
 Not like the war group.

398
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,320
 They were just a bunch of panic dudes trying to make it to the beach who happened to survive

399
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,720
 these capsized boats.

400
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,320
 Two of them ended up in a cave.

401
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 That's not a good place to be next to the ocean when the tide is rising so they're in

402
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,840
 a cave and the tide is rising.

403
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,520
 Now, there's a beach here but it's not a tropical resort.

404
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,760
 There's a beach and then there's a 100 foot high cliff.

405
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,800
 So it's not like if they can get to the beach they're going to sit and they're going to

406
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,280
 start drinking out of coconuts.

407
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,200
 They then have to scale 100 foot high cliff to get rescued.

408
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,360
 So these two guys are in this cave and the water's getting higher and higher and they're

409
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,740
 like, "We can't swim for it.

410
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,000
 We can try climbing this 100 foot cliff."

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,720
 And they start climbing the cliff and they both fall off into the rocks and die.

412
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 And horrible.

413
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
 Like just die in the beginning.

414
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
 If you're not going to make it.

415
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,280
 Like obviously they don't know the end of the story.

416
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,400
 I do.

417
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,440
 But I think that's just the worst.

418
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,240
 So what happens is those remaining nine dudes who are now on the beach, they also have to

419
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,560
 climb this 100 foot cliff in a rainstorm in the middle of the night and dark.

420
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
 But they do.

421
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,280
 Now, boats are situated with these things called Lyle guns.

422
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,920
 And what it is, it's basically like a really cool looking harpoon that goes *poof* and it's

423
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,800
 a hook with a long rope on the end of it.

424
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,600
 And I had to do a bunch of research on Lyle guns.

425
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,840
 Like the rope can't be too thick, but it can't be too flimsy.

426
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,160
 And what it does is you shoot it to shore and tie it around something and then that gives

427
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,320
 a way for people to be able to climb on the rope to get to safety.

428
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,800
 So it's a last ditch thing.

429
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,920
 Here you've used life preservers and lifeboats and life rafts and all this stuff.

430
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,560
 Because it's hard and they have special equipment like baskets they can shuffle.

431
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,240
 Basically it creates like a zipline type thing.

432
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,960
 But in this case you're shooting it.

433
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,200
 On the captain goes get the Lyle gun ready.

434
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,400
 We're going to shoot it to the top of that cliff.

435
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,160
 It'll give us at least a way to start moving people off the boat.

436
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,480
 Not the easiest thing to do, but it's their only option.

437
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,280
 First shot doesn't work.

438
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,880
 These things were actually quite fragile.

439
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,920
 Because you had to load it just right.

440
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,680
 As you would imagine a bullet made a rope would have to be done.

441
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,520
 But they do shoot off another Lyle.

442
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,480
 They see it go off into the forest on the top of the cliff.

443
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,680
 The captain's like, "That's awesome.

444
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,040
 All we need to do is get someone here, get the Lyle gun rope lying on that side situated.

445
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,080
 He's another terminology either.

446
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,840
 We'll be good."

447
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,640
 So the crew has now climbed this 100 foot cliff.

448
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,520
 They have a decision to make.

449
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,480
 So they're right, they see a telegraph line.

450
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,360
 Again, this is 1906.

451
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,280
 People aren't picking up the radio in the middle of the ocean being like, "Made a made a."

452
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,880
 Unless you can see their little flippy floppy light things, you're toast.

453
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,840
 They see a telegraph line running through the forest.

454
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,360
 And they go, "We should go that way."

455
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,160
 And then that's obviously the best decision because they could go, "This must be civilization

456
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
 that way."

457
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,440
 And then they had turned to the left.

458
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,720
 They would have been a short distance away from where the Lyle gun had landed.

459
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,280
 They would have been able to tie that down and start getting people off the boat.

460
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,360
 But they didn't.

461
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,960
 They had no communication with the ship.

462
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,800
 They didn't even know the Lyle gun was fired.

463
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 They had right.

464
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,040
 While all that was going on, there was still that one remaining lifeboat.

465
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,640
 They didn't really know if anyone had made it to the beach because it's pitch dark.

466
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,840
 They just saw the three boats tip and then the three boats capsized so they don't know.

467
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,360
 So the last lifeboat, a group of guys is like, "We need to get off this boat.

468
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,520
 We need to get help because we're totally done."

469
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,440
 And the captain goes, "Okay, you can take this lifeboat, but your main priority is to

470
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,760
 get to the top of that mountain and tie down that Lyle gun.

471
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,120
 We can start getting people off this boat."

472
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,440
 And the rescue team at this point says, "Yes, that's exactly what we're going to do."

473
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,240
 Now the state of the boat at this point is basically graham crackers and milk because

474
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,480
 it's so heavily damaged and these waves are hitting it so hard, chunks of the boat are

475
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,120
 getting destroyed.

476
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,080
 Little bit here, a little bit there, but because the boat has no give, it's basically just

477
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,960
 a block of wood and metal in the middle of this giant storm, which is every boat, but

478
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,240
 boats go up and down.

479
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,560
 This boat is not moving.

480
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,640
 It's stuck.

481
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
 The waves are hitting it so hard, it's starting to fall apart.

482
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
 And so they're running out of time.

483
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
 Now these other dudes get in this boat, they take off.

484
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,520
 They actually, the boat land successfully, they get to shore and they see a sign that

485
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,040
 says, "3 miles to Cape Beale."

486
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,360
 And they're like, "We can make 3 miles, we can do this."

487
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,480
 And the other people are like, "What about the Lyle gun?"

488
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,920
 They go, "Forget the Lyle gun."

489
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,720
 We're going to get to Cape Beale because they had no idea where they were at at this point.

490
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,280
 They didn't know if they were near civilization or this was an abandoned island until they

491
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,800
 saw that sign.

492
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,760
 They go, "Oh, you have the other team that found the shack."

493
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
 But again, nobody knows that they're even alive.

494
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,240
 This rescue team goes, "Let's go to Cape Beale, let's call for help."

495
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,560
 Then we can tie the Lyle gun down.

496
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,440
 We just, we'll get some other boats here.

497
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,960
 So they take off, take some 2 and a half hours, they make it to Cape Beale.

498
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
 They run in, they're like, "Oh, kicking doors down."

499
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,680
 They're dripping wet and they're like, "We need a call for help.

500
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
 We need a call for help."

501
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,680
 This boat, and they tell the whole story, and someone turns around and goes, "Yeah,

502
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
 we just got that call for help like four minutes ago."

503
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
 They're like, "What?"

504
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,920
 They're like, "Yeah, somebody from some cabin across the island called up, sent out the

505
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,240
 distress call saying that there's a boat wreck down there, rescue crews on the way."

506
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,280
 So they had already been beaten to the punch on that, but it's fine.

507
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
 They wasn't a contest.

508
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,520
 No one's keeping score.

509
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,240
 Now here's the weird thing about this story.

510
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,280
 A day has passed at this point.

511
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,440
 So it's not like, again, it's a certain point where you're on a boat and you're like, "Oh

512
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
 no, we're gonna sink.

513
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
 We're gonna sink."

514
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
 And then 23 hours later, you're like, "Oh no, we're gonna sink.

515
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,600
 We're gonna sink."

516
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,280
 So the sun comes up.

517
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,480
 There's still this massive storm going on.

518
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 People are getting hungry.

519
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,560
 They're like, "Oh, I'm so hungry."

520
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
 "Waves."

521
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,560
 Like you're going through all the normal stuff you go through throughout a day.

522
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,440
 No, I'm sure they had to go to the bathroom, but you know what I mean?

523
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,240
 You get tired, you want to take a nap, and you're kind of hungry, and then you're thirsty

524
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 all that's said.

525
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
 This isn't happening over the course of two hours.

526
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,480
 It's day two of this, and people are still soaking wet, freezing.

527
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,280
 There's blood in the water, the boat's stuck, and you can see land 100 yards away.

528
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,520
 But now they can actually see boats in the distance.

529
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,320
 And people are like, "Oh my God, the nightmare is over.

530
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,720
 There's boats here.

531
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,240
 We are gonna be rescued."

532
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,200
 Now on the boats, they're like, "Okay guys, let's get ready to rescue these guys."

533
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,880
 But the Valencia was so close to the land, the storm was raging, the boats cannot even

534
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,360
 come close to this thing.

535
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,760
 They ended up finding a barge, like recruiting a barge with a flat bottom, but even that

536
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,280
 was like, "I can't get to it."

537
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,520
 And so the captain said, "Hey listen, we got a couple life rafts.

538
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,160
 These are those little cheapo ones.

539
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,880
 They're not the big life boats that everybody loves, that everyone died in.

540
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,000
 We have these really flimsy life rafts.

541
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Let's get in them."

542
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,840
 And we'll start shuffling people back and forth between us, and the SS queen was at

543
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,200
 boat that was out in the distance, the big boat.

544
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,360
 Get in the life raft, we'll go out, and then you can come back, go out.

545
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,320
 Most people said, "Absolutely not.

546
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
 Absolutely not.

547
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,840
 I will take my chances on the SS Valencia.

548
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 I'm not getting in the life."

549
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,960
 Every time someone has gotten off this boat, they have died.

550
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,640
 They don't know what's going on with the rescue crew, although they could probably figure

551
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,280
 it because now there's ships in the distance.

552
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,400
 But for the most part, everyone who's gone off this boat has died.

553
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,680
 I'm staying on the boat.

554
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,960
 Captain's like, "Okay."

555
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,680
 And so people start getting in the life rafts, and they go off towards the queen.

556
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,760
 The boats that can't get to Valencia say, "You know what?

557
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,120
 We'll go over land.

558
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,600
 We'll have to go through the forest and see if we can figure out a way to save them."

559
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 The plan at this point is because they know the Lile Gun was shot, because the one team

560
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
 told them.

561
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,240
 They just didn't do an overland rescue.

562
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
 They're going to bring all their rescue stuff to the cliff face.

563
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,800
 They attached the Lile Gun.

564
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 Good to go.

565
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,280
 So at this point, the overland team, they come to the edge of the cliff.

566
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,080
 They see the Lile Gun hooked there, and they're like, "This is perfect.

567
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,400
 We're going to tie this down.

568
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,080
 We're going to get this going.

569
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,680
 Everything's fine."

570
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,800
 As they're tying the Lile Gun hooked down, you have this entire crew of people looking

571
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:54,880
 over the cliff at the SS Valencia, and a giant wave just goes...

572
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,440
 Smashes into it so hard, the giant steam stack.

573
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,120
 You see how those big old boats just falls over.

574
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,520
 And that was the last thing that was protecting the inside of the boat from the water.

575
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,960
 You had the people that were lashed down to the sides of the boat.

576
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:23,000
 You had a bunch of people inside the top portion of the boat, because everything else was flooded.

577
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,240
 And you had the giant steam stack, basically the roof, that when the wave hit it, it basically

578
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,120
 ripped the roof off.

579
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
 And that was the end of it.

580
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
 That was absolutely the end of it.

581
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,120
 The water began rushing into...

582
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,800
 Every wave now came directly into the top of the boat and washed people out.

583
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,640
 The people on the cliff are actually watching.

584
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,760
 Dozens of people just fly out, not like Peter Pan, but being lifted out of the boat.

585
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,480
 Each wave grabbed a handful of humans and just threw them against the rocks.

586
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,440
 The people who were tied to the boat were basically human debris.

587
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,000
 Because once the support structures were gone, every time a wave hit, a chunk of the boat

588
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,200
 would go flying off and you would be tied to a piece of wood or a piece of steel that

589
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,800
 would either float you out into the darkness or drag you to the bottom of the sea.

590
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:26,280
 All in all, there was 56 crewmen, there was 108 passengers, 20 people survived.

591
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
 All men.

592
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
 Captain was never found.

593
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,240
 His body was never found.

594
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
 And that boat is still there.

595
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,080
 You can actually go to this beach and you can still see the whole...

596
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,160
 Not like it's not like a little skeleton of a boat.

597
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,400
 It's not super dramatic, but you can see the flat pieces of steel that are just on the

598
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
 beach.

599
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,520
 It's considered a protected artifact.

600
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,160
 The government leaves it there as a reminder.

601
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,200
 They ended up, there was this huge controversy, they ended up having to build a bunch of lighthouses

602
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 in the area.

603
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
 Not all in the same place.

604
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,800
 They didn't just build three lighthouses on the beach and go, "We're done."

605
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,200
 27 years later, lifeboat number five.

606
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,680
 Seen just kind of drifting through the bay.

607
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
 Someone walks out.

608
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,800
 They don't walk out, they take a boat.

609
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 Boat out to it.

610
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 That's weird.

611
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 It says on it, "SS Valencia."

612
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 What?

613
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,920
 And they said it was weird because it was a 27-year-old lifeboat in good condition.

614
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,360
 Been floating in the sea the whole time.

615
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
 Pretty good condition.

616
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,520
 It's now in a museum.

617
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,840
 That's an anomaly.

618
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,000
 It's weird that a boat would last that long with just floating in the water.

619
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,600
 That a bunch of crabs didn't take it over.

620
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,080
 But then we have the stories of fishermen in the area early in the morning out plying

621
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,160
 their trade, trying to catch fish.

622
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,920
 And they see a life raft float by them.

623
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:56,640
 And they just see skeletons rowing it through the fog.

624
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,520
 And then more horrifying than a bunch of skeletons rowing a boat, which would be kind of funny.

625
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,360
 Xylophonemies explain the whole time.

626
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,040
 That's Calliope, by the way, but it doesn't matter.

627
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:15,880
 More horrifying than that story is the stories of the SS Valencia itself as a ghost ship.

628
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,640
 Sailors have said late at night in the fog or during particularly stormy nights, they

629
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,320
 can look out through the mist and see the ghostly outline of that passenger ship.

630
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,000
 And people strapped down to the sides of it.

631
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,760
 People's faces looking through portholes, screaming for help.

632
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,760
 Ghosts eternally drenched in winter water, forever replaying that descent into their

633
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,080
 watery grave.

634
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,200
 Ghosts walking down hallway is one thing.

635
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,360
 Just hitchhiking down a dark road.

636
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,680
 Creepy, yes.

637
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,840
 But not terrifying.

638
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,080
 Not a reminder of the end that waits for us all.

639
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,760
 But when you have the ghosts of women and children screaming in the darkness, reaching

640
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:18,680
 out for you with a dripping wet hand, it only reminds a sailor that his fate may someday

641
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:43,200
 be that of the specter just off starboard.

642
00:34:43,200 --> 00:35:00,400
