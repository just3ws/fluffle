1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Is your dog spying on you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,840
 Why British men suddenly can't have erections and we take a deep dive into the murky world of giant fish today on Dead Rava Radio.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:27,880
 Hey everyone, it's Jason Carpenter back again for another episode of Dead Rava Radio.

4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,280
 Hope you guys are having a good day. Still fighting this stupid sinus infection.

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 But you know what are you gonna do? I got some medicine and I'm gonna record this and edit it and get it out for you guys.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,000
 And then I'm gonna go to bed. I got a long week ahead, but I wanted to get this done. I like doing this show.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,880
 Hope everyone's having a good time. I know I always say that, but it's sincere.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,920
 So,

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,160
 went to the fireworks yesterday watching the fireworks on 4th of July.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And you know what's always interesting to me is

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
 subcultures.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
 Subcultures I find interesting and especially when they're based around some sort of job. So,

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,320
 I'm watching the fireworks and I turn to a friend of mine and I go,

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,920
 "How do they practice for this?" Like there must be some place out in the middle of the desert where like,

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,640
 they shoot off fireworks to test them out and to make sure the arrangements look good and things like that.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,880
 But it's and which is probably true. I didn't bother researching it yet.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,840
 But and then I thought, you know what throughout the year,

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,160
 you have those scenarios where it's like the young guy who wants to get into the firework business or,

19
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,960
 you know, he shows up there. Maybe he doesn't have any other career prospects and he shows up to the fireworks

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,520
 launching pad and there's like the old gruff guys like, "This is a business for kings.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 This is a business that was handed down from the

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,600
 Chinese to us." And you have those weird

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,160
 economies. You have those weird like the young guys trying to break into the business and the people have been doing it for the longest time.

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,480
 You have the people who to them it's just a job

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,720
 and it's something they do to pay the bills and then you have people who like have great pride in the fact that

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,560
 they're one of a long line of firework artists. I'm sure there's an actual name they use like a pyrotechnician

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,960
 or something like that.

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,440
 But I always think that's fascinating that you'll have these little subcultures that if I went and talked to them and said,

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,760
 "Hey, so how do fireworks work?" They'll give me like a brief overview, but when they're talking to each other, they're gonna use all this slang and jargon and

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,640
 maybe they go all to the same bar and it's called like the pop-off or something like that or Rockets Red.

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,920
 It's the name of the bar they all go to and they're, you know, shooting back whiskey and talking about, "Oh, yeah,

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,800
 I lost these two fingers in the fireworks show of 77 and all that stuff."

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,920
 But yeah, I mean, I'm sure that there are

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,800
 big test sites for fireworks and it's funny talking about the subculture of the people who set them off.

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,400
 You know that there's the people who designed them and the people who,

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,320
 you know, not only designed them, but like

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,200
 advancing the technology forward. The people who manufacture the fireworks we have now and then there's like people in a laboratory

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,680
 going like, "How can we make fireworks 44% more efficient the last longer?"

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,040
 So on and so forth. I saw an article that some

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,680
 places are using lit lighted-up drones instead of fireworks and you know, I can kind of see the allure of that.

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,400
 There's no, you know, fire threat, but I don't know. I'm not a huge fireworks guy, but I do like, I do like

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,720
 catching them. I really don't go out on my way to watch fireworks. Anyways,

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,920
 so today's a weird episode because actually all the stories kind of have something in common and that's bones

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,720
 and really I'm like forcing it to be in common. They don't have a lot in common.

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,160
 First thing I wanted to talk about and this is actually like if you know me in real life, if you had a conversation with me for more than

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,280
 10 minutes in real life and trust me, I'm a real person. This this isn't an act.

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:59,480
 I've been quoting this article. It's been out for probably a couple weeks now, but I just find it so fascinating and what's fascinating too is I

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
 don't think the article gets the main

49
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,280
 issue right.

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,920
 So they did, this is from the Mirror in Britain. This is their

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
 newsletter, not newsletter magazine

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
 newspaper. The headline is

53
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,720
 "Men in their 30s hit by impotence epidemic is half

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,200
 suffer from erectile dysfunction." Of course, this is a study and they, you know,

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,880
 study 2,000 men.

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:36,400
 They have to extrapolate it out, but half of men under 30s have impotence issues. That is mind-boggling.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,920
 I talked before on a previous episode about how as I got older and I was taking a bunch of nicotine, using a bunch of nicotine,

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,400
 it was causing blood pressure issues with me.

59
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,760
 But to be

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,320
 in their 30s and not being a chemical thing,

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,160
 that's just alarming. That's a, you know, it's a blow to a man's self-esteem and

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,880
 it's a blow to them being able to have a steady relationship because women are gonna have a hard time

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
 being sexually satisfied if you can't get it up. It's just the truth.

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
 So

65
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
 they asked them, obviously, the follow-up question was, "Why do you think you have impotence?"

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,120
 And 49% of them said stress and then 24% of them said, you know, too much drinking and then there's some other reasons in there as well.

67
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
 But I don't think either of those are really the issue. I mean, obviously, that's what they're saying.

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,560
 So they said nearly half,

69
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,040
 four in 10 minutes said it was stress and then 36% was anxiety.

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,920
 Or no, 29% of it was anxiety and 26% of it was boozing.

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,800
 I think it's pornography.

72
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,560
 Now there have been studies done as well. I'm gonna link all of this in the show notes, but there have been many studies done

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,960
 showing that pornography

74
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,600
 can lead to impotence in men.

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,360
 There's actually a term for it. It's P I E D, not pied. Well, it is pied, but it's porn induced erectile dysfunction.

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
 And what it is is that when you start off,

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
 you basically train your brain

78
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,440
 and your body

79
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
 to react to pornography.

80
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,840
 I'm looking at a video of a hot woman and I'm masturbating to it.

81
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,520
 And I'm creating this feedback loop. The dopamine rush is, you know, amazing whenever you have an orgasm, masturbation or not.

82
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,320
 But what happens is when you start watching pornography and then you end up watching too much of it, you end up overusing it.

83
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,680
 It becomes a crutch. And we do have young men say then when they go to be with a woman or a man, whatever,

84
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
 but when they go to be with somebody,

85
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,760
 it,

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
 they can't get it up.

87
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,800
 Now when you're watching pornography, I can click through, I can have 12 videos on my screen and I can pick which one

88
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
 that I want to watch and I can find a great one and watch it for two weeks.

89
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
 But then eventually the novelty wears off. I have to find another one. It taps into our

90
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
 our caveman brain every time I'm watching

91
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,080
 pornography. I'm basically finding a new mate and I'm spreading my seed. I'm doing all of these tricks.

92
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,160
 But when you're with somebody real and they're,

93
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,280
 it's not, they're not as sexy and you see the, you know, the blemish under their left armpit and they have a, you know,

94
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
 now they smell and stuff like that.

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,480
 And they're not a perfect 10 that you can't just skip past to the good stuff. You have difficulty. I actually

96
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,520
 don't watch porn anymore. And it's not because of that.

97
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
 I just am not a fan of it. Now obviously when I was in my, when I was growing up, yeah, it was great.

98
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,560
 It was this whole new thing. But you get to a point and for one, listen, man,

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,680
 I don't want to watch another dude being in a check. Like if some, if there's sex going on, I want to be the one involved.

100
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,200
 Is you get old? I don't know if it's just me, but I kind of had that realization. I'm like, well, I'm not watching this other dude

101
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,560
 being this chick.

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,360
 Like that, it's, that's not fulfilling to me anymore. I think maybe it was the novelty of it at first and you're seeing all these beautiful women, but

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
 you know what I mean? I wouldn't want to watch it in real life.

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,160
 Like someone's like, hey man, come over to my house and watch me being my wife. I'd be like, dude, that,

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,920
 no dude, you invite me over to your house and I'll bang your wife and you can watch. Or we can bang her together.

106
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,040
 But I'm not going to come over and watch you bang your wife, dude. That's weird.

107
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,240
 So, and that's really what pornography is. It's you're just watching an act, but you're, you're chemically your brain thinks you're there.

108
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,680
 So that's a little bit of a

109
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
 public service message. Guys, if you're listening to this, stop watching porn.

110
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,640
 Stop, masturbation, fine. Use your imagination.

111
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,560
 Read a book if you have to and imagine that. However, don't watch porn. It's going to mess you up if it hasn't already.

112
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,920
 You got to get out of it.

113
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,440
 So it can cause a lot of addiction issues and it can cause physical and mental issues when you need it the most.

114
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,520
 You don't want to get with the girl of your dreams or any girl for that matter and not be able to get it up.

115
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
 It's super disappointing to you.

116
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,160
 It's super disappointing to her and it actually makes her feel bad.

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
 So stop watching porn.

118
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
 But I'm going to go ahead and link both of those articles and

119
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,480
 there's actually

120
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
 some science articles on the P I E D stuff and then you'll have the other article for the British thing.

121
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
 There's books out there like

122
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,480
 Your Brain on Porn and stuff like that. You can do further research on that. Now

123
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,680
 going from boners

124
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,000
 to things with no bones

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,040
 and I don't know if maybe they do have bones. I don't know. Invertebrates. Do invertebrates have bones?

126
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
 I know they don't have spines, but I'm do they have like skulls?

127
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 Because that's a bone or teeth is a bone really anyways. Anyway, so the segue doesn't make sense.

128
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,160
 But so I was always told like I watched them a lot when I was a kid or any movie with a giant animal giant insect and people go

129
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,560
 You know insects can't animals can't get that big

130
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
 You know why not?

131
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,160
 And they're like well because they breathe through their like an ant breathes through its skin

132
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,600
 And if it got giant it wouldn't be able to breathe or something like that somebody told me that

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,480
 when I was a kid

134
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,400
 And so they kind of you know took the fun out. Was it them? It wasn't them with the giant ants

135
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,600
 So I was always told that you know animals have kind of like a fixed size in their genetic code

136
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
 That's not true

137
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
 That's not true animals

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,760
 Can really get as big as possible

139
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,560
 In the right conditions now. I'm going to put a little asterisk next to that

140
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,880
 It's just kind of invertebrates

141
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,160
 So you can't put a puppy in this environment and it's going to be like this giant like

142
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 Falkor size dog

143
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
 but

144
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,760
 It's called deep sea gigantism or abyssal gigantism and basically don't know what causes it

145
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,560
 But in areas that are super cold

146
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
 Things get bigger

147
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
 So greater pressure on top of them

148
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:46,720
 And a really really low temperature can cause normal like a squid can become a giant squid down there

149
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,880
 A sea spider can become a giant sea spider at the right levels and it's the same sea spider

150
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,720
 But what happens is I mean it's kind of like a breakaway species

151
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,640
 But what happens is it gets I read the article of like once so I could be off in this but

152
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,400
 I read it twice

153
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,560
 But anyways the point is is that if you go down a certain depths you live longer because it's colder and maybe it like slows

154
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,200
 In heartbeat, I don't know but anyways like the longer you live

155
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,120
 The more food you can eat and the more food you can eat the bigger you get so imagine them like

156
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 Uh

157
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,560
 Like the fat people version of other animals like

158
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,520
 On up in the coastline you have like just the normal sea spider and he's like hanging out and then like if you dropped

159
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,040
 1200 feet you can meet his cousin who's just like oh, dude. That's my cousin down there

160
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,480
 And they're like why is he so big and you're like, well, he he's been alive like

161
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,720
 Five times longer than anyone else in my family. So he's eaten like a ton more

162
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,240
 I just think that's interesting. So I'm wondering if you went to

163
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,600
 Certain parts of the world like if you went to Antarctica and started like finding like went under in the ice caves

164
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 I wonder if there's like giant

165
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,440
 Giant monsters down there. I guess this kind of thing. I mean, I don't expect you to be able to crawl into a cave in Antarctica and find

166
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
 The giant penguin

167
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,360
 That's a little ridiculous, but I mean

168
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
 What if you went far enough down and there was a

169
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
 You might be able to find a giant penguin

170
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,080
 I wonder how penguins do get pretty big

171
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,080
 But like if it was in the water and its heartbeat was slowed down and it's just like oh, you know what?

172
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,160
 I'm gonna live to be 100 years old

173
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,080
 But hey, yeah, wait a second. How come redwoods can get so big if there's a limit to how big stuff can get on land

174
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,040
 Could you technically have?

175
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,640
 Giant land animals, I guess you had dinosaurs. So I'm gonna say yes

176
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,960
 I'm gonna say yes

177
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,360
 I'm gonna say the only reason why we have the invertebrate

178
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,280
 Keyword on these things is because they're mostly underwater

179
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,600
 These things get pretty big and they have pictures. I'm gonna link this wikipedia article and we're gonna go ahead and move on

180
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,000
 To our last story because my entire face is swelling up from sinus pain. It's gonna be a short episode

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,400
 So

182
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
 Every so often of course you read something online

183
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,080
 You're like that guy's crazy and that happens all the time

184
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,040
 But sometimes you read something online and you go not only is that guy crazy, but that guy's dangerous

185
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,200
 That happens sometimes so I found a guy today

186
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,520
 And this is what he posted

187
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,080
 There's a picture of a little puppy

188
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,560
 Don't know. I'm not gonna nothing bad happens to the dog

189
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,760
 But there's a picture of a puppy

190
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,000
 And he writes i'm pretty sure my new puppy is a synth assigned to watch me. He watches all the time

191
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
 So a synth is an artificial life form

192
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,240
 Now there's people who believe that they're being gang stalked or the government's

193
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
 Spying on them. That's where a lot of the ideas of the tinfoil hat came from back in the 70s and the 80s

194
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,880
 The government satellites flying overhead can't read your thoughts if you have the tinfoil hat on that's evolved to modern times

195
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,280
 Where it's not necessarily spy satellites

196
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,800
 There's a group of dedicated people following you around so when you're walking on the street the mailman spying on you

197
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,560
 You always see the same guy on the same bicycle right by around the same time of the day

198
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
 Sure, it could be the time he gets off work and he's coming home

199
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,640
 But to these people that guy's a cia agent or working for deep state or whatever spying on him

200
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,120
 And this is a very it's a very egotistical paranoid belief and and it's again

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,520
 It's interesting because when I was talking about the transabled people, I think that was an episode 10

202
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,160
 This is another gang stalking is something that was it's a

203
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,000
 Like a precursor or a side effect to schizophrenia or other

204
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,280
 Uh mental issues and it was very very very rare

205
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,200
 For the longest time but since the internet since the explosion of the internet and other people are reading about these things

206
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,720
 It's blown up. There's now gang stalking support groups and and I kind of want to do a whole

207
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,440
 I think I've thought about doing a whole episode on gang stalking

208
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
 But I almost feel like it's going to be something that comes up

209
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,160
 Fairly regularly because it's a key component into a lot of conspiracy theories

210
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
 It's fascinating and um, there's actually one

211
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,440
 gang stalking

212
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,680
 Hey, let me let me talk about this dog real quick

213
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,920
 Before I go off and I'll just say this so well gang stalking will be something we talk about in the future

214
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,200
 I'm going to make a note and I know also. Yeah, so okay

215
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:30,960
 So this guy believes that his new puppy is a synth sent to him watch him now to who he hasn't stated yet

216
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:37,120
 I'm still monitoring this thread and unfortunately on this website the threads disappear fairly regularly

217
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
 So I can't really link you to it. You'll have to take my advice for it, but

218
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 You have to take my word for it. I guess I should say but anyway

219
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,800
 So someone also says so do you so you have a cyborg dog? So what and they're kind of like toying with him

220
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,840
 And he goes I don't think he's a cyborg. I think he's a synth with all reconstituted or cloned the live

221
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,280
 Parts genetically modified to do the bidding of a computer without the actual computer parts. That's what a synth is

222
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,600
 Looks perfectly normal, but I know and sometimes his skin looks fake

223
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,520
 So he got this dog and he thinks that it's fake

224
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,400
 And he said that the dog has some sort of mind control

225
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,680
 Ability that's preventing him from getting rid of the dog

226
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,480
 Someone then respore someone responds in the in the thread here

227
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,760
 You're going to be tempted to kill the dog, but remember don't kill the dog let the dog live

228
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,040
 And so he this person is trying to basically talk this man who's having a psychotic breakdown

229
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,320
 Not to do anything to hurt the dog and a bunch of other people jumped on as well

230
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,000
 And they said the dog you're you're you're that's not true. The dog's fine. The dog's fine go out and play with your dog

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,440
 Your dog's a puppy wants to play with you and such and such now

232
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,120
 Unfortunately this well, this is for a chance. So it's an anonymous board. Nobody knows

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Who who's post seeing this?

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,440
 And so, you know, it's not like we can track this person down now the person does say I'm I would never kill the dog like that's not

235
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:17,280
 That's not what I'm thinking and the reasoning why is because if he hurts the dog then all the other synths

236
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,200
 all the other clones will come after him

237
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,840
 so

238
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,480
 Fair enough no one wants to see the puppy get hurt and if it takes that delusion like oh, I better not hurt that dog

239
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,360
 Otherwise the army of clones will come after me. Hopefully he'll just get rid of the dog. These are the you know, this this person is

240
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,800
 You know a renter or a homeowner

241
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,000
 most likely have a job

242
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,840
 Talk to him drink coffee next to him pass him on the street

243
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:53,520
 It's weird to think that you know, there's a lot of people there are there are people out there who suffer from depression and

244
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,920
 anxiety and things like that and those are kind of you know, we just understand that those are

245
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,360
 fairly common problems in a modern society

246
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,440
 And then you know, you meet people or you hear about people like this

247
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,400
 Which is a full psychotic break to look at a dog and think that dog's spying on me

248
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,640
 And the reason why I can't say stop spying on me does it's controlling my mind

249
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,000
 And the question is is what's the solution to this?

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,680
 How would you deal with this in a

251
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
 How would you deal with this on a personal level?

252
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,200
 If a friend of mine told me I think my dog spying on me

253
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,400
 After I got done chuckling and going wait, you're serious and they go. Yeah, I think my dog is made up of other parts cloned parts

254
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,920
 And I think it's spying on me and I my first inclination is like this other person

255
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,000
 Well, you're not going to hurt it right and they go no no no

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
 I'm not going to hurt it because then all the other clones will come after me

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 I'm just you know keeping and I think it's just kind of observing me. It's not going to hurt me

258
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
 It just wants to know what what I'm doing

259
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 How do you deal with that?

260
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
 I mean you could get the authorities involved

261
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,960
 You know, you could I you know, you could say well, you know, why don't I look after the puppy?

262
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,640
 I'll quote unquote run some tests and then just they could take the dog

263
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,680
 But yeah, it's interesting because I think

264
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:16,160
 There's these people someone with this level of delusion has felt it fairly rare. But if you you start talking to people you'll mean people have

265
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
 weird thoughts

266
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,520
 Like that maybe not this bad maybe not this bad, but

267
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,840
 Well, I'm sure the puppy's going to be okay. I'm not really worried about it. I'm more worried about him as a human

268
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
 Um, because you know, I don't think you'd hurt the puppy again

269
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
 The if the delusion is he'll be attacked by clones if he hurts the puppy

270
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,760
 That's a good crazy delusion because we don't want him hurt the puppy, but at the same time. I hope this guy gets help

271
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,800
 I've noticed sometimes when I record these episodes

272
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,640
 People come from certain websites to listen to them and stuff like 4chan in particular

273
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
 When I was doing those episodes on

274
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,160
 The rapper who an x the rapper x

275
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,200
 xxx tentation. I think it's how you say it

276
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,600
 The conspiracy theorists would come to watch the videos and things like that

277
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,000
 So maybe this young man will watch this video and or listen to this podcast and say, you know what? Yeah, maybe I should go get some help

278
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,800
 But you know, then again, there's always the chance that he'll just the fact that we're recording this podcast about something

279
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,520
 He posted is just that gangstalking is real he may

280
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,680
 He may think that because how do how could I've written this and

281
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,400
 Two hours later it's being recorded on podcasts. I'll tell you why because I don't have a life

282
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,480
 and I troll

283
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,120
 Um, the paranormal board. Well, I hope you had a great night tonight. Um, again, we're just cutting it

284
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,160
 We're just making a short episode because I want to make sure I do this every single day

285
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,920
 If I miss an episode I want it to be because I absolutely can't record something

286
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,680
 I want this to just be my practice. This was episode 21. So we're still going strong. I hope you're having a great time

287
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,400
 Let's go through this again. Uh, dead rabbit dot com

288
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,040
 If you want to email me a dead rabbit radio at gmail.com

289
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,960
 You want to email me about ghost stories conspiracy stories anything like that that'd be great

290
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
 If you want to use a different name, just let me know everyone I've talked about that I've

291
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,120
 Said I know this person. I know that person. They're all fake names. They're real people but fake names

292
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
 So I usually use fake names anyways

293
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,560
 Twitter handle is @jasonocarpenter if you want to get ahold of me there

294
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,280
 I am going to go and

295
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 Drink some ambasol. I'm not going to do that. I actually found out you can

296
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,640
 Die from ambasol or ambasol whatever you call it

297
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,800
 Stuff for a toothache

298
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,960
 You can die from an overdose and I've been like oh man, but I think it's like I think you have to take a ton of it

299
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,480
 I think it has to be like a tall like you have to cover your body in it because I remember just eating this stuff when I was a kid

300
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,240
 You know my sinus infection gave me a toothache that that sucks. I got a whole thing going on

301
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,400
 but I got a doctor's appointment tomorrow, so

302
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,280
