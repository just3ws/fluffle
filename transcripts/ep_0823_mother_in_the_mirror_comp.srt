1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
 New research on ancient sea monsters may rock the scientific community.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,160
 And then we meet a young woman who spent most of her early life in a haunted house.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,720
 But we're not talking about cold spots or weird noises late at night.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,760
 This woman's house was haunted by Darth Vader, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,440
 *music*

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,480
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun, arm wrestling people, and just general, just general hijinks.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,280
 I hope you guys are able to get away with all of your Dennis the Menace-esque stunts today.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,840
 But someone who never gets away, someone who unfortunately gets caught by the police every single time,

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,200
 give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, Aaron Kostetanti.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,800
 Kostetanti, he's like shaking his head, nope, I don't know how you pronounce it.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,600
 Kostanini? Still getting to know. Aaron, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,080
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,080
 You don't want me to butcher your name. You don't want me to butcher your name on a podcast, that's fine.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,160
 Just help us spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,280
 And I got Aaron coming in and what's this? He's wearing some straight up juggalo makeup.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:32,360
 And that is an ad because I am currently on a new episode of the podcast, The Asylum Case Studies,

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:40,440
 where me and host Tressa review the asylum film Death Racers, starring the insane clown posse.

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,640
 So if you're looking for even more, Jason, who isn't, really who isn't, check out the Asylum

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,640
 Case Studies, we'll have the episode in the show notes and we get to whoop whoop and juggalo

23
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,480
 and juggalette and ninjas and I know all the slang I use to hang out with a bunch of juggalos.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:02,120
 So if you want to hear us wax poetic about a ICP movie, definitely check out The Asylum Case

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,600
 Studies. The link is in the show notes. Aaron's like, I'm not a juggalo and I don't even know what

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,080
 you're talking about. Aaron, let me go ahead and toss you the command codes for the dead

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,680
 rabbit dreadnought, our massive battleship, hop aboard laddies, everyone walk up that game plank.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,520
 We are setting sail because we're about to uncover a truly bizarre maritime mystery.

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:33,880
 Giant warship with little captain Aaron. I'm going hard on Aaron today. He's just like a juggalo,

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,840
 now he's just like Donald Duck and no pants. But he's the captain of this vessel and Aaron,

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,800
 take us out to the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean in this mighty, mighty warship. This story,

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,640
 I love this story. I read about it about maybe a week or two ago, but I already had those episodes

33
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,800
 prepped and ready to go and I was like, I can't wait to tell you guys about this one. We're going

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,480
 to be sitting down with a man. You're like, oh man, you said in the beginning there's a sea monster.

35
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,920
 We'll get to the sea monster. But first off, let's introduce into the cramped cabins of the dead

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,160
 rabbit dreadnought, Mark McMinneman. So Mark is a paleontologist. He's the professor of geology

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,240
 at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. And he recently gave an interview for NPR. He's too good

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,200
 to appear on the radio, but he did do an interview for NPR. And I found this story when mysterious

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,720
 universe published it on their website. So I'm going to give them a shout out too, because I

40
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,200
 wouldn't have known about the story if it wasn't for MU covering it. This is dope. So what Mark has

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,800
 been doing is he's been looking at bones, he's been looking at bones on the sea floor. And he

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,760
 has this theory, and this is really controversial in the scientific community. He goes, let's go back

43
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,360
 in time to the Triassic era. This is his theory. Back in the Triassic era, there had to have been

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,520
 massive cephalopods, massive, those are the ones with the tentacles and stuff, octopus, squid,

45
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,840
 type of entity, type of creature roaming the deep oceans of the world. And this is why I think this

46
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,480
 thing had to have existed. Because he says, listen, we all of the fossil records for octopuses,

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,360
 octopi, you could fit in a suitcase. They first off, they're all just kind of army and stuff like

48
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,400
 that. It's a bunch of muscles and cartilage. I said army, I'm not quoting him specifically. He goes to

49
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,920
 when they die, the chances of any creature being fossilized is fairly low. And then if there are

50
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,040
 fossils or deep underwater, but he goes, octopuses and squid, there's not much that can actually

51
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,280
 fossilize on them. He goes, we can find fossilized eggs. And with octopuses, we can find fossilized

52
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,320
 beaks. And with the squids, we can find fossilized gladiases, which is this bone in its head. He goes,

53
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,880
 other than that, we can fit pretty much all of the fossils we have of the octopi family in a suitcase.

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,760
 He goes, there's one species of octopus. The only reason we know it existed is that

55
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,240
 we found fossils of their food. We found fossils of these shells with a hole bore through them,

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,760
 like something went, and we have modern day octopuses that do that. So we, but that's the,

57
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,000
 we have no bones of octopuses during this era when we're finding these shells or the holes

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,400
 bored in them. And he goes, we all agree that it was probably an octopus doing this thing.

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:36,600
 So first off, the fossil record for cephalopods is very, very small, but his hypothesis is there

60
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,440
 used to be massive kraken like creatures. That's the word he'll use a lot is actual

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:50,440
 the triassic kraken roaming the oceans. And then he has two reasons why these things had to exist.

62
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,880
 He goes, one, we have been finding the bones of itheosaurs and it the oars were these giant

63
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:04,280
 45 feet long sea monsters. I mean, these things would be like sharks. Sharks would be like sardines

64
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,560
 to these dudes and we know they existed. And he goes, what we're finding is we're finding their

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:17,240
 bones at the bottom of the ocean. So we can have an octopsy team and we can tell that these things

66
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,200
 had their neck broken. And it looks like they were dragged down because the bones shouldn't be in

67
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:29,560
 like this area and they definitely shouldn't be in this pattern. So he has these photographs and it

68
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:38,520
 shows the bones of the echothorus are laid out in a geometric pattern. And he goes, listen,

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,440
 if you took, if you took one of these creatures and you killed it and it fell on the ground,

70
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,520
 the bones would not fall in this order. And basically it was like the pieces were almost

71
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,320
 next to each other and made this weird geometric pattern looked almost like a little road and

72
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,560
 what kind they're just taper off. And he goes, listen, I've we've done a lot of photographs,

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,280
 we've done a lot of studies on these things. He goes, based on the way the mud is down there,

74
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,360
 it's not currents because otherwise if the currents were strong enough to move the bones

75
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,760
 randomly into this position, it would have moved the mud all the way. So he goes, it has nothing

76
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,640
 to do with the currents at all. And the fact that this would fall randomly like this, maybe,

77
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:25,400
 but they found the same geometric pattern in other locations with also using the bones of

78
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,800
 these giant sea monsters. So I surmise that there must have been a creature big enough to

79
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,080
 smash these guys, punch them in the face, break their neck, drag them to the sea floor and eat them.

80
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,040
 And the scientific community goes, well, you don't have any proof of that. There's no proof that

81
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,880
 there was anything this big that was actually had tendrils, like it was a octopus or a squid.

82
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,680
 But that's not even the most interesting part of this. The fact that there might have been a giant

83
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,680
 sea monster back in the day, I mean, probably right. And it would make sense we don't want

84
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,600
 to really have any fossils of these. That's not the reason why this is such a controversial

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,560
 thing that Mark is saying this stuff. He said that the way the bones are at the bottom, it could

86
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:17,400
 not have happened accidentally. The squid put it that way on purpose. The squid actually lined up,

87
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:24,280
 it would kill these creatures as it was decomposing, was removing its bones and purposely laid out a

88
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:33,320
 geometric pattern at the sea floor. And so people go, why? It could have been a sign of like a

89
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,440
 breeding display, basically. It was almost just like instinctual. Like, they would put these out

90
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,280
 and it would be like a marker for their territory. And so the other squids would seem to be like,

91
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,520
 oh, he's sexy. He can totally kill these monsters. Look at this giant pattern. He actually has a

92
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:56,040
 more controversial answer than that. He says, I think they were drawing pictures of themselves.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,600
 He said the way, this is so interesting. The way that the bone, there'll be photos in the show

94
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,920
 notes, the way that the bone pieces are laid out is the same way of a long tendril with suction cups.

95
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,240
 So you see these little pieces and they kind of match together like a paved road,

96
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,880
 but it also would, if you drew a picture of an octopus's arm, it would look like this display

97
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:28,040
 of bones on the bottom of the ocean. And they found these in multiple locations and he goes,

98
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,280
 my theory, and I know it's super controversial, that these creatures were so advanced,

99
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:38,600
 they had a sense of self, they would draw pictures of themselves with the bones of the dead.

100
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,960
 That's dope, isn't it? I mean, I read that in my imagination, it was just going wild.

101
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,720
 And before I go and warn my imagination part, let's step back to the more rational part.

102
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,800
 There have been people saying this isn't, this isn't true. They said, listen, we know octopus

103
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,200
 do have a habit of building these things called midden piles, where they actually take the refuse

104
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,320
 of their kills and kind of pile them up, but they do not do it in a geometric fashion. So the fact

105
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,880
 that we have modern day species not doing it, but they do create this pile of rubbish, that

106
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,840
 that is probably what, first off, science says there is no squid that big, they just weren't

107
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,520
 that big. But let's assume that they were just for to help you out, Mark. They wouldn't be building

108
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,000
 these piles on purpose. It wouldn't be some sort of design that they're doing, if anything, it's

109
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,960
 habit. And you know, the old thing, the scientists who dispute this go, listen, I, you can see patterns

110
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,720
 anywhere. I can look up at the sky and see a fat man smoking a cigar. He's looking at a cloud. He's

111
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,560
 not actually watching the guy float off the earth. I left the, I left down the part, he's looking at

112
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,800
 clouds. You can find patterns anywhere. So he goes, the fact that you can look at a pattern of bones,

113
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,400
 you could find a pattern there. You could say it looks like an octopus's arm or squid's arm with

114
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,920
 the suction cups, but you know, it could be anything. And it's interesting because they go,

115
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,480
 extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And that's a very, very common quote.

116
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,160
 And Mark has an answer for that. Mark says, yeah, that is a very common quote. I think Carl

117
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,560
 Sagan was the one who came up with it, but he goes, extraordinary evidence for extraordinary

118
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,080
 claims. Let me lay this out for you. We have nine dead Ikea sources at the bottom of the ocean

119
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,440
 with twisted necks and broken ribs. So right there, that tells us that there was something big

120
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,760
 enough to kill these things on a regular basis. And then quote, then the pieces of the bones or

121
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:44,440
 skeletal elements have been organized in a very non, shall we say, natural way. This to me is

122
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,840
 extraordinary evidence and it demands explanation and has alluded the explanation or has alluded

123
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,000
 proper explanation by paleontologists for a generation now. It's time that we figured this out.

124
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,960
 Unquote. So he's saying the evidence is there. Now we got to figure out how this happened. I'm not,

125
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,920
 we have extraordinary evidence. We have to believe that something was breaking these guides next.

126
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,720
 Something had to be huge. And in the NPR interview, they were saying a 40, something that was big

127
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,480
 enough to take down one of these 45 foot Ikea sources would be the equivalent of those old

128
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,880
 wood carvings we'd see of octopi crushing a galleon, crushing this giant wooden boat. He goes,

129
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,800
 they'd have to be that big. And Mark's like, yeah, totally. Like this thing is massive and

130
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,840
 it could be incredibly smart. It's funny because a long time ago, we did an episode

131
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,480
 or octopuses from outer space. And that was a really fun episode. I'll put it in the show notes.

132
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,720
 And we talked about like why the octopus, the squid, they're so much more advanced than a lot of the

133
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,600
 other aquatic species. They're a lot more advanced than a lot of land animals as well. The, I remember

134
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,280
 reading this thing a long time ago, I think it was the octopus, the problem with the octopus, it has a

135
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,000
 very short lifespan. It's in a couple years, right? If they live to be 80, 90, 100 years old,

136
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,600
 they would, they would control the ocean. They're so smart, but they just have a very,

137
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,640
 very short lifespan and they don't breed a lot like a lot of other species. Humans can out breed

138
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,920
 octopuses. I think it's also interesting that before we began to sail the oceans, which was very

139
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,960
 relatively late in human development, there was no natural predators for a lot of these things in

140
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,480
 the ocean until we got on the oceans and started killing them. So if it had been another couple

141
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,880
 million years, right, before we were sailing, who knows who would have won that arms race and evolution?

142
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,600
 And it's so interesting too, because I hear all the time about the Fermi paradox and how come we

143
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,000
 don't see any proof of aliens? If aliens are really out there, how come they're not visiting? How

144
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,920
 come they're not signaling to us? And there's all sorts of stuff about that. If there's really like

145
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,600
 300 million life planets that can support life in the galaxy, just in the galaxy alone, how come

146
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,800
 we've seen no proof? That's such a human concept. Think about this. Think about this. There is a

147
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,960
 possibility of a meteorite strike wiping out the dinosaurs and the land mammals in our history,

148
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,040
 and that left the oceans alone to really breed in. The fact that we came out of the oceans

149
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,000
 and conquered the land, we forget that the oceans are two thirds of the planet. And if you, if the

150
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,280
 main life form on the planet was aquatic, if that was the highest life form on the planet,

151
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,840
 you would not leave that planet. For one, you'd maybe so deep in the ocean, you could have a

152
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,520
 fully functional civilization, advanced technology civilization under the water, under the sea with

153
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:50,440
 King Triton. You could have an alien race that is completely evolved in the ocean that didn't even

154
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,200
 know stars existed. And everything, they got all the geothermal energy that they need, they're

155
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,680
 fully exploring all of the caves in the mountainous regions underneath the ocean.

156
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,720
 To them, going to the surface would be like going to heaven. They wouldn't be able to breathe either.

157
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,720
 And let's say that they do discover that there is a world, I'm not just talking about the soil

158
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,240
 outside the ocean, but that they can look up in the night sky and see stars and see galaxies and go,

159
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,360
 I want to fly up there. One, they'd have no concept of flight. They're already living this 3D

160
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,440
 environment. We live in our very, I know we're three dimensional, but we live on an earthling

161
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,000
 environment. We didn't start flying till way late in the game. They wouldn't even think about flying.

162
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,760
 We thought of flying because we looked up at birds and go, oh, I want to be that.

163
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:44,040
 They just see other fish. Fully functional civilization underwater. Secondly, gunpowder,

164
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,280
 rocket technology. Would any of this even be possible with an underwater society if it was

165
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,760
 fully evolved on an aquatic planet or a planet like earth, which is two thirds water, and all of

166
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,520
 the land life, all of the creatures on land were killed? Would you invent rockets? Would a rocket

167
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,760
 work underwater? How does gunpowder, how does fire work underwater? You need rockets to even

168
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,480
 consider leaving the planet. You need to take that step. But let's say they do develop rocket

169
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,600
 technology. We can go to space for a limited amount of time. We have to expend a ton of fuel to get

170
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:28,120
 up there. And we have oxygen. But imagine if you didn't need oxygen. Imagine if you needed tons of

171
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:35,320
 water. You needed to constantly be in water. Now the amount of force of thrust that takes to leave

172
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,160
 your planet, and you have to have all this water on the ship, they would just be like, I'm not going

173
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,200
 to go anywhere. So there could be millions of aquatic species out there. There could be millions

174
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,920
 of species that live underground with these underground lakes like we find on Mars, like we

175
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,000
 find on these other moons. Like I think it's Titan that has a bunch of underground lakes.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,680
 You don't even know space exists. And if you did figure it out and you're an aquatic species,

177
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,040
 you cannot leave. It just takes too much thrust to carry tons of water off the planet. If you even

178
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,360
 discover thrusts, rocket technology in the first place, I do think it's very, very plausible that

179
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,600
 I do believe there's aliens out there, obviously. And if there's a lot of aquatic species, we would

180
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,440
 never know it. And they would never know we existed. You could have a super intelligent species on

181
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,480
 earth that lived long before us that died out long before us that would leave no fossil record. And

182
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,280
 even if you could find the fossils, they wouldn't say how smart they were. This is something I wouldn't

183
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,640
 dismiss out of hand. And I know scientists, that's what they do. They're like, well, you need that

184
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,600
 proof. You just can't make these claims. But again, he's showing you the proof. He's asking you,

185
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,280
 then what's your answer? Fascinating story. And the fact that it was possibly drawing a picture

186
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:54,120
 of itself, right? Like a creature that wouldn't leave any fossils, but we know that it exists,

187
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,760
 or that it might exist, because it drew a picture of itself. I mean, that's that in and of itself is

188
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,160
 a really cool story. So I wanted to share that one with you. I really, really loved that one.

189
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,600
 Is it true? I mean, is his hypothesis true? Maybe he says the only way we'll be able to find out

190
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,400
 if these existed is if we find a giant beak from an octopus or a giant gladius. He goes other than

191
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,320
 that or a giant egg from one of them fossilized. He goes other than that, nothing else will ever

192
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,120
 prove they exist. And even if they find one of those, could they prove the drawing was intelligent?

193
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,320
 I guess we won't know. I guess we won't know until the squid drop ships show up.

194
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,040
 They found the way to leave their planet. They're coming for revenge.

195
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,760
 Erin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter. We're leaving behind the ocean.

196
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:51,960
 We are headed all the way out to a suburban neighborhood. I found this story online. It's

197
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,200
 an interesting story. I have to be upfront with you, though. We don't have a date range, which

198
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,840
 sucks. I mean, obviously, we kind of want to know the key details who would when, where, why.

199
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,440
 Paranormal, we very rarely get the why and how of it. We don't have a time range for this. We don't

200
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,480
 have a location for this. We know it takes place in a basic suburban neighborhood. And I believe

201
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,600
 the story starts in the 60s just because of the Darth Vader reference that's coming up that I

202
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,600
 alluded to in the intro. We're going to meet a young woman. She goes online by the moniker

203
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,280
 Chef Lisa O. So we'll just call her Lisa for short. And she makes the claim she grew up in

204
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,240
 a haunted house. She said she actually had her room was above the garage and every night.

205
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:44,920
 That's not her exercising. That's not her touching her toes. She hears footsteps walking upstairs.

206
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,400
 She would hear footsteps walking up the stairs and she's like, no, not again, not again. And then

207
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,280
 she knew what was coming. She would start screaming at the top of her lungs, but no one in the house

208
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,400
 could hear her. I've actually experienced that. I'll put that in an episode in the show notes.

209
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,480
 That does fit with ghost lore that sometimes ghosts can actually create some sort of sound bubble.

210
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,880
 So that's a terrifying part of it. You think safety in numbers, but there are times and I've had it

211
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 happen to me. You can scream at the top of your lungs and someone in the next room literally hears

212
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,000
 nothing. So she screamed at the top of her lungs and a ghost would start beating her up.

213
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,560
 I'm working doing work in the rib cage a little bit, punching her in the face.

214
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,360
 And it's so funny because at the very beginning here, I'm not going to try to dissect this story

215
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,680
 too much, but at the very beginning here, this story has a weird balance of very credible information

216
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:42,040
 and then stuff that's so bizarre. Like I've been in the situation where you can scream and nobody

217
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:47,880
 can hear you, but imagine if every this happens every single night, she got beat up by a ghost.

218
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,320
 Like eventually she's going to come downstairs. She's all bruised. She's like wearing a sling and

219
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,400
 the mom's like, "How'd you sleep?" And she's like, "Mom, if I told you once, I told you twice,

220
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,280
 every night a ghost beats me up." "Oh, you're just, you're just faking."

221
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,440
 "As your kidneys are bleeding." She's like, "Mom, can I go to the hospital again?"

222
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,440
 So this story, and I'm not going to break, I'm not going to stop it every time, but I want to

223
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:14,120
 highlight that this story is weird on more than one level. She would often hear she'd be laying

224
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,520
 in bed. Why would you like just sleep on the couch, dude? But she'd be laying in bed. She wants to,

225
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,560
 she wants to get up her boxing moves. She's like the only true opponent is the spirit opponent.

226
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,480
 She's fighting it. She's always losing though. She'd be sleeping in her bed and she would hear

227
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:36,440
 deep scratches from coming inside of her closet. She's like, "Oh no, oh no." She's,

228
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,920
 she's wrapping her, wrapping her hands with tape, getting ready to box. And then one day she asked

229
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,280
 her older brother, "Hey, would you go check, would you go check on my closet?" There might be a

230
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,680
 demon in there. I mean, I don't know if she's not going in her closet to get her clothes or anything.

231
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,640
 They're all covered with moths. I mean, obviously she's opening her closet to get clothes out, but

232
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,760
 okay, I'll try to, I'll try not to stop this story to analyze it too much because we're only two

233
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:07,720
 paragraphs in. The brother goes into the closet and he's kind of pushing around on the wall.

234
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,000
 That's how he checks stuff. I'm not going to be able to get through this story. That's how he

235
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,360
 checks stuff. He's like, "Hey, can you check out the car?" He's just pushing on the carburetor. He's

236
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,440
 like, "Yeah, this seems to work." He goes in to check out the closet and he's seen what could be

237
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,680
 causing the scratches and he pushes and he realizes that the closet actually has a bunch of drywall,

238
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,280
 which you know, all houses do, but he's able to push through it and there's a secret room on the

239
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,920
 other side of Lisa's closet. And they walk in there and there is a small table, like an

240
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:45,240
 altar almost, and burnt candles, and then bones, bird bones and dog bones. And Lisa implies maybe

241
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,760
 some of the bones are actually human. And there was also a book of spells and incantations. So

242
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,560
 they're like, "What should I do with all of this demonic stuff? I know, I'll just throw it in the

243
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,760
 garbage." This is not doing me any good. I don't know how to read these incantations. And I've already

244
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,640
 made enough bone stew for the week. So they throw all this stuff out and they find out in a roundabout

245
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:15,240
 way the history of the house, why they actually had this hidden room in the closet. It turns out

246
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,080
 before Lisa's family moved in there, another family lived there, and this was a family where they had

247
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 a mom, a dad, and their son Bart. And Bart was, this is, I mean, you don't get to choose your

248
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,240
 children, right? You have kids and hopefully they're cool and not super lame and stuff like that.

249
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:40,920
 But anyways, this dude was a worshiper of the Dark Lord and a pedophile. So that's a bad combination,

250
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,840
 right? Because basically you're already a super disgusting human being, you're a pedophile, and

251
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,000
 then you're trying to use the ways of the satanic forces around you. I don't know, be like extra

252
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,120
 pedophilic. But anyways, he's a nutcase. And so he's living there with his mom and his dad. And

253
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,840
 the dad one day mysteriously vanishes. He's like walking, he's walking into the closet, he's like,

254
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 "Oh, it's a portal." And Bart's like, "One down, one to go." Well, the dad mysteriously vanishes,

255
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,960
 and then his mom fell down the stairs in the house. And she tumbled so far,

256
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,880
 or it could have been three stairs, I don't know how far she fell, but it was far enough and hard

257
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 enough that she needed a wheelchair after she fell down the stairs. So Bart was like, "Oh, man,

258
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,560
 he's like wheeling his mom or he's like, "Oh, man, I'd really love to worship Satan, but instead

259
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,600
 I gotta take my mom to the clinic." So anyways, the family moved out. It probably wasn't wheelchair

260
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,160
 accessible. There were a bunch of stairs as she fell down. So I don't think they could have lived

261
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,400
 there anymore. So they moved out. But what happened was Bart would still come by the house to visit.

262
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,320
 And well, he wasn't welcome. They didn't like let him in the house. They're like, "Teen crumpets,

263
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,120
 he's all levitating them." He's like, "Oh, yes, mom, mom, mom. Satan gives me more powers each day."

264
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,360
 He would show up and usually on Saturdays, right? He'd show up like every Saturday and he would stand

265
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,560
 in the front yard talking to the trees. You'd just be having these conversations with the trees.

266
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,600
 And people are like, "Dude, you're super nuts, right?" This is before they found his portal in

267
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,800
 her closet. They just thought he was a weirdo. And then one day when Lisa's mom is walking through

268
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 the front yard, Bart turns to her and says, "You, you will die a violent death." And she's like,

269
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,240
 "What?" I don't think he was allowed back at the house after that. That would definitely

270
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,080
 you'd get a restraining order after that. But he stopped showing up at some point and the house

271
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:47,320
 is greeted with a new visitor, El Greco. He's a tiny little demon man who starts walking around

272
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,440
 the house and he goes, "My name is El Greco and welcome to my home. You're the one paying the

273
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,760
 mortgage payments. I'm a roommate you can never get rid of." And this little El Greco guy would

274
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,960
 kind of like stalk around the house. I don't know. This is so weird because they introduce El

275
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,640
 Greco and I'll tell you right now he doesn't really do anything. He just kind of like hops on

276
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,680
 plates and dances. Actually, he doesn't even do that. He just is there. He just is there. My

277
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,480
 whimsical imagination imagined him the little top hat. But no, he just kind of is like hanging

278
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:25,240
 out in the house. The demon who really makes a mark on this story is described as a large

279
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,240
 black figure. The mom starts to describe this large dark figure that will be standing in the house.

280
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,200
 She's like, "Oh dude, it's super scary. Like this guy shows up and he has like on a cape

281
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,520
 and his face is all weird and stuff like that." And he just like walks around and he's super spooky,

282
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,320
 right? She's trying to describe what this demon looks like to her family because no one else

283
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,960
 can see it. And they're like, "Uh, I'm sure we found the portal to hell in my closet and I get

284
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,160
 beat up every night by the ghost." But I don't know what you're talking about. You're talking about

285
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,440
 El Greco. I haven't seen that dude and you're talking about this giant black demon walking around.

286
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,680
 And she can't really like explain it. Like he's dressed in all black. He has his black cape. He

287
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,800
 has this weird looking helmet. But one day, this is why I think the story takes place in the 1960s

288
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,880
 because now we're jumping ahead to 1977. They've been living in this haunted house for a long time.

289
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,200
 They all go to see Star Wars at the movie theater. The first one, right? And she's watching the movie,

290
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,480
 opening crawl, all that copyrighted music, laser beams, and the stormtroopers getting

291
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,680
 shot and rebels throwing bombs and whatever. And then the door opens up and out comes

292
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:48,120
 the demon from their house. When she saw Darth Vader walk on screen, the mom started to lose it

293
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,200
 because she goes, "That is what the demon looks like." Not El Greco. El Greco's right here. He's

294
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,400
 like in the popcorn. He's like, "Nom, nom, nom, nom." El Greco came with us. The giant, large, black

295
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,880
 demon I've been seeing in my house looks exactly like Darth Vader. It doesn't say whether or not

296
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,200
 they finished watching the movie because on the one hand, Star Wars, what a great film, right?

297
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,560
 On the other hand, the demon who's haunting your house is in it. I don't know if I could watch

298
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,120
 the first Matrix if Lawrence Fishburne kept breaking into my house and beating me up. I don't

299
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,040
 think I could do it, but again, another great movie. So this point, Lisa's like 14 years old. She

300
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:34,680
 spent her entire early life in this haunted house and her mom starts to act weird, which is a really

301
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,160
 high bar because she's already talking about Darth Vader hanging out in her kitchen and El Greco

302
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,320
 running around. She starts to act like she's possessed and she begins to hallucinate. And

303
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,240
 one of the hallucinations she saw that she specifically names that is that, Lisa, one of the

304
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,840
 hallucinations that the mother saw was she would be walking through the house and her kids would

305
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,760
 be running around or reading books or like jumping. "Please start playing with Star Wars

306
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,040
 action figures." She's like, "No, no. You're part of the conspiracy." She would be watching her kids

307
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:13,640
 and then they would start to slow down and then freeze and then turn to statues.

308
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:22,600
 She'd be staring at these lifeless sculptures of her children just standing there in the living

309
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,840
 room. That terrifies me. That level of mental illness terrifies me because you think about it,

310
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,640
 the kids are still moving around, right? The real world is still going on, but she's seen them

311
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:43,720
 frozen in place. Like statues, they became stone. You know what I mean? That's another

312
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,520
 layer of reality, almost like an overhead projector just laying on top of it while reality still

313
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,600
 moves. That type of thing absolutely freaks me out. And she starts to, during this time period

314
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
 where she's possessed and hallucinating, she starts to know things that she shouldn't know,

315
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,760
 not like advanced algebra. She's learning, like she knew that her husband got in a car wreck and

316
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,760
 she's sitting there and she's like, "He got in a crash. He got in a crash." And they're like,

317
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,680
 "What are you talking about?" And then they get a phone call later. The dad survived, but he's in

318
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:17,240
 a car accident. And she said that El Grico told her. El Grico's like, "Guess who's not coming home

319
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:24,760
 for dinner tonight?" She starts hearing voices. That's really de-escalation, right? She's seeing

320
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:30,120
 all this hideous stuff and then the other things. She hears voices. She smells burnt hair.

321
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,040
 That's pretty gross. Neurological problem, right? Neurological problem, looking at it like a skeptic.

322
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:43,800
 The story, though, concludes with Bart's prophecy coming true. The mother starts telling the family,

323
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,200
 "Hey, listen, I know things, things have been really stressful, me being possessed and all,

324
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,640
 but tonight I heard a conversation upstairs. It wasn't any of you guys. I'm not accusing any of

325
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:01,240
 you guys, but I heard a man and a woman talking upstairs and they said it's time for her to die.

326
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,600
 And to be honest, I'm really, really nervous about that because it's me and then Lisa,

327
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,000
 I think, is the only other girl in the house. So it's one of us. It's probably me, right? Because

328
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,080
 I was prophesied to have a violent death. And I imagine at this point you would be like, "Oh,

329
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,840
 do we have to take her to the hospital again?" Like at this point you would have to really

330
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,000
 believe your mom was suffering from some serious mental illness because you're not really seeing

331
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,480
 any of this stuff. I mean, to be fair, Lisa did get beat up every night by a ghost. I don't think

332
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,240
 she's a skeptic. I don't think she was like, "Oh, but Darth Vader, that's ridiculous,"

333
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:37,000
 as she's getting punched in the liver. The next night, the next night, the very next night,

334
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,800
 the mother bolts out of the house, runs into the road and is hit by two cars.

335
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:52,200
 And as she's laying there dying on the road, she's still clutching her Bible.

336
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,400
 She's holding tightly to her Bible, hoping for more peace in the afterlife than she had

337
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,960
 in the last few years of this life. Obviously super tragic. And how do you again explain that?

338
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,880
 Did she have a psychotic break? Did she run into the road? Did she see something that scared her so

339
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,480
 badly? Like, how did this happen? And for months afterwards, when Lisa was brushing her hair or

340
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,800
 brushing her teeth or just walking by a mirror of any kind, her mother would be standing behind her.

341
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,520
 And her mother would just be malvying something,

342
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:33,880
 trying to communicate with Lisa. And you could never make out the words. It was just

343
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,560
 silent, but she could see her mom's tortured gaze locked on her as her mouth silently opened

344
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,520
 and closed, trying to tell her something. This goes on for months and Lisa almost has a nervous

345
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,920
 breakdown. This was going for three days for me. I'd have a nervous breakdown. This goes on for

346
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,840
 months and Lisa's on the edge. She knows her mom wants to tell her something, but she can't figure

347
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,040
 out what it is for the life of her. And then one night, her mom shows up in the bedroom,

348
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:05,080
 and Lisa immediately relaxes like she feels all of this tension leave her body. And the mom says,

349
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:13,800
 "I didn't run out of the house because I was crazy. I was murdered by Darth Vader. I was murdered

350
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,600
 by the Darth Vader guy. He was in the house. This all happened at 3 a.m. This all happened at 3 a.m.

351
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,480
 I was sitting there in the house and Darth Vader showed up. He's like, "I want the plans for the

352
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,840
 Death Star." And I ran out and Darth Vader was chasing me through the house and I grabbed the

353
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,480
 Bible thinking it would protect me in some way, but it didn't. And I ran out the front door and

354
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,920
 Darth Vader's close on my heels and then I run into the road and I'm run over by two cars.

355
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:52,920
 And then after that, the spirit of her mom stopped visiting her. After that, the haunting of the

356
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,240
 house seemed to cease. I believe they just moved out of the house, which is what I would have done

357
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:06,840
 the first year of getting beat up by a ghost. Fascinating story. Obviously, there's two ways

358
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:15,400
 we can look at this. One is a mental health way, right? Because all of the stuff the mom's going

359
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,600
 through could easily be attributed to mental illness. Possessions. The burnt hair. It's so funny

360
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 because we deal in the paranormal world, we deal with possessions, we deal with ghosts, we deal with

361
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:31,720
 voices. All of that stuff is pretty normal in the world of the paranormal. When you add in the smell

362
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,440
 of burnt hair, that's really when I was reading the narrative, I go, "This does seem neurological."

363
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,920
 That's something you don't normally smell. You have the stereotypical smell of sulfur,

364
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,200
 which a lot of times could be some sort of methane leak, which it could also cause you to

365
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,040
 hallucinate if you're around it for too long. But the burnt hair, I was thinking she might just

366
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,200
 be having strokes that's causing all of these all of these disconnections in her brain. So that's

367
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,080
 obviously something we do want to address. It's the easiest thing to just go, "Ah, she was just crazy."

368
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,640
 But how exhausting would that be? Like even if it was just craziness. But then you look, you go,

369
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,360
 "Well, Jason, if the mom was crazy, she's hallucinating El Grico." What about the daughter?

370
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,440
 Like she was getting beat up by the ghost. Was she crazy? Was she beating herself up?

371
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,160
 It's interesting because when you look, this is one of the things I like about Reddit. One of the

372
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,360
 few things I like about Reddit. I think the website's a cesspool of the most disgusting humans on the

373
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,600
 planet. But other than that, I can look at people's post histories and not to discredit people,

374
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,360
 not to be like, "Oh, you also like this political party? Pfft, you're dumb." Not like that. I like

375
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,320
 to look at it because I like to see if they're posting stuff that is equally far-fetched. I can

376
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,080
 look at stuff and go, "Is this someone who's always posting once-in-a-lifetime stories?" Because if it's

377
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,320
 someone who posts once-in-a-lifetime stories over and over and over again, it starts to seem like

378
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,920
 they're making it up. To be fair, I've been ghost hunting for 23 years and I do have my fair share

379
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,800
 of once-in-a-lifetime stories as well. So it's not an automatic strike against her.

380
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,360
 She does go on to say that she once ran into a serial killer, a gay serial killer. I don't know

381
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,800
 if that meant he was killing gay people or if he was gay himself, but he gave her a giant

382
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 garbage bag full of beanie babies. And she also said when she's an adult and she has a daughter

383
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:31,240
 that Jesus was stalking her daughter, like there is this weird stalker outside of her window,

384
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,400
 and her daughter would be like, "Mommy, mommy, the visitor's back, the visitor's back," and then

385
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,720
 Lisa would go outside and there were these giant footprints. There was only one set of footprints.

386
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,680
 That's when Jesus was carrying the stalker to safety. They would find these set of footprints.

387
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,360
 They were like 11 inches. So not giant, giant, but... And then one day they were at church and the

388
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,440
 minister was showing a picture of Jesus. It was a picture of him photoshopping his arm around Jesus.

389
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,520
 He's like, "Look it. Jesus is my best buddy. You should join my church." They had like a, not a photo

390
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:05,160
 of Jesus, obviously. What a drawing of Jesus, like a painting. And the little girl goes, "That's

391
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:12,200
 him. That's the visitor who's peeking through my window at night." And it was Jesus. Jesus was the

392
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,960
 stalker. Now listen, I know humans can look like Jesus. Obviously Jesus was a human, but I mean,

393
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,120
 it's an easy look to copy, right? I've known people that pull out the Jesus look.

394
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,880
 So it could just have been, it could have been a stalker that looked like Jesus. We're in the

395
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,400
 world of paranormal. It could have been Jesus. When I read stories like that, it doesn't discredit

396
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:38,680
 Lisa at all. It does. It's interesting because I'm not going to throw out, those are weird once in

397
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,160
 a lifetime stories as well. They don't really dismiss everything. I don't go, "Oh, it's obviously,

398
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,640
 this woman's obviously making stuff up," or anything like that. Those stories are weird, though,

399
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,560
 and they do add color because even her story, the story about her mom, I should say, involves

400
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,000
 Darth Vader. Right off the bat. But what's so interesting is that Darth Vader does look like

401
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,040
 a spooky dude. Like to us, he's a toy, and I think he's one of the best villains in the original

402
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,880
 trilogy at least. I do think that that is a very menacing figure. And who knows that maybe George

403
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,520
 Lucas got the... Lucas's partner was El Grico. And El Grico secretly wrote the original trilogy.

404
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,360
 That's why those movies are so much better than all the other ones. I did like the prequels. But

405
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,240
 the point is, when somebody's telling you a ghost story and you're like, "Oh my god, the ghost was

406
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,080
 coming to your room," and she's like, "Yeah, he was beating me up every night." You go, "Ehh, every night?"

407
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:35,080
 It's interesting. Like, it's little details that make you go, "Like, if it beats you up occasionally,

408
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,280
 it beats you up every couple months or something like that, maybe?" But every night, that's

409
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,280
 obvious proof. Like, you could just bring someone to their house on a Wednesday and they

410
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:51,960
 get beat up. And that's proof. So, stuff like that. Like, sometimes the details are too weird,

411
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,080
 even. We just covered a squid that drew a picture of itself with dinosaur bones. But getting beat

412
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,080
 up every night's a little too weird. The Darth Vader thing, even though he's a menacing character,

413
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,520
 that's still really weird that Darth Vader was chasing this woman around the house.

414
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:11,160
 It's a story. It's one of the stories that is so ridiculous, it might become so ridiculous. It's true.

415
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,480
 So, was this the story of a woman in the throes of some sort of mental illness? Some sort of madness

416
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,000
 that was so out of control, not only did she run out into the middle of the street to get hit by

417
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,280
 two cars, but she also spread that mental illness throughout her family. It went from being in her

418
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,320
 head to almost mass psychosis. I really don't know. I don't know if I'd rather live in a haunted house

419
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,600
 or have actually no answer to this one. If I had to choose between a debilitating mental illness

420
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,240
 or a living in a haunted house, even if the demon was a killer, I'd live in the haunted house. Because

421
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:55,720
 I, I think I can go get an exorcist. I can maybe sublet the room above the garage to somebody I

422
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,400
 don't like. I'd much rather do that. Curses and hauntings can be passed on to the next generation.

423
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:08,920
 But so can mental illness. That's the case. That's what the story's about.

424
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,040
 It's not scary or terrifying. It's just really, really kind of sad.

425
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:24,920
