1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 an insane story coming out of Texas

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 that I'm going to try to tell

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,440
 without the FBI watchdogs shutting down the podcast.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,560
 And then we take a look at true evil

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,720
 as we meet a group of dark robed villains

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,440
 living amongst us.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,960
 Did you know there are grown adults?

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,200
 There are adults who believe that they are actually

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,360
 the real life version of the Sith.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
 And then we travel to India to meet a young man

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,720
 who is trying to get to school one morning.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,840
 Little does he know reality has other plans.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:50,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,720
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,720
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,040
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,760
 I hope you guys aren't me.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,840
 I hope you guys aren't me.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,760
 I'm suffering from severe allergies.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,680
 The amount of editing to take out all of the sneezes

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,040
 and sniffles will be insane.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,120
 But someone who's never insane

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,080
 walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
 give it up for our newest Patreon supporter,

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,520
 Sufi Loveheart.

29
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,720
 Yeah, all right, Sufi.

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,360
 Come on in, give him a big round of applause

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 to the door, to the door.

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,760
 The pollen is really bad around Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,000
 Sufi, you're going to be our captain,

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,960
 our pilot this episode.

35
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,200
 If you guys can't support the Patreon,

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
 I totally understand,

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
 just help spread the word about this show.

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,080
 That really, really helps out a lot.

39
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,640
 Now we got an action-packed episode.

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,560
 We got three stories.

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
 I haven't done three stories in a long time.

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,440
 So Sufi, hope you're ready to go.

43
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,960
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,840
 to the Jason Jalopy we're leaving

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
 behind Dead Rabbit Command.

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,480
 We're driving all the way out to Dallas, Texas.

47
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,920
 (imitates engine revving)

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,120
 We're taking the Jason Jalopy.

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
 It's a bad choice.

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,880
 It is a convertible.

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,600
 So I'm just getting extra pollen into my nostrils.

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,840
 Pollen from other states is even worse.

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,200
 The reason why we're in Dallas, Texas,

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,120
 Sufi, I want you to pull up right here.

55
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,360
 And we are currently sitting outside the house

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,620
 of former president George W. Bush.

57
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,880
 This story's nuts.

58
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,760
 I can't believe this story isn't getting more played.

59
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,760
 We were so close to World War III

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
 and I believe a civil war.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,680
 I believe that this could have thrown everything into chaos.

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,580
 What happened was in April of 2021,

63
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,000
 two people approached the FBI.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,760
 They were actually already like confidential informants,

65
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
 which tends to mean they got caught doing something

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
 they shouldn't have done.

67
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,560
 And to lessen their jail time

68
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,120
 or sometimes you'll get paid

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
 to be a confidential informant or both,

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,440
 these people worked for the FBI,

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
 but only as like secondary.

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,560
 Their main job was being a criminal.

73
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,320
 So you had one person specialized in being a forger.

74
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,920
 They would forge documents.

75
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,920
 So this person specialized in ID cards,

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,240
 police ID cards, drivers license, social security cards,

77
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,000
 FBI ID cards.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,960
 I mean, I guess if you want someone on your team,

79
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
 it should be this guy.

80
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,600
 But again, he's not a member of the FBI.

81
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
 He's a confidential informant.

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 So this person who's actively making badges

83
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,160
 that are fraudulent is also working with the FBI.

84
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,360
 You can imagine whenever he goes into the FBI field office,

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,320
 they're like, "Hey, Joe, it's nice to see you.

86
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,920
 You got any juicy tips for the FBI?"

87
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,880
 And he's like, "Sure do, boss."

88
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,360
 As he's walking through the place,

89
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,840
 he's like stealing their FBI badges.

90
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,600
 And he's like, "No one will ever suspect

91
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,120
 it is the master forger who's a double agent

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
 who stole all these FBI badges."

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,800
 The other person that was working with the feds

94
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,640
 was a smuggler.

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,600
 This guy specialized in human smuggling.

96
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
 I'm sure he could get you some bananas over the border.

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
 I'm sure he could get you a bunch of illegal iguanas

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,240
 from Guam, but specialized in human smuggling.

99
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,320
 Apparently a lot of this stuff is still

100
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,600
 in sealed court documents,

101
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,880
 but from what we can understand,

102
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,120
 Forbes did a really good right upon this.

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,360
 And no one else.

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
 This is shocking.

105
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,720
 Forbes covered this and then ABC News covered this

106
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
 and then, oh, what?

107
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,160
 Okay, I guess it's a non-new story.

108
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,000
 A smuggler, a human smuggler and a master forger

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
 went to the FBI and said,

110
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,160
 "Dude, you need to like work more criminals

111
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,520
 and we know we're criminals,

112
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,040
 but you need to look into this guy."

113
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,920
 His name is She-Hob Ahmed She-Hob She-Hob.

114
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,800
 He's a 52 year old man.

115
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,360
 He was a citizen of Iraq who's been living

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,920
 in the United States on a visitor's visa

117
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
 in Columbus, Ohio.

118
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,400
 And he has an asylum application pending.

119
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,600
 And these two confidential informants said,

120
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
 "We have both been contacted by this guy

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 because he has a plan to assassinate George W. Bush."

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,200
 And he had a plan.

123
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,160
 It's not like, oh, I hate the governor.

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,200
 One of these days, I hope someone,

125
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,560
 this is the phrase I'm not gonna complete

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,200
 because I don't wanna get arrested.

127
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,880
 But people have grievances with politicians, right?

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,480
 And some people will fantasize about it.

129
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,080
 They're like, oh, if I could only,

130
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,640
 if I could only do that phrase.

131
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,120
 But he actually had a plan.

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
 And what had happened was he'd contacted these people

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 and he says, "What I want is I'm a member of ISIS.

134
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,600
 I've triggered so many federal watchwords."

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
 The Feds are definitely gonna love this episode.

136
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,600
 "I'm a member of ISIS.

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,800
 I She-Hob Ahmed She-Hob She-Hob is a member of ISIS.

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,920
 And I have a bunch of ISIS dudes over in Iraq.

139
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,460
 And I wanna smuggle them over the Mexican border.

140
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,500
 So smuggler, can you do that?"

141
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,320
 And he goes, "Yeah, it's like $50,000 a person."

142
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,200
 And She-Hob goes, "No problem.

143
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
 No problem."

144
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
 The smuggler's like, "Oh, I should ask for more.

145
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,600
 I should have said $100,000 a person."

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
 He goes, "I wanna get seven of my ISIS compatriots

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,280
 over the border.

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,080
 We are then going to get a bunch of guns.

149
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,680
 And we're gonna have fake police badges.

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
 You can do that, right, Master Forger."

151
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,800
 And he's like, "Yeah, I can totally do that.

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,920
 It'll be $50,000 a badge."

153
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,440
 We're gonna have either fake police badges

154
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,320
 or fake FBI badges so we can get close to the president.

155
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 And we're going to shoot him.

156
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,740
 Now, that's troubling enough.

157
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,220
 But again, sometimes people,

158
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,900
 they get drunk and they're boasting and stuff like that.

159
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,940
 They don't really mean it.

160
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,980
 In November of 2021,

161
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,860
 She-Hob was outside George Bush's house

162
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,140
 taking photographs.

163
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,620
 That's when it's not you sitting on your couch

164
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,000
 throwing empty beer cans at the television set.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,060
 That's when you have a plan to assassinate a former president.

166
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,040
 The plan was then to escape back over the border

167
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,340
 and just to disappear.

168
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,480
 Can you imagine if this had been pulled off

169
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,400
 in today's climate?

170
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
 He's been arrested.

171
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
 And that's why we know about this stuff.

172
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
 He wasn't reading Forbes.com one day.

173
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
 He's like, "Oh, gotta go."

174
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
 They caught him.

175
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
 And they don't believe that he's a boaster.

176
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,180
 Again, there's a lot of people who make threats.

177
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,700
 They're calling up the White House

178
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
 at three in the morning threatening the president.

179
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,860
 The Secret Service will come out and talk to you for that.

180
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,580
 They'll see if you're a threat.

181
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,300
 This guy was not sitting in a living room

182
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,820
 full of a much empty beer cans

183
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,460
 that had been thrown into television set.

184
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,820
 This guy was a member of the Bath Party of Iraq.

185
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,140
 He's claimed to kill several Americans in Iraq

186
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,180
 during the resistance years between 2003 and 2006

187
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,120
 during the American occupation of Iraq.

188
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,640
 He's claiming to be a member of ISIS as well.

189
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,420
 And it doesn't seem like the authorities are like,

190
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,560
 "Yeah, whatever you say, buddy.

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,920
 "Like you're just making it up."

192
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,440
 They're taking this pretty seriously.

193
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,840
 He is in jail.

194
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
 And I think they can track some of this stuff.

195
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,720
 He's able to name names and say,

196
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
 "Oh, I used to work for this guy."

197
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,760
 He was like, "Trying to tell these two

198
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,360
 "confidential informants."

199
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,200
 He was like bragging,

200
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,480
 "Oh, dude, I love killing Americans."

201
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,760
 And they're like, "Do all I do is make documents.

202
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
 "I don't know why you think all of a sudden

203
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,360
 "I hate America 'cause I forge IDs."

204
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,380
 So they were able to stop this guy.

205
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,320
 But could you imagine if this happened in today's climate?

206
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,900
 I think it would have caused World War III.

207
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,480
 And I think it would have caused the Civil War.

208
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,320
 I think, because imagine if they got away with it.

209
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,760
 If they did this and they killed a former president

210
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,480
 and they got caught, you could blame it on ISIS.

211
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,040
 Oh, man, and that would be insane.

212
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,960
 'Cause ISIS has been decimated at this point.

213
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,760
 They're still active, obviously, this guy.

214
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,120
 It's just this guy left.

215
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,540
 They're still active, but they don't have the same amount

216
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,840
 of firepower or following that they used to have.

217
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,720
 We invaded two countries because of Osama bin Laden.

218
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,680
 We invaded the country he was in.

219
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
 We invaded Afghanistan.

220
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,840
 And then we went ahead and invaded Iraq.

221
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,440
 And that's why this guy wanted to do it.

222
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
 He wanted to do it as revenge.

223
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,160
 If you couldn't catch him though

224
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,280
 and you couldn't blame it on ISIS,

225
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,920
 everyone would be suspect.

226
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,760
 You would every American geopolitical enemy.

227
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,600
 And not only that, I think it would rip the country apart

228
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,720
 because you would have people who actively hated George W.

229
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,100
 Bush, people who would be celebrating it

230
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,920
 on Facebook and Twitter after this happened.

231
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,200
 They'd be like, "I don't care about that guy anyways."

232
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,520
 People would go nuts.

233
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,920
 People would go and saying this.

234
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,360
 It wouldn't be like when Kennedy was assassinated, right?

235
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
 It brought the country together.

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,760
 This would be the opposite.

237
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,960
 I honestly think that had this been successful,

238
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,400
 it would have at the very least

239
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,680
 thrown the country into turmoil

240
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,400
 'cause you would have people who were openly celebrating it.

241
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
 And then you would have people who weren't.

242
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,200
 You would have people who would be going after the people

243
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
 who were celebrating it.

244
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,520
 It would be insane.

245
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
 And if you thought it came,

246
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,200
 'cause you might think it's a domestic thing, right?

247
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,240
 How could they gotten close to this guy?

248
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,440
 Or you could have thought it was a world power

249
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,240
 that did it or ISIS or some unknown terrorist group

250
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,080
 or China or Russia or whatever.

251
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,520
 I mean, it would be insane.

252
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,200
 And you gotta remember there is always a segment

253
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
 of the US government.

254
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,240
 I can't say this for all world governments,

255
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
 but there is always a segment of the US government,

256
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,360
 no matter who's in power that wants to go to war.

257
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,560
 Always, always, that has always existed.

258
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
 We were, I think it was Eisenhower

259
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,240
 who warned about the military industrial complex.

260
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
 You're not hearing it here first.

261
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,000
 This is pretty well-known, I think, in American politics.

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,280
 There is a group of people who are always willing

263
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,760
 to use US might to go to war.

264
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,200
 Is it for profit?

265
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
 Is it for power?

266
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,160
 Who knows?

267
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,240
 And it's always there.

268
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,760
 It might be different names,

269
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,720
 but there's always a group of people

270
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,240
 who wants to invade other countries.

271
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,320
 So this assassination attempt was successful.

272
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,520
 It would throw the country into turmoil,

273
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,120
 if not the world.

274
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,560
 Crazy.

275
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,080
 A salute to you, good old forager and human smuggler.

276
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
 You guys are criminals

277
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,720
 and you guys should probably stop doing that criminal stuff.

278
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
 But man, had they not turned this guy in,

279
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,720
 the world would be a very different place,

280
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,920
 very, very quickly.

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,120
 And no one's talking about it.

282
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
 It's so weird, no one's talking about that.

283
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,480
 Sufi, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

284
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
 to the dead rabbit rocket ship.

285
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,280
 We're leaving behind Dallas, Texas.

286
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,500
 We're headed all the way out, too.

287
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,160
 The Death Star.

288
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,680
 I was researching a story recently on Reddit

289
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,520
 and what I'll tend to do when I find a story,

290
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,440
 someone's posting it.

291
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,160
 I like to go through their posting history

292
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,200
 to kind of see what they're about.

293
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,840
 'Cause if someone is always posting

294
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,560
 once in a lifetime, paranormal events,

295
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
 then I go, "Is this true?"

296
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720
 If they're posting about a bunch of normal stuff,

297
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,280
 most of their posts are just about random stuff,

298
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,720
 and then they go, "Hey guys, you won't believe this.

299
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,680
 This has just happened the other night."

300
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

301
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,280
 It usually lends more credence to the story.

302
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,400
 It's just a research tip I like to use

303
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,360
 because we don't know how much of this stuff is true.

304
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
 When I read something published in a UFO journal

305
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,920
 or a UFO website, a cryptid website,

306
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,800
 that does give it a little bit of more legitimacy,

307
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,120
 but again, they might have just found it on Reddit,

308
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,400
 and it might have been random when they found it as well.

309
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,680
 So I like to have this tool when it's available,

310
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,640
 and I don't remember what story I was working on,

311
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,400
 but some guy had posted something

312
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,480
 that I was like, "Let's see what this guy's all about.

313
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,760
 Let's see if this guy's actually legit."

314
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,280
 And what I found was I was a fool.

315
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,880
 I was a fool to question this guy in the first place

316
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,200
 over whatever story it was.

317
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,840
 I obviously decided not to do it.

318
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,960
 I was a fool though,

319
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,960
 because I was trying to find out who this man was.

320
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,320
 But really, I was in the presence of a Sith Lord.

321
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,000
 Now, if you don't know what a Sith Lord is,

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,200
 you've obviously never watched the Star Wars movie

323
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,240
 or hung out with an eight-year-old.

324
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,640
 Sith Lords, the ancient enemy of the Jedi,

325
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,880
 Darth Vader was a Sith Lord,

326
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,000
 Emperor was a Sith Lord,

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,560
 a bunch of made-up characters

328
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,680
 and a bunch of books and cartoons were Sith Lords.

329
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,280
 They are the dark side of the Jedi.

330
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,040
 They're the ones who decided to say,

331
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,200
 "I will embrace the anger

332
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
 and shoot electricity out of my fingers

333
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,680
 and kill my children,"

334
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,200
 which seems to be a common theme among the Sith.

335
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,720
 And if you could join any fictional group,

336
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,680
 wouldn't you want to join the group

337
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,980
 that's constantly killing their kids?

338
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,360
 This is the Sith Order,

339
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,920
 and you might be saying,

340
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,400
 "Jason, these guys are obviously LARPers, right?

341
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,120
 They don't actually think they can shoot electricity

342
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
 out of their hands.

343
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,800
 They don't.

344
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
 It would be hilarious if they tried,

345
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,180
 but they're not LARPers.

346
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,040
 They clearly say, quote,

347
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,640
 "We are not a role-playing sub,

348
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,120
 and we aren't delusional people

349
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,600
 who think we can use force lightning.

350
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,400
 We are regular human beings

351
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,240
 that recognize the Sith Code

352
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,720
 as a guiding principle in real life."

353
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,800
 Now, obviously, huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy.

354
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,040
 I was born in '76,

355
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,480
 so it's kind of required that you watch all that stuff.

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,240
 I like the prequels.

357
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,560
 I read a couple of the books,

358
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,600
 "Aird of the Empire," that trilogy,

359
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,200
 that was fun, "Timothy's Zon," and stuff like that.

360
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,320
 I don't watch the cartoon.

361
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,480
 I watch a little bit of "The Clone Wars."

362
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,040
 I don't watch any of the new stuff other than "Mandalorian."

363
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,280
 Bookaboofet.

364
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,680
 Bookaboofet bored me,

365
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,360
 and I was like, "Okay, I'm done with the new Star Wars stuff."

366
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,520
 Never saw the new movies.

367
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,200
 So that's where I am at as a fan of Star Wars.

368
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,120
 So my knowledge of the Sith is fairly limited.

369
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,560
 So when these guys said that they followed the Sith Code,

370
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
 I thought, "Isn't that...

371
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,920
 Isn't force-lasen shooting lightning out of your fingers?

372
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,280
 Kind of a big part of it?

373
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,760
 Killing your kids?

374
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,840
 Being evil in general, right?

375
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,120
 The Sith are constantly trying to take over the galaxy,

376
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
 and there are gonna be two of them at any one time.

377
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,400
 So I'll have to spoiler alert,

378
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,920
 there's more than two members of the Sith Order.

379
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
 You can only have two members of the Sith.

380
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
 So I had to look up the Sith Code.

381
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,400
 I'm not gonna go through the whole thing.

382
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,720
 It's pretty self-explanatory.

383
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,560
 It's dumb.

384
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
 It's just dumb little kid stuff,

385
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,480
 stuff that people would write on a spiral notebook

386
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,960
 when they were 12 years old and thought it was edgy.

387
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,000
 But it starts off with peace is a lie.

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,360
 Peace is a lie.

389
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,920
 Here's a little tip from an old man.

390
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,080
 If you're ever thinking about joining a philosophy

391
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,520
 or a cult or a religion of any sort,

392
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,200
 and it starts off by telling you that peace is a lie,

393
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,440
 it's not gonna end well.

394
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,800
 Because the second you're like, you know what?

395
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
 I really like it here.

396
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,040
 They're gonna beat you up.

397
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,200
 They're gonna beat you up because you're living a lie, man.

398
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,280
 It goes on like this.

399
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,120
 Peace is a lie.

400
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
 There's only passion.

401
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,400
 Through passion I gain strength.

402
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
 Through strength I gain power.

403
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,360
 Through power I gain victory.

404
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,200
 Through victory my chains are broken.

405
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,600
 The force shall free me.

406
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,920
 The force shall free me.

407
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,280
 And you go, well, Jason, I don't know.

408
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,600
 I kind of do believe peace is a lie.

409
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,520
 I currently have two cops and headlocks

410
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
 listening to your podcast.

411
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
 Whether or not you agree with this,

412
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,760
 whether or not you're a total psychopath or not,

413
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,920
 I should alert you that this creed

414
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,040
 that these people do believe

415
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,120
 and they live their life by was not found

416
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,400
 on a set of stone tablets or even a holochron

417
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,200
 deep within the Jedi library.

418
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,440
 No, this credo was first shown

419
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,440
 in the Clone Wars animated series, episode 16.

420
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
 Here's another tip from an old man.

421
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,200
 If you're a life philosophy first appeared on a cartoon,

422
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,520
 it's probably not a good life philosophy.

423
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,480
 But let's take a look at you.

424
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,120
 You're like, Jason, you're lambasting these dudes, right?

425
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,400
 You're talking bad about the code.

426
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,240
 You know what these guys are gonna do to you?

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,320
 Let's take a look at some of these sinister dudes, though.

428
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,800
 Let's take a look at some of these dark lords of the Sith.

429
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,960
 Now, again, if you're not very familiar with Star Wars,

430
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,120
 the Sith Lords have to have the name Darth in front of them.

431
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,520
 So you have Darth Vader.

432
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,820
 This is stupid, right?

433
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,800
 It was cool when his name was just Darth Vader.

434
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,880
 When I watched the movie,

435
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,320
 they never said Sith in the original trilogy once.

436
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,240
 They might have done it with George Lucas's 18 edits,

437
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,960
 but originally his name was just Darth Vader.

438
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,160
 It wasn't a title.

439
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,480
 It was just that was his name.

440
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,440
 He was from an alien planet.

441
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,040
 It was Darth Vader, like on solo, right?

442
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,760
 Obi-Wan Kenobi was just some made up name.

443
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,000
 And now there's Darth Sidious and Darth Bane

444
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,520
 and Darth Maul and all these guys, right?

445
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,840
 Which I don't mind those characters,

446
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,200
 but it kind of took away from the fact that it was him.

447
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,080
 But anyway, so that's the thing.

448
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,560
 Now, you gotta be a Darth.

449
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,640
 You gotta, honestly, sounds really dumb.

450
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
 The name Darth always reminds me of Darth

451
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,280
 from Wayne's World.

452
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,720
 But anyways, let's take a look at one of these sinister dudes

453
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,960
 that are out there.

454
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,480
 Might be working next to you right now.

455
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,960
 Put your work place, you're listening to this.

456
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,800
 If you look over there,

457
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,360
 there's a guy with a dark-headed cloak on.

458
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,600
 Let's take a look at some of these guys.

459
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,440
 We have Darth Oskiro.

460
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,200
 He chose his name because it's the Spanish word for dark.

461
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,320
 So Darth Oskiro.

462
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,200
 And he goes on to explain that.

463
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
 It's just not good enough, right?

464
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,040
 The Spanish word for dark.

465
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,200
 And he says it's quote referring to my assassin nature.

466
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,800
 The darkness is my home.

467
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,800
 Birthplace, work office, and battlefield.

468
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,200
 And I was like, what, where does this guy work?

469
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,800
 Where do these guys work, honestly?

470
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,520
 They all seem to be adults.

471
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,840
 The darkness is my home.

472
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,080
 I can see that, your soul is in this dark place.

473
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,360
 Peace is a lie.

474
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,000
 His birthplace, his birthplace, I guess,

475
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,600
 maybe we all came from the dark room

476
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,260
 in our mom's womb, work office.

477
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,440
 So now he's just making stuff up.

478
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,840
 He's just lying, right?

479
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,760
 Who works in a dark place?

480
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,800
 Who is like, all right, man,

481
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,880
 time to go to work, he shut all the lights off.

482
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,960
 Oh, dude, maybe he works in a dark room, right?

483
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
 But he doesn't say that.

484
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
 I mean, that would be less intimidating.

485
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,000
 He's like, I work in the dark,

486
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,160
 but there's a red light on

487
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,240
 so he can develop photos at the local pay less.

488
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,680
 And battlefield, he fights on a darkened battlefield,

489
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,120
 which I think would be pretty easy to beat this guy up

490
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,080
 because he's never seen the light.

491
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
 The only thing you have to do is shine a light in his face

492
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,760
 and they have lightsabers, so that's even worse.

493
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,080
 He'd be constantly blinded.

494
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,000
 Then we have Darth Lune.

495
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,640
 Not like a loony bird,

496
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,640
 not like a coin from Canada, Darth Lune, L-U-N-E.

497
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,480
 I am Darth Lune, he says.

498
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,000
 Lune is French for moon.

499
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
 I think you guys are seeing a pattern here.

500
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,800
 They're very imaginative people.

501
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,880
 They just pick something from different language.

502
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,320
 Lune is French for moon.

503
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,520
 Like the moon, this is all his quotes.

504
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,000
 I'm not saying this, this is crazy.

505
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,920
 Like the moon, I wait for my time to strike.

506
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,640
 And I do not shine brightly like the sun

507
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,480
 who charges in head first.

508
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,160
 I am the moon, wait, before I continue,

509
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,560
 let's just take that apart.

510
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,240
 Whoever associates the moon

511
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,760
 with waiting for its time to strike,

512
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,400
 it's just something that's up there,

513
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,200
 slowly disappears, right?

514
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,520
 And then it slowly comes back.

515
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,360
 I've never been like, oh, it's almost a full moon.

516
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,120
 It's about to punch earth.

517
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,800
 I've never once associated the moon

518
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,160
 with anything like strike-worthy.

519
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,400
 And then he says I do not shine brightly

520
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,840
 like the sun who charges in head first.

521
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,500
 So I don't know what type of solar patterns this guy sees.

522
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,080
 The sun, I guess, kind of just shows up

523
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,240
 and it's super hot, but again, I've never thought like,

524
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,160
 if I had to say either one of them was punchy,

525
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,720
 would be the song, like their heat waves

526
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,580
 are constantly like punching my skin, making it burn.

527
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,240
 But still, I don't wanna say it heads in first,

528
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,720
 but anyway, so this guy, his name is Darth Moon,

529
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,600
 basically Darth, and here's the thing,

530
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,440
 like in America, if someone says I'm Darth Loon,

531
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,400
 you'd be like, oh, what does that mean?

532
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,360
 They say moon.

533
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,080
 But if he was in France, he's literally saying Darth Moon.

534
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,920
 Like that's what it is.

535
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,280
 And people would be like, well, that's a stupid name.

536
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
 Why would you have that?

537
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,200
 And then he continues on, I am the moon,

538
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,320
 I am the shadows and I am a Sith.

539
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,720
 And it's so funny because of course,

540
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,080
 when you get a bunch of malcontents

541
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,360
 who believe that piece is a lie,

542
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,520
 you guess what they do all the time on the subreddit?

543
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,760
 They argue with each other.

544
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,480
 They're constantly arguing with each other.

545
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,840
 And on this particular thread, people were,

546
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,320
 some guy said, I am not a slave to the dark side.

547
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,840
 The dark side is my pet.

548
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
 And people are like, no, you can't treat the dark side

549
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
 like that, this fictional thing

550
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,240
 that no one over the age of eight

551
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,880
 actually believes is real.

552
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,320
 You can't treat it like that.

553
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,160
 You have to be subservient to the dark side.

554
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,960
 And this went back and forth for a while

555
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
 until Darth Deficio, which I'm pretty sure

556
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,960
 my Latin's a little rusty, but I think it means lack of.

557
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,240
 Could be wrong, could be wrong, but I think it's apt.

558
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,200
 Darth Deficio says, I do agree,

559
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
 talking about the Sith order in general.

560
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,480
 I do agree that this order is dot, dot, dot lacking.

561
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,800
 And I do appreciate restraint.

562
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,840
 I just do not take lightly to lack of respect,

563
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,120
 especially involving Darth Bane,

564
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,560
 who's a fictional character, he's totally made up,

565
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,520
 he's from the books, he's not even cool enough

566
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
 to be in the movies.

567
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,800
 I just do not take lightly to lack of respect,

568
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,820
 especially involving Darth Bane or any of the ancients.

569
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,080
 The most ancient any of these guys are

570
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,040
 is a book published in the 1990s.

571
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,200
 And especially involving Darth Bane or any of the ancients.

572
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,360
 I say we talk about this issue elsewhere,

573
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,480
 perhaps in a PM, unquote.

574
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,960
 This is just insane.

575
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,040
 This is just so ridiculous.

576
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,560
 I get it, like there are people out there

577
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,960
 who believe in the Jedi religion

578
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,440
 and like Jedi's a recognized religion

579
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,600
 in a couple countries, but that is very tongue-in-cheek.

580
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,920
 And even if it's not tongue-in-cheek,

581
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
 it's basically just an offshoot.

582
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,440
 It's a mysticism, right?

583
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,520
 It's a Buddhism for the sci-fi age.

584
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,400
 And I get that, that's all well and good

585
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,240
 because at the very end of the day, at least it's positive.

586
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
 These people cannot go a thread

587
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,000
 without arguing with each other over something dumb.

588
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,440
 But yet they're living their life by the Sith code.

589
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,600
 And you go, Jason, what do you care

590
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,720
 what people's religious belief is?

591
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,560
 Well, I don't care if their belief

592
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,260
 is they don't like peace, right?

593
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,280
 If I'm sitting there, if I'm working with someone

594
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,400
 who's a Sith Lord, not even a Sith Lord, a Sith apprentice,

595
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,240
 well, it wouldn't do either of those things.

596
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,560
 Those things don't exist.

597
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,760
 Someone who actually believes they exist, right?

598
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,400
 And that's fine, people believe

599
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,880
 in all sorts of insane stuff.

600
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,720
 But if you have a philosophy

601
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,440
 and the first thing is peace is a lie, guess what?

602
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,960
 Your life's not gonna be easy.

603
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,820
 You're not gonna get along well with others.

604
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,720
 Someone who actually believes

605
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,000
 that their philosophy is based on a cartoon

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
 and a bunch of expanded universe.

607
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,880
 Not like it'd be any better if it was canon.

608
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,160
 Not like it'd be any better

609
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,540
 if it was from the original trilogy.

610
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,200
 I'm just saying that it's just so ridiculous.

611
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,680
 And of course, these people fight and bicker

612
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,120
 and they talk in these highfalutin' tones like,

613
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
 "My liege, would you like to please

614
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,240
 instant message me later?"

615
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,620
 Like, it just doesn't work.

616
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,200
 It's so bizarre.

617
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,360
 There's a guy who goes by the name Darth Caledas,

618
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,360
 who's also, he's a member of the Sith Order,

619
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,600
 and a member of a subreddit called True Christian.

620
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,160
 It's like, make up your mind, bro.

621
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,320
 Jesus was all about peace.

622
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,180
 And the Sith are all about destroying peace.

623
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,980
 Peace is a lie.

624
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
 It's so insane.

625
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,420
 This stuff is so nuts.

626
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,880
 But I hope that it's been illuminating for you.

627
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,700
 Watch out, Darth Iskiro.

628
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,660
 It might be too illuminating for your dark, crusted eyes.

629
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,060
 We're gonna save the time loop story for tomorrow.

630
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,860
 Like, damn it, Jason, I was waiting for that one.

631
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,140
 But I do have one more story for you.

632
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,460
 This one, it terrifies me.

633
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,980
 It absolutely terrifies me.

634
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,340
 Your mileage may vary.

635
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,980
 I imagine a bunch of people are gonna be like,

636
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,060
 "That's not scary."

637
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,960
 Sufi, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

638
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,800
 of the carbon helicopter.

639
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,760
 We're leaving behind the Death Star.

640
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,600
 We blew it up.

641
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,400
 The good guys won, as they often do,

642
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,920
 in fiction and in real life.

643
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,640
 Sorry to break into you, Sith Lords.

644
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,560
 We're leaving behind the destruction of the Death Star.

645
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,720
 We're headed all the way out to California.

646
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,640
 (imitates gunfire)

647
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,140
 We're in Sierra Sky Ranch in California.

648
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,440
 It's two in the morning.

649
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,400
 Three men are out camping in the area,

650
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
 and they're like, "You know what?

651
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
 "This camping thing's cool.

652
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,360
 "Sittin' around the fire, trading spooky stories,

653
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,080
 "roasting marshmallow jelly tastes.

654
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,000
 "Now, hold on, these guys are the H-12."

655
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,280
 They're all Sith Lords.

656
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,440
 They're out camping, and they go,

657
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,280
 "You know what?

658
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,440
 "This camping thing's pretty cool.

659
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,680
 "But let's also walk around."

660
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,320
 Their legs are all asleep.

661
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,600
 They're like, "Oh, we've been sittin'

662
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
 "christ cross apple style for two like."

663
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,480
 They're walking around Sierra Sky Ranch.

664
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
 It's two in the morning.

665
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 All of a sudden, they hear a strange rustling in the trees.

666
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,760
 (rustling)

667
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,260
 And then, an equally strange rustling from the bushes.

668
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,240
 (rustling)

669
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,760
 And you go, "Jason, you know, there's this thing

670
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,360
 "outside called the wind that can rustle trees."

671
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,440
 But remember, they said it was strange.

672
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
 They said it was a strange rustling sound.

673
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,840
 This wasn't what they had heard before.

674
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 And they see a man standing.

675
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,040
 (laughing)

676
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,640
 I think this is terrifying.

677
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,320
 This is one of my worst fears.

678
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,120
 They see a man standing there.

679
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,680
 You're like, "Jason, that was your worst fear."

680
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
 You can't even say it without laughing.

681
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,520
 Okay, it's spooky, but I know some of you guys will be like,

682
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,360
 "What?

683
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,840
 "There's a man standing there, but not just any man."

684
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,200
 He's a tree man.

685
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,040
 It's this dude who's 20 feet tall,

686
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,480
 and he's covered in bark.

687
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,720
 And he's slowly moving.

688
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,960
 (groaning)

689
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,920
 He's not making any noise.

690
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,640
 I'm trying to make it even scarier.

691
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,360
 He's covered in crows.

692
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,960
 There was a pumpkin, a jack-o'-lantern next to him.

693
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,480
 He's a 20-foot-tall man covered in bark.

694
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 Long limbs spread out with branches and leaves

695
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,480
 growing out of his tree skin.

696
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:46,640
 This type of story, that's a whole story.

697
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,920
 But I'm telling you right now, this terrifies me.

698
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,680
 I, my worst fear, I have two worst fears.

699
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,600
 Zombies, zombie takeover, not just like limited zombies.

700
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,360
 If there was just like some zombies walking around

701
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
 in the living room, I'd be like, "That's their problem."

702
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,400
 But like mass amount, more zombies in my city,

703
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,800
 that is my problem, but mass amount of zombies.

704
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,680
 Just zombies showing up, that doesn't scare me so much.

705
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,640
 It's the total breakdown of society

706
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,120
 and your fighting zombies.

707
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,520
 If society broke down, I think I'd be okay.

708
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,320
 And if zombies attacked, and society was still functioning,

709
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,400
 people were still going to work,

710
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,000
 I'm like, "I'm walking the best buy,

711
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,640
 "and buy a new computer, but then I see a zombie behind me."

712
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,480
 I'm like, "Ah!"

713
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,640
 Both of those are fine, but together,

714
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,720
 that's what scares me, ball of humanity

715
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,000
 and the rise of the zombies.

716
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,160
 And then turning, well, actually it's funny

717
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,240
 'cause I never really put this two and two together.

718
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,900
 Turning to my other greatest fears,

719
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,080
 turning into something against your will,

720
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,840
 which is really what a zombie is, right?

721
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,760
 A zombie story is you get bitten, you turn into a zombie.

722
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,360
 I find that terrifying to have the human consciousness

723
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,600
 locked into something else.

724
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
 Now, if I wanted to become a grasshopper,

725
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
 I'm totally down.

726
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,240
 Like if I could be like, "See you later, losers."

727
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,000
 Whoop, then I'm like hopping away.

728
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,320
 They just grab a nap and they catch me,

729
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,720
 I'm like, "Oh no, foiled again."

730
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,760
 If I could turn into it, I'd be fine.

731
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,400
 But like, you know, in the Greek mythology,

732
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,440
 wasn't, oh, Arachne, the story of the woman

733
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,240
 getting turned into the spider, terrified me.

734
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,560
 There's tons of stories like that.

735
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,760
 It happens every so often in horror movies.

736
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,880
 I remember the first time it happened

737
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
 was that Doctor Who special where a guy

738
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,800
 got turned into a statue, and that really scared me.

739
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,440
 So if people get turned into stuff

740
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,040
 against their will, it terrifies me.

741
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,120
 And I do believe that this is possible.

742
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,160
 I do believe that's possible.

743
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,600
 I believe that you can be cursed and turned into a tree.

744
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,440
 I do believe that.

745
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,560
 I do believe that there are curses out there

746
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,440
 or places on earth.

747
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,640
 Yeah, in Twin Peaks, when Josie got turned

748
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,840
 into a doorknob, that terrified me.

749
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,880
 Like, to me, that's a fate worse than death.

750
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
 If someone said, "We're gonna shoot you in the head,"

751
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,240
 it's not like I would lean against the barrel

752
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,360
 and go, "Try it, sucker."

753
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,640
 Like I would try to avoid dying.

754
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,280
 If someone says, "We're gonna torture you

755
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,440
 "and then kill you," I would not, again,

756
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,000
 jump towards the chainsaw.

757
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,920
 I would try to survive.

758
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,360
 But if someone says, "We're gonna lock your consciousness

759
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,000
 "inside this inhuman object."

760
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,640
 If I ever get caught by some shadowy agency

761
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,680
 working for some unnamed government,

762
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,240
 and they go, "We can either kill you,

763
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,400
 "we can torture and kill you,

764
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,360
 "or we can take your soul and put it in this amulet,"

765
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,000
 I would be like, "How long is the torture?

766
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 "And how bad is it?"

767
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,960
 And I'd probably still take that

768
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,640
 rather than have my soul locked into an amulet.

769
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,680
 Because then, I mean, at least I know

770
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,960
 if my arms are getting chopped off,

771
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,280
 I'm like, "Well, I won't be using those anytime soon,

772
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,440
 "but they're gonna kill me after this,

773
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,600
 "so I mean, it sucks and all."

774
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,440
 Whatever.

775
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,840
 But if I was trapped in an amulet for eternity,

776
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,080
 like I'm in this amulet and I'm like,

777
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,640
 "No, no, my soul, if you hold it under the right light,

778
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,600
 "you're basically telling me

779
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,920
 "you're ready to be coming to Goosebumps novel.

780
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,680
 "Imagine if you held up a gem.

781
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,360
 "Imagine if I stopped doing the podcast."

782
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,520
 All of a sudden.

783
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,400
 And it's because I constantly made references

784
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,040
 to President Speed assassinated in the earlier segment.

785
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,120
 It's not that the feds shut me down.

786
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,760
 The podcast just stops happening

787
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,640
 and everything eventually just goes away.

788
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,960
 The hosting stops getting made

789
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,280
 for YouTube channel gets taken down.

790
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,800
 I become a medallion.

791
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,400
 My soul's trapped in a medallion.

792
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,960
 And if you look at it under the right light,

793
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,520
 you can see me going, "No, no, let me out, let me out."

794
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,760
 And some guy, like some wizard,

795
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,120
 some wizard in a giant stone castle has me around his neck.

796
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
 And he's like, "Oh man, this guy's constantly saying,

797
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,720
 "let me out, let me out."

798
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,760
 I didn't think about that.

799
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,040
 I should have made his mouth disappear

800
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,800
 and then put him in the amulet.

801
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,640
 And then he takes him to the goodwill

802
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,120
 of the local wizard walking in his giant robe.

803
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,800
 And he's like, "I don't want this amulet anymore."

804
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
 And now I'm in a goodwill.

805
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,760
 And I'm like, "No, no, let me out, let me out."

806
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
 Like, I know it sounds like I'm joking.

807
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,400
 This is honestly incredibly terrifying for me.

808
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,920
 As much as I'm laughing,

809
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,280
 this would be the worst thing for me.

810
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,960
 To be trapped in a medallion

811
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,560
 or to have a human consciousness trapped in a tree.

812
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,160
 I don't mind reincarnation

813
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,480
 as long as I'm reincarnating another human.

814
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,880
 If you told me there was a chance that when I died,

815
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,360
 I could become a stick or I could become a beaver

816
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,560
 or I could become a rock.

817
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,200
 I would do whatever it took to not never die.

818
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,920
 I would have the healthiest diet ever

819
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,600
 if I thought that there was a chance that when I died,

820
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,920
 my human, if I'm a rock

821
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,440
 and I don't remember being a human, I'm totally fine.

822
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
 But if I have a human consciousness

823
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,840
 and I'm trapped in a rock or I'm a rock

824
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,520
 and I'm like, "Oh no, dude, I remember it used to be human."

825
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,920
 And rocks last a long time.

826
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,600
 I'd be trying to roll into the river.

827
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
 I'm like trying to make birds peck me.

828
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,280
 I'm like disguising myself as ham

829
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,600
 so animals will chew me up.

830
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,880
 That terrifies me more than anything.

831
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,320
 So the idea that this dude could actually have been a tree

832
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,560
 or this tree could have actually been a dude,

833
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,120
 that's scary to me.

834
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,680
 That's one of my worst fears.

835
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,760
 And whenever I come across stories like this,

836
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,120
 I just completely pause.

837
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,240
 I completely pause as short as they are.

838
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,920
 I got this from thinkaboutadux.com

839
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,560
 which is one of my favorite resources for this website.

840
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,960
 Always like to give them a shout out.

841
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,120
 They got it from the Western Bigfoot Society newsletter,

842
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,680
 which is another really good resource.

843
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,240
 But yeah, I do believe it's possible

844
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,880
 out of all the stuff we talk about.

845
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,240
 And I do believe aliens exist.

846
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,120
 I do believe ghosts exist and demons exist

847
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,960
 and stuff like that.

848
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,720
 I won't say that, I think most of it's fake.

849
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,480
 I think most of the stories we cover on the show are real.

850
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,200
 That's why I cover them.

851
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,440
 But out of all of them,

852
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,600
 this type of story is the scariest to me.

853
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,160
 Turning into something against your will.

854
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,160
 What did this guy do that led him to become this thing?

855
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,720
 I don't think it was willingly.

856
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,560
 I don't think anyone's like,

857
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,640
 you know what, I'm kind of bored today.

858
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,240
 I want to be a 20 foot tall immobile object.

859
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,800
 And the fact that he was moving

860
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,520
 and that strange wrestling to me makes it seem like

861
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,840
 he was in the last days of him being mobile.

862
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,960
 Soon his feet would grow thick roots into the ground

863
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,120
 and he would be frozen in place.

864
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,440
 And he would watch the rest of humanity go by

865
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,320
 as he stuck in this tree.

866
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,320
 Over time, the limbs would start to look like branches.

867
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,160
 And the face would slowly get covered up by bark

868
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,340
 as the rings grew larger.

869
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,440
 The human inside of the used to be able to look out with

870
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,800
 eyes at a world he can never be a part of

871
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,800
 is now suffocating as the rings continue to grow.

872
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,200
 Suffocating but not dying.

873
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,760
 His human face, his original human body is now encased

874
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,400
 in a hundred years of tree growth.

875
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,600
 Silently screaming, blind to the world, stuck in place.

876
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,920
 His only hope is that someday he will feel

877
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,040
 the flicker of a wildfire begin to burn at him.

878
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,880
 Or Lumberjack's chainsaw shred into his body.

879
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,280
