00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 When a young man takes his dog for a walk through the forest, he thinks it's just going to be another great way to start the day.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 But when he hears a voice calling out from behind the trees, he realizes that this day will be anything but ordinary.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 And then we're going to meet two resident care workers, two young women who spend their nights taking care of those who cannot take care of themselves.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But when a mysterious event strikes the home that they're working in, we are forced to ask the question, are aliens from another world targeting the disabled?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenterner, I'm having a great day.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We're getting ready for spooky month central October.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Will I do anything different? I always go eat this year, I want to review a movie each episode or this year is going to be a ghost.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 This show is so hard to do, this show is so hard to put together. It's so hard planning anything, but I'd love to do spooktobular spectacular something like...

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Hopefully something I can pronounce. We'll figure it out.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But someone who never needs to figure stuff out, someone who always has all the life mysteries solved, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, Michael Knight.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Yeah, woohoo, come on in, come on in, Michael Knight walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Michael, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode, if you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it, I do.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Just help spread the word about this show that really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You can even help us, right now a big thing we're trying to do is to fill out the Dead Rabbit Radio wiki that Germ started.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Thanks for that Germ, so get the word out about the show, help us with the Wikipedia page, or support the Patreon, all of that stuff totally helps.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Michael Knight, he's walking in with his cool sunglasses.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jollopy. We're trading in Kit the Talking Car for this hunk of junk, for this hunk of junk, this jitty jitty bang bang car.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Michael, we're leaving Dead Rabbit Command Drive us all the way out to a forest.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Bang bang!

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We're headed back to September 12th, 2022. That's very, very recent story, right? What is that, just a couple weeks ago?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I found this story posted online, we don't have a location of it, it's just a small, I imagine it's an area like so many areas are.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 You have suburban housing and then you have a nearby green belt, a nearby forest that has been untouched by the developers so far.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 We're about to meet a guy, we don't have his real name, we're gonna call him Charles.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And Charles has this routine. Before he goes to work, he likes to take his dog, we're gonna call the dog Rufus, he likes to take his dog on a nice little walk, right?

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 That's actually Charles' painting, the dog's quite silent. He takes his dog for a walk around 5.45 in the morning so he can get it done, he can get it out of the way so he can go to work.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 He gets the exercise for the puppy and then you gotta go do your own thing. He's a professional dog walker, he thinks his dog's super nerdy.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 He's like, "The dogs I walk are cool, Rufus, you're not cool enough to hang out with them so I walk you all alone through the forest."

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 He says, you know, for the past few months it's been nice 'cause the sun's been up at 5.45 and he would take his dog on this walk, they would take him down a trail through this nearby wooded area.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But recently it's been getting darker, right? Everything's kind of changing.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So at 5.45, even though it's always been the same time, it's just a little darker outside than he's used to, that he's comfortable with.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Now like he said, Charles likes to take the dog for a walk before he goes to work so he can get the energy.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 The dogs need walking, right? It's a good time to do it.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 He gets him up moving, gets some energy burnt out on the dog, they're going for this little jaunt through the woods.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 The reason why he specifically chose the woods is because Charles also likes to get stoned before work.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So hopefully he doesn't do anything more serious than a professional dog walker.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 He's like, smoking a weed, he's like, "Oh, now it's time to go to my job, professional construction worker."

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 He likes to get stoned before work and he does it in the woods so nobody can see him.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So he's walking, when now it sounds a little less altruistic that he's taking his dog for a walk.

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 The dog's mostly just a cover story. If he gets caught, he's like, "What? No!"

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 The dog was smoking the joint. It wasn't me, I swear, officer.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 He takes his dog on a walk through the forest.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Yeah, that's the good stuff. Mmm, yummy, yummy, yummy.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 We love it all. He's super loud. He comes to the least complimenting how strong his weed is.

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 He's like, "Charles, we can hear you. You're not being discreet at all.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 You're making orgasmic moaning sounds and you're naming the brand of your weed. Ah, yes, Cherryberry.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 The best. He's smoking this weed in the middle of the forest walking his dog."

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Now, to say, I'm making him turn out to be a huge stoner.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 I have to say, if you're waking up, the first thing you're doing is smoking weed.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 That's the definition of a stoner. But he says he just smoked a little, right?

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Which is obviously like a little to me would be like a puff.

53
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 There we go. That's the good stuff.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But to a professional stoner, they're like, "Why don't we smoke three joints this morning?"

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 That's barely getting me high. So we don't know what it means when he said he smoked a little bit.

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 But he smoked some weed, smoked some Mary Jane, and then he continues on his walk.

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And he's getting ready to exit the woods when from behind the nearby tree, he hears a voice.

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 "Hey, Rufus. Come here, buddy."

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Charles kind of stops when he hears this, right? He looks over.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He can't see anything with the trees, right? He doesn't see anyone.

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But he clearly heard someone say, "Hey, Rufus. Come here, buddy."

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And then the sound of someone tapping their knee like you would when you were calling over a dog.

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 "Hey, Rufus. Come here, buddy."

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Now he's stoned, right? I mean, according to me, he probably just smoked a little.

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 But you know what? He's inebriated on some sort of drug. It's psychoactive.

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And you could just write it off, right? Hallucination. He's smoking weed in the forest at 545.

67
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It's getting darker. He's not comfortable in the dark. He's definitely a little more paranoid.

68
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 What's interesting is he noticed when he heard it, he looked over and he wasn't for sure that he heard it.

69
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But he noticed that Rufus was also now looking in this direction.

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Like, they both turned and they were looking from where the sound came from.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 So now he realized, it's not just the hallucination. My dog's looking over there as well.

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And I heard someone say, "Hey, Rufus. Come here, buddy."

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I just couldn't believe that that would be coming from there.

74
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But when my dog turned and looked at the same time I did, like, what could that possibly be?

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And then as he's staring out into the trees, trying to figure out what could possibly be going on,

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 he hears, "Come here, Rufus. Come on, boy. Come here."

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Charles is standing there, peering into the darkened trees.

78
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Can't see anything.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But what he realized was the energy was kind of changing, and the sense that Rufus, who originally turned and looked when it heard the voice,

80
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 is now not in a curious mood.

81
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It's not tugging at the leash. It's not trying to check out what's over there. It's not angry.

82
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's not trying to figure out what's over there.

83
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Rufus is in a protective state, as Charles described it.

84
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Rufus senses danger and wants to protect the leader of his tribe.

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Rufus wants to get out of there.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And so Charles puts on his headphones and hurries out of the woods.

87
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Now, they were almost out, right? He was getting ready to exit the walk.

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So it's just a short walk for him to end it. But they do get out of the tree line and they hurry home.

89
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's an interesting story. This is one of those stories where it could totally be made up.

90
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I've been fooled before this stuff happens.

91
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 It's interesting, though, the element of them putting in the headphones, which sounds counterintuitive, right?

92
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 You spoke before as someone's calling your dog.

93
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 You think you might be in some sort of danger or you put in headphones to walk away.

94
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 That is this element that makes the story really believable.

95
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Because people do stuff like that. When they're in a threatening situation, they will block off their senses.

96
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's the same thing when you're in a room and you think there's a monster in the room and you close your eyes.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Or you cover yourself with your blanket. And you're like, Jason, that's what eight-year-olds do. It's a human thing.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It really is a human thing. If I close my eyes, it'll go away.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 If I stop listening for the voice, I won't be able to hear it.

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Now, I think a rational thing would be to have my ears working in case someone's up running up behind me.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But Charles goes, "I don't want to hear anything, so I'm going to plug my ears and we're going to get out of there."

102
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 That's a really interesting little tidbit that makes me think the story's authentic.

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And again, when you read it, when you're looking at it, when he's getting stoned and hearing voices,

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I would have totally just written the story off. It's interesting, but I would have written it off and go, "Well, he's stoned."

105
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 So, of course, he's hearing stuff.

106
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But the idea that his dog was reacting to it as well is what makes me think there could be something there.

107
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 And then what would it be? How did this thing know his dog's name?

108
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Because obviously there's two options. One, it's a real human who was trying to lure.

109
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 There's that word again. I had to use that word a couple times earlier on the podcast.

110
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 There's the possibility that it was a real person trying...

111
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 There's the possibility that there was a real person trying to lure Charles into the woods for some sort of nefarious reason.

112
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And then there's the other possibility that it was some sort of creature or cryptid or spirit or ghost,

113
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 also trying to bring him into the woods for some sort of nefarious reason,

114
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 because they want to hold a birthday party for you, right? It's always some sort of horrible thing.

115
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 But what was it? What could it have been? It's funny, I'm going to segue to another story here real quick.

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 It's related... Michael Knight, let's go ahead and actually drive your car. The Knight Rider.

117
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Was that the name of the car? It was Kit. Drive us out all the way to somewhere in Oregon.

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I heard this story a while back from my good friends, Sabine, who she doesn't believe.

119
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 She is one of those hippie-dippy girls that is all spiritual, she does all that goofy stuff.

120
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 She also is super pragmatic, right? We'll be watching a movie. We saw The Northman, which was all about Norse mythology.

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Odin is a character in it, and there's constantly this magic being performed, these weird miracles.

122
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And I saw it as a paranormal movie, and she saw it as like, "Oh no, those were a bunch of coincidences."

123
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Like, none of that was paranormal. When that woman was tied up with another man's intestines, that was just somebody did that.

124
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It wasn't some sort of paranormal act, and I was like, "What?" She's super pragmatic.

125
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 She's the type of person that could watch a teacup...

126
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 She's the type of person who could witness a teacup floating across the room, and 100% believe there was a valid answer for that, even if you ruled out every possible valid answer.

127
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 It's weird to be f-

1699
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 perpetrated the night these young women lost seven hours.

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And while that thought is terrifying,

1701
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 we have to ask the question,

1702
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 how many times did they visit that care home?

1703
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Are they still visiting it now?

1704
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Are they doing this in such locations all over the world?

1705
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Attacking those who are the most helpless, attacking those who cannot cry out for help.
