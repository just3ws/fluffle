1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 A man is simply hoping to be castrated.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,120
 That's all he wanted, but instead he ended up in a house of horrors.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,440
 Who could have thought that story was going to happen?

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,080
 Then we take a look at a band-sheen ritual that will keep you busy all afternoon.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,000
 And finally we travel to New York City as we follow a trail of mysterious yellow notes

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
 strewn about the city.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,440
 Is it possible that one man has all the clues to prove the ultimate conspiracy today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 [Music]

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,600
 I'm your host Jason Carviner. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,120
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,320
 I gotta say this man, I'm really behind on sending out my Patreon stickers.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,080
 I'm gonna be doing that this... I'm gonna be... I'll do it tomorrow.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,640
 100% I got a ton of Patreon stickers I gotta send out.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,320
 I really apologize for being behind on that.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,760
 But what I'm not behind on is welcoming our newest Patreon.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,240
 He's like, "Dude, you just told me you don't send stuff out."

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,480
 Adam Carter, we shish him and then we clap for Adam Carter.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,080
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,400
 Adam, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,720
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,160
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,080
 I said on yesterday's episode, I feel bad about the Patreon support for this episode.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,080
 So here we go. Let's get the ball rolling here.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
 Adam, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
 We are going to fly out to Patu, Oklahoma.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,640
 And as we're flying out there around the same time,

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,240
 so the story starts in October of 2020.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
 Very, very recent story.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
 There's a man who is unnamed. We'll call him Travis, just the guess.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,280
 Travis is sitting at his home in Virginia and he's sitting there and he goes,

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
 "You know what? Life is pretty good. I'm having a lot of fun."

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,000
 "I enjoy windsurfing. I don't know, making that up.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,720
 I enjoy training card games. I love Magic the Gathering."

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,320
 But you know what? I'm not a huge fan of... or my balls.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,800
 My tights. I'm not talking about basketballs in the corner.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
 He's like, "I really should start selling off my ball collection."

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
 "He wanted to get his testicles removed."

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,160
 Now listen, you want to get your...

40
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,640
 A lot of people don't have testicles.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
 First off, a ton of people don't have testicles,

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,160
 but a lot of guys don't have testicles.

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,280
 They got blown up and shot or punched a bunch or they just decided,

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
 "I don't want testicles anymore."

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
 That's fine. I mean, hopefully you don't get blown up.

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,000
 You're like, "Oh, Jason said this was good. I'm going to sit on this pump."

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
 But you know what I mean? If you don't want testicles, that's fine.

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,280
 I'm not to judge you.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
 However, you have to say this.

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,880
 If you want them removed, don't go online and search for the Unicmaker and the EM crew,

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,000
 which sounds like the worst rap group ever.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
 But the Unicmaker and the EM crew,

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,720
 which I'm assuming EM stands for Unicmaker and not Emergency Medical Crew,

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,560
 the Unicmaker has this website where you can share stories about getting your testicles removed.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
 I don't know what the story is.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
 Basically, just be Adam removed.

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,320
 I talked about this on another episode.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,400
 I feel so bad for Adam.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,920
 Sorry, Adam. He's sitting in the car and he's like, "This is an happening. This is an happening."

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
 I talked because it's going to get way grosser from here.

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
 We haven't even scraped the icing off this thing.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,360
 I didn't have a long time ago about people being castrated.

63
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
 And I thought that's such a weird fetish to have because you can only do it one time.

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
 Right? Right? They don't grow back, I'm assuming.

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,840
 That's what's weird about it.

66
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
 Like, I guess you would imagine it.

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
 You would fantasize about it up to the point of them being removed.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
 And then after that, you just look and you go, "All right."

69
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
 Because this isn't a sex change operation.

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 It's not gender reassignment and nothing like that.

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,440
 You're still a dude, but you just don't have any balls.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,880
 And so, again, whatever.

73
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,280
 But you go to a licensed doctor, find someone who will take care of it.

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,240
 But don't go to the Unic Makers website.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,520
 Travis finds the Unic Makers website and gets a hold of these two guys in Oklahoma.

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,120
 So we've been waiting here this whole time in Potu, Oklahoma.

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
 It's October 12th, 2020.

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,760
 And Travis is driven out to this location in the middle of nowhere.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,000
 This is the home of Bob Lee Allen.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
 He's 53 years old.

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,880
 And his husband, Thomas Evan Gates, who's 42 years old.

82
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,800
 Travis goes out here and they said, "Listen, we will castrate you for free,

83
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,280
 but we want to videotape it."

84
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,320
 That should be your first sign something is wrong that they're going to videotape it.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
 But technically, the first sign should be that they drove you out to the middle of nowhere.

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
 I don't think he was like, "What? I expected a five-star medical suite."

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
 I'm sure he knew what he was getting into.

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
 But anyways, he's in this cabin in the middle of nowhere.

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,960
 They go, "We'll do it for free. We want to videotape you."

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, that's fine, I guess."

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
 And then the procedure starts.

92
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
 So, four at him, four at him.

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
 What they do is they do remove his testicles.

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,760
 That part of it is successful.

95
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,440
 But he's not put under for it.

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,400
 He's given local anesthetic, so it doesn't feel anything down there.

97
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,080
 But he's wide awake during this.

98
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
 Maybe that's part of the fetish.

99
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,240
 I don't know.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
 I'm not going to research it.

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,480
 But anyways, they snip his balls.

102
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,520
 They're done.

103
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,160
 Now, he is like strapped down to this table.

104
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,920
 So, because even though you're like a willing participant,

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,520
 I think you would probably, you know, like start moving.

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
 I would assume you would start moving,

107
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,200
 even if you were willing participant.

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,640
 So, he's strapped down.

109
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,280
 I'm assuming.

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,760
 It doesn't say so, actually, in any of the articles.

111
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,640
 But I'm assuming for the events that transpire.

112
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,840
 He's laying there and they're putting gauze down there.

113
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,640
 And Bob says, "Oh, you know, videotaping, it's just part of the plan.

114
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,720
 That's just part of what we're doing."

115
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,280
 He's like, "What?

116
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
 How can this get even any weirder?"

117
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,520
 That's when Bob tells Travis that him and Thomas like to eat the testicles of the men

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
 that he's castrated.

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
 He goes, "You're not the first, son.

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
 I've been doing this a long time.

121
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
 I actually got six more customers on the way."

122
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
 He said, I don't know if he actually said that.

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
 That wasn't in the article.

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,200
 They're like, he quote, went, "Mmm, mm, mm, rubbed his tummy."

125
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,200
 But anyway, so he takes this guy's balls.

126
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,120
 Which again, is a terrible dietary.

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,520
 I mean, don't eat it for the nutrients.

128
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
 I mean, obviously it's some gross sex thing.

129
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,120
 But think about it, like when you kill a bear, you get a bunch of bear meat.

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
 When you kill a cow, you get a bunch of cow meat.

131
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
 But if you only eat testicles, I don't think that's the only thing he eats.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,680
 I don't think he's like, "Oh man, I'm starving.

133
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,760
 I better get some weirdos down here."

134
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,040
 The point is, is that he says I'm gonna eat your balls.

135
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,760
 After the fact, by the way, he did not sit on the website.

136
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,960
 None of that was in the advertising.

137
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
 He's like, "No, I wanted to take those out."

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
 And then he said, "This is why I think the guy's strapped down."

139
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,320
 Because at this point, the guy is totally like putting the balls in a bag,

140
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,080
 throwing them in the freezer.

141
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,320
 And he goes, "I'm gonna tell you a story too here,

142
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,760
 because I don't want you getting too crazy."

143
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,680
 "Well, you know this, I run a professional operation here, Travis."

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,800
 He goes, "Once I had a guy that I did this procedure on, and he got crazy.

145
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
 So I just left him on this table and let him bleed out.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
 He's dead now."

147
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,520
 So Travis is like, "Okay, this is definitely taking a turn for the worse."

148
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
 So I think, again, if he wasn't strapped down, he'd be like,

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
 "Good day to you, sir, and just leave."

150
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
 Grab a bunch of gauze on the way out.

151
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,120
 But he doesn't leave.

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,040
 He's actually there all night long.

153
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,680
 And when he wakes up the next morning, he's heavily bleeding from his groin.

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,240
 So he's begging Bob and Thomas to take him to the hospital.

155
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
 Bob is adamant, "I'm not taking you to the hospital.

156
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
 You're just gonna stop bleeding.

157
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,360
 It's only been 12 hours.

158
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
 Give it another 12.

159
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,200
 See how you're doing."

160
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,360
 Finally, after a lot of pleading, Bob relents, throws Travis in the van,

161
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,720
 and begins driving to the hospital.

162
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,960
 But Bob turns around while he's driving.

163
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,760
 That's not safe.

164
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,280
 Everything else he did up to this was, "A, okay, but this part's not safe."

165
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
 He's driving on the road and he turns around.

166
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,320
 He's not looking where he's driving.

167
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,040
 And he says, "If you fall asleep or pass out while we're driving to the hospital,

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
 I'm just going to carry you in the woods and dump your body.

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,920
 So stay awake."

170
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,080
 That would keep you awake, right?

171
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,600
 You're like, "Okay, I don't need any caffeine.

172
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,320
 I'm fine."

173
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,480
 Secondly, he said, "When you get to the hospital,

174
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,080
 tell them you did this yourself."

175
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,920
 "Tell them you did this yourself."

176
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,520
 And he's like, "Okay, that's going to be kind of hard.

177
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,320
 Because this is very difficult.

178
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,720
 I came to you because I couldn't do it myself."

179
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,560
 But anyways, he dropped him off the hospital.

180
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,280
 He goes in.

181
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
 The doctors start taking care of him.

182
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,240
 Travis is still a lie.

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,920
 But while Travis was in the hospital, guess who visits him?

184
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,880
 Bob and Thomas.

185
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,000
 They walk into the hospital.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,480
 They go up and they visit Travis.

187
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,960
 And I don't know if they talked to him about it in the hospital room

188
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
 or talked about it to him before.

189
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,480
 The articles made it sound like they talked about it in the hospital itself.

190
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,120
 So I'm going to go with that narrative.

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,840
 Plus that makes this even more insane.

192
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,640
 They go to the hospital.

193
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,520
 They visit poor Travis and they say, "Hey, how you doing, man?"

194
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,360
 "I was really worried about you.

195
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
 I threatened to let you die multiple times."

196
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,960
 Then Bob goes, "Tell you what, even such a good sport,

197
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,800
 you haven't ratted us out to the police.

198
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
 You know, I told you I was going to eat your testicles.

199
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,360
 You know, I said that when you saw Thomas super low.

200
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
 There's a nurse in the room folding blankets.

201
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,920
 She's like, "What'd you say?"

202
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
 "Remember how I said I was going to do that?

203
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
 Tell you what, man.

204
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
 Tell you what, man.

205
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
 Tell you what.

206
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
 You got two testicles.

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,840
 I'll let you eat one of your own testicles."

208
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,320
 How's that?

209
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,720
 How do you feel about all the events that have transpired?

210
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
 I'm willing to split testicles with you.

211
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,600
 So Bob and Thomas were shortly arrested after the hospital visit.

212
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,840
 And what it seems like is either he didn't know who they were

213
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
 and when they visited the hospitals.

214
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
 I don't know if security tackled him.

215
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
 They tackle him, much of balls are rolling on the floor.

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
 They go to tackle him.

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
 The Bob's throwing balls on the ground.

218
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
 The security guard's just living on him.

219
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,320
 Whoa, whoa.

220
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
 Throwing him.

221
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
 He is a slingshot.

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
 He's like, "Take that, Coppa."

223
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,480
 Right in their face like a egg's breaking open.

224
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,400
 Anyways, how do you take down a man whose weapon is unlimited testicles?

225
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,680
 When the cops did go to his house,

226
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
 they did find balls in his freezer.

227
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,960
 They also found other unnamed body parts.

228
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,760
 The police have not announced what else they found in the freezer.

229
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,400
 So it may be a murder investigation right now.

230
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,880
 See, this story is kind of stopped.

231
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360
 It's kind of frozen, no pun intended, in motion.

232
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,960
 It's not really a pun.

233
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
 I just started running a freezer earlier.

234
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,200
 We don't know really much else about this story.

235
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,840
 So we'll keep you updated if you guys want to know.

236
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,320
 We're going to have a testicle Tuesdays,

237
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
 where every Tuesday I'll update you to the story

238
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,280
 like, "Oh, I'll just stop listening on Tuesday."

239
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,560
 Sounds like a deal, Jason.

240
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
 Adam, let's go ahead and hop in that Jason Jalopy.

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
 We are leaving behind Poe to Oklahoma.

242
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,840
 We are headed out to your bedroom.

243
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,240
 Adam's like, "What in the heck? My bedroom's super messy.

244
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,960
 I didn't plan for this."

245
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,560
 We're all sitting in Adam's bedroom.

246
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,600
 It can be anyone's bedroom.

247
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
 It could even be your bedroom.

248
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
 It doesn't matter where we feel most comfortable, you're there.

249
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
 Yesterday, I needed a story about monsters in the closet.

250
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,760
 Now, there was some stuff I had to cut for time,

251
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,520
 but I did want to include this.

252
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,160
 I probably should have included it yesterday

253
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
 because it's a banishing ritual.

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,080
 It's to keep monsters from getting you in your house.

255
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,000
 You're like, "Yes, Jason, you should have included it."

256
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
 Yesterday, I've been attacked several times by demons since.

257
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
 So here we go.

258
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,760
 We're sitting in your bedroom.

259
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,800
 When I was looking at that website, Magic for the Real World,

260
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,840
 it has a comment section,

261
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,080
 which I love comment sections for this type of stuff

262
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,440
 because you can have borderline weirdness in the article,

263
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
 and then the weirdest dudes in the universe

264
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,560
 show up there manifested into the comments of these places.

265
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,640
 So here we have on this article that I talked about yesterday,

266
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
 Magic for the Real World.

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,800
 We talked about transitional spaces.

268
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
 We have someone appear out of the transitional space.

269
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,720
 It's the commenter known as Shadow Speaker.

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
 So they're just set at the level of edge

271
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,960
 that we're going to be looking at in this comment.

272
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
 Shadow Speaker's sitting there and he shuts off his panic.

273
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,280
 I have the disco album and he turns to us and he goes,

274
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,280
 "You know what, guys? I love transitional spaces."

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,840
 When I was a kid growing up, I always loved walking in and out of rooms.

276
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,760
 People didn't want me in the same room with them,

277
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,040
 so I got really used to it.

278
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
 I see you guys are scared of these places.

279
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
 I love them, man.

280
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,440
 I used to love being under my bed.

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,920
 We're kind of looking at each other.

282
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,520
 What are you talking about?

283
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,400
 He's like, "Come on, man. It's not spooky down there."

284
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,120
 And he then goes on to explain that he is not just Shadow Speaker.

285
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
 And Shadow Speaker isn't just the name.

286
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,680
 Oh, no, no, no.

287
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,160
 He's more than us mere Homo sapiens.

288
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 The God of Darkness is inhabiting his body.

289
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,480
 You better take him seriously.

290
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,840
 You don't get a name like Shadow Speaker just because it sounds cool.

291
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,320
 Right?

292
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,200
 You know, he earned that name when the God of Darkness crept into his body.

293
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,960
 It's crawling through the darkness.

294
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,000
 It's crawling through his skin.

295
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
 Lincoln Park's playing really loud in his ears.

296
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,640
 Ah.

297
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,320
 It finally, the God of Darkness, says,

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,200
 "Oh, they don't like you.

299
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
 They make you walk from room to room.

300
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
 Your feet are sore."

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
 "But I like you. Yes, I do.

302
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,080
 I'm the God of Darkness."

303
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,960
 Yes.

304
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
 Shadow Speaker.

305
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,480
 So apparently this guy, this guy who's commenting on a website,

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,640
 commenting on a WordPress website is actually part deity.

307
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,280
 That's pretty good.

308
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,040
 You think he'd have better things to do with his time,

309
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,640
 you know, like take over all the reality.

310
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,600
 But he also says, "I have the God of Darkness in me,

311
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
 totally unironically."

312
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
 He just goes on with his sentence.

313
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,280
 He makes that claim.

314
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
 But he's here to share with us a banishing ritual.

315
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,200
 I bet you guys didn't know that.

316
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
 The God of Darkness wants to help us banish darkness.

317
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,960
 It's a wacky world out there.

318
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
 2020 has been a mess.

319
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,800
 Here you go.

320
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,920
 Take a pen and paper.

321
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,280
 Get ready to write this stuff down,

322
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,400
 unless you're driving in the car.

323
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,560
 And just play this back when you get home.

324
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,880
 Here's a foolproof way to protect your room.

325
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,520
 First off, you draw an algaise.

326
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,880
 So I looked that up.

327
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,400
 That's the Y, the letter Y with a head with a little line.

328
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
 Look, this is how I'm going to start drawing this.

329
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,440
 How much a demon show up.

330
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,960
 You get an ancient sigil.

331
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,880
 It's a letter Y with a line at the top.

332
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
 So it looks like a man sticking his hands up.

333
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
 You have to draw one on each wall.

334
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
 That seems easy enough.

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,880
 Then you have to draw three on each door.

336
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,200
 You have to draw one on each window.

337
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,440
 One on each mirror frame.

338
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,320
 Mirror frame?

339
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,120
 One of the two.

340
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,400
 However you pronounce it.

341
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,920
 You have to draw one on the vents.

342
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,080
 So at this point, you're like,

343
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
 "Man, I hope I didn't even show up.

344
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,720
 My arms are getting tired."

345
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,800
 At least they could take me away from this muscle strain I have.

346
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
 You also, that's not, you're not done yet.

347
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
 Don't put down that chalk yet.

348
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
 You're not done yet.

349
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,760
 You also have to put it on any gateway in the room.

350
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
 Now my question is, you have to do it on any gateway.

351
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
 So that would be, I don't know, a mouse hole.

352
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,040
 You might want to call an exterminator about that,

353
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,200
 but like a little mouse hole, you do it on there.

354
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,040
 The drain in your bathroom?

355
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
 Because that's the spookiest place.

356
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
 Ghosts can come in and out of my bedroom all day long.

357
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
 I don't want them in my bathroom.

358
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,400
 You'd have to draw one on the, like all your pipes and stuff like that.

359
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,920
 And then aren't you a gateway?

360
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
 Like your mouth is a transitional space.

361
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,200
 I guess I'm being facetious.

362
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
 Now I'm like, "Your butthole is a transitional space,

363
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,240
 Shadow Speaker."

364
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,880
 But I think like anything could really be considered a gateway.

365
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,000
 But so the thing is, is that this is so,

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,440
 oh, you also got to start a fire.

367
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,240
 You got to get a, like, you can't just do that.

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,240
 You have to get a little bowl, a fireproof bowl if those exist.

369
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,480
 And put it on your floor and then burn a row in wood shaving.

370
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,040
 And then as you're sitting there, you pretend you imagine all of this.

371
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
 Not a big difference between the two words in this context.

372
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,520
 You make all the light fill your room up and you move your arms.

373
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,480
 And you're like imagining this light going all over your room, this healing light.

374
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
 So you got to do that too.

375
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,640
 Don't burn your house down while you're doing any of this.

376
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,840
 Or get affected for drawing a bunch of symbols everywhere.

377
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,600
 It's actually kind of interesting because it's fairly complex.

378
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,280
 And if it doesn't work, the onus is on the magic worker.

379
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,480
 This is one of those spells like you could write back to Shadow Speaker,

380
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,880
 who again, the deity of the eternal ebony knight,

381
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
 also has an AOL account.

382
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,760
 You can message him and be like, "Hey, I tried your thing and it didn't work."

383
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,320
 And they'll be like, "Was there a crack in your room?

384
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,200
 There's an ant?

385
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,640
 Is there a single ant moving around?

386
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,080
 That means there is another gateway."

387
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,080
 So basically if it doesn't work, then you didn't do it right.

388
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,360
 It's fairly complex to have to cover all entrances and exits.

389
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,920
 But he does say, this man who's an expert of leaving rooms does say, quote,

390
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,280
 "In this way, nothing can enter or leave without your permission."

391
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,920
 You wouldn't want to create a spell to trap something in there with you.

392
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,600
 So I don't know, Shadow Speaker, you're out there now, I'm sure you are.

393
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,880
 I'm sure you have a fulfilling job, a career, a family,

394
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
 and you've left the God of Darkness behind.

395
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
 But if you haven't, the God of Darkness is still inside of you.

396
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,800
 Let it out.

397
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
 Let it out, we know that the God of Darkness is just hanging out in your placement day.

398
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,000
 He's like, "Oh, this place looks kind of chill."

399
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,840
 He's trapped in the room and then underneath the blankets, Shadow Speaker arrives.

400
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,640
 He goes, "I've been waiting for you, God of Darkness.

401
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,480
 You belong to me now.

402
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,960
 God of Darkness had never felt fear like that before."

403
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,040
 As this young man devours him.

404
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
 And now he's trapped in the body of this man.

405
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,560
 The tides have turned.

406
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,400
 Oh, Lord of Darkness.

407
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,680
 But you probably deserved it with a name like that.

408
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,120
 You're probably super evil.

409
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,040
 Adam, go ahead and call in that carbonicopter.

410
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,240
 We are leaving behind your bedroom.

411
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,080
 Shadow Speaker's just hanging out there.

412
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,040
 I'll be waiting for you when this episode's over.

413
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,680
 You're like, "Please don't let this episode ever."

414
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,080
 And Adam, go ahead and call in that carbonicopter.

415
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,200
 We are leaving behind your house and we are headed out to New York City.

416
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,480
 [MAKING TUNE]

417
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,960
 So Adam lands us in the middle of Central Park.

418
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,240
 A bunch of birds are getting scared.

419
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,360
 We jump out of the carbonicopter.

420
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,160
 We get mugged.

421
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,200
 We fight the muggers.

422
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
 We win.

423
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 And we're continuing to walk through Central Park.

424
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
 We're fighting muggers the whole way.

425
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
 We're ranking up our experience levels.

426
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,880
 We finally get out of the park.

427
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
 We lost a couple of you guys.

428
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,600
 But the journey brought the rest of us closer together.

429
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,200
 Outside of Central Park, because this guy's too smart to be hanging out in there,

430
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,000
 we meet Lars Dutstein.

431
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,520
 He's simply holding a little yellow note in his hand.

432
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,320
 And he goes, "With his-- with his eyebrows cocked, took you long enough."

433
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,720
 Lars sent me this story the other day.

434
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,080
 He took a photo of all of these little yellow squares laying on the sidewalk.

435
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,320
 Lars said, "You know, I've seen these pop up before.

436
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,520
 I believe I saw them as early as 2016.

437
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,280
 But it had been a while since I seen them.

438
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,960
 Thought you might be interested in this."

439
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
 And he took a couple photos of these things.

440
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,840
 This note that he's holding starts off with the headline,

441
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
 "November 8th, 2020."

442
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,200
 CIA SS, the Nazi SS, not Secret Service, FBI, Kempetite,

443
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,360
 which I can almost for sure I'm pronouncing that wrong,

444
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,920
 was the Japanese version of the Gestapo.

445
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,240
 They ran Unit 731.

446
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,800
 But anyways, he's basically comparing--

447
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,360
 he's basically saying that CIA and the German SS and the FBI and that Japanese

448
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
 Gestapo unit are one and the same.

449
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
 That kind of goes to where his conspiracy's going.

450
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,280
 But in this little sheet of paper, it's probably about, I don't know, 5x5,

451
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,640
 he lays out a pretty intricate conspiracy theory.

452
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,440
 So here we go.

453
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,000
 1. Both Donald Trump and the left have been defrauded during this election.

454
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
 So neither side won.

455
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
 And he goes, remember Bernie Sanders was defrauded too.

456
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,200
 So he goes, don't think that the left is trying to defraud Trump.

457
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,640
 They've both been defrauded.

458
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,080
 They've both been defrauded by an organization so ingrained and American--

459
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,880
 no.

460
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
 In world society, that they can do whatever they want.

461
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,280
 3% of the population of the planet are actually spies.

462
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,520
 He goes on to say that most cops are good.

463
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,120
 However, 20% of all cops work for the deep state.

464
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,320
 And every single criminal organization on the planet works for the deep state.

465
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,000
 With this network, the spies know everything about you.

466
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,960
 Everything.

467
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,720
 Doesn't matter if you didn't post about it online.

468
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,600
 Doesn't matter if you did it alone in your house.

469
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,520
 Trapping the God of Darkness in your bedroom.

470
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,560
 They know about that.

471
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:14,720
 He says in this note, "The spies train from very young, framing and bullying other kids."

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,960
 It's funny when I read that part I go, I can almost guarantee you that he had a difficult

473
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,440
 childhood.

474
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,520
 Not necessarily, I don't know what his home life was like, but when I read that I thought,

475
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,320
 it will pop up later that he had a difficult childhood.

476
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,320
 Sure enough, he does state that since he was 15 years old, he's been an unwitting participant

477
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,040
 in what's known as lab rat experiments.

478
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,280
 He says he went to Congress 11 different times with evidence.

479
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,320
 He has thousands of hours of video proof.

480
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,000
 He says several times in this message that at any point he could be killed.

481
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,160
 They know how to make it look like an accident.

482
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,360
 He can be killed at any time.

483
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,640
 And at the very bottom of this slip of paper that was littering a New York street,

484
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,760
 placed there on purpose.

485
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,640
 There were several of them.

486
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
 It's not like this guy was running from the CIA and he was like, whoops,

487
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,680
 and he butterfingered all of his pamphlets.

488
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,000
 He puts them out on purpose.

489
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,040
 After talking about 3% of the world being spies, after talking about he might be killed

490
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,760
 in any moment.

491
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,880
 He leaves his address in his real name.

492
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
 Alexander D. Philippi.

493
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,720
 Alexander D. Philippi.

494
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,880
 Alexander is what we're going to call him.

495
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,000
 Anyways, so Lars had said that he thought this guy was operating as far back as 2016.

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
 I actually found an article on a website called the Bowery Boogie.

497
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,920
 It's, I believe it's like a New York Zee newsletter thing.

498
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,880
 They say that this guy's been doing it since 2012.

499
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
 He's been dropping these leaflets off.

500
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
 So now the hunt was on.

501
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,720
 I started to find out all of this stuff about him.

502
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,880
 He does have thousands of hours of video footage.

503
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,760
 He has a Twitter that he set up in 2014.

504
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,800
 Most of the videos are of a camera facing outside of his apartment or house or brownstone,

505
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,440
 whatever it is.

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
 There's a camera facing out at the street and the videos will be labeled.

507
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,000
 The mailman's at it again.

508
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,800
 Car playing loud music at three in the morning.

509
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
 Four people walking down the street.

510
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,120
 A lot of times he does this thing where he'll set his camera up and he goes,

511
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
 "Look what happened right after I set my camera up."

512
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
 So he'll set his camera up.

513
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,760
 There's a couple seconds of nothing and then all of a sudden like a bunch of people are walking

514
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,560
 down the street.

515
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,680
 So he's thinking that the camera is starting the play.

516
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,880
 I guess I should say this.

517
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,840
 I don't even think I need to.

518
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,760
 He obviously has a lot of elements of gang stalking in this.

519
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,480
 A lot of these things.

520
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,800
 Most of the people work for this organization.

521
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,480
 You can't trust law enforcement.

522
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
 You can't trust anybody.

523
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
 He's constantly videotaping this stuff.

524
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,680
 He's gone to Congress a couple of times with this apparently which would honestly be hilarious

525
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,240
 to watch the 10th time when security's like, "Ugh, not this guy again."

526
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
 He has, he started this in 2014.

527
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,880
 He's created 131,000 tweets.

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,240
 There's a video channel.

529
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,320
 He has a video channel set up on a site that I wasn't familiar with.

530
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,720
 He has one video that is simply six hours staring out of his window.

531
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
 This doesn't have lo-fi mixed into it.

532
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,800
 This is a camera staring out of his window onto the street below.

533
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,120
 That channel has 2,800 followers and 810,000 likes.

534
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,960
 This guy's huge.

535
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,000
 This guy is huge in the gang stalking community.

536
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,600
 His Twitter photo, people have weird Twitter photos, right?

537
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,280
 His Twitter photo is a man in full traction.

538
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
 It's a photo taken from a cell phone of a man in full traction.

539
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,800
 You can barely see his face.

540
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
 He basically looks like, you know, when Bugs Bunny gets hit by a car and then he's in the

541
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,080
 or when a real person unfortunately gets hit by a car.

542
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,920
 You know how like they're cast from head to toe.

543
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,120
 You can just see their eyes.

544
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,600
 That's a photo of his Twitter profile and I'm like, "What?

545
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,040
 Is that him?

546
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,440
 Is that just how he feels today?

547
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,520
 Is that, does he feel like he's trapped in a cast, like a rat in a cage?"

548
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,760
 His Facebook has the same man from a different angle.

549
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,680
 So it's either him, I'm assuming it's him, because it's in a hospital.

550
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
 It wasn't in Bob's barn from the first story.

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,040
 It's in a hospital.

552
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
 This photo is being taken.

553
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,480
 But I can't figure out, I mean the assumption would be that this is Alexander in full body cast.

554
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,040
 So, I mean, I'm assuming that's him.

555
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,600
 My question is why would that be the photo you would put?

556
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
 I mean, I guess multiple questions.

557
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,680
 I'm not like, "Oh, I totally believe everything else.

558
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
 3% of the world spies."

559
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,440
 But let me ask you about your photo choices.

560
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,040
 Like why is that him?

561
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,920
 I guess in a gang stalk, you know, most people want to put themselves,

562
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,600
 you got to put photos based on how you want the world to perceive you.

563
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
 If you're a jokester, you have a picture of you going, "Ugh!"

564
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,160
 Doing something funny.

565
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,880
 And then if you're like serious or a businessman,

566
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
 you want to take a photo of yourself doing something business related.

567
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,840
 In a business suit, shaking a hand with someone,

568
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,320
 you don't want a picture of a guy in a business suit going, "Ugh!"

569
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,640
 But I wonder if gang stalkers, if I was a part of this community,

570
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,280
 I would want to put myself out there as being like super tough,

571
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
 so the gang stalkers didn't mess with me.

572
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,440
 You know what I mean?

573
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
 Like you'd want to have a picture of you like holding a gun

574
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,240
 or lifting weights or lifting guns.

575
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,840
 But maybe in the gang stalking community,

576
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,160
 you want photos to show yourself as the victim.

577
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,040
 Because that's how you feel all the time.

578
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,840
 I just thought of that.

579
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,600
 I wonder if that's what was going on with this.

580
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
 So he could go, "Look, gang stalking world.

581
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,800
 Look at all you weirdos out there.

582
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,760
 This is what happened to me."

583
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,240
 This is his conspiracy in a nutshell,

584
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
 because I didn't want your research on it.

585
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,080
 I was looking through it.

586
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,760
 This is really it in a nutshell.

587
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,120
 And it's fairly compelling as far as like a Tom Clancy novel goes

588
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
 or Harry Turdledove novel goes.

589
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,280
 The Nazis did not lose World War II.

590
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
 Sure, the government was crushed.

591
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
 The military was crushed.

592
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
 And the land was taken over.

593
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,240
 But the Nazi regime simply had a plan B.

594
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,880
 If you can't beat them, join them.

595
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,560
 And they begin to form spy networks all over.

596
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,320
 Now I know about Project Paperclip.

597
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,760
 I know about Operation Werewolf.

598
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,480
 Project Paperclip is where the United States got a bunch

599
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 of Nazi scientists to work on a space program.

600
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,560
 Operation Werewolf was a plan that was discussed

601
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,720
 within the German government saying,

602
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
 "We're going to have eternal guerrilla warfare

603
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
 in the country of Germany."

604
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,160
 Like they may destroy the government,

605
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,480
 but behind every blade of grass will be a man with a gun.

606
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 And eventually the generals in Germany were like,

607
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,000
 "That is a terrible idea."

608
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,800
 The South wanted to do that too after the end of the Civil War.

609
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,880
 They wanted to have this long term guerrilla warfare.

610
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,200
 And the leaders are like, "Nah, we lost."

611
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,080
 Like, "Just kind of call it a day at a certain point."

612
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,800
 Because you would never be able to put down a nationwide

613
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,120
 insurrection like that every single day.

614
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
 Millions of people shooting each other.

615
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,600
 So they just called it.

616
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,200
 But anyway, so this, I know both of those are real actually.

617
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,760
 Those aren't even conspiracy theories, but this borders

618
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,080
 on conspiracy theory territory because it's not like they just

619
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,200
 go to NASA.

620
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
 They actually infiltrate every position of society.

621
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,640
 Politics, the media, entertainment industries,

622
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,600
 cults, secret societies, the press, terrorist groups,

623
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,400
 law enforcement, they're all infiltrated at some point by this fourth Reich.

624
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 They are the deep state is this guy's conspiracy theory.

625
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,640
 The deep state's not just people who've been working in government for 30 years

626
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,800
 and they're like, "I don't want anything to change."

627
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,440
 That's not what he's saying it is.

628
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,640
 That's what it is in real life.

629
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,640
 It's basically, you have people in there who are die hard political operatives,

630
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,160
 but you have a lot of people in there and be like,

631
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,960
 "I just want to work here long enough to get my pension."

632
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,440
 So if I got to do a bunch of illegal stuff, so stuff doesn't change too much in the

633
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,760
 government, that's a big component of what the deep state is.

634
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,120
 It's just lifelong bureaucrats who've been stamping papers for past 15 years and then

635
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,800
 they're like, "Uh, I just want to see all these changes come in government."

636
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,480
 And they're like, "Okay, I guess I'm in the deep state now because I want to get my pension."

637
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,440
 But his idea isn't that.

638
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,640
 It's that the actual Nazi regime has morphed into that.

639
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,040
 That's a compelling conspiracy theory.

640
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,120
 That was one that I actually went to the conspiracy theory iceberg on.

641
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,520
 I went to that list that Jack on Twitter made and I couldn't find it.

642
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,720
 This conspiracy theory that Nazis didn't lose World War II, they simply

643
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
 reorganized and took over the planet in another way.

644
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,920
 That's not on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

645
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,560
 I actually was sure that it was because it's a compelling conspiracy theory.

646
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,640
 Don't get me wrong, it'd be a great espionage novel.

647
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,520
 I'm sure there have been books and movies made about stuff like this,

648
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,680
 but let's wrap it up like this.

649
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,560
 Let me read you a little bit of what Alexander wrote in his own words.

650
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,760
 "Formally, I am free to go anywhere.

651
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,120
 Nevertheless, I am object of such harassment when I leave home

652
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,640
 that ultimately I have to stay in it to avoid provocations that can get me arrested again."

653
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,760
 Although staying at home means bearing enormous amount of toxins to keep me awake,

654
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,960
 and electroshocks to wake me up at specific intervals, sleep deprivation,

655
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
 the chances that a provocation can work in the spice favor when I am at home

656
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,880
 are much more remote than when I am out of it.

657
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,000
 So that's the story of Alexander, a man who has imprisoned himself in his own house.

658
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,240
 It's the only place that he can truly be safe, with a camera pointing outside,

659
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,920
 recording all of the Nazi collaborators walking down the street.

660
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,200
 It's an interesting tale with a mysterious ending.

661
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,440
 If he is a recluse trapped in his house, who's dropping off the notes?

662
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,520
 What if someone is planting these notes, leaving this man's name and address,

663
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
 and he doesn't even know it?

664
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,680
 And curious people, or weirdos, or gang-stalking advocates,

665
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,000
 keep walking up to his house, ringing the doorbell,

666
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
 asking for more information about the grand conspiracy.

667
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,440
 This man doesn't answer the door, he just waits until the knocking stops,

668
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,000
 and he sees them move past his window.

669
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,840
 He records their face, and it's another proof of his gang-stalking delusion.

670
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,320
 However, what if someone is actually using innocent people to gang-stalk him?

671
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,560
