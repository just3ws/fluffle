1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
 A performance artist so daring, so shocking, he either committed a horrifying crime or

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,960
 he made the whole thing up.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,360
 And then we take a look at a young man who is traveling on his way to school when he

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,980
 finds out that he is in the middle of a glitch in reality.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,760
 As he tries to navigate his way through a time loop he and his friends are caught in,

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,160
 we have to ask the bigger question.

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,120
 Are we ourselves currently trapped in a never ending cycle of beginnings and beginnings?

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:52,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 I'm your host Jason Corviner, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,120
 Hope you guys are having a great day too and hope you guys have some great plans for the

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
 weekend.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,120
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,040
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our newest Patreon supporters, I

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,120
 think, I'll explain that in a second.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,160
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command, everyone give a round of applause for Gregory Fader.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,920
 Yeah, come on in Gregory, come on in buddy.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,720
 He's like, "It's weird, I think I've been here before he thinks he's trapped in a time

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 loop."

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 I might have given Gregory Fader a shout out on an earlier episode, but I'm not entirely

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
 for sure.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,080
 His name's still sitting here in my notes and I would rather err on the side of caution

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,800
 and definitely give him a shout out today than to just assume that I had done it before.

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,280
 But again, could be a time loop, could be a time loop, I could have done that.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,280
 Gregory, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,720
 Patreon, I totally get it, I really do.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,480
 Just help spread the word about the show, that really really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,000
 And to you guys who do support the Patreon, I wanna tell you how much that means to me.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,700
 That's like grocery money for me, okay?

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,560
 That's like rent money and keeping the lights on.

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,280
 It means a lot that you guys are giving me donations, like it really does.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,560
 I count on this money, so to those of you who do support the Patreon, hats off to you.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 You guys are feeding me and keeping me comfortable, so really really appreciate that.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,760
 Oh, and before we get started, take a look at this fan art we have for Fan Art Friday.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,100
 This was sent to me by Mountain Man Leroy on Reddit, has a picture of the Carburetor

36
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,380
 Coptor hovering overhead and then it shows two people having a nice day on the beach.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,940
 And it says, "Random people thinking nothing tragic weird is going to happen to them."

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,300
 So the Carburetor Coptor, when you do see that coming, you've probably been trapped

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,700
 in some nightmarish reality or a victim of a true crime.

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,900
 And hopefully that never happens to any of us, but who knows where we're currently at

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,500
 in the time stream.

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,320
 Let's go ahead and toss you the Hair Hanglider.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,480
 We're going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,500
 We're going to fly all the way out to Italy.

45
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,320
 Specifically, we're headed to Bologna, Italy.

46
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,640
 I think it might be pronounced "Bologna."

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
 Probably not.

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
 It looks like it.

49
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,520
 It looks like it's pronounced that way, which would actually make sense because I think

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,760
 this artist, allegedly, allegedly is full of it.

51
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
 Baloney.

52
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,540
 I don't believe that this artist is doing what they're saying.

53
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,860
 I'm putting all my cards on the table right now, but let's take a look at it.

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,060
 I will say this, when I started doing this podcast, I always thought we'd cover a lot

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,260
 of ghost stuff, a lot of UFO stuff, some Bigfoot stuff.

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,340
 We've covered a lot of Bigfoot stuff, not covering a lot of ghosts, because the stories

57
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,180
 are really hard to find, but I'm doing my best.

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,100
 We got a lot of good ghost stuff recently.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,700
 One thing that I never expected to ever do, like multiple shows on, I've covered a lot

60
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,400
 of these guys over the years, performance artists.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 Performance artists.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,640
 We covered that guy who rolled an egg through London with his nose to protest wheat prices

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
 or something like that.

64
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,040
 And we talked about Marina Abramovich.

65
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,000
 She's very popular in the conspiracy theory community and her connections to the Clinton

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,920
 administration and her connections to witchcraft and all of this stuff.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
 We talked about that.

68
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
 We also talked about she's a crazy performance artist.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,140
 Sometimes she took a car into the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art and was doing donuts,

70
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,140
 spraying black oil everywhere.

71
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,860
 So she's definitely, she definitely has some controversy surrounding her, but her performance

72
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
 art is just weird.

73
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,500
 We've covered a lot of these guys.

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,300
 I recently came across this guy named John Duncan.

75
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,220
 That was the sound of a couple of you shutting off the podcast or finding the fast forward

76
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
 button.

77
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,340
 You're like, nope, I'm going to pull over in my car and just figure out where the time

78
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
 loop story is.

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,720
 Cause if you know the name John Duncan, you know exactly what the main thing we're going

80
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,280
 to talk about on this story.

81
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,840
 John Duncan.

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,360
 Back in the 1970s, he's in the performance art scene in Los Angeles and performance art

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,760
 is basically people sitting around going, I have an idea.

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,480
 I'm going to do something weird.

85
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,560
 And then I'm going to attribute some sort of deeper meaning to it.

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
 And one of his was this.

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,320
 I don't think there's really any deeper meaning to this one.

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,660
 One of his artworks was called scare.

89
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
 Scare.

90
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,340
 He wears a disguise in this one.

91
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,340
 It's not really scary if he walked into the room.

92
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,780
 It actually does turn out because the, the already does, it would make you scared if

93
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,780
 he walked into the room.

94
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,860
 If he's telling the truth again, who knows.

95
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,580
 But this one, there were witnesses to this one.

96
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,940
 He put on a disguise and he walked into an art exhibit or he walked in where all these

97
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,940
 people were.

98
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,660
 They're all sitting around there and we're John Duncan.

99
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,700
 He's supposed to scare us.

100
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,020
 And he was wearing his disguise and he jumped out with a gun.

101
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,020
 He goes, "Ahhhhh!"

102
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,600
 He's waving the gun in his fuel's faces and they're like, "Ahh!

103
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,200
 Who are you?"

104
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
 That was, that was it.

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
 That was the whole art exhibit that only works once.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,560
 Like you can imagine the people like waiting to go visit that one.

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,400
 They see a guy jump out and he's waving a gun and they're like, "Uhhh."

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
 I can imagine what is going to scare me, that guy with the gun.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,280
 And it's probably John Duncan.

110
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,160
 So that really happened.

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,480
 He also apparently was a Los Angeles city bus driver for a while.

112
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,220
 Either that or he pretended to be one of the more bus driver uniform and just gotten a

113
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,380
 bus and started driving around.

114
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,740
 Because a couple of his artworks, quote unquote artwork, has to do with driving a bus, driving

115
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,820
 a city bus.

116
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,860
 In 1976 he had one called Bus Ride.

117
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,500
 This first one's funny.

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 This first one's pretty funny.

119
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,900
 That's the reason why I like performance artists and sometimes they're wacky.

120
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,300
 He, I don't know if he arranges.

121
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,740
 I'm assuming this was some sort of skit that was going on on a bus.

122
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,520
 But the bus would be going down the street and he would have a pregnant woman on board.

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,240
 I'm sure I wish she was part of this.

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
 I wish she was in on it.

125
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,040
 Otherwise, actually it's probably more hilarious if she wasn't.

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
 There's a pregnant woman on the bus.

127
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
 There's a bunch of random passengers.

128
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,000
 This is, nowadays we would call this a social experiment on YouTube.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,680
 But back then this was high art.

130
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
 He would drive around a bus.

131
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 He's wearing a sky suit.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,160
 He's dressed up like a burglar.

133
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,200
 He has his gun ready to scare people in case he needs another artwork real quick.

134
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
 This one isn't paying out.

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,780
 There's a pregnant woman and then there's a stranger on there as well.

136
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
 I mean, it's a bus.

137
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,740
 Everyone's a stranger but there's a pregnant woman and not a stranger to John Duncan.

138
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,640
 Someone John Duncan knows.

139
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,580
 And this dude kicks the pregnant woman off the seat.

140
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,340
 Like they're sitting next to each other and he kicks her off and then props his feet up

141
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,340
 on the seat.

142
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,420
 So he was doing it just to have more leg room.

143
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,900
 He wasn't doing it because he needed to get there.

144
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,500
 He wasn't doing it because she was Sarah Connor and he was the terminator.

145
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,280
 He kicks her off the seat and then a fight breaks out among the other passengers and

146
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,520
 half of them take the stranger's side.

147
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,120
 Half of them go, "Hey, man, you shouldn't kick a pregnant lady off of the seat."

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,320
 And the other half is like, "Well, we don't know the whole story.

149
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 We don't know the whole story.

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,480
 Maybe he's from the future and he's trying to terminate John Connor."

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,560
 He did that twice.

152
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,800
 He did that artwork twice, 30 days apart.

153
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,920
 And then he did this other one which I had to go.

154
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,820
 I ended up finding his website and really had to dig into some of this stuff because

155
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,020
 this made no sense, but this is a quote, this is from Wikipedia.

156
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:07,420
 His other version of bus ride was, "Bus ride sexually stimulated unsuspecting passengers."

157
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,940
 This would be a crime nowadays.

158
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,780
 It's a crime back then too, but "Bus ride sexually stimulated unsuspecting passengers

159
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:21,820
 on a city bus with a liquid poured into the ventilation system in order to observe the

160
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,820
 results."

161
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
 I'm like, "What?

162
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,320
 What in the possible?"

163
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,680
 Like, I can understand like if he was driving, he's driving by sexy billboards over and over

164
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,440
 and people are like, "Ooh, that sure is a sexy picture of Bo Derek or whoever was hot

165
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
 back in 1976."

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
 No, he put a liquid in and I was like, "What?

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 That's not enough information.

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,240
 I'm not going to figure out what this liquid is."

169
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,600
 It was, this is gross.

170
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
 This is so gross.

171
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,840
 Who would get turned on by this?

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,480
 Imagine you're on a city bus in Los Angeles, the home of smog, the birthplace of smog.

173
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,180
 It didn't exist until Los Angeles was built.

174
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
 It's 1976.

175
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,540
 It's the smoggiest of smogs.

176
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,980
 You're driving in this hot city bus.

177
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,420
 You're like hoping you can see a rainbow and we kicked off a seat.

178
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,220
 You're like, "That's my fetish because I'm a weird sicko."

179
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,140
 But instead, instead you don't get to see that delight.

180
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,380
 Instead he dropped fish extract into the ventilation system.

181
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,460
 I mean, that's the grossest smell.

182
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,740
 Fish extract into the ventilation system.

183
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,800
 I've done that as a prank.

184
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,440
 It's actually a crime, but I've done that.

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,680
 I've taken fish oils or other smelly things and put it in people's ventilation systems

186
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
 in their cars.

187
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,760
 It was a long time ago, officers, you can't prosecute me for that, for that misdemeanor.

188
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,680
 He would put fish extract in the ventilation system of an LA bus and also the windows he

189
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,000
 made so the windows don't open up.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,640
 So now it's not a social experiment.

191
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,360
 Now he's basically just the joker.

192
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,780
 He's trying to drive people mad.

193
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,820
 And that's not sexually stimulating.

194
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,180
 I've never been walking by dudes fishing and they're like checking me out.

195
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,740
 They're like, "Woohoo, woohoo!"

196
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,380
 And they're like cat calling me.

197
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,580
 Fish aren't sexy.

198
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,260
 I don't understand why he thought that he could put fish extract in a dirty city bus's

199
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,580
 ventilation system with all the other smells that are contained in that bus.

200
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,700
 Lock the windows, which I'm pretty sure is fire hazard, and just drive around in circles.

201
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,000
 We were like, "Sir, that was my stop.

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 That was my stop."

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
 And he's like, "Do you have a boner yet?"

204
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,040
 And they're like, "No, of course not.

205
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
 I don't want a disgusting city bus."

206
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,080
 He's like, "We're just going to keep driving around until you do."

207
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,340
 He's most famous, though.

208
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,600
 Not for this hilarious practice.

209
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
 That's pretty funny, right?

210
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,640
 Both of those are kind of funny.

211
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,680
 He's not famous for those.

212
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:44,280
 He's famous for...and piece of art he did on May 14th, 1980.

213
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,100
 This one had no witnesses.

214
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,460
 You could argue it had one, but as far as I know, they've never come forward.

215
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,700
 This was a performance art that he did called Blind Date.

216
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,380
 And you can find it on YouTube, shockingly.

217
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,580
 Well, I mean, again, if it's fake, it's probably about as real as the Batman.

218
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,140
 You can watch a video of Robert Pattinson beating up some thug.

219
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,140
 You're not like Colin the cop.

220
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,460
 You're like, "I just saw Robert Pattinson beat up this dude."

221
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,940
 He has this audio only.

222
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,160
 There's no video footage or film footage of this at all.

223
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
 We have to take his word for this.

224
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,760
 And if you listen to the audio track on YouTube, it explains, "On May 14th, 1980, John Duncan

225
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
 had sex with a dead body."

226
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:37,760
 Apparently, he went to Mexico and bribed a coroner down there to have sex with a body.

227
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,200
 He walks in with a pocket full of cash and he goes, "Do you have any suggestions, good

228
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
 sir?

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,620
 Can I have your hottest corpse?"

230
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,980
 And I don't know if he cared how hot it was.

231
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,500
 It was a dead woman, right?

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
 I don't know.

233
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,700
 And here's the thing.

234
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,220
 I don't believe this.

235
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,180
 I don't believe this happened.

236
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,620
 If you guys are getting angry at me laughing, I think it's made up.

237
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,060
 But he says he went to a coroner down in Mexico and bribed one of them to have sex with a

238
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:09,660
 dead body and he was going to record it on audio tape.

239
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,400
 So there's no proof he did any of this.

240
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:22,280
 And he had sex to completion and then he went and had a vasectomy on audio tape.

241
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,680
 So he went, I don't know if they were all in the same room.

242
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,200
 I don't know if there was a doctor sitting there and he's like, "Oh, come on.

243
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
 Hurry up, dude.

244
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 I got another appointment.

245
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,920
 I got another appointment with another sicko."

246
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,000
 It rides down.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,600
 Apparently, he had sex with this corpse and recorded the audio of it and then had a vasectomy

248
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,660
 and recorded the audio of that.

249
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:47,220
 And the point was to have put the last of his living viable seed, his sperm, into a dead

250
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,820
 body, to a corpse that can never get pregnant.

251
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,220
 I don't believe this happened.

252
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,140
 I don't believe this happened because basically I listened to the audio track.

253
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,140
 Again, it's on YouTube.

254
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,300
 I had to go to some crazy website and I wouldn't have if I had to.

255
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,860
 I'd been like, "Ah, whatever."

256
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,080
 I went to YouTube and I listened to this and it's about, imagine what you, imagine

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,320
 the sounds of two people having sex but one of them can't.

258
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
 It's that.

259
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 It's nothing.

260
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 It's nothing.

261
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,200
 I mean, I don't know if I expected like Barry White music in the background and him like

262
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
 talking to it.

263
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,320
 This is getting really, really dark and really gross.

264
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,160
 But again, I didn't, I'm not saying that he did this.

265
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,800
 He's saying that he did this and I don't believe him.

266
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,020
 It's the sound, it's like nothing.

267
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,100
 It's like 10 minutes of like a guy unzipping his pants and then nothing.

268
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,940
 And then about 10 minutes, an unreasonably long amount of time, I don't know how long

269
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
 the sectomies take.

270
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
 I'm like, "What?

271
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
 Come on.

272
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,980
 I have an appointment on the other side of town.

273
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,260
 Hurry up, duck."

274
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,180
 It's the sound of two blocks of wood scraping against each other.

275
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
 That's really what it sounds like.

276
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,140
 I don't know if he was trying to simulate like someone sawing through his testicles to

277
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,180
 give him a, the vasectomy.

278
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,120
 I don't know what he was trying to do, but it's basically like 10 minutes of nothing.

279
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,360
 And then 10 minutes of, "Ugh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

280
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,120
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

281
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

282
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

283
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,120
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

284
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:37,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

285
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:44,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

286
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:51,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

287
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:01,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

288
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:11,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

289
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:18,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

290
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:27,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

291
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

292
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

293
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

294
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

295
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:06,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

296
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

297
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:20,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

298
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

299
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:34,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

300
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

301
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:48,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

302
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:55,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

303
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:02,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

304
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:09,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

305
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:16,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

306
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:23,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

307
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

308
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:37,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

309
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:44,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

310
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

311
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:58,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

312
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:05,100
 uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
