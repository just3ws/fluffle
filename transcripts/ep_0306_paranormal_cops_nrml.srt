1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
 a gang of vigilantes that strikes fear in the hearts of its prey.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,800
 And then we take a trip to the Navajo Nation,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,900
 where we meet two police officers who, 99% of the time, solve domestic violence disputes

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,200
 and out-traffic tickets, general police work.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,100
 But 1% of their cases involve UFOs, ghosts, and the occasional Bigfoot.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,700
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:35,300
 [Music]

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,100
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,900
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,300
 New Patreon, we got a new Patreon from one of the original supporters of the show,

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,800
 Ash Black, the guy who designed the Dead Rabbit logo that you guys are familiar with,

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,200
 the iconic Dead Rabbit logo.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,100
 It was Ash Black.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,600
 He's now supporting the show through Patreon, so thank you very much for doing that, Ash.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
 You've already done so much for the show.

18
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,500
 And I'm kind of talking to him a bit now, because listen, this kid's smart.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,400
 Like, this guy has come up with some really cool stuff.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,200
 So I'm going to talk to him when he's ready to start announcing stuff.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,200
 I want to plug a couple things that he's doing, because this, and it's not because of the Patreon.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,700
 It's, it's, it's, because I feel like I owe him just for the art.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,600
 But yeah, I mean, he's, he's a smart kid.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,300
 So I'm still talking with him, but he has some really cool projects that hopefully I'll be plugging soon.

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,900
 So I think it's kind of right up your guys' alley.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,800
 It's right at my alley.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,400
 So, okay, let's go ahead and get started with our first story though, because we're in the United States.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,700
 We're in a court of law, dun dun.

29
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,900
 And this dude, this shackled gang member, he's this buff dude.

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,700
 He's like six foot three covered in gang tats.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,400
 He's being brought into court, immigration court to be specific.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,000
 This is a court deciding whether or not he should be shipped back to his home country, a Vilsalvador.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,100
 He's walking in, he's handcuffed, and the judge is sitting there old gray-haired dude, big old mustache.

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,200
 Tom Selick, it's Tom Selick, he quit acting.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,800
 Now, I guess there's a rumor in Hood River that Tom Selick lives on an island, like down, down river, like two miles away.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,700
 And everyone goes, oh, that's Tom Selick's island.

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,900
 That's the island I'm going to, a zombie's ever attacked, but people go, oh, Tom Selick.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,400
 I don't know if anyone's ever seen Tom Selick in town, ever.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,200
 That's a weird Hood River urban legend that Tom Selick owns an island nearby.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,400
 Why Tom Selick?

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,500
 Anyways, so now he's off the island and he's in this courtroom.

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,800
 To those of you who even know who Tom Selick is, like, who is this guy?

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,900
 Just a talking mustache who owns an island.

44
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,200
 Tom, he's Magnum PI.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,800
 You don't know that.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,900
 Wait, was he Magnum PI?

47
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,600
 Who was the guy in Hawaii?

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,700
 Who was a Magnum PI?

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
 Who was the guy in Hawaii?

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
 There was the Hawaiian show where he had on the Hawaiian shirt and he solved crimes.

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,600
 Maybe that's Magnum PI yet.

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,900
 I think I need to eat more bacon.

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,600
 So, but I'm not gonna, because I got to record this episode.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's running late already.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Magnum PI or a guy in a Hawaiian shirt.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
 It was Magnum PI.

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
 Tom Selick is in court.

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
 That's what we're trying to say.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
 A judge, it's not really Tom Selick.

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,300
 Okay.

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,200
 This is a true story.

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,700
 So there is a guy in a courtroom, a judge sitting on a judge chair.

63
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,300
 And then this big dude comes in, covered in gang tats, handcuffed.

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,200
 Now, the judge is going to decide whether or not he gets shipped back to his country.

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,900
 I don't know.

66
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,100
 I've already explained all that stuff, but I'm explaining it again.

67
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,900
 And the first thing the judge asks is,

68
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,700
 "What was that show with Tom Selick in the Hawaiian shirt?"

69
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,600
 And the guy's like, "I have no idea."

70
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 And he goes, "Okay, never mind.

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,500
 Never mind that."

72
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,700
 So based on your horrible crimes you've committed in the United States

73
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,500
 and the fact that you are an illegal alien,

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,300
 we are shipping you back to, and the convict goes,

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,500
 "No, no, sir.

76
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 Do not ship me back to El Salvador.

77
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,200
 Please.

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,700
 Please, your honor."

79
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,000
 And the judge is a little perplexed because you have this hardcore gang member

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,300
 basically begging not to go back.

81
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,000
 And he's like, "Listen, I get that maybe the job opportunities aren't the best in El Salvador,

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,900
 or people are not going there to work.

83
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,000
 You're going there to serve a time in prison, but I know their prisons are pretty bad."

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,200
 And the convict is like, "No, please, you can't do this.

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
 They're down there.

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
 They'll kill me."

87
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,300
 The judge is like, "Who is scaring this guy?"

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,700
 Because the tats that he's wearing aren't just spiderwebs on the elbows.

89
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,800
 He's wearing straight up MS-13 tats, one of the most fearsome gangs in the Americas.

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,400
 And the dude is pleading for his life to not go back to El Salvador.

91
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,800
 But the judge goes, "No, all your pleading won't do anything.

92
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
 I sentenced you... I don't know if they...

93
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,200
 They may just sign a piece of paper.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,100
 I don't know, but anyways, the judge goes, "No, you're going back to El Salvador."

95
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,300
 The inmate goes back to his cell and starts making some connections in prison

96
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,900
 because before he gets deported, he wants one thing to happen.

97
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,900
 He wants all of his MS-13 gang tattoos covered up or removed with a knife.

98
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,300
 In El Salvador, there's a gang known as Sombra Negra or the Black Shadow.

99
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,000
 It's a paramilitary vigilante group and that's actually a bit of a misnomer.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,200
 It should actually just be military vigilante group.

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,200
 These guys are all ex-military or ex-police.

102
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,100
 So they are taking their weapons.

103
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,300
 And it's funny because I think "X" is in quotation marks.

104
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,500
 I think they probably have active military aid and active police aid

105
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,900
 because the government of El Salvador started to crumble.

106
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,900
 The gangs started to rise up and you had these people watching these gangs take...

107
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,700
 Because MS-13 is from El Salvador.

108
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,200
 They were watching these gangs take over their country.

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,400
 Local law enforcement wasn't doing anything.

110
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,500
 National law enforcement wasn't doing anything.

111
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,600
 So these people, these military officials and these police officers formed the Black Shadow.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,400
 And they began just executing MS-13 gang members wherever they could find them.

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,700
 And the government clamped down on stories of this group for a while.

114
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,100
 They were pretending that they wasn't happening.

115
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,400
 But you had people saying, "Hey, my brother was shot yesterday."

116
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,500
 And they're like, "Is your brother a gang member?"

117
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,800
 And they're covering up his gang tattoos.

118
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
 He's like wearing a big mink coat.

119
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,100
 He's like, "No, we're upstanding citizens, your honor."

120
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,300
 But they're like, "We must have just gotten killed by a rival gang."

121
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,100
 The story of the Black Shadow began to go from town to town.

122
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,000
 And you think, "Okay, gangs fight each other all the time."

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,100
 So the fact that there's another gang that happens to be like military train have access to military level weapons.

124
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's nothing new in gangs, especially Mexico farther down.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,700
 Like, that's nothing new.

126
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:48,200
 It's what the Black Shadow does to the victims is what sends chills down the spines of MS-13.

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,000
 They'll snatch you off the street, break into your house, find you in your car with your girlfriend,

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,400
 and just do what they do.

129
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,300
 Which isn't just shoot you in the back of the head.

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,200
 That's how it ends.

131
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 First off, they torture you.

132
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,300
 Good old torture.

133
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,700
 Again, that's nothing new for gangs.

134
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,500
 Gang on gang violence, they do this stuff.

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 They torture you for a while.

136
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,400
 And then when they decide to finally end it, they cut off your hands.

137
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,700
 You're still alive, by the way.

138
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,500
 So now you're like, "Ah, no hands."

139
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,300
 You feel a little more animated than that.

140
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,100
 I think you're like, "Oh, great. No hands. Can't play video games anymore.

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,200
 What else are you going to do?"

142
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
 I hate video games, Black Shadow.

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,700
 They cut off your tongue.

144
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,200
 So now you can't even trash talk them.

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,700
 That's pretty brutal.

146
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,800
 But we're just getting started.

147
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,200
 They cut off their genitals while you're alive.

148
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,500
 And the coup de gras, actually the coup de gras is the shot to the back of the head,

149
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,100
 but hands, tongues, genitals, keeping you alive the whole time.

150
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:47,100
 And then finally, they remove your anus, which to me, honestly, is a feat of engineering.

151
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,900
 I don't know how you could, like, core out a living person's butthole,

152
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,800
 but they figured out a way to do it.

153
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
 And then they're shooting them back to the head.

154
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,600
 And at some of these scenes where these people, they just find like,

155
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,200
 they walk in, they find a handless, tongueless, genital-less body,

156
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,300
 and then there's like a long tube and they're like, "Oh, we found the anus."

157
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,400
 It's just like rolling like a hot dog next to the body.

158
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,500
 Some of these crime scenes, the bodies have semen on them, or in them, or around them.

159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,100
 And so the rumor is that these people are also sexually assaulted before being murdered.

160
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
 Sorry if you're listening to this episode while you're eating an egg McMuffin.

161
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,600
 But this is gone beyond cartel violence brutality.

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,100
 When we have this level of violence, plus the military training,

163
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,500
 plus the fact that the government pretends that these guys don't really even exist,

164
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
 the Black Shadow is what strikes fear into the heart of people

165
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,600
 who strike fear into the heart of the general population.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,900
 And the Black Shadow is only growing stronger.

167
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,800
 They started off-- they actually started off in Guatemala.

168
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,500
 Sorry, misspoke.

169
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 They're in El Salvador now, and they're spreading throughout South America.

170
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,000
 So there are rumors that the Black Shadow operates in the United States.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
 It's never been proven.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 But people are saying that, yes, there are cells of the Black Shadow in the United States.

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,600
 So if you ever think about joining MS-13, if that's ever crossed your mind,

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
 and it's gone to the point where they actually have started going after other gangs.

175
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
 They hate gangs.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,000
 MS-13 was their first target, but they branched off to other gangs.

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And it's funny because they're such a rumor that they're almost encrypted among gangs.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
 A rumor that you don't want to ever run into.

179
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,500
 A name you don't want to say, because you'll be looking over your shoulder,

180
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,300
 the Black Shadow.

181
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,000
 It takes a lot to strike fear into depraved humans.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,100
 But they do it, and they do it, and they just disappear back into the darkness.

183
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,300
 I find this story fascinating.

184
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,600
 I had an idea to do a vigilante week, and I didn't have enough for a whole week,

185
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
 but I actually found a lot of really cool vigilante stories.

186
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,900
 That was one of them.

187
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,900
 So anyways, let's get to an official Dead Rabbit Recommends for a Halloween Spooktacular.

188
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,000
 I saw this movie a couple years ago, and it stuck with me,

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,800
 which is always a good sign for a movie, especially like a low-budget horror movie.

190
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 You see the Matrix, it's going to stick with you forever.

191
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,700
 But when you just have an assemble across a low-budget horror movie, or sci-fi movie,

192
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,200
 and then years later, you're still thinking about it.

193
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,900
 It's been about four years since I saw it.

194
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,700
 It's really, really good.

195
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,600
 The movie's about this sculptor who's really, really down on his luck.

196
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,700
 Like, that is his art of passion, but he can never succeed at it.

197
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,400
 And he ends up moving into an apartment.

198
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,900
 It was like an L.A. or some city or something like that.

199
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,700
 He moves into this little apartment in the landlords like,

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,000
 "Oh, you know, like some of these famous artists,

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,100
 they lived in this apartment before their careers took off."

202
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,600
 He's like, "Oh, you know, maybe it'll give me the inspiration that I need."

203
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
 So he's living in this apartment.

204
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,900
 And there's like a crack in the wall.

205
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,700
 And if I don't remember all the exact details,

206
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,100
 I don't want to give away spoilers either,

207
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,600
 but the crack starts to get a little bit bigger and a little bit bigger.

208
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,100
 And then eventually it's just like this gooey, fleshy mass in the wall.

209
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,500
 Like, you can actually see how it's like sticky and wet inside this crack in this wall.

210
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,900
 You're like, "Touch it."

211
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,000
 It's like gooey.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,600
 And then it starts talking to him.

213
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,500
 And it starts to say, "Stick your fingers in me."

214
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,800
 This is a real movie, by the way.

215
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
 This is a real movie, by the way.

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,400
 "Stick your fingers in me, and I will make your art come alive."

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 Really, he sticks his fingers into the hole and you hear this voice going, "Mmm."

218
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,800
 The voice of the hole is, if you remember this,

219
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,900
 is the voice of Aon Flux from the old liquid television MTV cartoon,

220
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,400
 which was a great show, but very, very like sexy, sultry voice.

221
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,200
 It's not like Marge Simpson.

222
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,700
 He's sticking his fingers in the hole.

223
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:40,000
 And then a little piece of goop comes out, like a little chunk of like flesh comes out of the hole.

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And she's like, "Put that in one of your art pieces."

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,900
 So he sticks it on the top and he's like walking on the street with it.

226
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,000
 And people are like, "Oh my God, that's so great."

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's just like a piece of junk.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
 Like it's horribly designed.

229
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,500
 Like he's into that abstract art type of stuff.

230
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
 And there's just this little piece of flesh on the top.

231
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,000
 People are stopping him on the street wanting to buy it for like $500,000.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,300
 That's really all I want to tell you about it, because it's a really fascinating movie.

233
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,800
 The whole movie maybe has four actors in it.

234
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,300
 It's basically like two locations.

235
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,500
 But you wonder, is this guy going crazy?

236
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,900
 Is there really a hole in the wall?

237
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,800
 Spoiler alert, there really is a hole in the wall.

238
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,100
 But I mean, like what is going on with this whole thing?

239
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,500
 It's really, really interesting, artistic horror movie.

240
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,600
 But yeah, the movie's called Deep Down.

241
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,400
 It's called Deep Down.

242
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,300
 It's a really cool, if you're looking for a quiet kind of creepy horror movie to start these months off.

243
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,900
 Deep Down.

244
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,200
 It came out in 2015 if you have a hard time finding it.

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,800
 Deep Down.

246
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,200
 Dead Rabbit recommends Deep Down.

247
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,800
 But we leave behind the hole in the wall.

248
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,100
 We leave behind the goo.

249
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,900
 I take a little goo for myself, put it in my pocket, and you see it and you're like,

250
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,100
 "How did you get that goo?"

251
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,800
 I didn't see you stick your fingers in that hole and I go,

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,300
 "You gotta watch the movie to find out how, the other way I get this goo."

253
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,000
 It's not feeding people to it either.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
 That would be lame.

255
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,400
 But anyways, something else.

256
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,800
 What's in between sticking your fingers in a hole on a wall, throwing a human body in there?

257
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,200
 You're looking at me.

258
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,600
 My hands are all sticky and you're like, "Jason, you did it."

259
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
 And I was like, "Just watch the movie, bro.

260
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,700
 Watch the movie.

261
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,400
 Deep Down 2015.

262
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
 Check it out."

263
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,500
 And I go shake your hand.

264
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
 You're like, "No way, dude.

265
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,000
 No way."

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,700
 I'm like, "Come on, man.

267
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,700
 Give me a hug, dude."

268
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,300
 Well, you're like, "Get off of me."

269
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,900
 We're stuck together now.

270
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,300
 But anyways, we unstick ourselves.

271
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,400
 That was a disgusting sound.

272
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,800
 But anyways, we're all unstuck and I sit down in the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

273
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,600
 Start to rev it up.

274
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
 I'm all, "Are you getting in?"

275
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400
 You look at me and you go, "Yeah, sure.

276
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
 I guess I have to."

277
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
 Or I could just skip 'Til tomorrow's episode.

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,800
 I'm like, "That's what I thought."

279
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,600
 [Makes noise]

280
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,300
 Now, we're in the desert.

281
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
 We're in Arizona to be specific.

282
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,900
 And Arizona is part of a place called the Navajo Nation.

283
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,700
 It's like in Northeast Arizona, Southeast Utah, and Northwestern New Mexico.

284
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,500
 I don't know if that's just one giant reservation.

285
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,400
 But anyways, we're going there.

286
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,500
 I don't need to have all the info.

287
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,800
 I have a map and I have you.

288
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,000
 And you're all the information I'll ever need.

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
 And you're like, "Aww.

290
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,900
 I forgive you for not researching an integral fact in your story."

291
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,100
 I'm like, "Yeah, that's what I thought."

292
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,400
 [Makes noise]

293
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,500
 So, we're in the Navajo Nation.

294
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,200
 And we go and there we're going to meet two police officers.

295
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,900
 We're meeting Lieutenant John Dover and Sergeant Stanley Milford Jr.

296
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,500
 So Dover and Milford are law enforcement officers.

297
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,300
 I don't know if they're still doing this thing, but at the time they were law enforcement officers.

298
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,500
 There are Navajo Nation Rangers, which are actually federally trained officers.

299
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 So they were going and they were like kicking down cardboard doors and shooting at cardboard targets.

300
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,800
 And then enjoying a good cardboard beer after the training run.

301
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 [Glug glug glug]

302
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,600
 And then the federal government says, "You are federally trained dudes."

303
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
 So they're like, "Yay."

304
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,800
 And they jump up in the air in a freeze frame.

305
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,400
 And they go back to the Navajo Nation to do this job.

306
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,100
 Be an officer of the law, right?

307
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,400
 It's interesting because this story was told in a bunch of different media outlets.

308
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,900
 Huffington Post and the Mysterious Universe website covered this as well.

309
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,800
 But it's always the same stories and the same quotes.

310
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,400
 So I'm really thinking, I think Huffington Post covered it first and then other people.

311
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,700
 It's multiple websites have talked about this story.

312
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,000
 But anyways, the news isn't there's two cops.

313
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,300
 The news is that these dudes say that 99% of the cases they cover are normal cases.

314
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,900
 They're just walking around, knocking cats out of trees.

315
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:30,200
 And helping old ladies up and then like stopping drug trafficking and stuff like that.

316
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,900
 But 1% of their cases involve the paranormal.

317
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
 So cue spooky music.

318
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,200
 This article kind of flew around the internet for a little bit a couple years ago when it came out.

319
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,500
 And I think part of it is, one, you think of like vast deserts of having more spooky stuff.

320
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:53,300
 Two, you think of Native American lands and Native American people having more connection to spiritual stuff.

321
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,000
 So they may more likely see this type of stuff.

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,700
 But let's look at a couple of their experiences here.

323
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,500
 One, this dude says, one of these cops goes, there's this house.

324
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
 This is happening a couple of times.

325
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,200
 It's not the first time it happened to me.

326
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,900
 I walked into a house that was supposedly haunted and I was talking to the homeowner and a bunch of coins fell on my head.

327
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
 And there's a couple questions that happened.

328
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,000
 What he says that he looked up, there was no holes in the ceiling.

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,800
 And I don't know if he didn't notice that like there was a leprechaun celebrating behind him with the big old pot of gold.

330
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
 I have a couple of questions about this story.

331
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,000
 I don't really mean a nitpick at Mr. Officer of the Law, but one, where are the coins now?

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Two, you got any money I can borrow?

333
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,700
 And three, where are the coins?

334
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,300
 Like, I mean, obviously I can take a picture with a bunch of quarters in my hand and caption it.

335
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
 These fell on my head, ghosted it.

336
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,200
 And there would be, to be a fair, there would be people who would believe in that.

337
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
 But I mean, are they current?

338
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,100
 Where are the coins from the current year? Were they American coins?

339
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,400
 Or were they like ancient Navajo coins? Or were they from Tourette or what?

340
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,900
 Like, where do these coins come from?

341
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,400
 And I guess that's the question, but I guess I should say what are the coins?

342
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 Because those are, if the coins were from the future, that would be absolutely bizarre.

343
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,800
 If they're from the past, then I think someone was just throwing coins at you.

344
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,600
 The other thing is that if you had a place where you knew, he said this wasn't the first time it happened.

345
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,000
 If you knew a place where coins fell on your head, why wouldn't you just bring a bucket with you every time you went?

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,900
 And just leave, you just leave the bucket there.

347
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,000
 And then coin, and then you show up each day, you got all your laundry money, you got $5 a day from coin.

348
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
 That would be worth the trip out to that house.

349
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,900
 Why would you report to the police, "My house is haunted, money's falling out of nowhere on my head."

350
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,600
 Just don't tell anyone, be a quarter heir.

351
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 There's the next story I love, this woman's driving down the road late at night.

352
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,100
 And she sees a white bright light following her.

353
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,000
 An orb, a glowing orb is actually what she said, not a white bright light glowing orb.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 [Warming]

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
 And she's like, "Ah."

356
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 She flores it.

357
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,700
 She's going as fast as she can.

358
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,800
 I made that deal tell up.

359
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,500
 I don't know if that's true.

360
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,400
 But anyways, she's trying to get away.

361
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,300
 She may have been going the speed limit the whole time.

362
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,100
 She's like, "Oh no, it's only 65."

363
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,600
 The orb, there's like menacing claws coming out of it.

364
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,400
 She's like, "I have to drive the speed limit."

365
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,700
 But anyways, the orb doesn't get her, but as she pulls up to her house, the orb disappears.

366
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,600
 And she sees in her driveway a quote, "Very large rabbit."

367
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,800
 She runs past the rabbit and runs inside, goes to sleep, wakes up the next morning with a splitting headache.

368
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,400
 And when the cop showed up, she called in and she's like,

369
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 "Oh, you won't believe what happened last night."

370
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,200
 So I was getting chased by this orb, very large rabbit, went to sleep, woke up with a headache.

371
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,500
 And if I was a cop and I got that phone call, I'd be like,

372
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,200
 "First off, why didn't you call us last night? I want to see the rabbit."

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,900
 Secondly, so.

374
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,800
 And thirdly, do you have any money I can borrow?

375
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,600
 So the cops do go out to her house and they say,

376
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,000
 here's a quote from one of these articles that I read,

377
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 "Dover and Milford investigated the site and would find that the car was imbued with anomalous electromagnetic readings, particularly in the driver's seat."

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,400
 Let's take this part real quick too, because I'm going somewhere with this.

379
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,500
 I'm not just being a skeptic the whole time, but the orb chasing her down the street,

380
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,100
 that's classic UFO thing, may or may not have happened.

381
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,600
 I'm more interested in two details.

382
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,700
 One, if you were driving on the road and you got to your house and there was a rabbit in your driveway,

383
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,200
 how big would it have to be before you use the words very large?

384
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,800
 Both of them, not just I found a large rabbit, but how big would the rabbit have to be before you use the words very large rabbit in your driveway?

385
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,300
 Because I'm picturing, they never specify how big this is.

386
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,800
 I'm picturing a rabbit the size of someone in an Easter Bunny outfit, like a 5 foot 6 foot tall rabbit.

387
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,800
 That's a very large rabbit to me, which that you would not be able to sleep.

388
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,600
 That's the second, it's the other detail.

389
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,000
 She runs in the house, there's a 6 foot tall rabbit out there and she goes to sleep.

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 She wakes up with a headache.

391
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,200
 So I'm a little suspicious of that detail.

392
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,600
 I'm 100% suspicious of that, of another detail that they came out and they took electromagnetic readings.

393
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,800
 Now these cops go on to say later in the articles, listen, we're not saying we believe in any of this stuff,

394
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,600
 but it's our job to investigate all cases.

395
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 And they say some of these cases, if they went to a court of law, it would actually have enough evidence to convict someone.

396
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
 What?

397
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:49,600
 You're going to arrest a UFO, it's all walking in, it's all "yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum,

398
00:20:49,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 They magically wave over a sedan, over a Nissan and it goes, "Nininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininininin

399
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:26,100
 I'm just a little suspicious they have a proton pack in their backseat of their car, that they have any of this gear.

400
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 And it's interesting because the story came out, I think like in 2014, 2015, something like that, may have been a little more recent,

401
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,100
 but it's been a couple years and there's been no follow-up, which makes me think that either these guys,

402
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:43,100
 they may be telling the truth and they may just have wanted to do an article or the Huffington Post for whatever reason,

403
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,600
 or they wanted a television show or a book deal or something like that.

404
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,100
 So it's possible it was publicity for publicity's sake and that's why there's been no follow-up,

405
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:58,600
 because a book deal or a TV deal didn't go through and no other officer wants to talk about this story in the Navajo Nation Rangers.

406
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 I'm sure their office got a thousand phone calls the week following when these articles were published.

407
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,100
 And I'm sure their sergeant was like, "You guys, you've caused over $10,000 in phone bills this week.

408
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,600
 You gotta play by the book!" And they're like, "The only book we play by is the book we're gonna write."

409
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:25,100
 And we're gonna use all this publicity to get it published and sergeant's like, "Dover! Milford! Or..."

410
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:32,100
 I think paranormal, I think probably a lot of law enforcement officers and EMTs and stuff like that encounter paranormal stuff.

411
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,100
 I'm sure if you did a survey across the board of law enforcement officers around the world, you would probably, I don't know about 1%,

412
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:47,100
 that might be a little high, but I would say 0.5% of all calls that an officer goes on during the course of their career

413
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,100
 involves something completely unexplained and I don't mean like a murder they can't solve.

414
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,100
 I mean, they go in a house, they kick down a door, they are looking for a drug suspect, they see someone running in the closet,

415
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
 they open the closet, there's no one there.

416
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:11,600
 I'm sure that that happens more so to an officer of the law or to emergency medical technician or something like that than it does to a normal person.

417
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:19,100
 They're constantly in situations where there's psychic violence, there's real violence, but there's also like just psychic disturbances.

418
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,100
 They're going to places where people have been murdered, they're going to places where people are dying,

419
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,600
 they're going into abandoned buildings looking for vandals, they're out in the middle of the woods looking for a child,

420
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:37,100
 they're out in the darkest parts of not only the city or the wilderness, but the darkest parts of the human psyche.

421
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:47,100
 I would be shocked to meet a 20 year old officer of the law who has not had one bizarre thing happen to them during the course of their career.

422
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,600
 So that, just that idea lends a lot of credibility to the story.

423
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
 I think the fact that, I just think it's an occupation that you would run across that stuff a lot.

424
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,100
 And I think it's an occupation that if you did, like pilots who see UFOs tend not to report it because they get made fun of,

425
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:09,100
 and they're called Gray, "Hey, Gray?" "My name's Gray, yeah, whatever, Gray." "Heard you saw a UFO the other day."

426
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:18,100
 Like, there are certain jobs where you want everyone to conform to an ideal because when someone messes up at that job, you die.

427
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:24,100
 So you don't want to get in an airplane with someone who's seen a UFO because you think, "Oh, that guy's nuts because UFOs don't exist."

428
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:33,600
 You're a cop. You don't want to work with a guy who believes he saw Bigfoot one day or one day a UFO came down or a ghost scared him during a drug raid.

429
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 Like, you don't want to work with those people.

430
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 So they tend to be very conformist and they tend not to be a nail poking out of the floorboard or the funny penny falling from the ceiling.

431
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,600
 They tend to, it's an occupation that tends to be very conformist.

432
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 But if you talk to them, if you bought an officer a couple beers and you sat back, had a conversation with them,

433
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,100
 I'm sure you could squeeze a story out of them.

434
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 Here's an interesting story. This was in the Mysterious Universe article regarding this story.

435
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,100
 It has nothing to do with Dover and Milford.

436
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
 So we're leaving those. See you guys later.

437
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,100
 And as we're leaving, we hear the sergeant going, "If you guys go one more time talking about ghosts, I'm going to have your badge."

438
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,100
 And we hear Dover's badge at the table and he goes, "Have it. I don't need it to bust ghosts."

439
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,100
 He's like, "Milford? I mean Dover?"

440
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,600
 We just left a buddy-caught movie. We're going back to the late 90s and this is according again to Mysterious Universe.

441
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,100
 This was an anonymous report the author got.

442
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,600
 There was a police officer and his partner in Arizona driving around and they get a report.

443
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,100
 We're running on our car 9-9.

444
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,600
 Car 9-9.

445
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 We have a report of a weird howling man in your vicinity and the officer's like, "Yep. Yep. A good old 1088.

446
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 I don't know why all my sirens sound like the ectomobile."

447
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,100
 Cop car goes off and finds this weird howling man.

448
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,600
 He's out in the middle of nowhere. It's nighttime. It's actual nighttime.

449
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 And what they see is a tall, pale, skinny man walking around howling like a wolf.

450
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,600
 The cop and his partner are like, "This guy has to be high on something."

451
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 Which is not a good thing. Like this guy's either crazy or he's high, but we can't let him get into town.

452
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 And he's a good ways out of town, but we also just can't let him walk around in the middle of desert.

453
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
 He'll die. He might hurt himself as well.

454
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 So anyways, they hop out of their car. He looks like he's on drugs.

455
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,600
 And as the officer start approaching them, he completely freezes.

456
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,600
 Cold desert night air begins whipping around the officers and they're looking at this tall, pale man.

457
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
 He just freezes. The howling has stopped. He just freezes in his tracks.

458
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 And then sprints just bam! Goes off into the night running as fast as he can.

459
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,600
 The officer said he went from standing perfectly still to a runner sprint like that.

460
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 He goes, "It was just from nothing to pure movement in the heartbeat. You've never seen anything like it."

461
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 The cops run back to their car. They realize this guy's running so fast. They can't catch him.

462
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,600
 And again, if they catch him, they don't know what to do because he's just crazy.

463
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
 They don't want to wrestle him. They don't want to hit him with the car either.

464
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,600
 But they also don't want to go chasing after him into the dark Arizona night and then have him turn around at any point in their boxing.

465
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
 So they hop in the car and they start following him. Now he's running.

466
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,600
 He's running. The car's getting closer. He's still running.

467
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 The guy's running.

468
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
 At one point, the cop looks down. He's just pedaled to the metal, just flying.

469
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:41,600
 He looks down. His speedometer reads 50 miles per hour. The dude's still running and they're barely catching up to the dude.

470
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:52,600
 And then all of a sudden the guy drops to all fours and begins to just gallop across the desert and disappears into the Arizona night.

471
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,600
 Now, it's possible that story is also made up. But if you experienced that as a law enforcement officer, if me and you experienced that,

472
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
 if we were driving on the street and that same thing happened to us, we would tell a lot of people.

473
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,600
 We'd start off telling people that we trusted, but we wouldn't keep it a secret. I don't think.

474
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,600
 I think we would probably brag about it, at least online and stuff like that.

475
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,600
 Because our jobs wouldn't depend on it. We're just walking on the street and we see some crazy stuff and we're like,

476
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,600
 "Oh, I can't wait to tell my friends about this. I saw a guy run 50 miles an hour and then just gallop off into the distance."

477
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 But again, if you're a law enforcement officer, if people need to know that you are sane, otherwise they won't trust you to do the job,

478
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 if you saw something like that, you would only report it anonymously. And never talk about it again and hope no one ever asks you.

479
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:45,600
 It's funny because there are people who would kill to see a ghost. There are people who really, really want to have a paranormal encounter.

480
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 You really want to know what it's like to see a UFO or to stumble across a Bigfoot.

481
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,600
 There are people who have made careers out of trying to find Bigfoot or finding any sort of paranormal activity.

482
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,600
 There are people who go out of their way to find these things or find out if they're true.

483
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,600
 I think it's interesting because some people spend their lives hoping to see a ghost.

484
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 But there are most likely millions of law enforcement officers out there, firefighters, emergency personnel, who have seen them.

485
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:24,600
 And their only hope is that no one ever finds out. So they sit on that story and just pretend it never happened.

486
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,600
