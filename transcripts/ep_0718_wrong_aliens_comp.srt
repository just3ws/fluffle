1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 A terrifying crime shows what happens when we take conspiracy theories a little too seriously.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,560
 Then we take a look at the story of a young woman who encounters aliens,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,120
 advanced life from another galaxy, which makes us ask the question,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,640
 what if the smartest beings in the universe are wrong today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,880
 Garvin, or I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,400
 This may be the fastest recorded episode of Dead Rabbit Radio ever.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,600
 It's slowly approaching 100 degrees outside. I really, really waited a long time to record this

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,640
 episode. I recorded it like almost the hottest time of the day. So we're gonna have to get right

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,480
 through this. First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon. Actually,

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,080
 you know what? Today I want to give a shout out. I don't know if I ever gave her a shout out for

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,080
 this. So today's shout out is going to be Audrey Mackamson. Everyone give a round of applause to

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
 Audrey as she's walking into Dead Rabbit Command. Do a little bow. She's not a Patreon supporter,

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,880
 but a long time ago I put out a bounty. You're like, Jason, you did reward her for this. We

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,720
 remember this. You just didn't put it down your notes. Audrey Mackamson, or makeum some, I put

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,160
 out a bounty for a Bigfoot USB. There was something called Bigfoot the track record,

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,480
 a Bigfoot Encyclopedia. And it had a, we covered the story. It was about Bigfoot hanging out in

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,640
 Oregon at near a place called Cock Rock, which is, which is a place where dudes go to bang each other.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,680
 But Bigfoot was there for some reason, just looking for love. Anyways, I'll put that episode in the

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,480
 show notes. You're like, no, Jason, tell us that story now. In that episode I mentioned there as a

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,360
 USB. It was like lost media. I didn't think I could ever find it. She found it. She sent me the link

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,920
 and I purchased it. And it's really cool. So Audrey, I wanted to really thank you for that. So

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,400
 you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode today. If you guys can't find an obscure

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,400
 piece of lost media for me, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show. Really,

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,680
 really helps out a lot. Also to give a shout out to the Patreons, there is currently a debate.

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 It's not a debate. Everyone agrees on the Patreon Discord. How much they hate me for being a fan of

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,000
 the Minecraft streamer dream. Apparently there's almost enough rising. I expect to lose a lot

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,240
 of Patreons this weekend because I do like dream. Audrey, oh, oh, we got, what am I talking about?

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,880
 We also got this amazing fan art for Fan Art Friday. I almost forgot because I'm not looking at it on

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,160
 my screen, but this was from the Patreon Discord. This was from a long time listener of the show,

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,520
 Patreon supporters will. Rudy Jazz, look at this. It's a little combination. Don't, if you're driving,

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,640
 if you're driving, you can look at it later. It's a combination of myself

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,000
 with the Dead Rabbit radio logo. So it's, I got my hair cut, I'm all wooly, and apparently I have

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,360
 the nose of a pig. I did not know that. I always assumed my nose was Romanesque and less chief

35
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,400
 wiggum, but whatever, I don't care either way. Rudy, thank you so much for providing this artwork

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,960
 for Fan Art Friday. It really is super duper awesome. Audrey, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,000
 keys to the Jason jet. We're actually going to leave behind Dead Rabbit, I forgot where we were

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,640
 going. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. You're going to vroom vroom us on out to

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:34,480
 Mexico. Audrey's flying us over the beautiful blue skies of the world,

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
 we're headed down to Mexico. Now this first story, it's a little intense. I'm not going to go into

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,160
 a lot of the details with it, honestly, because I think the implication is more important than the

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,800
 gruesomeness of it. On August 7th, 2021, you had a dude named Matthew Coleman of Santa Barbara.

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,840
 People are already skipping, they're like, nope, there's all this news, all this news,

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
 where's the fast forward button? On August 7th, 2021, Matthew Coleman of Santa Barbara

45
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,680
 decides to kidnap his own two children. Kalio, three years old, it only gets worse from here,

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,240
 unfortunately. Kalio is three years old and Roxy is 10 months old and takes his beautiful little

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,920
 babies down to Mexico. Shortly after that, their mother, Abby Coleman, his wife, reports her

48
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,560
 children missing. This is a pretty breaking news story. On August 7th, we're still getting drips

49
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
 and drips of information, but we don't know if the relationship was on the rocks, like if he

50
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,640
 was sending out warning signs that he may be planning to do something brutal. They're actually

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,280
 lived up in Santa Barbara, so he's driving out of Mexico and she reports them missing and the

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,680
 police are like, oh great. So I think there is more stuff going on. It wasn't like, oh I think

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,920
 he spent a little too long on this day trip. I think she alerted them that he's been having some

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,960
 mental health difficulties. Matthew Coleman is then coming across the border from Mexico back

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,440
 into the United States and everyone at the border had gotten a bolo for him, right? Be on the lookout

56
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,520
 for Matthew Coleman, so when his car comes, they stop him. Hey Matthew, he's arm and they know his

57
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,840
 name, he's like, oh, they start questioning him. They notice that there is droplets of blood in his

58
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,600
 car, like on a sheet of paper, and most horrifically, neither of his children are in the car. So Matthew

59
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,440
 Coleman is arrested, he is questioned, and it turns out that he took both of his children down to this

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:40,640
 farm in Mexico and shot them both with a spear gun. All that stuff is just horrific. All of that

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,400
 stuff is just absolutely horrific. It's a terrifying local news story and it happens all too often.

62
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,920
 The reason why I'm talking about it on Dead Rabbit Radio, even though this is a true crime

63
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,400
 podcast, we don't cover stuff like that. We do cover more stuff like that on the TikTok. We cover

64
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,920
 kind of these local weird creepy crime stories on the TikTok, but on the Shell Proper, I don't really

65
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,200
 talk about that type of stuff unless it's super bizarre. This is super bizarre because his motive,

66
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
 and this is why I think they probably, Abby was probably aware that there was some mental

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,040
 health difficulties going on prior to this. Matthew Coleman told the investigating officer,

68
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,280
 I believe it was an FBI officer, because you can read the affidavit on Crime Online,

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,720
 I'll put the link on the show notes, it's a really great website, I visit it every day.

70
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,880
 For my crime fix, I go to Crime Online, he tells the FBI agent, well, I had to kill him.

71
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:42,800
 I had to kill him because I learned the truth. You see, I am a, what you may call a conspiracy

72
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,440
 theorist. He's not as exact words, he wasn't talking like Heath Ledger's Joker or anything like that,

73
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,720
 but I'm kind of puffing it up for you. I can just read the affidavit, but that's no fun and it's kind

74
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,600
 of dark. He goes, listen, I've been learning about this stuff about the Illuminati and QAnon.

75
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,120
 Did you know about QAnon? The FBI agent goes, yes, I do read the newspaper, I'm aware of that term.

76
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,040
 He goes, but see, the Illuminati has opened my eyes to what's really going on in this world.

77
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:24,400
 You see, my wife and mother of my children is a reptilian. She has what's known as

78
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,400
 serpent DNA and she gave it to my children. Officer, I'm telling you this right now,

79
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,680
 those weren't children I killed in the desert.

80
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:45,760
 They were monsters. I didn't murder my children. I just saved the world.

81
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,280
 Now, even though that was me adding a bit of dramatic flair, the lights flickering,

82
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,280
 that is the gist. He did say QAnon and Illuminati conspiracy theories,

83
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,200
 and he quote, was receiving visions and signs revealing that his wife possessed serpent DNA

84
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,640
 and had passed it on to his children. And the phrase to save the world was also used in that

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,960
 affidavit as well. Terrifying story. Absolutely terrifying story. And I know right now there

86
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
 are already some people typing into the YouTube comments, maybe this is just a story to make

87
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,160
 conspiracy theorists look bad. Listen, there's already enough stuff that makes conspiracy

88
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,840
 theorists look bad. I would be hard pressed for a group to just pick out a local crime story,

89
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,680
 no matter how horrific. And this actually isn't in the top 10 most horrific crimes that have happened

90
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,480
 in the past month. I mean, for this family it is, and for this family it's the worst.

91
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,640
 But you know what I mean? Like if this was some sort of conspiracy, oh they're trying to make QAnon

92
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,880
 look bad, so they're gonna type, no, no, no. There's worse they could have chosen. There really is

93
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,320
 worse crimes they could have chosen. I do enjoy investigating conspiracy theories,

94
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,640
 and I love sharing them with you. And I think you guys sense that there's definitely at the very

95
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,280
 least an interest in conspiracy theories, and for me at the very most like a joy. Like I enjoy

96
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:13,280
 finding these things, and you guys are very well put together adults as well. But this guy had

97
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,120
 most likely an underlying mental illness and found the conspiracy theories as well. It's

98
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
 interesting because I think, I don't think this is going to become a huge major story, and they're

99
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,880
 going to try to use it to push away conspiracy theory content on YouTube or anything like that.

100
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,000
 But this is almost like the Freddy Krueger defense, which I don't think has ever been used. But if

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,440
 they did, that's a cool name for it, where somebody commits a crime based on a horror movie,

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,720
 and that person had been struggling with mental health issues their entire life,

103
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,360
 and then they became a huge fan of the Freddy Krueger franchise. They bought a time machine,

104
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
 went back to the 80s, they're a huge fan of Freddy Krueger, and they end up making a glove out of

105
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,520
 knives and stabbing someone to death. Or just took a knife and stabbed someone to death.

106
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:04,000
 One that's most likely happened already. But was Freddy Krueger to blame, were those horror

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,960
 movies to blame for the crime, or if he had watched The Wind and the Willows too many times,

108
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,360
 would he have dressed up like a frog and drowned people? Because the underlying mental illness

109
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,920
 is already there, and if it's untreated, that's really the key. If you can get it treated, you're

110
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,200
 fine. But if it's untreated, and you have the movie stimulating the thought pattern, would any

111
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
 movie do that? What if he was watching action movies all the time, would he want to go on a

112
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,920
 mass shooting rampage? So that's where I think this lies. I don't necessarily blame the conspiracy.

113
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,240
 I will say this though, Freddy Krueger and The Wind and the Willows and The Matrix,

114
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,480
 they don't ever imply that they're true, even though Nightmare on the Street was based on a

115
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
 true story. I'll put that episode in the show notes, it's really creepy. But the movies themselves

116
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,360
 don't apply to be true. These conspiracy theories are supposed to be true, so there might be more

117
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,280
 of an argument that the conspiracy theories weighed more on him. Actually that's a good point,

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,200
 because as I'm arguing with myself in a 90 degree closet, Freddy Krueger doesn't go now, well listen

119
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,880
 kids, this is a true story, this is what happens if you try to take vigilante justice

120
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,480
 against a child rapist. This is what will happen to you. We know it's fictional. And see when we

121
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,480
 look at conspiracy theories like, there's a whole group of population that has serpent DNA in them

122
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,040
 and they're going to pass an on. We've covered this conspiracy theory. Not only have we covered

123
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,440
 this conspiracy theory, oddly enough we've covered multiple times people have tried and

124
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,520
 successfully used spear guns to kill people, which is such a weird exotic weapon. We covered it when

125
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,240
 the guys were fighting on the airliner and we covered it with the guy who killed his family

126
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,120
 using a spear gun. But anyways, I'll put those episodes in the show notes, it's not an advertisement,

127
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,160
 I'm not using that as an advertisement, it's a weapon of choice, but we did cover the serpent

128
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,560
 seed conspiracy theory once, there was a minister who believed that people were passing this around,

129
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,440
 and that's a quite foolish conspiracy theory. That's one of the ones where I'd be like, wait,

130
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,800
 well if we can't detect it, if we can't detect that serpent DNA, like you look at a microscope,

131
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
 you see a regular little sperm, and then you look and there's little microscopic

132
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
 alligator-strung ethosperm, you can't detect that there's serpent DNA in there, you can't

133
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
 scientifically do anything, it's quite foolish. But he was having these visions and seeing these

134
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,080
 signs as well, he's probably flipping through the radio station and every so often the song

135
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,080
 Man Eater would start playing and he's like, oh, Man Eater, that's like an alligator, and

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,840
 he puts this stuff together and, but who knows, it's tragic and it goes to show that sometimes

137
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,360
 when you take these conspiracy theories too seriously, plus, I don't think that can just be

138
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,440
 your kind of believing stuff that doesn't exist if you believe in every conspiracy theory,

139
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,200
 you take it, someone believes the earth is flat, it doesn't affect you in any way, shape, or form,

140
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,160
 it really doesn't, so I don't care about it, I think it's dumb, but it doesn't affect me in any

141
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,400
 way or other people. But when you take that conspiracy theory and you put an underlying

142
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,440
 mental illness to it, that's the problem, I think that's really the problem and I think that's

143
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,400
 the main issue here. If people want to believe that 10% of the population is reptilian, whatever,

144
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,320
 then the only way you can become famous and rich and powerful is to either be reptilian,

145
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,840
 or to join the reptilian core or whatever, have a little reptilian badge ask me about my

146
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,880
 reptilian ancestry, whatever, that doesn't affect us in any way, shape, or form, and if they just go

147
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,680
 "ah, Queen Elizabeth, she's a big old reptile, I saw her laying an egg, it's all laying an egg the

148
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,760
 other day and Meghan Markle popped out of it, whatever, who cares, like that really doesn't

149
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,880
 affect us." If that person is then going to do something violent, which is the extreme minority,

150
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,920
 which most conspiracy theorists, they don't do anything like that, but there's the extreme minority,

151
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,200
 there's a stream minority of people who love motocross, who are also using their dirt bikes

152
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:56,640
 to run drugs across the country and maybe to run over their enemies faces. They have to wait till

153
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,320
 their enemies sleep in and then like "ring, ring, ring," they got the silence around their bike.

154
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,240
 There's a small minority of every group, but we are conspiracy theorists, or at least we enjoy

155
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,560
 conspiracy theories and this one unfortunately, whether or not the conspiracy theory England

156
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,560
 is an unfortunate true crime, I'm not trying to gloss over that, but I thought it would be

157
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,160
 interesting for us to take a look at because we enjoy these topics, sometimes people take them too

158
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,880
 far and have other mental issues and the people who really paid for this was the two children,

159
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,760
 Kaleo and Roxy and then Abby and then everyone who loved those people. Matthew Coleman, who cares

160
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:46,160
 about that? Anyways, I won't cuss on the family episode, I won't cuss on this family podcast

161
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,920
 where I just talked about this horrible brutal crime. Awful, awful, awful, you just, you don't even

162
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,680
 want to think about it, but Audrey, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbenter

163
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,080
 copter. We are leaving behind Mexico, such a sad story, and we are headed on out to the Vologadot,

164
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:12,320
 what a baby name this place, you're like no Jason, you're just mispronouncing it. Vologadot

165
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:26,480
 region in Russia. In the Vologadot region in Russia, it's August 2nd 1982. Wow, I didn't even plan

166
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:35,440
 that, that's almost 21 years ago. Jason, how hot is it in that closet? That's not even cool,

167
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:43,280
 that's like 40 something years ago. Anyways, close enough, it's 1.15 pm, we're in the Vologadot

168
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:50,000
 region in Russia, and there's a young woman, her name is Elle Smirnova, she's walking through this

169
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,480
 birch forest, having a good time, I don't know, doesn't actually say what her mood was,

170
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,080
 she could have been deeply depressed, but anyways, she's walking through the forest,

171
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:08,720
 and she hears a loud booming Russian voice, come closer, do not be afraid, the equipment is switched

172
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,840
 off, she's like is that the voice from Gumplet? Elle Smirnova needs food,

173
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,400
 badly, she's walking through this forest and she sees a clearing, and in the clearing is a UFO,

174
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,280
 a flying saucer, typical flying saucer, shiny metal just sitting on the ground, and she sees

175
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:36,160
 like three dudes walking around, one of them looks to be a white guy, and he has dark eyebrows with

176
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:44,480
 gray eyes, and then standing next to him are these two other dudes who look Japanese, and the white

177
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,840
 dude, she said they all looked around 25, so she is trying to gauge how attractive they are, she said

178
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:58,800
 the white dude starts smiling at her, and then goes Elk on seal, which apparently some alien thing,

179
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,720
 it's not Russian, she didn't understand it, and the two Japanese dudes leave them, they go and

180
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,680
 they walk by these stairs that are leading up into the UFO, I didn't describe the UFO, I have more

181
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,040
 stuff about the UFO, I'm too caught up in this romantic drama we're about to get entangled in,

182
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,520
 the UFO wasn't sitting on the ground so much as it had the little landing gear, and then it had

183
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,840
 these stairs, like how you would picture a UFO from a 1950s movie, and the stairs going up to

184
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,920
 the open doorway, and she said the door had these intricate designs of animals and plants on them,

185
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,280
 this little motif on the door, because if you're going to build a UFO, if you're going to build a

186
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,120
 vehicle that spins 90% of its time in the dark reaches of space, you want to have a nicely designed

187
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,200
 door, you want to show off to nothing, to the nothingness that lives in the cosmos, Elk and Sue,

188
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:03,600
 all of a sudden Elk starts to go, she starts getting dizzy and sleepy, and she's starting to

189
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
 think, oh no, I'm being hypnotized, I'm being hypnotized by this really handsome man in the

190
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,400
 middle of the woods, and she starts saying please don't hypnotize me, please, please don't hypnotize

191
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,160
 me, so he stops, and then he goes, well I was going to hypnotize you, but now I guess we'll have a

192
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:28,800
 conversation, he goes, my name is Oli Kan, I am Oli Kan from the planet sunny, S-U-N-N-Y,

193
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,520
 and this is where we really, the story's interesting, but this is where you really

194
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,600
 start to ask questions about it, I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com, they got it

195
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 from a magazine called Veer Russia, number 18, I couldn't really figure out what that digest was,

196
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,600
 it seems to be maybe some local newspaper for the town or province of Veer, T-V-E-R,

197
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
 that's not how you pronounce it, why do you even go to other countries,

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,960
 anyway so I don't know what that magazine is, but ThinkAboutItDocs.com has never stirred us

199
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:09,120
 wrong in the past, Oli Kan tells this woman, El, that he's from the planet sunny, and then the

200
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,680
 name is, I think he realized that that was probably a dumb name for a planet, because then he goes,

201
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,640
 oh yeah no no sunny, that's what those people need to call it, I call it Galeos, so there's

202
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,320
 actually two names for this planet which is weird, like I guess we have earth and then sometimes

203
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,840
 nerds call it Terra, but sunny or Galeos, it's one of the two, it's one of the two names, so

204
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,520
 if you're trying to fly to this planet you might get lost, that he said it's about 45 light-years away

205
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,440
 in the Ursa Majoris constellation, now he says that they're there in this particular, they're

206
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,560
 having this conversation, he goes, the reason why we're here in this particular location is we

207
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,880
 want to investigate some nearby atomic weapons, and El goes, oh well there's none in this area,

208
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,280
 there's no missile silos, we're fully aware of that, we have to fight back the evil capitalist

209
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,200
 pigs of the United States, and Oli Kan goes, well there actually are nuclear weapons here,

210
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,120
 he said about three kilometers away there's an underground bunker full of nuclear weapons,

211
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,360
 she's like three kilometers away, that's where my house is, he then pulls out a beige colored

212
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:25,840
 clock dial, and he begins to present holograms of her brain, she's able to see her brain and she

213
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,920
 sees regions of it are mapped out in green and red, it's very Christmassy, and after looking at a

214
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,880
 hologram of her brain, he doooo shuts off the device, doesn't shut off her brain, and he goes,

215
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,840
 quote, we will talk to you, you have a good memory, you don't smoke or drink alcohol, unquote,

216
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,120
 so if you've ever thought about it, if you're a fan of alien encounters, and you have either of those

217
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,440
 vices, um, stop it, stop doing that stuff, stop smoking and drinking, because someday you may

218
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,160
 mate an alien from the planet, he begins to quiz her, which we see a lot, you know, a lot of times

219
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,080
 humans don't have time to ask questions, because these aliens are asking so many questions, he's

220
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,560
 asking the weird stuff, like what do humans know about water, she's like, well, I mean there's two

221
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,640
 thirds of it, we have the most in the solar system, he wanted to know about all the elements, what we

222
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,600
 know about water, fire, sky and earth, he asked, oh, what's the meaning of the universe, she's just

223
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 sitting there, and he's like, oh wait, oh wait, we'll just sit here on this rock until we figure it

224
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,720
 out, he starts to ask, does she believe in God, does she read the Bible, she says she was a Christian,

225
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:42,800
 and she worshiped Jesus, to which Alican, the space alien, responded, Jesus, quote, was the man,

226
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,960
 unquote, I don't know if that's the equivalent of being like, oh, he's the man, or if it was saying

227
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,640
 that Jesus, yeah, that's the right guy, I don't know for sure, but he also said that our religious

228
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,600
 life, like just all of our religions in general, these guidelines were necessary, but just in the

229
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,640
 beginning, which is a kind of an interesting, interesting alien look at it, like all of the,

230
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,520
 maybe these religious rules that our societies follow, they're created in different ways all over

231
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,920
 the world, but these religious rules are created, but someday we move past them, I don't know,

232
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,200
 he begins to show her maps, they're having a long conversation here, he shows her a map of the ancient

233
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,600
 world, and then the world of how it is today, when he's showing her the map, and these are

234
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
 electronic maps, he's now rolling out these paper maps, when he's showing her these maps, he shows her

235
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,080
 these massive mineral deposits and unearthed riches in the modern world, he also said there's three

236
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,320
 undiscovered elements on the planet earth that humans don't know about yet, they're here, here,

237
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,880
 and here, and there's that one from behind her ear, and here you are, it's already active, she's

238
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,200
 all melting, no there's apparently three undiscovered elements we haven't discovered yet, and this is

239
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,040
 where we start to get into some really interesting stuff, Arlican then went on to say that in the

240
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,160
 year 2050 there's going to be massive climate change, it's going to ravage the world, floods,

241
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:21,040
 hurricanes, tornadoes, snowstorms, islands would disappear, all coastal cities would be underwater,

242
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:27,680
 so if you're big, if you're big in a windsurfing, 2050 is the year to be here, he also says that

243
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,200
 life is eternal, which I like this one, but there's also a little catch this one, life is eternal,

244
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,360
 it just kind of flows through the universe, life the soul force simply transfers from one

245
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,000
 form of energy into another and then to another and to another and it's endless, but not for everyone

246
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,880
 does this happen, so that's a really interesting again a little tidbit here, we're really kind of

247
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,600
 analyzing this because on the one hand you could go oh hell right someone who broke the religious

248
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,160
 code someone who didn't believe in the truth their soul does not continue to travel through the

249
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:11,680
 universe they go to hell, you could also go no enlightenment, you transfer forever through

250
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,600
 the universe and then eventually you've been everywhere and you are then enlightened and you

251
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,680
 go somewhere else or simply obliterated what what else is there you've ascended you've

252
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,920
 experienced everything or more those are both kind of older theories or you could say NPCs,

253
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,560
 the current relatively new couple year old conspiracy theory of there are a lot of people

254
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,480
 out there who are non-player characters who don't have a soul they are simply moving about society

255
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,920
 and they don't have the life force that the rest of us have, one thing I thought was interesting

256
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,080
 and this guy's dropping knowledge to this guy's dropping bombs not literally he's not dropping

257
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,000
 atomic bombs, he says that a lot of the UFOs we see are remote controlled which is back in 1982

258
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 remote control obviously was a thing but it's not as popular as with drones are today but he goes

259
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:05,280
 most UFOs you see are not piloted by life forms most of them are remote controlled they're on the

260
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,360
 other side of the moon there's a base on the dark side of the moon there's a base over there so

261
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,360
 I'm not gonna he didn't give an actual statistic like nine out of ten he just says most of them

262
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,880
 most of the UFOs you see if they crash there'd be nothing on board which wouldn't make sense the

263
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,040
 risk is much lower to be discovered the chances of losing an entire experienced crew is zero if

264
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,840
 they're on a base somewhere and they're flying the UFO like because drone technology has advanced

265
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:37,360
 so much you would have to assume that alien drone technology would be light literal light years ahead

266
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,720
 of us don't want to make sense to put three tiny people on a ship on a crowded little ship and shoot

267
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,200
 them across the cosmos you could shoot them across the cosmos but then they set up a base on Mars

268
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,560
 then they use that to interact with us sending little UFOs that he ends his conversation with

269
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,560
 this he says that on his planet there's a population of 200 million people there's no

270
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,960
 skyscrapers all the buildings are pretty level we'll get into that's a really important detail

271
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,800
 in a second he says there's no starvation because they all eat albumin which I had to look that up

272
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:17,920
 it's egg white that's their entire diet is egg white and he goes they make it they have this

273
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,720
 process that they can make tons of albumin in one minute they don't eat a ton of shit they're like

274
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,320
 step one get 10 trillion chickens no they can mass produce his albumin and they eat it that's the

275
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,200
 only food they need I'm sure they probably make it tastier like putting spices in it and make it

276
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,960
 shaped like a chicken and then eat it who knows maybe they do but it doesn't matter that's all they

277
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,960
 eat doesn't matter what it looks like it's still egg white and he goes there's no starvation and he

278
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,080
 offers L the recipe he goes how would you like to be able to make tons of albumin in a minute and

279
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,240
 she refuses he's like that's so disgusting that's so gross even though I live in the so eat union in

280
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,800
 1982 I would rather stand in a bread line than just eat egg white that's pretty much the end

281
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,000
 of the conversation he does say I'll see you again every four years and they did return in 1986

282
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,920
 1990 and 1994 it's a typical alien story we have kind of a communication of ideas you have her

283
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,160
 kind of being shocked by the presence of these guys very typical the reason why I wanted to cover it

284
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,320
 is not for all that so if it is interesting I always think it's interesting when aliens talk

285
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,040
 about religion it seems like such a man-made thing but we see all these stories that make us

286
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:42,480
 think it's something else but what if aliens are dumb is the point of this story because I saved

287
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,680
 some stuff here for the end we kind of sprinkled it on throughout but the undisclosed see I still

288
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,560
 what's I think science I think science is wrong I think you could have undiscovered elements out

289
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,120
 there I do I think that we don't know what we don't know it's a phrase I use a lot in my personal

290
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,560
 life we don't know what we don't know but then there's stuff that this alien says that is noably

291
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,840
 false it's absolutely not true so let's go back to when he said that the buildings on his planet

292
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,120
 were not skyscrapers he's talking about climate change he's talking about the elements he's talking

293
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:27,600
 about life being eternal flowing through the universe he also says that we are a lopsided planet

294
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,840
 he tells this woman in 1982 listen lady I know you're just some girl walking through the woods but

295
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,040
 you have a serious problem you need to address people have built buildings on the wrong side of

296
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:48,880
 the planet so because we have skyscrapers and they're not evenly spread out like our civilizations

297
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:56,320
 are tend to be along the coastlines and along rivers we've actually unbalanced the world

298
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:04,160
 the buildings are making the world wobble a little too much and it's actually gonna make the earth

299
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,440
 if you don't lady if you don't in the middle of the woods and Russia fix this if you guys keep

300
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,880
 building cities and the population keeps growing the planet earth is actually going to fly out of

301
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,520
 orbit it's actually gonna get so wobbly you're like fine you're putting the last rivet in this new

302
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:31,200
 building they're like hand me that rivet Tony finally that this building is done and then

303
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,800
 all of a sudden whoa the next thing you know we're orbiting Jupiter that is not possible I don't

304
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,280
 even think I have to explain the science of why that's not possible but I will because I actually

305
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,760
 think it's super interesting everything on this planet is from this planet like when we build a

306
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,160
 massive skyscraper all that stuff is from the planet we're not adding anything to the planet

307
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,920
 or taking anything away we're just building this skyscraper and I did an episode on this a long

308
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,960
 time ago because I was curious about this how to look it up the earth gets heavier every single year

309
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:13,200
 by tons gets heavier every single year through space dust and meteorite impacts so the world gets

310
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,920
 heavier and bigger every year it doesn't matter what we do as far as building the stuff it's

311
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,720
 interesting because as he is so on his planet there's no uneven buildings all everything was

312
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,560
 perfectly mapped out so their planet didn't go wobbling off into the cosmos if we keep building

313
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,320
 along coastal lines and it's not I keep saying skyscraper it's not even really the size of the

314
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,440
 buildings like that's part of it but just if you have too many even small buildings on one side of

315
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,360
 the planet the planet's gonna fly out of orbit people forget how massive earth is that's the thing

316
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,760
 with the flat earth theory they go way up and they're like I don't see the curve the earth is so

317
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,880
 huge like even just the size of the earth can be mind-boggling sometimes what's interesting is if

318
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,360
 coastal he talked about the climate change if the coastal cities are wiped out in 2050 that'll

319
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,360
 actually reset the clock because all of that coastal buildings all of those uneven cities will

320
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:12,800
 actually save so he's saying climate change is good so so so take that youtube take that youtube

321
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,360
 algorithm that's gonna hear me say climate change is good and do something funky to this video

322
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,720
 he also says that you know when he was showing the I left this part out because I wanted to add

323
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,600
 it to the end he said when he was showing the map of the ancient world he said the pyramids were built

324
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,480
 with the assistance of aliens in fact it wasn't just myself I'm not not 10 000 years old wasn't

325
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,400
 just our alien race there were five different star systems worth of aliens they all came down to

326
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:50,240
 build these pyramids but the pyramids exude an ionized poison so you can't go near them

327
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,600
 if you're around the pyramids too long it'll kill both humans and aliens because they're just these

328
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,320
 powerful that's not true that's not true now if you told somebody that in 1982 Russia it might

329
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,040
 might I mean they weren't bumpkins that might have raised an eyebrow or three because she's

330
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,640
 living near that radioactive bomb factory but that's not true like there are I'm not saying

331
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,640
 there's like people living right next to the pyramids but there are people who make their job

332
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,160
 their tour guides around the pyramids they're not mutants they're not ionized poisonous freaks

333
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,840
 unless that's the biggest cover up of all maybe I've exposed the biggest conspiracy I just dropped

334
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,960
 the ultimate red pill the pyramid pill so it's an issue this story is just kind of interesting

335
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,520
 look at because the aliens fly away and she has this information he put she passes it on to the

336
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,240
 journalist and we have this story but what if aliens are wrong aliens are interesting because

337
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,800
 it's the one paranormal phenomenon that we assume is smarter than us like sure people look to angels

338
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,960
 and demons for guidance when people look to demons for shortcuts people look to demons for shortcuts

339
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
 because they want to get rich and famous so they don't have any of that Serban DNA in them

340
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,800
 they weren't lucky enough to have that made-up thing put inside their body so they'll turn to

341
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,360
 demonic forces to become rich and famous they'll look for shortcuts people talk to angels for

342
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,440
 protection but ghosts people even when they're like talking to ghosts maybe they'll want to know

343
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,560
 the future but no one's ever like using a Ouija board to find the answer to some equation or to

344
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,640
 find the cure for cancer to do something like which they should now that I think about it

345
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
 we we did cover the soul phone the people who are trying to build the phone

346
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,880
 I'll put that episode in the show notes every time I say that phrase it costs me five extra

347
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,360
 minutes at work guys I have to go full of the episode but the soul phone they were trying to

348
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,200
 get this phone built so they could talk to the dead and to help with scientific advances but for

349
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,080
 the most part go start the spooky people who hang out in your closets and stand in dark hallways big

350
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,840
 foot is just a big old dummy trying to try to hook up with some dudes at cock rock in Oregon

351
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,920
 you know I mean cryptids are just these monsters aliens are the ones we assume are smarter than

352
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,800
 ourselves and and it's interesting because it is it does have a bit of the demonic in it that we

353
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,600
 want them to solve our problems there's people who believe aliens are going to invade the planet but

354
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,960
 there's a lot of alien enthusiasts who believe they're going to save the planet they're going to help

355
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,120
 cure us they're going to bring us together in a good way we become part of the space brotherhood

356
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:24,240
 it's a shortcut because we can't do it ourselves we can't do it ourselves right we can't see past

357
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,800
 each other's differences and we can't you hold each other's hands with people that we absolutely

358
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,440
 hate and realize that all of this stuff is so fleeting what's the point let's be together now

359
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,520
 we can't do that we can't do that as a people we can't do that as cultures so aliens can do it

360
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,080
 alien it's a shortcut it's a shortcut we don't want to do it ourselves but what if they're wrong

361
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:52,800
 like what if they are wrong the uneven city thing just is scientifically invalid it's an

362
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,960
 interesting story because what he's saying is false and we put a lot of faith in these aliens

363
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,840
 to come down and save us and we covered recently like what if aliens are demonic what if they're

364
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,680
 trying to take over the world what if it's not even that sinister what if they're just as dumb as we

365
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,560
 are sometimes they just give bad advice what if a fleet of UFOs came down tomorrow and said this

366
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:23,680
 stuff you'll find these undiscovered elements life is eternal move move your cities around or the

367
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,880
 world's gonna go full how would people take that they clearly are smarter than us they have this

368
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,800
 fleet of UFOs they've descended from the heavens they're clearly more technologically advanced

369
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,200
 from us would we as a species be smart enough to go you're wrong like you may be smarter than us in

370
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,160
 some stuff but that's not true we know who would your your planet may be wobbly it's funny i say

371
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,960
 well we do we know the answer most people would acquiesce to the aliens they go well they must

372
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:05,360
 know more than us let's start changing the way we build cities and that would be the least of my

373
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,920
 worries right imagine if they go these aliens no way more than us they have all this advanced

374
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,720
 technology they've shown us where these riches are we haven't found these undiscovered elements yet

375
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,040
 but they've shown us where these riches are we've moved our cities and everything seems to be great

376
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,080
 they also only have a population of 200 a million we're seven billion

377
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:40,560
 they know more than us maybe that's the correct thing to do as well sometimes when we listen

378
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:49,200
 to the so-called smartest people in the room we end up making the dumbest and deadliest decisions

379
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:58,480
