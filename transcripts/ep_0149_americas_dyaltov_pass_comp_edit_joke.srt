1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 One man declares war on an entire nation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 And then we take a look at-

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 (laughs)

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 It's my movie trailer voice.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we take a look at the mysterious disappearance of five men on a dark, snowy night.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 There are no one as the Yuba County Five,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 but it's also no one as the American D'Otloff Pass, today on Dead Ravv Radio.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 (music)

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravv Radio.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host Jason Garbender.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Merch Store is up.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 If you want to support the channel, you can wear our merch around town.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We'll buy it first, but after you buy it, wear it around town.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Everyone will go, "Hey, where'd you get that cool shirt?"

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And you go, "I got it from a merch store online."

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And they go, "Which one?"

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 And you're like, "Uh, I don't know.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Just go to deadravv.com and listen to the podcast and then buy a shirt if you like it."

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And they'll be like, "Cool."

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So we got a lot of good stuff for you this week.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I've actually found a lot of stories about badasses.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I didn't find five, and I know there's hundreds, but it's what I can find in the time I wanted.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 But I found some good ones.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I was thinking, "I could do a badass week."

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And I was like, "Nah, am I pushing it?"

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 But what we're going to do right now is we're going to take a journey back in time.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And it's funny because I'm going to tell you the story and you're like,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 "Whoa, that's a cool setup for a movie."

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And it is, but there's some problems why they won't make a movie about it.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Before we get started, too, I wanted to address this real quick.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We're about to talk about a guy who is a slave owner in the South.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Not like it would have been any better if he was in the North, but he's a slave owner.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 He's not a Confederate soldier.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 He's not a supporter of the Confederacy.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 But he's a slave owner, and I don't sugarcoat that at any point when I'm going to be talking about this.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 That's despicable.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Nobody should ever hold another person in bondage anywhere.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And then in America, we have the added element of the racism, of the institutional racism embedded into the slave trade.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So I don't want there to be any confusion about, "That's badass," or, "It's real badass that he had this huge plantation."

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 No, I'm not talking about that.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I'm talking about the adventure he goes on.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And I think it's really interesting because the adventure that he goes on is badass.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But it will always be marred by his personal choices to be a slave owner.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 You could say he was the product of the time, but I don't really buy that.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 When you're talking to someone who's using different language in the 70s and now it's uncouth to say those words today, fine.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But when you own slaves, you had to know that was wrong even back then.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Or just assume they were less than you.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 So I don't buy that.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 It was a very efficient way for him to run his plantation.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But when you buy into these racist beliefs, it overshadows the rest of your life.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Like when you're that a part of a system, the adventure he goes on in any other location, it would be a story that they would make movies out of.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 "Red Baron" was an enemy of the United States and Britain, and there's still movies about Red Baron.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 He's such a romantic figure even though he was a villain to the victors of that war.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And this guy, the only thing that I don't like about this story is that he's a slave owner.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And that's why I'll keep bringing it up, because I don't want to whitewash that.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Everything else is badass.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 A man on a mission.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 But unfortunately, before the mission started, before he left the Shire and went to Mount Doom, he had a bunch of slaves.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Which just solies the whole thing.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But it's still a very interesting story.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 I just wanted to clear that up if there was any confusion going forward.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 He did do horrible things, and I don't want to whitewash that or say it was a product of his time or anything like that.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I just find the story that comes after that badass.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And it is. I just wish he was a better person all around rather than just the last couple months of his life when he was killing Union soldiers.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Let's go ahead and get this story started.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 We're going back in time. We've got to blend in with the population.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 So we're going to bring the Jason Jalopy.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 [Jalopy makes a sound of a gun]

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 But we put some paper mache horses on it so people think that it's just a carriage.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Because we're actually going back to the beginnings of the Civil War.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 We're going to Tennessee.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And specifically, we're going there to meet a man.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 His name is Jack Henson.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Now Jack Henson was a southerner.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 He had slaves.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So that's one reason why they don't want to make the movie.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 He has slaves. He has a family.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But he wants to remain neutral in the Civil War.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 He's like, "I don't want to get involved in this in any way, shape or form."

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 But it's raging around him.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 So he's completely neutral.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 His little farmland, well it wasn't little.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 There's a plantation full of slaves.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 He was neutral. He's like, "I'm not going to support either side.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I don't want anything to do with Civil War.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I'm an honest man with a bunch of slaves.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I don't want to get involved."

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Now, eventually Union troops did take over his area.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And people are like, "We got to fight back. We got to be like this guerrilla force."

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And Jack's like, "Nope. We're not going to do it. We're businessmen.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 We got families. We're not going to get involved in this war in any way, shape or form.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And you shouldn't either.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 The war is between generals and these big powers.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 We're just landowners with slaves.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And everyone's like, "Yeah, I guess that kind of makes sense."

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Someone goes, "What if we lose?"

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 He's like, "We'll deal with that later.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But we don't need to get involved in the bloodshed."

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Ulysses S. Grant actually came to the area.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 General Ulysses Grant at that time.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Met Jack Hinson.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Jack's like, "Hey, listen. I'm totally neutral in this.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I don't really care who wins or loses.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It's no skin off my back."

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 As Ulysses Grant is looking at the slaves over there.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah. Ignore this, guys.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 But why don't you stay at my house?"

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 They actually became not necessarily friends, but acquaintances.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And General Grant stayed at Jack Hinson's house.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So the other people in town were getting a little irritated

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 that Hinson wasn't taking the side of the south.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 But he's like, "I'm not going to do it."

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Two of his sons, one joined a southern army

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 and the other one joined like a militia unit.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Like, well, they were all kind of militia units,

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 but one of them joined this other group.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But so they went, they left though. They were gone.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But he still had other boys. He had his wife.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He had his property, including, again, the slaves.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So again, I have to keep hammering that home

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 because that's why they won't make a movie about this guy

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 regardless of how badass he is.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 At the end of the day, he was a slave owner.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He was like, "I'm going to stay out of it."

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Now, in this area, they started having these things called bushwhackers,

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 which I always thought was a Australian term.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Apparently, it was a term that comes from the Civil War

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 because these people would jump out of bushes and whack you.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It was basically a guerrilla army in Tennessee

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 that was just shooting at Union troops.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And so the Union officer, like the commanding dude down there,

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 said, "Okay, zero tolerance to bushwhackers.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 We're going to kill them on site."

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 One day, two of Jack's sons were out hunting on their property.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 We're like hunting rabbits with their rifles.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And they stumbled across some Union troops.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 The Union troops shot them dead right there.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 "Drag their bodies into town."

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They knew who the kids were.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 "Drag their bodies into town to show everyone this is what happens to bushwhackers."

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Chopped their heads off and then put them on the spiked fence at Jack Henson's property.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And the officer was going to arrest the whole family at that point for it.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Knowing bushwhackers?

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And someone said, "General Grant knows this guy."

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Like, General Grant has stated this house,

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 "You probably don't want to arrest him."

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Now, he should have known that before he shot the boys,

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 but he's like, "Okay, I'm not going to arrest him."

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 But you watch out, Jack, because if we got your sons, we'll keep an eye on you.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Now, Jack Henson does what I think any man would do in a situation like this.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Maybe not any man, but he said goodbye to his family.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 He's like, "Okay, I gotta take care of some stuff now."

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 He then frees the slaves, so they can put that in the movie.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 They can just start the movie off with him going,

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 "Goodbye, goodbye, guys who were totally voluntary workers here."

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And they're like, "Bye."

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And then forget all the slave stuff.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 So after he says goodbye to his family and his former slaves,

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 very important former slaves, he goes to a weaponsmith and says,

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 "I can see him dropping down this piece of paper and be like,

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 'Can you build this?'" And the weaponsmith puts on his little glasses

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 and is like, "What are you hunting with this?"

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And Jack goes, "I'm hunting for justice."

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 He has constructed a 50-caliber rifle that is a 41-inch long barrel that's hexagonal

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 because he felt that was more accurate than the smooth, bore barrels that were popular at the time.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 A 50-caliber rifle.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And he's just walking around, well, not like walking around a broad daylight with a giant rifle,

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 but he's hunting the officer, the man responsible for killing his sons.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Guy's eating soup.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 "Mmm, this is some good old-timey soup. What's in it?"

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And they're like, "Beans, what else is an old-timey soup?"

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He's like, "Mmm."

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Bullet right through the brain.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 [BOOM]

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Falls all over.

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Then he's like, "Okay."

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And at that time people are like, "Well, that's kind of weird."

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Like, "Okay, you know, we're at war."

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 You know, the guy gets his brains blown out. This kind of happens.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 But then a short time later, he finds the guy who was responsible for the commanding officer

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 who actually put the heads on the pikes and threatened the families.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 The first one was just the guy who ordered the killing of his sons on the spot.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 He finds the guy in charge.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 That guy will say, "I don't know, it's flying a kite."

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He's like, "Man, this sure is fun taking a break from the war. I'm just flying this kite.

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I'm looking straight up and not anywhere around me.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 My situational awareness is nil."

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 [BOOM]

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 50 caliber bullet through the chest just blows him to pieces.

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 [BOOM]

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Kite goes flying off into the distance.

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Little known fact, that kite just got lost. There's no fact of that.

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So anyways, the...

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 At this point, now the Union soldiers are like, "Okay, the first one we thought maybe was just this random shooting,

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 but now that two people have been killed by the same gun."

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I guess they don't want to CSI back then. They don't know it's the same gun.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 But they go, "Now that two people have been killed in relation to Jack Hinson's sons being killed,

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and he sent all of his slaves away, and they're like, "That was good."

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And he sent his family away. It has to be Jack. It has to be Jack Hinson.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But at this point, it honestly seems like there was a bit of a lull.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Now, I'll also say there's not a ton of information about what happens between now and later.

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 This is the last event we really know a lot about.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But it's... It comes across like he would have stopped because he got vengeance against those two guys.

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But the Union troops, in retaliation for those murders, burned down his property.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Burned down his house. He's like, "Oh no, my slave quarters!"

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 He's like, "I mean, my employee barracks, the whole field, the whole house, everything is destroyed."

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And Jack Hinson is like, "Now, they've gone too far."

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 He becomes a one-man killing machine. He's basically, at this point, for the next few years,

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 running through the wilderness of Tennessee, blowing the brains out of any Union officer he meets.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He was shooting top staff. He wasn't shooting privates.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He wasn't shooting like low-level cooks and stuff like that.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 He wanted every bullet to count. He wanted every bullet to wear down the Union war machine.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And this is from a guy who was 100% neutral up until the point that the Union went after him.

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Now, because the Union won the war, there's not a lot of folk tales about this guy.

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 These are basically the few facts that we know.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 They sent four regiments of troops out into the wilderness looking for him.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Couldn't find him. He was a straight-up ghost. He died of old age.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 We know that for a fact. And when he went on the run after the Civil War, he was a wanted man.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And it's always been one of those things that they don't have an accurate kill count for this guy.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 His rifle had 36 notches on it.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And because he would talk to his family about it, like, he ended up reconnecting with his family later on.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Two of his other sons died of other things during the war.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But he got away. He told his family about the stuff.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And he would notch his rifle if he shot someone and was able to confirm the kill.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Basically, to see the body or to, like, kick it was kind of the thing.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Like, you'd shoot a person, you'd have to confirm the kill.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 If he just shot someone and they ran away, he wouldn't notch it.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 So his official count by his standards was 36 kills with this .50 caliber rifle during the Civil War.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Historians believe that the kill count was as high as 100 kills.

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 100 officers that he shot that then were rushed away for medical treatment and died.

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And he would never know about that.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And historians think of that for a couple reasons, but one of them is having four regiments of troops looking for this guy.

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 That's a huge amount of troops to have searching for one guy, so they think he was doing massive damage to the Union war machine down there.

236
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Generally, officers don't get killed.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Generally, officers aren't targeted.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Even though that's your best play, if you see an officer in 20 men, your best play is to kill the officer.

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Another officer on the other side doesn't necessarily want to order that because it's kind of like this rule of war.

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 But that's what he was aiming for. He was aiming for the top brass.

241
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 He wanted to smear it all over the dirt and stifle that march across his state.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And again, I don't think even when he was walking around blowing people up, that he really cared about the Civil War.

243
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 He just wanted revenge.

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And he got it. He died an old man in bed with his trusty rifle with 36 notches on it, which again, the accounts probably tripled that.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 But it's funny because as I'm reading the story, I was like, in any other circumstance, I think this could be a really dope action film.

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And it basically was the Patriot. It basically was that Mill Gibson movie where he's running around with Tomahawks attacking British people.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 This guy, though, he's real, but, you know, the slaves.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I could see the movie trailer where they're like, coming this June, one man pushed to the brink, let my sons alone, why ya pfft pfft, nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And he did like a quick montage of him building the gun. In my version, he builds the gun himself and he's testing it.

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And in this version, there's no slaves. There's no slaves.

251
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Well, I mean, it's the Civil War, so there are slaves, but he doesn't own any of them.

252
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Or, better yet, they show him sitting in his plantation and they're like, you know if the South loses, slavery loses.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And he turns and he goes, slavery should lose.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Dun-un-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And then there's the British bastards thing where Jack Henson is the one who kills Abraham Lincoln.

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 That's the 36 notch. We find out Abraham Lincoln underneath his top hat has the severed heads of Jack Henson's sons.

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So why he wears that giant top hat? Never mind the movie will never be made, but I do think it's an interesting story.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Again, a man pushed too far. A man pushed too far. If his sons weren't killed, basically he traded two lives for 100 lives.

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And he would have never taken that trade. The Union was stupid for doing it, but yeah, push a man too far.

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Who knows how to snipe people? That's kind of what happens.

261
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 So I hope you learned your lesson, the army of the North.

262
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story, because that one's getting really, I'm getting in a lot of trouble with that one.

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So next story is a really interesting one. Now I said in the beginning that it's no one as the American D'Otlof pass.

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Now that phrase may not mean something to a lot of you.

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 D'Otlof pass is a very, very intriguing mystery that came out of Russia back in the late 70s, early 80s, I believe.

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's a case, and I'm going to say this now that I don't even know the date, but it was a case that I've looked a lot into.

267
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 It's very, very fascinating. A group of campers, hikers go up into this forbidden area known as the D'Otlof pass,

268
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 not forbidden by the military, but it's just a cursed, known as a cursed area by the locals.

269
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And they all die in super weird ways one night.

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Now there are scientists and psychologists who can go, "We think this is what happened."

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It was an avalanche, and then people had mental breakdowns and stuff like that, but there's a lot of just weird things.

272
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Like one guy cut his way out of the tent from the inside, and people poured out into the darkness, and they all kind of died.

273
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 One guy was missing his tongue. It's just this really creepy thing.

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 There's been all sorts of stuff, whether it's like UFO, I might do an episode on it.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I'm kind of on the fence about it because it's fairly well known, but it's been connected to everything from UFOs,

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 to demonic forces, to an avalanche, to some sort of Russian weapon that was being tested.

277
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 The one we're going to talk about today, though, isn't as well known.

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And it has been nicknamed the American D'Otlof Pass because it's just so mysterious.

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 So we're going to California, my home state. The year is 1978.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And we have five men, five special needs men, on their way to a basketball tournament.

281
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Now, they weren't the level of special needs where they needed adult supervision all the time.

282
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 These five men, this basketball team, was driving around.

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Don't you need six people for a basketball team, or am I getting that confused with that Marlon Wayne's movie?

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I guess the sixth man was the ghost in that movie, so maybe you only need five people for a basketball team.

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But anyways, these five guys were on their way to compete in a special Olympics event, which is cool.

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 I have friends who do special Olympics.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But I thought this was an interesting detail.

288
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 These five men, they're adults. They're driving around on their own.

289
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 These five men were on their way to a special Olympics basketball tournament where if they won,

290
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 they would win a trip to Disneyland. Just give them the trip.

291
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 When I read that, I was like, "Really? You're going to make a bunch of special needs people play super aggressive basketball

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 because the winning team goes to Disneyland and the losing team does nothing."

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 That's a lot of stress to put on.

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 That's a lot of stress to put on anybody.

295
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But then you have special needs.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Just send them to Disneyland, dude.

297
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 When I read that, I'm like, "That's quite heartless."

298
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 To basically dangle that in front of somebody, being like, "It's not super aggressive basketball.

299
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 It's a special Olympics.

300
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 It shouldn't be so competitive that the losers actually lose."

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I'm not saying everyone needs a trophy, but it's Disneyland.

302
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And then the recent time I was reading the article, I kept imagining this super aggressive coach,

303
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 like an old school 1970s basketball coach throwing chairs across the gym

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 and being like, "Get your head in the goddamn game. You want to go to Disneyland?

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Get the fuck out there and play."

306
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And people are like, "What the fuck is this? This is a special Olympics."

307
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I want to see. That's the movie I want to see.

308
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 The Civil War movie would be cool, but I would love to see a movie about a super aggressive basketball coach

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 who has to coach the special Olympics.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And the joke isn't that. I just got to say this.

311
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 The joke isn't that like, "Ha ha, look at those guys playing special Olympics."

312
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 The joke is this guy is taking this way too seriously.

313
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I just can't. The rest of the time I'm reading this article, I'm thinking, this coach is like,

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 "Hey, come here, come here. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

315
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "Hey, come here, come here. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. What's your fucking problem? You want to go to Disneyland? You like Minnie Mouse? You like Minnie Mouse? Yeah, yeah, I like Minnie Mouse."

316
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 See that guy over there? Do you see him? He's going to be balls deep in Minnie Mouse.

317
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 If you don't make this goddamn shot, go back in there. That's the movie I want to see.

318
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 That's the movie I want to see.

319
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 So I have to admit, I was quite distracted the rest of the time I was researching this

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 because I kept imagining this crazy basketball coach harassing them.

321
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 However, we will move on as best as we can. These five dudes, they don't go to Disneyland, spoiler alert.

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 That is not what happens in this story. They are driving through California. They're up in Yuba County.

323
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 They stop at a convenience store around 10 p.m. where they're sighted, buying snacks and stuff like that.

324
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And then, for the most part, they're never seen again.

325
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Because 70 miles away from the convenience store, their car is found on a forest road in Plumas National Forest, completely abandoned.

326
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Deep, deep snow surrounding everything. They were driving up over the mountains.

327
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Their car got stuck in the snow off the main road on a forest road in super deep snow.

328
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 No sign of the people.

329
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 What happened was when they didn't get to where they were supposed to go, obviously their loved ones were like, "Hey, these kids, the..."

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Well, they're not kids, but these adults, they're special needs.

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 They would have been here. We think something might have happened to them.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There was no way they would miss that basketball game at all.

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So the cops begin looking, kind of looking in the area. They end up finding the car.

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 This was a little condescending. This was a quote from a police officer at the scene, little condescending.

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 They find the car. This is the actual quote.

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 "The car was littered with candy wrappers, basketball programs, milk cartons, and other material indicating a good time."

337
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Do you think he would have said that if it was five, like, pro-college players?

338
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 That would raise so many suspicions.

339
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 If they found a car that was being driven by college-level basketball players, and it's in the middle of nowhere,

340
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 and they find this, and these are like high-level basketball players, one of them is about to get drafted into the NPA.

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 They find the car, and it's full of candy wrappers, basketball programs, milk cartons.

342
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 They would not say, "Man, it looks like they had a good time."

343
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I think that's a little condescending. I think it's because their special needs that they're like, "Aww, isn't that cute. They're drinking milk."

344
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 That would raise suspicions with any other group. So I was like, "That's a little condescending."

345
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That cop's kind of a dick to these dudes. But that was all they had.

346
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 They had these milk cartons, and curiously enough, each milk carton had the face of the missing person on their own milk carton.

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 No, that didn't happen. But anyways, that would have been cool, and creepy, and that would be a totally different episode.

348
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But these guys go missing, and they're thinking, "What happened? We have no idea."

349
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But one guy might hold the key. His name is Joseph Shones.

350
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He was farther up the mountain from where they found the car full of milk cartons, but he's up there that same night, and his car gets stuck in the snow.

351
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And he's like in his fifties, and he's like, "Oh crap, I gotta dig my car out."

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Pulls out his little shovel, starts digging the snow away, has a heart attack, and he's like, "Aww, aw, aw, he crawls into the car, and there's no cell phones."

353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It's 1978. He's laying there in his car, and he's like, "What am I gonna do? Like, this sucks. I'm in a lot of pain. I'm having this heart attack."

354
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 He's laying in his car, it's freezing cold, he's having a heart attack, and he sees five people walk by his car.

355
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And he's like, "Wait, wait, come help me, I'm having a heart attack. Uh, uh, they just walk on by. Totally ignore him."

356
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And he's like, "Ugh, and you gotta think." He was probably thinking like, "What are the chances of me having a heart attack in the middle of nowhere? I need help."

357
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Five people walk by, I'm saved, and then they just keep on walking, and he's like, "Ugh."

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 A short time later, a pickup truck drives by, and he sees it, and he's like, "Ugh, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And then he had a heart attack, I walked down a mountain, a bunch of weird stuff happened, but here I am.

360
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 He ends up getting treated, and like a day or two later, he hears the news that there's five young special needs men missing.

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 So then he goes to the cops, and he's like, "This is what I saw. The problem is his story has changed quite a lot, and I don't know if it's him changing it or the article's changing it."

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 He said that the five guys walked by his car, and then the pickup truck.

363
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I've also heard variations that that all happened at the same time that a pickup truck pulled up, five guys jumped in the back, and it drove away.

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And then I heard variations that the five guys walked by, a man, a woman, and a baby walked by, they all got into a red pickup truck and drove off.

365
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And it's so funny because the articles are like, "Ooh, isn't that mysterious?" And his quote generally is, "To be honest, I might have hallucinated it."

366
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Like, to be honest, I was having a heart attack. He goes, "I think I saw something."

367
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 He's mostly for sure on seeing the five guys walk by. He goes, "But for all I know, there was no pickup truck. There was nobody else."

368
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 The only reason I know there's five guys, because five guys are missing in the same general area.

369
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 But the red pickup truck and all that stuff, even he's like, "I don't know, dude. I was in total pain. I was freezing to death. I thought I was gonna die. I might have just hallucinated."

370
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That's the second part. Sorry, police.

371
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Police looked all over these mountains for these guys, and they're thinking they have to be dead at this point.

372
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But they're flying helicopters around. A massive search party for these dudes. Nothing.

373
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 And Blizzard rolled in, and they're like, "Okay, we gotta suspend the search effort. It's just what are we gonna do?"

374
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And the families are like, "You could do more!" And I don't think the cop just said, "What are you gonna do?"

375
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And just walks off from the press conference, and the reporters are like, "Yeah, what are you gonna do?"

376
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And the families are like, "Ooh-hoo!" But anyways, that was all they could do.

377
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Like many of these stories, it's not the police who end up cracking it.

378
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 It's other people just out in the wilderness having fun. This is where it starts to get weird.

379
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 People disappearing in the snow, people acting irrationally in the snow, it happens.

380
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 So, a couple months later, these dudes are dirt biking up there, or RVing, or what, not RVing, ATVing, or something up in the woods,

381
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 and they find an abandoned trailer, like an abandoned state property trailer, like a rangers' trailer, or something like that.

382
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And there was a window smashed in it, and they said, "Hey, let's go check that out." You know?

383
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 I think they were probably getting ready to rob it, but anyways, they said, "Let's go see what's in there, and not steal anything."

384
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Wink, wink, and they open the door, and the first thing they see is a body underneath a blanket.

385
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And they immediately fill their pockets full of stuff, and then call the police and say, "Hey, we found something up here. Don't look in our pockets."

386
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So, the police come up there, and that is when they identify the body of one of the young men.

387
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And the official report was that he died of a mixture of starvation and hypothermia.

388
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Now, not at the same time, he wasn't like, "I'm so hungry and so cold." Well, he might have said that at some point, but he was very, very emaciated,

389
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 and he froze to death. His foot was totally gross. He had gotten frostbite, and it went untreated, and he got gangrene,

390
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 and so it was all smelly and disgusting. The cops were like, "Eh, let me steal something to plug up my nose."

391
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And they later find another body, two miles from the trailer, and they think that that was one of the friends who was with him in the trailer.

392
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 They had found the trailer at some point, and when the one guy died, the second one got scared and ran off.

393
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Could also just have been the gross smell of the gangrene foot, but anyways, the other dude ran off at some point, died two miles away.

394
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Two of the other dudes were found 11 miles from-- so, I guess I should have said this-- the trailer was 19 miles from the car,

395
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 in like, waist-deep snow in the forest. So it was quite a journey. They find this trailer.

396
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 It's kind of weird the search party didn't pick it up on it, but you know, mountains and ravines and trees and all that stuff.

397
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Anyways, the two dudes were in the trailer. One of them was found two miles from the trailer. The trailer was 19 miles away from the car.

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 11 miles from the car, they found the bodies of two dudes. Two of the special-- not just two other random guys.

399
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 They're like, "Hey, we weren't even looking for these dudes." The working theory was this. They all set off from the car,

400
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 and one of them succumbed to hypothermia relatively quickly, and one of them said, "I'm not going to leave him behind."

401
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 And they both died together, 11 miles from the car. The party then continued another seven miles through deep, deep snow in the middle of the night,

402
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 found the trailer, they broke the window to get in, went into the trailer, and then that happened. The fifth guy, they've never ever found him, ever.

403
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Never found any remains. He's just gone. They have no idea what happened to the fifth guy.

404
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And you're thinking, "Jason, that's not so mysterious. Like, why? They're in a trailer and a guy gets gangrene,

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 and one person doesn't want to leave their buddy behind. That's not mysterious." This is what's weird about this.

406
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 They won. They were walking up the mountain. Generally, if you're driving up a mountain and your car breaks down,

407
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 your best bet is to walk back down the mountain. And you may go back down the mountain 20 miles, but up the mountain could be only 10 miles,

408
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 but you have no idea what's up there. You know it's down the mountain. Plus, you can just, you know, make sleds and go, "Weee!" Go all the way down, right?

409
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 20 miles is a long way to sled, but it would be an easier thing. So the first question is, "Why did they go up the mountain?"

410
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 The second, well, and another question was, people wondered, "Why did they get on the forest road in the first place? They got off the main road.

411
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 The dude who had a heart attack was on the main road. They were on a forest road, and there's been suggestions of why did they do that?

412
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Were they going to visit someone in the area and trying to take a shortcut?

413
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 But, you know, the mom of the guy who owned the car was like, "He's super, super..." Well, he was super, super sensitive about his car.

414
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 He would never take it anywhere where he thought it could get damaged. He would want to stay on a main road.

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 People thought maybe they were being pursued, and that's why they were kept having to move forward.

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 They pulled off on the side of the road to avoid someone, and then they had to keep moving up the mountain to avoid something from following them.

417
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And you're thinking, "Well, Jason, maybe they're just not survivalists. Maybe they think, if I get to the top of the mountain, that's where I..." Maybe they just weren't thinking.

418
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 This is, I thought, the weirdest thing about this story, and this is what makes it super eerie.

419
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 You have the five people set off from the car and heading up the mountain, and we'll accept that one of them is like, "I can't go any further. I'm totally cold."

420
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And he's like, "I need to go to sleep." And the other buddy says, "I'll stay with him," and they die.

421
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 But the other three keep going. That trailer that they found, and they smashed the window and get in sign, when they found the body of the guy with the gangrene foot,

422
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 from what they can tell, from facial hair, he was there for two months. He was alive in that trailer for two months.

423
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 The trailer was, like I said, like a ranger trailer. It had food, and according to these articles, they had enough food for five people for one year.

424
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It was basically like a supply trailer. They had food, clothing, books, and they agreed... I was like, "Books? Who cares? They're not going to sit and read."

425
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 But I was reading an article and they explained those were perfect for setting fires, but they also had fuel, and I believe they had like a little furnace.

426
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 But even if they didn't, they had books and matches, so they could have lit their own fires if they needed to.

427
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Only a few cans of food were opened. Nothing was burned. The matches weren't lit. None of the books were burned. None of the fuel was used.

428
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 The window that they broke open wasn't even covered up to keep out the cold. And he starved while surrounded with years worth of...

429
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 If there was only two people in the trailer at this point, let's say the other guy just went missing.

430
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 But even if there was three, there was still enough food for three people for like a year and a half, two years.

431
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 There's only a couple cans of food opened. One guy is starved and dead. One guy is dead from hypothermia and the other guy is missing.

432
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 That's what makes the story so weird, because again, you could see if they had broken in that night, they're not going to be like, "Hmm, a cup of noodles."

433
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 But after two months, you should be eating some food. After the first couple days, you could be like, "Oh my God, it's so cold. Why don't we patch up that window?"

434
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 They weren't so special needs that they wouldn't know how to do that. So it's such a bizarre story, and that's why the families have thought that there was foul play involved.

435
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 When the police started investigating it, they immediately suspected foul play. And I think now they're kind of like, "Oh, you know, stuff happens in the woods."

436
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 But the families to this day are like, "No, they were being chased by something. They were being pursued by somebody."

437
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 The idea of the red pickup truck and the people in them hopping into the back of the pickup truck, that would explain how they got 19 miles away.

438
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It wouldn't explain how the bodies were found in various locations, but the creepy scenario that's been put out there was that they were kidnapped, taken to this little trailer in the middle of nowhere,

439
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 and basically killed by exposure. So it wasn't these guys sitting in this trailer all by themselves, and they're like, "Dang it, no milk!"

440
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 But there's all this other food that someone took them there and was basically refusing to feed them or kicking them out. It's super bizarre.

441
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 It's really, really weird. It would be an interesting way to be a serial killer is to kill people by completely normal methods.

442
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But who knows? The only fact that we know is that these five guys are dead. What killed them? How they died? We kind of know how they died, but like, what killed them?

443
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 What drove them farther up the mountain? Why were they there in the first place? All these questions are completely unanswered.

444
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But the biggest mystery is how do you starve to death when you're surrounded by at least the years worth of food?

445
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 And he got into some of it, so it's not like he didn't know how to open the food. Why only open some of it? Why did the other guy leave the trailer?

446
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Where's the fifth man? Bizarre story. I think it deserves to be called America's The Outlaw Pass, and it definitely deserves more exposure, but it kind of sucks because that's it.

447
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Those are all the answers we have, unless someone comes forward and says, "Oh no, I saw the red pickup truck that night," or, "I was the driver of the red pickup truck," and this is what happened.

448
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Really, all we have to go on is the eyewitness testimony of a man in the throes of heart attack, and then five sets of footprints into the snow, four bodies, and a trailer full of mysteries.

449
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
