1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,080
 Is it possible to have a science that is so scary people don't want to even research it?

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,480
 And then we travel to Iceland to take a look at one of the most bizarre and yet most powerful

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,760
 magical relics known to man.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,560
 What would you do if you found out that the only way to become rich and successful is

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,840
 to wear the necropanths?

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:43,040
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,600
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,280
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so first off walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,040
 our newest patreon supporters.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,920
 Get on your feet and give it up for our very own necropanths wearing Jonah.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
 Woohoo!

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
 Yeah come on in.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,920
 He's like wait I don't know what the necropanths are yet.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
 Oh you'll learn soon.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
 Jonah.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,880
 And you'll be like I don't want to wear these pants.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,480
 Well you can't take them off but we'll get to that.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,560
 Now you're prisoner of the necropanths Jonah but thank you for supporting the show.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,520
 You guys don't want to support the show financially.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
 That's totally fine.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
 It really is.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,680
 It really helps spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,840
 That helps out so much and I see you guys doing it online all the time so I appreciate

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
 that.

29
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,960
 Jonah let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy we're going to leave behind

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,840
 Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,560
 Drive us all the way out to Georgia.

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
 [POP]

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
 [POP]

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 [POP]

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,560
 Specifically we're headed out to Savannah Georgia.

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,720
 And hey Jonah you see that house right there.

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,560
 Yeah the yellow one with the blue trim.

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
 Go ahead and pull the Jason Jalopy over.

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840
 Let's get out.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
 We walk up to the house.

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
 I'm standing there at the front door.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
 Check my watch.

43
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
 I go.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:17,040
 One thing that's interesting that I find so fascinating about the I would say the art

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
 of ghost hunting.

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,240
 Rather than the science of ghost hunting.

47
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,720
 So many people want to make.

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,320
 I mean listen it's a free world you can do whatever you want with your hobbies or with

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
 your profession.

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:40,240
 But I find it so interesting that people try so hard to make a science out of the paranormal.

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,720
 Because science is something I mean you just have just the basic foundation that you have

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,560
 to be able to repeat and experiment over and over and over again under the same conditions

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,600
 and if you get the same results then that's the scientific method.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,440
 And that's something that we don't see happen with paranormal events.

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,040
 Every so often we come across the paranormal story and it's things like every labor day

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,560
 if you go out to this graveyard you'll see a little girl dancing around a grave and she'll

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,960
 look at you and she'll go shh she'll vanish in the thin air.

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,480
 If there is actually a story creepy right?

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,440
 The story is creepy but if there is any way to actually prove that it's a repeatable time

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 right?

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,880
 You know when it's going to happen you know the day it's going to happen.

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,240
 You'll know to bring out your recording equipment and capture proof of it.

63
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,960
 I've never been, I guess maybe when I was younger I might have wanted to prove.

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
 Actually no I don't think I was ever in that mindset.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,440
 I think I've always been in the vein at least as far as the world of the paranormal goes.

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,960
 Conspiracies is a bit different you know.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,280
 I believe that there's a criminal conspiracy going on or a conspiracy the government is

68
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
 putting against people.

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,640
 I want to prove that.

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,960
 But as far as whether or not people believe in ghosts it doesn't really matter to me

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,160
 in the end.

72
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,040
 I understand why people don't believe in ghosts because it's not repeatable.

73
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,800
 There's no way to provoke this response.

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,560
 You know whenever we do have some sort of tool like a spirit box or a Ouija board or

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,960
 things like that.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
 Physical items.

77
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 I'm not talking about mediums.

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,560
 I'm looking at my watch again.

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
 Not talking about mediums or anything like that.

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
 Physical devices.

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
 A microscope.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,480
 If you turn the knob it will always get closer on the Amoeba.

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,600
 But Ouija board under different conditions will work or will not work.

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,760
 Same thing with the spirit box and all of these things.

85
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
 And I understand that.

86
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,440
 I understand why people don't believe in ghosts because it can't be verified.

87
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,920
 I don't necessarily like it when people don't believe in ghosts simply because they think

88
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,880
 it's stupid.

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,200
 And they believe that people who believe in ghosts are stupid.

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,000
 That's when now it's a personal attack.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
 And I don't think it's a personal attack on me.

92
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
 It is.

93
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,000
 But I guess so I do think it is that.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,160
 But I mean I don't get offended by it.

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,280
 I think it's a attack against millions.

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,080
 Really billions of people around the world who do believe in ghosts.

97
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,160
 People go oh they're just stupid.

98
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,520
 They're just mentally ill.

99
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,840
 Yeah I mean then I guess you live on a planet that is ruled by the mentally ill.

100
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,200
 But whatever everyone's free to have their own opinion and I'm not here to prove anything

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
 to anybody.

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,840
 But science is.

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,480
 I check my watch I go okay we're here at the perfect time.

104
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,600
 And I get down and I start picking the lock to this house.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,760
 We open the front door.

106
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,480
 It's an average house.

107
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,960
 We walk into this house and we hear a television playing in the bedroom.

108
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,440
 So we make our way to the bedroom and we walk in there and playing on television is a rerun

109
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 of Sanford and Sun.

110
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 That's not the first thing that catches your eye.

111
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,680
 You see a middle aged man dead in a bed.

112
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,280
 And I go yeah just in time.

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
 I had this time perfectly and I walk over to this man.

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,320
 He's laying in bed.

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 Hmm.

116
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
 His heart stopped.

117
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,960
 His heart stopped the minute we walked into the room.

118
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,240
 Now his brain is not being supplied with blood.

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,320
 And we're watching this man die in this room.

120
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,440
 And you go to shut off the television set because you don't think anyone should die

121
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,360
 while it's 1976 comes playing.

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,200
 I go no no no no no no no don't touch the TV.

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,720
 First off fingerprints.

124
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,160
 Secondly this man loves Sanford and Sun.

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,400
 It's one of his favorite shows.

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,920
 It's a good show I used to watch it.

127
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 And I'm sitting by the side of his bed.

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,040
 We're watching this man die.

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
 Finally he's already dead.

130
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
 His heart has stopped.

131
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:16,600
 At this point we're just watching all of the biological functions cease in his body.

132
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,320
 We continue to let the episode play out until it's over.

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,120
 What you just witnessed was science.

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
 You're letting no chance in.

135
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,840
 I think we just witnessed a man die and you easily could have done something.

136
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,160
 Well we could have done chest compressions but it was this man's time to go.

137
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,160
 This was on his terms.

138
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,920
 He wanted to die in bed at home watching television.

139
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,440
 And the reason why we're here and the reason why we timed it so perfectly is that I wanted

140
00:07:46,440 --> 00:08:00,880
 to talk about a very intriguing article I read about how long can the dying here.

141
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,120
 Fascinating study that came out of the University of British Columbia Canada.

142
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,560
 It was printed in the publication Scientific Reports which is a journal.

143
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,400
 Finally they did the study hospice center.

144
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,240
 They had this cap with these electrodes on it.

145
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,800
 They put it on the heads of a control group.

146
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,200
 People who were totally alive.

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,920
 And then they would put the same cap on people who were in the process of dying.

148
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,160
 Because again like our friend here when you're in hospice there's not much that they can

149
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
 do for you.

150
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,400
 If you have a heart attack in hospice care the worst thing they can do is drive you across

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,800
 town to the hospital bring you back to life.

152
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,400
 And take you back to the hospice center where you may just repeat the whole thing next day.

153
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,920
 Hospice center is where people go in their final days, weeks, months.

154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,120
 However they have it set up.

155
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,440
 So we have one set of electrodes on healthy living people and another set of electrodes

156
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,160
 on people who are in the process of dying.

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,680
 And what they've realized was that when they were doing this study right, the people who

158
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,960
 are in the process of dying, they're not dying right now.

159
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,640
 They're just you know they got a couple days, couple weeks left.

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,120
 The scientists would play these different changing melodies, these very simple melodies.

161
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,680
 By playing these they called this type of melody an oddball sequence.

162
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,640
 By playing these melodies we can measure what's going on in the brain.

163
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,360
 It gives us a baseline of what a human brain shows when it's hearing these melodies.

164
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,160
 What parts of the brain light up.

165
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,600
 Now when these hospice patients are actively dying right they've fallen unconscious.

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,120
 They are not going to be revived.

167
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,920
 At this point whatever disease or ailment has gotten them it will finish them off in

168
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,120
 a matter of hours or minutes.

169
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
 Whatever it is depending you know obviously.

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,360
 Usually it's hours but it can vary.

171
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,880
 They would put the caps back on the now unconscious patients.

172
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,320
 I should be very clear they were all aware this was going to happen.

173
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,520
 They signed up for this.

174
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,960
 They weren't like "ah now I get to sleep.

175
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,460
 The sleep of kings."

176
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,520
 All of a sudden they're feeling someone put a ill fitting hat on them.

177
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,640
 They're like "what no this wasn't part of the deal."

178
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,840
 They knew that they were going to do this.

179
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,680
 So anyways when these you have a control group and then you have a baseline reading of the

180
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,960
 dying hospice people hospice patients and now when they're actively dying when they

181
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,120
 fallen unconscious these electrodes are reattached to their head and they begin playing the tones

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
 again.

183
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,860
 Even after they fell unconscious they could hear the tones because we could see their

184
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,540
 brain reacting to them.

185
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,660
 It wasn't as strong as when they were alive like fully alive.

186
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,980
 Now that they're unconscious and they're in the final moments of life their brain is still

187
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,260
 reacting to the sound.

188
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,300
 But you know we've always heard if someone's in a coma you sit next to them you can talk

189
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,820
 to them that can help.

190
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,700
 So we've always figured that that wouldn't be a barrier if someone was unconscious.

191
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,080
 People can talk to you while you're sleeping and maybe affect your dream.

192
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,360
 You're like "watch out zombies zombies they're coming the right behind you."

193
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,400
 You're like "ahhh" in your dream and they're giving you sleeping pills to keep their entertainment

194
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,720
 going.

195
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,240
 Even after the heart stopped pumping blood.

196
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,640
 So at this point they are generally people are considered dead.

197
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,220
 It depends really there's actually become an active debate in the medical community.

198
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,140
 When is somebody dead?

199
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,760
 Is it when the heart stops pumping blood and there is no way to revive them?

200
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,660
 Or is it when the brain sees as activity?

201
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,420
 The problem is we don't know when the brain sees as activity.

202
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,060
 The brain seems to be active for quite a while after when a doctor would say you're dead

203
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,260
 and that's where a study like this gets creepy.

204
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,060
 If that intro wasn't creepy enough for us.

205
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:18,880
 Even after the heart stops pumping blood the brain is still reacting to the tones.

206
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,640
 What they believe and this has been a theory in the medical community for a long time that

207
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,920
 hearing is the last sense you lose as you're dying.

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,520
 Vision goes fairly quickly especially if you're unconscious right?

209
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,480
 You're going to lose your vision.

210
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,120
 But I imagine as your body is shutting down it does like obviously we don't need taste

211
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
 buds no more.

212
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,900
 We don't need to pump energy to our taste buds so you lose a sense of taste would probably

213
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,940
 be the first one to go.

214
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,100
 But touch, hearing, sight.

215
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
 What's the other one?

216
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,180
 What is the other one?

217
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,440
 Touch, hearing, taste, sight and a sense of rhythm.

218
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,480
 I don't remember what the five senses are but anyways I imagine taste is the first thing

219
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,000
 to go but there's been a theory that the last one to go is hearing.

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,880
 So even after you've become unconscious even after your heart stopped beating what we can

221
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,560
 tell again it's not as strong as it was when these patients were still alive.

222
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,380
 It wasn't even as strong as when these patients were just unconscious but the brain is still

223
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,660
 picking up signals after the person's heart has stopped beating.

224
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,460
 It's still reacting to the tones.

225
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,780
 Now the scientist said listen here's the thing, according to this study people can still hear

226
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,020
 after they've been declared dead.

227
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,860
 The question is can they comprehend it?

228
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,180
 It's still terrifying right?

229
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,680
 It's still absolutely terrifying to think about but they go just because the brain is reacting

230
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
 to it.

231
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
 It is picking up on it.

232
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,720
 The sense of hearing is still there but do they understand what you're saying or what

233
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,580
 anyone's saying or what Sanford is saying when he's having another heart attack?

234
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
 We don't know.

235
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,840
 That would be the worst show to watch after you've died of a heart attack and you're

236
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,520
 just laying there in bed and the last thing you hear is Sanford going oh Martha I'm coming

237
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
 home Martha.

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,020
 You guys are like I've never watched Sanford and San what is this?

239
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,620
 Does every episode he have a heart attack?

240
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,940
 Yeah every episode he had a heart attack.

241
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,340
 It's crazy.

242
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:39,060
 It's really chilling if you think about it but at the same time I think it also is, it's

243
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
 reassuring.

244
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:46,740
 I think it's kind of sweet on one hand because then when you are dying your loved ones around

245
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,120
 you as they're saying their goodbyes to you you're hearing all of that even after you've

246
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,600
 become unconscious you're still hearing them even after your heart stopped beating you're

247
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 still hearing them.

248
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,640
 I think that is sweet and nice.

249
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:10,840
 However the chilling part comes from is when does this sense of hearing leave you?

250
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:25,260
 Like as your body is being zipped up you hear the gurney wheels you hear a door open up

251
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,660
 you're stuffed into a freezing cold morgue.

252
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,860
 I mean the good thing is you've lost your sense of touch.

253
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,980
 Actually we don't know that that's the next thing they're testing.

254
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,980
 These Canadian neurosciences are going to test whether or not the dying can feel touch.

255
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,760
 How long they can feel something touching their skin.

256
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,940
 But I mean like imagine if you could hear your coffin being shut.

257
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
 Dirt being shut.

258
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,460
 You're like okay Jason that's you took it too far.

259
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,460
 You're taking it to ruin.

260
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,140
 I imagine they don't hear all of that.

261
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,820
 I don't imagine they're like I can hear the worms.

262
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,860
 I can hear the worms digging through the wood.

263
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,180
 I don't think they can.

264
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,300
 I bet they couldn't but until we get scientists down there who knows.

265
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
 Probably not though.

266
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,300
 Probably not.

267
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
 Creepy creepy story.

268
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,260
 And I want to talk about that for two reasons.

269
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,260
 One because I found it infinitely disturbing yet kind of cool.

270
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,860
 Two I wanted to contrast it with this story.

271
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,740
 We walk out of this guy's house and now we're standing in Savannah Georgia and I said you

272
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,100
 know there's one thing that gets the old thirst going.

273
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,700
 It's my sense of taste.

274
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
 Kicking up.

275
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,580
 He's watching a man die.

276
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,260
 Let's go to a local tavern and wet our whistle.

277
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,220
 Jonah go ahead and call in that bunny bicycle.

278
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,940
 We're going to jump on the handlebars.

279
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,420
 Bike us all the way out to Pirate's House Tavern.

280
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
 Weak and weak and weak.

281
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
 Weak and weak and weak.

282
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,020
 He's pedaling down the streets of Savannah Georgia.

283
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,460
 We get to Pirate's House Tavern and we walk in.

284
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,980
 We're like Saspirilla is all around.

285
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,540
 The guy's like what is this is a bar.

286
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,620
 What year do you think this is?

287
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,620
 We don't serve Saspirilla.

288
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,100
 We're like oh man.

289
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
 Root beer is all around.

290
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,820
 He's like there you go.

291
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,420
 We all got a nice Henry Weinhardt's root beer in our hand.

292
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
 Ice cold.

293
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,420
 We're drinking it.

294
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,180
 I wanted to talk about this in contrast to how that is a scientific study that was done

295
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,020
 by scientists and it was probably creepy for them too.

296
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,340
 I don't think they're working on it late at night.

297
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,780
 They're like look at these readings.

298
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,180
 The dead can hear and they're like hunched over their laptop and there's like an old

299
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,900
 man ghost standing behind him and he's like we heard it all.

300
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,740
 What was that?

301
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
 Scientists is all sweating.

302
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,860
 I don't think it's creepy but you know it's science.

303
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,860
 You got to do it.

304
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,220
 You got to hang out with these dying people.

305
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,020
 Let's contrast it to the Pirate's House Tavern.

306
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,460
 I came across to this ghost story the other day when I was going through the shadowlands

307
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,380
 dot net.

308
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,940
 And Pirate's House Tavern it was built in the 1700s.

309
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,380
 We don't have an exact date.

310
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
 It's a real place.

311
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,460
 It's a real tavern.

312
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,220
 Originally it was a place for pirates.

313
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,820
 I don't think it was called the Pirate's House Tavern back then because piracy was a crime

314
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,580
 that you would get hung for at best.

315
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,380
 They often would torture pirates.

316
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,860
 I don't think that they actually called it the Pirate's House Tavern.

317
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,500
 That'd be like having a bar in downtown Chicago today called the Drug Runners.

318
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,380
 Not a smart idea.

319
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,540
 Very very notorious though.

320
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,020
 This is where you had Robert Louis Stevenson when he was getting ready to write Treasure

321
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
 Island.

322
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:42,620
 He spent time at Pirate's House Tavern to get a feel of the energy from the area.

323
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,580
 He wanted to go to this pretty, I mean I'm sure it's a nice place now but it wasn't for

324
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
 a long time.

325
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,780
 It basically it's where sailors would go whether or not they were pirates to where sailors

326
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,180
 would go to get drunk and to beat each other up.

327
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,980
 There'd been a lot of stabbings, a lot of murders, a lot of kidnappings.

328
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:07,380
 Apparently there's a series of tunnels from underneath the Pirate's House Tavern to the

329
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,420
 local port.

330
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,460
 We do know a lot of men got kidnapped out of Pirate's House Tavern and dragged through

331
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,540
 the tunnels and what happened is they'd get drugged and then they'd wake up on a pirate

332
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,500
 ship a hundred miles out to sea and they'd like swap the deck or get off.

333
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,340
 Not sexually.

334
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,620
 Although we'll probably do that later.

335
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,820
 You can jump overboard.

336
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,700
 And so you're like well I guess I'm a slave now.

337
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
 That happened.

338
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,900
 We did have stories historically of men being shanghied, being kidnapped and forced to

339
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,900
 work on boats.

340
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,780
 Because what choice would you have at that point?

341
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,740
 So this place was considered very lawless.

342
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,700
 It had a reputation for being lawless.

343
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,300
 So nowadays it has all these ghost stories.

344
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,340
 It's very standard ghost stories we see in places like this.

345
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,060
 Poltergeist activities such as glasses getting knocked off the shelves.

346
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,540
 Full body apparitions appearing as well.

347
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,380
 A lot of times these ghosts will appear right in front of people staring eye to eye with

348
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,500
 them and then they just disappear.

349
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 It's not like you catch something out of the corner of your eye and you turn and you think

350
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,340
 you saw a peg leg walk by.

351
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,700
 No, he's standing right in front of you.

352
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,740
 You're getting ready to use the urinal and he appears right in front of you and there's

353
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
 no mistake.

354
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,940
 You're looking at a ghost because he appears and then disappears right in front of you.

355
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 Screams coming from the tunnels.

356
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,820
 I'm so blase about that I'm like oh not the screams.

357
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,820
 Boring.

358
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,740
 And so you know that would be horrifying.

359
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,980
 Screams coming from the tunnel but we have those stories.

360
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,220
 A very very interesting ghost lore.

361
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,260
 Is it Dead Rabbit Radio interesting though?

362
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,380
 The reason why I wanted to highlight it was because of this.

363
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,900
 This is where I get upset.

364
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,620
 And I hope I have time.

365
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,820
 I don't go off on too much of a rant and I have time for the Necro Paint story since

366
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,620
 Joan is wearing them and all.

367
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,020
 Listen I get it.

368
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,340
 The world, the paranormal is not taken seriously in the scientific community.

369
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,980
 And your mileage may vary on that.

370
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,580
 Some of you guys may deeply care about that and you want it to be considered up there

371
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,980
 with chemistry and astronomy and biology.

372
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:28,020
 And that's why you have terms like parapsychology in the study of the paranormal.

373
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,020
 You have all this stuff.

374
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
 We keep inventing equipment.

375
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,420
 A spirit box.

376
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
 Temperature meters.

377
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,660
 EVPs.

378
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,980
 These are not just for ghost hunting.

379
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,820
 These are to prove to people who don't believe in ghosts.

380
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,580
 That's why these devices keep getting invented.

381
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,020
 People who just go ghost hunting for the love of it.

382
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,460
 And that might be the wrong way to say it because I know people who do go ghost hunting

383
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,060
 for the love of it and bring these devices.

384
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
 But you know what I mean?

385
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,420
 When I go to a ghost location, when I've done a lot of on the ground hunts, we never ever

386
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,660
 worried about recording anything.

387
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,500
 I don't think we ever did that.

388
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,340
 I think maybe once I did set up a camera to do EVPs at a house that was pretty haunted.

389
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,060
 But even then, I didn't pick up anything.

390
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,180
 Actually, to be honest, I didn't finish listening to the tape.

391
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,620
 I got bored.

392
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
 I got bored.

393
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,620
 It was like eight hours.

394
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
 I was like, "I'm done."

395
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,860
 So who knows maybe after I shut it off, they're like, "We have your soul."

396
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,820
 But anyways, I don't care whether or not people believe in it.

397
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,620
 I believe in it.

398
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,260
 And if you don't believe in it, that's totally fine.

399
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,660
 When you mock people, you don't believe in it.

400
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,140
 That's when it's kind of like, "Okay, now you're just kind of..."

401
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,820
 Now you're just being a jerk, right?

402
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,660
 There's a lot of stuff that I don't believe in that other people do and I don't go out

403
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,820
 of my way to tell them I don't believe in it.

404
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
 And I'm just like, "Whatever.

405
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
 It doesn't matter.

406
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,540
 It's not affecting me in any way, shape, or form."

407
00:22:52,540 --> 00:23:06,060
 But if you are going to try to be taken seriously, like a lot of ghost hunters are, you cannot

408
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,620
 scream and run away.

409
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:22,500
 I'm going to read you this little story that happened at the tavern and tell me what other

410
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,700
 scientific pursuit would this happen at.

411
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,020
 According to theshadowlands.net, and I saw this reported in other places as well, there

412
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,820
 is a group, first off, this name, right?

413
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,460
 We can have the University of Cambridge Center for Astronomical Studies, right?

414
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,700
 We can have something like that.

415
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,180
 This group is the national...

416
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,900
 They don't exist anymore.

417
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,100
 They don't exist anymore.

418
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:55,980
 But the National Ghost Chasing Association.

419
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:01,140
 The good old NGCA, the National Ghost Chasing Association.

420
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,020
 Probably looks funny.

421
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,780
 Probably looks kind of funny on a business card and on a shirt.

422
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,980
 But if you want to be taken seriously, probably leave out the part where you're chasing it,

423
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
 right?

424
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:23,380
 I know there's storm chasers, people who chase tornadoes, but meteorologists don't generally

425
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,260
 call themselves weather chasers.

426
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,900
 But anyways, I don't want to feel like I'm, you know, nitpicking.

427
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,780
 Although that's probably what I'm about to do.

428
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,940
 National Ghost Chasing Association.

429
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:42,340
 12 of them, 12 members of the National Ghost Chasing Association.

430
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,860
 Now, for all I know, these guys were just a bunch of dudes out having fun.

431
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,700
 But when you name yourself the National Ghost Chasing Association, it does make it sound...

432
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,580
 Well, it makes it sound national, right?

433
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,100
 It makes it sound like it's this big organization.

434
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,980
 And there's 12 of you.

435
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,660
 So I don't know if people came from all over America.

436
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,260
 Maybe it was just a local group and they had a big ambition.

437
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,100
 They don't exist anymore.

438
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,860
 National Ghost Chasing Association.

439
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:17,380
 12 of them said we are going to investigate Pirate's House Tattern.

440
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,020
 Places all these hauntings, these screams from the tunnels that seem not to impress Jason.

441
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,700
 We're going to investigate this.

442
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,500
 12 members of the National Ghost Chasing Association showed up.

443
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,140
 And they were going to be there for three days.

444
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,500
 Three days seems like a long time.

445
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,260
 Not necessarily for a ghost hunt, because again, you want that...

446
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,340
 If you want to prove it, right?

447
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,580
 You want verifiable.

448
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,060
 You want to see if it can repeat itself.

449
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,220
 But it's also a business.

450
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,660
 This is a functional bar.

451
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,260
 So imagine if you're trying to run a business and you have a bunch of ghost chasers walking

452
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,260
 around.

453
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,700
 And maybe it was in the middle of January.

454
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,860
 Maybe it was a slow month for the bar.

455
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
 But still.

456
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,980
 And how are you going to do any sort of ghost investigations if you're like, "Oh no.

457
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,540
 I hear a voice coming from the floor below us."

458
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,380
 Yeah, because there's 20 people down there dining.

459
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,620
 Anyways, I'm nitpicking.

460
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
 That's not fair.

461
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,980
 They were going to be there for three days.

462
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
 They decided.

463
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,860
 I'm sure they talked to management.

464
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,140
 I'm sure they didn't just show up and not leave.

465
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,660
 The boss is like, "We're closed."

466
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,020
 And they're like, "Look at our business card goods, sir.

467
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
 We're ghost chasers.

468
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
 We make the rules."

469
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,300
 And they were going to stay there for three days.

470
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,800
 But...

471
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,380
 Tell me, name any other form of science that this would happen in.

472
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,900
 But it was so scary.

473
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,100
 It was so terrifying at the Pirate House Tavern that all of the experts, they call themselves

474
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,860
 experts, so this isn't a hobby group.

475
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,060
 They may have been hobbyists who called themselves experts.

476
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
 Sure.

477
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,460
 But they didn't see themselves as hobbyists.

478
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,420
 It was so spooky at the bar.

479
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:11,660
 Nine of them left the premises before the investigation was over.

480
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,140
 So three remained for the whole three days.

481
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:26,620
 And according to this report, "All of the experts were scared out."

482
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
 I just think...

483
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,940
 I can't imagine any other scientific discipline ever using this phrase.

484
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:40,140
 "All of the experts were scared out of their minds."

485
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,540
 And I read that and I thought, "Listen, you have to choose.

486
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,980
 You have to choose one or the other.

487
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:55,420
 To be taken seriously as a scientific organization or a scientific pursuit, or...

488
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,300
 Yeah, I can only have one of these two.

489
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:08,580
 Or run out of a house at three in the morning with your arms flailing in the air going, "Ahhh!"

490
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,020
 And you're trying to get the car started because you saw something spooky in that house.

491
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
 It's one or the other.

492
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,380
 All these ghost shows on television, ghost hunters, and ghost adventurers, and ghost travel,

493
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,340
 and all this stuff, they're walking through an abandoned asylum or abandoned prison, which

494
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,860
 are scary places.

495
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,980
 Don't get me wrong.

496
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,980
 But they're walking in the dark with their cameras and their infrared cameras and their

497
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,340
 devices and everything like that.

498
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,340
 And then there's a noise down the hallway and they go, "Ahhh!

499
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,620
 You have a choice."

500
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:53,020
 Because I don't think there has ever been at an observatory where a scientist was looking

501
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,180
 through a telescope and ran away.

502
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
 Ran away.

503
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,420
 They go, "Hey, Johnson, why did you leave the door unlocked last night?

504
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,660
 I hope those came in and re-attached the telescope.

505
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,700
 It's going to take years to get it back in place."

506
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,980
 He goes, "You won't believe it.

507
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,580
 I saw a black hole.

508
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,860
 It's all black hole.

509
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,660
 Now unless they're black hole, it just opened around Jupiter."

510
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
 I mean, sure.

511
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,020
 Okay, listen, if it's a world ending disaster, if some guy's looking through a test tube and

512
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,180
 he's like, "Oh my God, this virus is going to kill humanity in the next six months, sure.

513
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,660
 You're free to run out.

514
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:36,780
 You're free to run out of the lab with your arms in the air screaming."

515
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:42,460
 But in the ghost hunting world, you have to choose.

516
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:51,100
 You can either be scientists trying to prove that ghosts exist or people running out of

517
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,420
 the study.

518
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,140
 This is a study you've set up.

519
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,620
 You've set up something that you go, "We're going to observe a phenomenon.

520
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,180
 We're going to try to contact it.

521
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,020
 We're going to document it."

522
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,420
 You can't run away screaming.

523
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:09,740
 I remember I read this book about the history of diseases, modern diseases.

524
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,500
 It wasn't like the lame ones, like the flu.

525
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
 They were talking about AIDS.

526
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,260
 They had a whole section about AIDS and they were saying they didn't know how it was spread.

527
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,080
 This was when it first started popping up in parts of Africa.

528
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,300
 This is before it got to America, got to the San Francisco is where it really popped off

529
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
 over here.

530
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,660
 But they can trace AIDS in America to a single person.

531
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,380
 It was an airline flight attendant.

532
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
 That was patient zero.

533
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,500
 They know that person's name.

534
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,180
 I don't remember it, but they do know the person who brought AIDS to America.

535
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,140
 But anyways, when they were first trying to figure it out, it was just this disease that

536
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,060
 was killing very, very young people.

537
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,200
 There was, I think it was in France or Sweden, there was a laboratory and a guy had samples

538
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,820
 of AIDS infected blood.

539
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,860
 They don't even think they had named it at that point.

540
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,180
 It was just like a series of letters and numbers.

541
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,700
 He had this vial and he's in this laboratory and he dropped it.

542
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,460
 Shattered.

543
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,700
 And they locked the lab down.

544
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,100
 It's like something out of a sci-fi movie.

545
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,100
 They're like, "Sorry, Charlie.

546
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
 Everything got locked.

547
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
 I don't know if it was automated.

548
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,820
 I don't know if he was thinking about sliding underneath the door."

549
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,460
 But he was locked in because they didn't know if it was airborne.

550
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,940
 They didn't know how you contracted it.

551
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
 They had zero idea.

552
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,140
 For all they knew, they just watched the guy die because he butterfingered a vial.

553
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,660
 He'd been up all night working on what is this.

554
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,660
 And they did.

555
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,980
 They isolated him for quite a while and then they got brave enough, because it's what you

556
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,620
 have to do, to start testing him and he didn't have it.

557
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:47,500
 So now they know, well, at least it doesn't seem to be airborne.

558
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,020
 Now I'm sure that guy was, I'm sure that guy was moving his pants, right?

559
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,180
 I don't think that guy slept well for the next couple nights.

560
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:01,100
 But even in that situation, he didn't run out of the room with his arms flailing in

561
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,380
 the air.

562
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,380
 They wouldn't let him for what.

563
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,220
 He was locked in the room.

564
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,260
 But two, do you see what I mean?

565
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:14,100
 Science can be scary, but no other scientist.

566
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,660
 I mean, listen, if there's a nature, a biologist or whatever out in the jungle and a gorilla

567
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,420
 comes after him, yes, you can run.

568
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,020
 If I see him running, I'm like, you whip.

569
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,340
 Go steady that monkey.

570
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,340
 I'm all driving away.

571
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,860
 I was like, I'm not picking you up until you get some monkey science done, sir.

572
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
 You go chase him.

573
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,540
 What's the difference between an 800 pound gorilla chasing a scientist through the jungle?

574
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,460
 That's kind of funny, actually.

575
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,540
 What's the difference between an 800-pound lab coat?

576
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,500
 His lab coat keeps getting tattered.

577
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,300
 He's like, oh, why did I wear this dude with lab coat?

578
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,900
 I'm not even in a lab.

579
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:52,420
 800 pound gorilla chasing a scientist through the jungle.

580
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,780
 What's the difference between that and your in the catacombs of a place where you know

581
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:04,180
 untold amounts of people were dragged out of here unconscious to wake up on a ship miles

582
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,500
 away and now you're hearing them scream.

583
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,980
 You're hearing the disembodied screams coming from the end of these deep tunnels.

584
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
 What's the difference?

585
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
 Well, listen.

586
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
 I'm not.

587
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,260
 Listen, it would terrify me.

588
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,660
 It would terrify me.

589
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,740
 But I am not a scientist and I don't approach this as a science because I understand that

590
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,140
 it really does defy science and the sciences as we know it.

591
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,180
 It just can't be replicated.

592
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
 We've learned that.

593
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,340
 You cannot replicate this phenomenon.

594
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,740
 You can't replicate any of it.

595
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,740
 You can't replicate.

596
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,300
 And this is actually a good segue, too.

597
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,540
 Let me finish what I was going to say.

598
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,300
 Yes, it would be scary.

599
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,940
 I would be scared to be in those tunnels, but I'm not there to prove anything.

600
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,180
 I'm there to go down there and be like, I wonder if this place is actually haunted.

601
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,100
 And then I would come back and say, yeah, I was down there and I heard this and I heard

602
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,540
 that and it was so scary.

603
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
 I ran away.

604
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,940
 You're like, Jason, you'd run away, too?

605
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
 Well, yeah.

606
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,940
 I'm not thinking about it.

607
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,540
 I would totally run away if it was that bad, too.

608
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,900
 But again, I'm not a scientist.

609
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,980
 I consider myself more like a journalist.

610
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,820
 And when I was reading this article the other day about how journalists in Mexico, they're

611
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,660
 like, yeah, we've just kind of stopped reporting on stuff because the corruption is so bad

612
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,060
 that if we report on the corruption, we get killed.

613
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,660
 So we've just stopped reporting on it.

614
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,860
 And I go, that's fair.

615
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,860
 I mean, it's not fair for the citizens of Mexico, but I understand that.

616
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,300
 But I'm just telling ghost stories, ghost experiences I've had.

617
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,020
 And if you don't believe my stories, that's fine.

618
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,820
 That's fine.

619
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,860
 But if you're trying to prove the existence of ghosts, which a lot of these ghost hunting

620
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:55,700
 shows do, that's why they bring in these monitors and they're like, look, we caught this EVP.

621
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,540
 They hit play and it's all mashed potatoes.

622
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,020
 And they're like, let me rewind that for you.

623
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,460
 Mashed potatoes.

624
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,100
 And they go, it's sane.

625
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,860
 I hate God.

626
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,100
 And then they play it again and it goes very clear.

627
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,740
 Once they say what it's supposed to say, the end play and it goes, I hate God.

628
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,940
 They're like, wow, how did I not hear that the first two times?

629
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
 It's weird.

630
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,580
 Once he told me, he's saying mashed potatoes, but once he told me what it said, I clearly

631
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,860
 heard it say, I hate God.

632
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,940
 You know, that's I think the difference.

633
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,660
 The difference is that if you're a ghost scientist, you're a parapsychologist, you're

634
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,020
 trying to prove this stuff, you're trying to use the scientific method to, for something

635
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,380
 that at this point defies the scientific method.

636
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,980
 I think someday we may understand what it is, but it'll be outside the bounds of what

637
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
 we know as science.

638
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,060
 It won't ever fall underneath that umbrella.

639
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,580
 And we won't get to the Necro pants.

640
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,940
 Jonah, we're going to have to have you back.

641
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,260
 Keep those Necro pants on.

642
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
 Good sir.

643
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
 We'll have you back.

644
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,580
 What I think is interesting is this is the old, even in paranormal, even in the world

645
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:04,180
 of paranormal, this is the only place we see this happen.

646
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,940
 We do not hear stories about UFO hunters leaving the scene, right?

647
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
 They went up to the mountains.

648
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:15,740
 They went out to Mount Shasta because there were reports of UFOs and hidden tunnels underneath.

649
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:22,140
 You never, as far as I can remember all the UFO research we've done over the years, even

650
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,300
 before the show, I don't think I've ever come across a story where UFO hunters, UFO researchers

651
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:34,060
 go out to an area and they see a bright light in the sky and they leave.

652
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,060
 They drive away as fast as they can.

653
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,380
 I can't recall that because that's what they're there for.

654
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:48,740
 Hell or high water, they are there to prove that this phenomenon exists.

655
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,620
 UFOs are all about proof.

656
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,340
 They're all about getting the photographs, getting the video footage.

657
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:00,140
 That's why whenever a little, even the smallest sliver of hope from a photograph or a video

658
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,860
 goes viral because people want that with that.

659
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:11,020
 They'll go there where they know there's alien activity, where they know there have been

660
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,300
 cattle mutilations, where they know things have been ripped open and had nearly all the

661
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,380
 blood drained out of them.

662
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,740
 They don't run away screaming.

663
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,100
 The same thing with cryptids.

664
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
 People who go out.

665
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,060
 Sometimes you might have a little bit of the run factor, but if we narrow it down to stuff

666
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:37,580
 like the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot, you very, very rarely, there would probably be

667
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:42,260
 more than the UFO stories but less than the ghost ones, of people going out to hunt Bigfoot

668
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,420
 and they hear something in the woods and then they pack their gear up and run away.

669
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,340
 I have seen stories of people who have gone out to hunt Bigfoot, not necessarily shoot

670
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,300
 him but to photograph of him, and Bigfoot throws rocks.

671
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,940
 They throw rocks flying through the forest at them, tree branches moving in again.

672
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,660
 Now you're looking at a physical threat.

673
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:08,500
 They may not see it, but they can tell something very big and very strong is moving sight unseen

674
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,140
 through the forest towards them.

675
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,900
 A physical force that may rip their head off.

676
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,620
 Even those stories are rare.

677
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,340
 I'm really thinking there's a story I read recently, well covered on the show I think,

678
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,300
 about a wolf man, about this giant wolf-like creature moving through the forest.

679
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,780
 It was throwing stuff at these guys.

680
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,500
 I actually don't think they were cryptid hunters.

681
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,220
 I think they were just regular hunters and they took off running.

682
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,220
 That's a cool story.

683
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,860
 We'll have to cover that one next week.

684
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:43,020
 But I'm just saying, like ghost hunters, they run.

685
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,700
 And that's almost like part of it.

686
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,580
 It's super weird.

687
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,620
 Basically you want to prove that ghosts exist, but also you want to be like, man, that house

688
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,580
 is so haunted.

689
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,580
 I couldn't get in.

690
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,580
 It was so haunted I didn't even try to get any proof.

691
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,140
 I ran away.

692
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:05,420
 Just like me, like when I recorded eight hours of a haunted bedroom, it was at Jackie and

693
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
 Josh's house.

694
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,580
 I was over at Jackie and Josh's old house.

695
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,580
 They're old friends of mine.

696
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,100
 Don't go looking for them now.

697
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,180
 Don't go crawling into their bedroom, being like, "Oh, this place is haunted."

698
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,260
 This was out in a semi-valley, not the city, a semi-valley road in Antelope, California.

699
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
 There's a haunted house out there.

700
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,420
 And I remember I was like, I set up my camcorder and I go, "I'm going to record this bedroom."

701
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
 It's the parents' bedroom.

702
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,420
 They weren't there at the time.

703
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,220
 I wasn't secretly recording your parents, Josh.

704
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,300
 Had the camera set up and I hit play.

705
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
 It was extended play.

706
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:44,300
 I was going to record eight hours of audio and visual evidence in Jackie's parents' bedroom.

707
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,300
 And the next day I was like, "Oh, I'm going to watch that."

708
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,620
 And maybe a ghost showed up.

709
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,780
 Maybe the sound of the dead and the damned talking.

710
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,100
 I watched, I watched maybe 20 minutes of it.

711
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,980
 But again, I'm not a ghost scientist.

712
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,540
 I'm allowed to be lazy.

713
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,580
 I'm allowed to be scared is basically what I'm saying.

714
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,100
 This is why people don't take ghost hunting seriously because they don't have the gumption

715
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,300
 to stick around.

716
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,300
 You can choose.

717
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,180
 Do you want to be taken seriously?

718
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,980
 Do you want proof or do you want to be scared?

719
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,060
 And I think that's the interesting thing.

720
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,300
 People don't investigate UFOs to get scared.

721
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,940
 People do not investigate cryptids to get scared.

722
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,180
 Cryptid investigations really come down to two groups of people.

723
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,700
 People who are trying to find proof of, three groups of people.

724
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,380
 People who are trying to find proof of Bigfoot.

725
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,100
 People who are trying to shoot Bigfoot in the brain.

726
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,580
 And then the whole other group of cryptid people are people trying to protect their

727
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,340
 farm.

728
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:44,740
 And there's some creature out there in the darkness that's killing their sheep.

729
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:50,100
 Where you have a rash of young men disappear along a river somewhere in South America.

730
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,380
 And people are trying to figure out what's doing it and it's some sort of crypt.

731
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,580
 It's some sort of creature of legend out there.

732
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,300
 Those are really the groups of cryptid hunters.

733
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,740
 People who are trying to prove something.

734
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:07,420
 People who are trying to kill something or people trying to protect their territory.

735
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
 Ghost hunters.

736
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
 I listen.

737
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,540
 I love you guys.

738
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,100
 I consider myself a ghost investigator.

739
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,540
 Maybe that's just split hairs because I'm always going to.

740
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,260
 But even then, I mean, yeah, sure.

741
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,260
 Listen, it's scary.

742
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,860
 I don't can necessarily say I've run from a location in the middle of a ghost hunt.

743
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,340
 I don't think that I have.

744
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,500
 But again, I have different motives.

745
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
 I'm not putting up.

746
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,820
 I'm not going to be there for three days to prove this place is haunted and then run

747
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,700
 away in the middle of the night because it's so scary.

748
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,780
 We can't have it both ways, ghost guys.

749
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,460
 We can't have it go.

750
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,380
 We can't have it ghost way.

751
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,940
 You like that?

752
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,540
 That's just my take.

753
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
 Maybe I'm wrong.

754
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,220
 I was really, really hoping that segment wouldn't turn into a rant and take up the rest of

755
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,220
 the episode.

756
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
 But it did.

757
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,460
 Jonah, we're going to have to have you next episode because we got to have everyone in

758
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,740
 the carpenter copter.

759
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,820
 So you will be back.

760
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,580
 Keep those necro pants on till tomorrow and then you'll find out the horrifying madness

761
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,540
 that you've been wearing.

762
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,220

 I'm glad you listened to it today.

768
