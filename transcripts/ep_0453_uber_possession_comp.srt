00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
 Today, it's all about cars. First off, a man, minding his own business, begins to receive

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,920
 telepathic messages from an abandoned car. A father is seen putting his three-year-old

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,200
 son in the trunk of his car and driving away. What would you do? And then we take a look

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:31,800
 at a man who got a job driving for Uber, but ended up taking the highway to hell. Today, on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,640
 [Music]

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Garpenter.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,240
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's all automotive, baby.

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,480
 [Music]

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,440
 Quick montage, all these different shots. We're gonna be in the Jason Jalopy today. We're on the roads.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,680
 Cars going faster, lots of cool shots. Hot bikini models posing next to the car.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,320
 We're walking in slow motion to the car. Now, currently sitting in the car is our legacy

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,560
 Patreon supporter of the day, Narlos. You are going to be our driver this episode. You're

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,480
 going to take us down these crazy roads. We're going to have a lot of fun. If you can't support

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,400
 the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. That really,

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
 really helps out a lot. So, Narlos, we've got our driving glasses on, which for me is just

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,360
 regular glasses, but you guys can wear your really cool shades. The Jason Jalopy does have a top

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,880
 speed of like 15 miles an hour and it has no roof, but it has one hell of an air conditioner.

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,760
 So, we're going to be driving through these hot streets. We're headed out to Arnold, Missouri.

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,200
 This story happens in March 30th, 2020. So, just about a month ago, we're driving to Arnold,

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,000
 Missouri. It's 8 p.m. and there's a man sitting in his apartment trying to just do normal stuff,

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,880
 right? Like, watch television. Big Bang Theory is on for the 800th time on TBS that day. He's like,

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,800
 anything but this. And he begins to receive a message in his head. What's going on?

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,240
 Why am I seeing these things? Why am I feeling these things? He's walking around his living room.

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,240
 He's knocking stuff over. And he looks out his window and he sees a 2015 Chrysler 200

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:28,080
 just sitting empty in the parking lot. Ah, ah, ah, knocking stuff over. He's knocking stuff over on

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,480
 the way to his door. He's putting on his jacket. Knocks over his coat rack. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,200
 he walks down the stairs. Now, we don't have a name for this dude. The police have not named this

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,640
 guy. But other people in the apartment complex see a man, he's 44 years old, yelling at the car. He

29
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,840
 has a hammer. He happened to carry that out too. Maybe he always has a hammer just in his pocket

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,440
 of his jacket. He's threatening the car with a hammer. So the police are like, oh, it's one of

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,360
 those stories, right? So they put on their hammer proof vests and they drive on out there. Now,

32
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,440
 it turns out he's already punctured the back tire of the car. You're not going nowhere. We're going

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 to have a nice long conversation. Just me, you, and my trusty hammer. And the cops show up. They

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,720
 obviously arrest them. They're not just sitting there eating popcorn and they're like, well,

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,120
 that was fun. Let's go. Let's go somewhere else as he's attending to a batch of this car.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
 They arrest him and they question him and they go, dude, what's going on? And I mean, which,

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,720
 which, listen, man, the police, their job isn't the easiest job in the world,

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,120
 but you do have to admit it would be awfully fun to see an insane person and then have the ability

39
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,560
 to go. So tell me what's going on because if I asked an insane person what's going on, they're

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,760
 just going to like attack me, right? And then not to say that they don't attack cops and same people

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,160
 always intact cops. But what I'm saying is like, I can't like take them to a location and question

42
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,760
 them for hours on end. I could, but then I would be visited by police and considered to be insane.

43
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,400
 Anyways, the cops get this guy and they arrest them and they go, what is going on? Now this is

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,400
 the reason why he started attacking this car. He said, I just mind my own business being totally

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,880
 not insane. And then I felt this thing in my head. He saw visions, visions of like car berators and

46
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,720
 like gear shafts and other car stuff. He said the car was telepathically assaulting him.

47
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
 He's walking through aisle after aisle of Napa auto parts. He's like,

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:37,360
 Chryslers are sneaking up behind him. And he said not only was the car telepathically assaulting

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,560
 him, the car was also coming onto him. The car was trying to have sex with him. So now he's all

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,480
 alone in the infinite Napa auto parts store. There's a Chrysler walking up behind him. It has

51
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,760
 on it has on a sexy dress. Walking on the back two wheels. And the guy's like, I'm

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,480
 oddly attracted to you. But at the same time, I know you're two tons of pure Detroit steel.

53
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,120
 I don't know what to do. And the car is like getting closer. The front tires are like the boobs.

54
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,320
 The bottom tires are the legs. That's how it works, right?

55
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:19,280
 And then he would snap out of his telepathic vision right before things got really interesting.

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
 And then he walks outside. He starts attacking the car. Now the cops arrested him.

57
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,960
 What's weird about this story? Right? But what's even weirder was this was reported on March 30th.

58
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,640
 On April 15th, when around this story was being publicized, they've never found the owner to the

59
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,520
 car. The car was abandoned in the parking lot. Nobody knows where the owner of this car is. So I

60
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:54,800
 am going to say something totally insane. What if the person who owns the car is currently

61
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,440
 being assaulted, trapped somewhere, some dudes are like beating up the owner of the car,

62
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,640
 and is trying to reach out with their mind, like sending out psychic cries. And and

63
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,040
 would they we're all just immune to them because we're not insane. But to someone who's

64
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,640
 grasp of reality is already a little weakened, they're hearing this stuff. And what they're

65
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,560
 seeing is not the car trying to have sex with them, or the car trying to telepathically attack them.

66
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,280
 The car is the conduit for this message of the owner saying, please rescue me. I will have sex

67
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,320
 with you. I'm not a car. I will have sex with you if you rescue me. You know what I mean? Like

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,160
 you're like Jason, that's more insane than attacking a car at the hammer. But who knows?

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,240
 It's probably it's probably not that fanciful scenario. It's most likely that the car was stolen.

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,000
 I don't know. I don't know. Why don't we know the owner of the car? Who knows? But probably not

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,440
 my scenario. It's probably much more rational than that. But maybe, maybe if you're crying out

72
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,520
 into the cosmos, only the insane can hear you and it just drives you more insane.

73
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,160
 Narlos, skip back in that Jason Jalopy. We are headed out to Norwich, Illinois.

74
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,200
 Norwich, Illinois. It's September 2, 2018. So we're going to go a little bit back in time.

75
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,040
 There's a little like time warp stuff flying past us. Keep your hands in the vehicle when we're

76
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,800
 going through the time warp. Otherwise, like one of your limbs may end up like punching Catherine

77
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
 the Great in the face. We don't want to do that unless you, unless you hate Catherine the Great,

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,680
 then go nuts. But anyways, we're back in time now, September 2, 2018. It's 89 degrees out.

79
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
 So that's pretty nice. If you have air conditioning, which we do in the Jason Jalopy,

80
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,600
 that's not bad. 89 degrees is pretty nice. But people are sitting at this restaurant in

81
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:52,800
 Norwich, Illinois, just eating. This is one of the mong bok videos now. I don't get those.

82
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,560
 I don't get those. But anyway, we're eating. Dude, I love some pasta right now. So let's say

83
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,200
 we're at a spaghetti factory. The best of all pasta restaurants. Spaghetti factory. Eat fresh.

84
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,760
 And so we're sitting there and we see this dude yelling at his three-year-old son. He's like,

85
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
 "You suck. You're actually, I don't even have to make up quotes. We have an actual quote form.

86
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,800
 He's yelling at the son. He goes, quote, "You are being bad and I'm going to punish you by

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,160
 putting you in the trunk." Now that's an actual quote, which should let you know that this guy

88
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:32,720
 talks like a robot. He either talks like a robot. He talks like data. Or he's reading a script.

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,160
 Or he's just some weirdo. But when you see a man talking to a three-year-old kid saying,

90
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,000
 "You are being bad and I'm going to punish you by putting you in the trunk." I mean,

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
 that's not how normal people talk, right? People are more emotional. But anyways, he yells out,

92
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,520
 "You are being bad. You are being bad and I'm going to punish you by putting you in the trunk."

93
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,240
 And he picks the kid up. Whether or not you think he's a robot or not, he's not. He picks the kid

94
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,120
 up, puts him in the trunk, drives away. And everyone's like looking at what just happened.

95
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
 "I'm finishing my plate of spaghetti. Jason, aren't you going to call? Wait, wait, hold on.

96
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,960
 Can I get some more bread, please?" Yeah, no, no, no. Narlos is paying for it. It's good.

97
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,160
 "Patreon money." No, no, no. And then after I get a refill on my soda, apparently I'm the only one

98
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,960
 with a cell phone at this entire restaurant. I pull my cell phone out as Narlos is paying the bill.

99
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,760
 Figuring out the tip. "Hello, 911?" Yeah, I just saw a dude like 30 minutes ago put it kid in a trunk.

100
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,840
 So what happened was, obviously, the cops were called out and the cops are able to track down

101
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,040
 this dude. His name is Boguslaw Matlak. Boguslaw Matlak. Maybe he is a robot. I don't know. I've

102
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,600
 never seen that name before. That does sound like a name from like Babylon 5. Boguslaw Matlak.

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,040
 He's 28 years old. And so the cops get him and they're like, "Sir, sir, we need to open your

104
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,960
 trunk. We need to see what's going on." Now, he opens his trunk. There's nothing in there,

105
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,560
 which that makes the cops a little more suspicious. But he goes, "Listen, guys, listen."

106
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,320
 It was just a social experiment. It was just, "Don't worry about it. My son is safe at home.

107
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,240
 It's a social experiment." And the cops are like, "Oh, okay." So this is what happened. This guy

108
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,280
 wanted to be an internet sensation. He wanted to be famous. He wanted to be famous. So

109
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,160
 some people are famous because, you know, lots of hard work. Some people are famous because

110
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,600
 they're lucky or born into a famous family. Some people are famous because they put their

111
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,560
 sons in the trunk of a car in public and yell what they're doing. See, we're loud. That was his

112
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,240
 path. That was Mr. Matlack's path of fame. He decides to do this. Now, they do track down the kid.

113
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,360
 He's at home. They track down the wife. She's at home. The way the cops found him was the cops came

114
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,560
 to the spaghetti factory and we're all eating pasta together now. And the guy came back to the same

115
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,080
 parking location. So the cops are all there investigating and he pulls back up and everyone's

116
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,520
 like, "Dude, that's his car." So they go out. His son wasn't in the car. But then they track it down.

117
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,000
 He's at home. His wife's at home. It's a social experiment, bro. So this was his idea. He wanted

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,480
 to see what people would do if someone put a kid in the trunk. Now, he says that the trunk,

119
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,120
 the way the car was set up, but the back seat would fold down and his wife, I guess, was hiding in the

120
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,840
 back seat like some sort of serial killer. This is not helping your case, Matlack. It's not helping

121
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,120
 your case. Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. My wife was crouched and hidden from the view of strangers.

122
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,200
 Apparently she was like hiding in the car or something. This is all alleged too, by the way.

123
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,240
 Even this happened in 2018. Don't sue me. Don't bring down your lawyers from the Andromeda system

124
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,040
 and sue me. The seat, allegedly, the seat goes down. The little boy's in the back. He crawls

125
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,280
 out of the trunk and into the back seat and then she put him in the child's seat in the back seat

126
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,480
 and Matlack drove away. But the people in the restaurant were saying, "We didn't see any of that."

127
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,360
 Like, "We saw the kid get put in the trunk on the car drive away." He said, because again,

128
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
 a social experiment, he'd done this two other times and no one had ever called the cops.

129
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
 I'm a little suspicious about that detail because where, that would be an easy thing to prove,

130
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 right? You'd show the cops. No, look, I did this other times and no one did anything, but I

131
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
 actually, now the thing about the cops would be like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just showed this video

132
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,200
 of you committing the crime two times previous." Is that what you're doing, sir? So Mr. Matlack

133
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,800
 could have been like, "That's probably not going to do." But anyways, he said he did this two times

134
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,000
 previously. Now, he didn't get charged with anything because technically he didn't break a law. He

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,480
 broke a law because he was being a ding-dong, but that's not actually a law. That's just more of a

136
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,440
 human rule. Don't be a ding-dong in public. He did get his kid taken away for three weeks, though,

137
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 which that sucks for the kid. Like, that's always the thing. Whenever parents lose custody of a

138
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,720
 kid, obviously this is a kind of ridiculous story. I always feel more pain for the kid

139
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,240
 because they don't know. Like, three-year-old kid, all of a sudden, sometimes you have to do it,

140
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,640
 right? When the parents are abusive and I've taken the kid away for three weeks,

141
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,400
 I don't know who learned the lesson. The parents are like, "We're not going to be idiots anymore.

142
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,360
 We lost our kid for three weeks." Or during those three weeks, are they planning more schemes?

143
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,560
 Are they planning their YouTube career or whatever? I don't know. I always feel bad when

144
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,720
 the kids get taken away because how terrifying that must be for them. But they ended up getting

145
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,520
 the kid back. And as far as I can tell, Matlac has returned to his home planet and we have no other

146
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,800
 issues with this family. So that's good. "Narlos, let's get back in this Jason Jalopy you paid.

147
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,880
 You tipped her well at the spaghetti factory, right? She got a good tip." Okay, good. "We're

148
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,480
 leaving behind Illinois. I got some to go spaghetti. We are headed off to Michigan." I'm going to be

149
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,600
 honest, dude. This story scares me. The story scares me. Now, it's not scary in the sense that

150
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,960
 it's gory like the Michael Taylor thing. Or it's not scary in the sense of like the Ant Hill kids,

151
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,240
 where it's like this idea of like human misery, cult leader feeding on human misery.

152
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:14,800
 This segment scares me. "We're driving into Michigan. We're in Kalamazoo County, Michigan." So

153
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,200
 the car is driving down the road. It's February 20th, 2016. There's a man living in Kalamazoo

154
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:31,120
 County named Jason Brian Dalton, 45 years old. Same first name as me, two years older than me,

155
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,760
 married two kids. I don't have either of those things. He's married two kids, not married two

156
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:48,240
 kids. He's married and has two kids. Now, Jason has lived a pretty mediocre life. Just working,

157
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:57,600
 doing his thing, growing up. Normal, right? No criminal history. Never been in jail,

158
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 never been in prison. You know what no criminal history means. I don't have to explain that to

159
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,440
 you. No mental health issues. No mental health issues. Never been treated by a psychiatrist,

160
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:17,520
 psychologist. A normal citizen of the globe. Earlier in the month of February, just two weeks

161
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:24,800
 earlier, he got a job driving for Uber. So he gets his little phone ad, "Boo-duh-boop-boo!"

162
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,520
 A little Uber symbol comes up, presses a button. It says, "Go here, bro!" And he like drives there,

163
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,240
 and there's some dude hanging on the street corner waving. It's a real-life version of that game,

164
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,600
 crazy taxi. Or also known as regular taxi rides. But Uber and Lyft and all these services

165
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,680
 gives you the ability to pick up total strangers and put them in your car. He started driving

166
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,040
 for Uber about two weeks earlier. And then on February 20th, 2016, he's driving around

167
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,520
 and he gets an Uber call to go pick someone up at an apartment complex and he goes there

168
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 and a woman comes out, but he's at the wrong apartment complex. And he goes, "Hey, are you

169
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,360
 so-and-so?" And the woman goes, "No." And he drives and he circles back and he pulls out a gun,

170
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,920
 "Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!" Starts shooting her. And she falls down, she survives, medics come out,

171
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
 they pick her up, and she says, "This dude pulled up and just asked me who I was and I wasn't that

172
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,960
 person and then he shot me." Jason just goes, takes his next Uber, "Pick up, right?" He just starts

173
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,120
 picking up people, driving them, dropping them off at their location. Then he drives around a

174
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,640
 little bit more and then he would shoot somebody. He would kill someone in the street and then pick

175
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,160
 up a couple more Uber people and drive around. He drives to a, like, auto lot. There's like a father,

176
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:58,000
 a son, and a girl there. And he drives into the lot and opens fire and kills the father and kills

177
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,800
 the son and the girl survives. Just drives away. He drives to a cracker barrel restaurant where

178
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,960
 there's four women and a younger woman. They're sitting in their cars having a conversation,

179
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,480
 they just spent the night out having fun. And while they're sitting in the parking lot,

180
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,160
 finishing up their night's activities, there's a car driving through the parking lot,

181
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:28,240
 like a shark, like a snake winding its way closer, opens fire, "Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

182
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,560
 four women killed in that parking lot. The young woman critically injured, but she survives."

183
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,120
 At this point, the cops are like, "We have a active shooter that's mobile.

184
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:46,000
 Active shooters themselves aren't super common, but a mobile active shooter are even less common."

185
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,920
 So they're driving around. The dude is still picking up Uber requests, right? And at one point,

186
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,720
 he picks up this guy and his friends and they're driving through the streets and these friends

187
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,440
 had heard on the news about a car driving around the city opening fire.

188
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,400
 And they asked Jason, this one guy in the back seat goes, "Hey, you're not the shooter, are you?"

189
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,440
 Jason's driving the car. "No, no." Drops him off at their house. The whole thing, he started,

190
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:25,360
 he shot the woman in the parking lot at 5.40pm. At this point, it's like 11pm, 12. It's gone on for

191
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,400
 hours. The cops run up on his car and he offers no resistance. Cops take him down, they cuff him,

192
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,280
 they arrest him. When they ask him, once again, like in the first thing, you get an insane person,

193
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:44,800
 you put them in a room and you can get them to talk. They ask him, "What? What was all that about?"

194
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,440
 And he said he would tell them, but he said it would, quote, "blow their mind."

195
00:18:49,440 --> 00:19:00,000
 This is a very, very scary story for me. Not just because his name is Jason,

196
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,880
 I'm like, "Oh no, Friday 13th, it's super spooky." Because he has no history of criminality, he has no

197
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,920
 history of mental issues. And then he begins, he killed six people total that night and injured

198
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:23,120
 multiple more. We begin to look at what happened, what triggered this. And it was either a normal

199
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,360
 person who had a clearly psychotic break, like someone who maybe he had anxiety issues or stress

200
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
 issues or some sort of mental issues. Those aren't really even mental issues. Those are stuff that

201
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,800
 everyone deals with, but high-level mental issues that were hidden for 44 years. Because his wife was

202
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,600
 like, "This is totally out of the blue." He was acting weird that day. And people said previously,

203
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,680
 he was acting a little depressed, but not, shoot, six people randomly depressed. And even his wife

204
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,360
 was like, "Yeah, he was acting kind of weird. He started his Uber shift and then he came home,

205
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,520
 was acting weird and tried taking another car. He did grab his gun, but you know,

206
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,560
 figured he's an Uber driver, he's probably just being saved." But she could tell something was

207
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,520
 a little off after he started to shift that day, but just kind of came out of blue. So he either

208
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,200
 snapped, had a complete psychotic breakdown and murdered these people, which would say to us,

209
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,960
 us people who aren't insane, that why couldn't it happen to us as well? Why couldn't we go about

210
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,440
 life totally normal and then one day wake up, do your job, and then snap. We always hear that term.

211
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
 They snapped and they shot up the workplace. They snapped and did this. But when we look at it,

212
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,240
 that's very rarely the case. When you talk to friends and families and stuff like that,

213
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,040
 people who really, really know the person, not just the neighbors you were saying,

214
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,640
 who would have thought he was such a nice guy? Usually there's a descent into madness, but as

215
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,960
 far as we can tell with this guy, he got a job at Uber and then one day just snapped. That's scary

216
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,320
 enough because it means it can happen to anybody. The other alternative though, his version of events

217
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:05,200
 isn't scary. It's bone chilling. This is what he tells the cops. February 20th, he gets into his

218
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:13,120
 car and turns on the Uber app on his phone and he sees what he calls the Eastern Star. Now the

219
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,600
 Eastern Star is basically the upside down pentagram, which is usually connected to

220
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,880
 Satanism. The Eastern Star is the specific name of a Masonic symbol, a Mason group called the Eastern

221
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:34,320
 Star. So it's using the Masonic name for a symbol that we're all familiar with. If you saw an upside

222
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,680
 down pentagram, you're like, "Oh, it's like St. Warshm." He sees the Uber app as an Eastern Star.

223
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,040
 Now I actually am not super familiar with Uber. I went and looked it up. That doesn't seem to be the

224
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,840
 case. I found one image that had the Uber app that had an upside down pentagram. I don't know if

225
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,880
 that's a recent change. When I typed in Uber logo, it had something that looked more like the

226
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,680
 umbrella logo, but there was one image where it had an upside down pentagram. He says, he gets in

227
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,440
 his car, he turns on his Uber app and he sees the Eastern Star and he says, "I said the name of the

228
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:18,560
 Star." I have no idea what that means. Did he say out loud the Eastern Star? Did he call it by another

229
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,880
 name? What does that mean? But he sees an icon on his phone and he says, "I said the name of the Star."

230
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:35,120
 And then it morphed into the head of the devil. He said, "It looked like a cow with horns." Which,

231
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,760
 again, technically the devil is generally like a goat image, but he saw it. I'm not going to quibble.

232
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,800
 I'm not going to quibble with the hallucinations and or paranormal activity that he's viewing.

233
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,400
 He's looking at his phone. He sees the Eastern Star shift into a demonic head. He presses the

234
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,680
 button to activate his Uber requests. And whether or not you work for Uber, if you ever are looking

235
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,880
 at your phone and the devil's head pops up on it, don't press the button. Don't don't activate that.

236
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:14,160
 But he presses it and then the icon, the Uber icon, turns from red to black. And he said that

237
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:23,920
 he got a "assignment." He said that he immediately became possessed. It was interesting because he

238
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:33,120
 has a... he experiences like a chain of events while he's possessed. First off, he said, "It's like

239
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,080
 I got a navigation request." So as you're driving through town and you have your map

240
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,520
 quest going or whatever, and it's like, "Turn left here. Turn right." He goes, "I felt like

241
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:52,080
 I was in control, but something was telling me to go to these various locations. So I would go there.

242
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:59,280
 I'd see someone. I'd pick them up. I'd go there. I'd see someone. I'd shoot them." Then,

243
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,360
 the navigation feeling left him. Because remember, we're talking a course of hours this took place.

244
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:14,320
 The navigation left him. He was no longer in control of his body. He was in his body, a prisoner

245
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,680
 in a meat suit. And his arms were controlling the car. Something was steering the car. Something

246
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:28,480
 was pressing the gas pedal. Something was talking to the passengers in the back seat. He was simply

247
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,720
 in his body. Something else was in control. And then he leaves his body. And at that point,

248
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,520
 he's floating outside of his body. Everything's in third person mode. He's watching himself drive

249
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,880
 the car. He's watching himself stalk through the parking lot. He's watching himself grab the pistol.

250
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,840
 He said, because the cops are like, "Do you remember killing anyone?" He goes, "I don't remember

251
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,600
 pulling the trigger. I remember the sound of the gunshots." He goes, "And I remember the recoil

252
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,560
 of the gun, but I don't remember ever pulling the trigger or pointing it at anybody. I don't

253
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,200
 even know who I killed. I wasn't in control of my body. I was a prisoner." When he was picking up,

254
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,680
 because remember, again, multiple hours, he's still picking up Uber people. One person said,

255
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,240
 because he was one of the first passengers after this dude hit the button, the guy was like,

256
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,400
 driving super crazy, going really fast. And the dude was like, "Just let me out. Just let me out."

257
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,120
 He got out of the car. That happened before he murdered anyone, but it was after he had pressed

258
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,320
 the button, pressed the red button. Other people said, "It's totally fine. Like, we didn't notice

259
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,520
 anything wrong. We got in there. He drove us to the destination. Might have had a chit chat.

260
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,800
 Might have not said anything. Never would have suspected this man was a active shooter."

261
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,560
 Other people said he seemed a little manic, but otherwise, again, not manic to the point where

262
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,360
 we thought he was killing people. It's interesting to note that the first passenger he picks up,

263
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,320
 he's acting all crazy with, but as the night goes on, he seems to calm down, as if something that

264
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:07,440
 is in possession of him is learning to balance things out, learning to act more human. 540

265
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,120
 shoots the woman in the parking lot. Then we have the last victims at 1026 when he shoots the four

266
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,480
 women at the Cracker Barrel parking lot. He begins to say stuff to the police, too, that he realized

267
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,520
 that if you drive through stop signs at 100 miles an hour, you can quote "go places." Now, obviously,

268
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,400
 you're going places because you're leaving. You're going 100 miles an hour, but it sounds like he's

269
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,680
 talking more about shifting through planes of reality. If someone says, "Hey, if you go really

270
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,560
 fast, you go places," you get the context, but if someone who's claiming they're possessed by a

271
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,120
 demon says, "If you go 100 miles an hour through a stop sign, you'll quote unquote "go places,"

272
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,240
 it gives it a different context, right? So Jason ends up getting arrested and he is found guilty

273
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,760
 because this happened a few years ago. He's already found guilty. He got sentenced to life in prison.

274
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,800
 Obviously, people aren't like, "Well, the devil made him do it, so we're going to let him go,"

275
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,760
 but that is his story that he was possessed. And the cops go, "Why didn't you open fire on us

276
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,560
 when we showed up to arrest you?" And he goes, "He had a simple answer for that." He had a very

277
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:20,720
 simple answer for that. He goes, "Oh, when the cops pulled me over, the app on my phone went from

278
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,840
 black to red. So of course I didn't kill you. I wasn't possessed anymore."

279
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,160
 Cops walking up behind his vehicle and he's just sitting there back in control of his body.

280
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,640
 The Uber icon is returned to red. The cops pull him out of the vehicle, throw him to the ground.

281
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,360
 "It's okay. You don't have to worry about me, officers. I'm Jason. I'm not possessed anymore."

282
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,680
 He told the officers he has a new understanding of mass shootings. He understands why mass

283
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,600
 shootings take place now. He believes that all of them are full body possessions,

284
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,200
 that these people who are living lives, maybe they already have a little bit of mental health

285
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,840
 struggles, maybe they were like Jason and by all accounts perfectly fine person, but they get possessed.

286
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,920
 They're walking through the school. They're walking through their workplace.

287
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:22,640
 They're walking through the mall. But they're not there. Something else is controlling their body

288
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,200
 while their soul is floating helplessly nearby watching the massacre take place.

289
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,400
 It's one of those stories that is really scary to me because again either he just had a psychotic

290
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:42,000
 break or a totally normal person not doing Ouija board stuff, not contacting dark spirits and

291
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,880
 graveyards, not spending half of his life worshiping the dark lords by sacrificing cats. A man just

292
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:57,200
 starting his shift looking at an app on his phone saying a name, pressing a button.

293
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,440
 He said, "I wish I never said the name of the star." Wish I had never said the name of the star.

294
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,600
 He said that during his interviews and again we, I don't know what name he's talking about. If he

295
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,040
 just said Eastern Star, which I mean, that's a Masonic order. That's very, I mean, that's a,

296
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,400
 you can look that up on Wikipedia and half of Wikipedia is not running around gunning people

297
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,400
 down. Did he know another name of the star? He said out loud, he goes, "I wish I never said

298
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,640
 the name of the star out loud." That was one of his statements he made. But it's just a terrifying

299
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,480
 story because if we accept his version of events, it was normal up until he pressed the button.

300
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:48,880
 Imagine your entire life can change in the blink of an eye. Not just yours, but the lives of innocent

301
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:57,040
 people around you. You lived a good life, you did things right, and then one day you get a little

302
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:06,080
 curious and you click a button and that happened to a normal guy. What about us? What about us who

303
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,720
 researched the paranormal, who look into conspiracies, who are going on creepy websites at two in the

304
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:20,240
 morning or checking out random apps that a friend sends you? "Hey, check this out. Isn't this weird?"

305
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,080
 If this can happen to him, why can't it happen to any one of us?

306
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:38,320
 Full body possession, just by clicking a button. If this is the cause of active shooters,

307
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:47,280
 the forces of darkness have a terrible weapon, and any one of us can fall prey to it next.

308
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:55,760
 And guys, let's go ahead and end it with another amazing song from one of my favorite bands,

309
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,000
 "Sundiver." This fits the car theme. I know we just told a spooky story, but let's sit back,

310
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:19,200
 relax, try not to get super scared, and let's listen to "205" by Sundiver.

 Late one IC 9

 Oregonian Poltergeist

316
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,640
 My only company

317
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,240
 Mind led by a dim philosophy

318
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,720
 Spirit by the thought of you touching me

319
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:38,240
 And I could swear by your urgency

320
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,240
 That this is all a dream

321
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,120
 I came to know you into my league

322
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:58,320
 And I woke up with your name on my tongue

323
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,920
 With your name on my tongue

324
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,840
 Came to your place in the blink of an eye

325
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,840
 The door was unlocked so I went inside

326
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 And searched for you but you were nowhere to be found this time

327
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,600
 My mind made sick by TV shows

328
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:47,600
 Creates horrifying scenarios

329
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,600
 I could tell by their clarity

330
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,600
 That this is all a dream

331
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,720
 I came to know you into my league

332
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,720
 And I woke up with your name on my tongue

333
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:22,720
 With your name on my tongue

334
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,720
 I came to know you into my league

335
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:40,720
 And I woke up with your name on my tongue

336
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,720
 With your name on my tongue

337
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,720
 I found you seated beneath a tree

338
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:04,720
 You and your fiery eyes staring up at me

339
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,720
 You had this look of tranquility

340
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,840
 I came to know you into my league

341
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,840
 And I woke up with your name on my tongue

342
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:39,840

 With your name on my tongue

346
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,960
 With your name on my tongue

347
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:18,960
 With your name on my tongue

348
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:28,960
 With your name on my tongue

349
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,960
 With your name on my tongue

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:46,960
 With your name on my tongue

 I found you seated beneath a tree

 You and your fiery eyes staring up at me

 It was all a dream
