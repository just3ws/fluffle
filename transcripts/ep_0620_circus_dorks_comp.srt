1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 What is the Buddhist view on artificial intelligence?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,240
 The answer will terrify you.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,640
 And then we take a look at the story of a man known as Philip Taylor Cramer.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,880
 He went from being a basist for the band Iron Butterfly to working on top secret missile

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,480
 systems for the US government.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,720
 But the real mystery began when he died.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,680
 Is it a tragic case of suicide or a cover-up to steal the most important invention in human

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
 history?

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:43,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,480
 So we're going to get started right away.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,600
 In comes a giant bucket of food.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
 It's a trough.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,680
 But what's in this trough is what's important.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,880
 It's one of our live stream supporters.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
 In this trough of food.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,760
 This is the most unflattery introduction ever.

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
 Your slop.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
 Your slop, I tell you.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,980
 It's Chime Chili.

25
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,280
 You know, because chili is food, right?

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,560
 Chime Chili rises out of the trough of food and begins walking towards us.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
 Chime, thank you so much for your live stream donation.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,600
 It was actually Thanksgiving of 2019.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
 I don't even know if you still listen to the show.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
 Hopefully you're still alive.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,000
 But Chime Chili, either way, you are our pilot, our captain this episode.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,680
 So sorry it took so long to get around to it, Chime Chili, but you are the supporter

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
 for today.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,800
 So I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,200
 We're going to toss them in your chili soaked hands.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,880
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,800
 We are headed out to Tibet.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
 Chime Chili is flying us out to Tibet.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,960
 Specifically, we're going to the home of the Dalai Lama.

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,560
 I found this article just today.

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
 It's really creepy.

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
 Really creepy article.

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
 I found this interview.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,060
 I found it on allamut.com.

46
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,640
 The interview is actually from a book called Gentle Bridges, Conversations with the Dalai

47
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,520
 Lama on the Sciences of Mind by Jeremy Hayward.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
 It was published in 1992.

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,160
 And it's just an interview with the Dalai Lama on a bunch of stuff, Sciences of the

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
 Mind.

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
 If you can believe it, the title is actually accurate.

52
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,560
 So this interview starts off, and again, it's a snippet.

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,640
 We don't have the full interview here.

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,080
 But the question that's being led into is, what is artificial intelligence?

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,320
 What is artificial intelligence to Buddhism?

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,920
 Specifically, the Buddhism idea of reincarnation.

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,200
 So that's kind of the setup that's going on.

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,040
 So the interview actually starts this snippet that we're seeing.

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,440
 I don't know how many times I'm going to use the word snippet.

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,960
 The Dalai Lama asks to clarify, he goes, "What are computers made out of?

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,920
 They're made out of plastic and metal and things like that, right?"

62
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,000
 And the interviewer goes, "Yes, they are made out of natural components.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Electric is a natural component.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 It's made from petroleum."

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,080
 So here is the Dalai Lama's first answer when he's talking about artificial intelligence.

66
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,360
 It's very fascinating.

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,720
 He says, "It is very difficult to say that it's not a living being," talking about

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
 the computer.

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,240
 "It's very difficult to say that it's not a living being, that it doesn't have cognition,

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,120
 even from a Buddhist point of view.

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:16,120
 So the computer itself can in some way be considered a living thing because it can think.

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,760
 You can't say that it doesn't have cognition because that's what it's built to do is to

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
 think."

74
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,800
 The interviewer then says, "Well, the thing with artificial intelligence is that it's

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,480
 a new intelligence that's being created."

76
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,560
 So how does that work into the Buddhist philosophy that you could actually create a new intelligence?

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 Here we have another quote from him.

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:43,520
 "There is no possibility for a new cognition, which has no relationship to a previous continuum,

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
 to arise at all."

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,040
 So he's saying right there, every consciousness that exists now existed at the beginning of

81
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
 time.

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,540
 They can't be obliterated.

83
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,680
 They can't be birthed.

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
 There's no such thing as a new cognition.

85
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,200
 Everything that is thinking now was thinking at the beginning of time and will think until

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
 infinity goes on.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,880
 So you can't have artificial intelligence is what he's saying, but it's not that cut

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
 and dry.

89
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,600
 He's not saying quit programming, Quake 5, guys.

90
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,000
 He goes on to say, "I can't totally rule out the possibility that if all the external

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 conditions and the karmic action were there, a stream of consciousness might actually enter

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 into a computer."

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,160
 The interviewer then basically says, "So you're saying that someone could be reincarnated

94
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,440
 into a computer."

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,280
 If you had, the example they used, if you had a very powerful Buddhist monk who was trying

96
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,760
 to project his consciousness into a computer before he passed away, that his consciousness

97
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,720
 could enter the computer, is that possible?

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
 And the Dalai Lama said, "Yes."

99
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:55,040
 Basically, the Dalai Lama says, "If the computer has the physical ability to hold a human consciousness,

100
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,800
 yes, it is possible."

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
 You don't have to worry about that pocket.

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
 You don't have to worry about being trapped in a calculator, in a solar power calculator

103
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
 for the rest of your life.

104
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,800
 If the computer has the physical makeup, or "the ability to serve as a basis for a continuum

105
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,840
 of consciousness," yes, it is possible.

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,800
 He does say this is something that we will have to see what happens, but you can't program

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
 an artificial intelligence.

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,000
 You can program something to mimic a human, but the second it is intelligence, that is

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
 a reincarnated person.

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
 You can't create consciousness.

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,720
 It has existed since the beginning of time.

112
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,920
 It has been Leichen, trapped in the middle of a meteorite.

113
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,600
 It has been a sand frog of Remus 12.

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,120
 It has been a young boy playing T-ball.

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
 It's been you.

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,920
 It goes back to being the sand frog.

117
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,840
 And then just throughout reality, and then eventually when they develop that robot, and

118
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,520
 they turn it on and they spend all this time trying to replicate a human brain, and it actually

119
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,120
 has consciousness, that is a living consciousness in that system.

120
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,740
 You cannot create consciousness.

121
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,400
 Consciousness was created when the universe was created.

122
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
 It's a fascinating question.

123
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,520
 I could literally dive into this with so many different levels, which I'm going to because

124
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,760
 this is a podcast where we do this stuff.

125
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,320
 First off, you have to look at the time period, 1992.

126
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,560
 I don't even think sneakers came out.

127
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
 The shoes were real, but like the hackers movies.

128
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,840
 The average person didn't know what a computer was at that time.

129
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,040
 They knew that it was a box that people used to do work on.

130
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,800
 But as far as like the internet wasn't around, or it wasn't in popular use, it was a totally

131
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,240
 different ballgame.

132
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,840
 So if you talk to people, computers seemed more mundane and magical at the same time.

133
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
 What?

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,520
 I can hold all my spreadsheets and this one thing can hold 512 megabytes.

135
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,280
 This is amazing.

136
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,000
 But you also just used it for work and to do spreadsheets and maybe play Snake.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,040
 It'd be interesting to see his point of view and AI was light years away back then.

138
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,100
 It's still pretty far away now, but it seems to be closer.

139
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
 So we have that.

140
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
 We have the technological thing.

141
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,960
 I think nowadays based on this, we cannot program AI, but I think we have computers powerful

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,080
 enough that could hold a human consciousness.

143
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,880
 Now you go Jason, you know the brain is like the super advanced computer and we don't have

144
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,160
 chips that are that advanced.

145
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,880
 There, you couldn't replicate a human consciousness 100%, but remember the idea of consciousness

146
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,600
 in the Buddhist tradition is a life force.

147
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,800
 It's not necessarily being able to make these decisions.

148
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
 The Sandfrogs of Romulus 12, you could put that on a hard drive.

149
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,720
 That creature I just made up, that's my argument.

150
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,320
 You can't argue with it because I made it up.

151
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,120
 You may not be able to use human consciousness.

152
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
 Maybe I shouldn't use that word.

153
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,280
 A human intelligence on a computer right now, but you could definitely, the brain, the

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,080
 processing power of a computer, I would argue is much more powerful than a lot of animals.

155
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,920
 Don't look that up.

156
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,720
 Don't look that up unless I'm right.

157
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
 And then look it up and put it in the comments.

158
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
 Jason was right.

159
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
 So you have that.

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,640
 So the technology is there.

161
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,200
 But what's terrifying about this is that the Dalai Lama is basically saying that yes, you

162
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,040
 can be reincarnated into a computer.

163
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,600
 But computers don't die.

164
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,040
 If you're reincarnated into a tree, you have a life cycle.

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,720
 If you're reincarnated into a rock, it has a life cycle.

166
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,080
 If you're reincarnated into a metal, into an ore, it has a life cycle.

167
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,760
 Even if that life cycle is it being churned out of the earth, sitting on a beach for 10,000

168
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:44,000
 years, and eventually as the plates of the earth shift and move, the chunk of iron falls

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,840
 into a chasm and is compressed and pushed and morphed and melded and it's over 10 million

170
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,600
 years makes it way back down to the earth's core and melts and becomes something different.

171
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,920
 Don't look that up either guys.

172
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,440
 This is not a science podcast for a reason.

173
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
 But you know what I mean?

174
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,480
 Everything has a life cycle it wears down.

175
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
 Computers don't.

176
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,320
 And you go Jason, if the earth can swallow up a chunk of iron, I think it can do the

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,920
 same thing to my Macintosh.

178
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,240
 But it's different because the iron is a single component.

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,320
 A computer is like it's hard drive.

180
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
 Which okay.

181
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,720
 Now I'm thinking about it.

182
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,600
 I would much rather be a computer hard drive than a chunk of iron.

183
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
 Because a chunk of iron you're going to be hanging out for a while.

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,880
 You're not going to be able to do anything.

185
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,400
 My point is, okay, forget the chunk of iron.

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
 That was a bad example.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,080
 Edit that out in your brain because I'm too lazy to do it myself on the podcast.

188
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,680
 If you had your choice between being a mighty redwood or a computer hard drive, what would

189
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,760
 you rather be?

190
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,520
 You may want to be a computer hard drive because then you're like surfing the internet.

191
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,120
 So you're literally surfing the internet, little digital you.

192
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,520
 But the tree can watch the sunrise and the sunset.

193
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,400
 I don't even like the outdoors.

194
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,120
 But still I'd be a tree.

195
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,160
 You know owls would be hanging out on me and I'd be like dropping sap on campers and going

196
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
 hehehe.

197
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,640
 And they're like I'm allergic to sap.

198
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
 I know I'm a tree.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,520
 And I am doing all this stuff.

200
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,840
 I'm doing all these high chinks.

201
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,600
 The computer hard drive is going to end up in a dump somewhere.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,760
 First off it's going to get, you don't know whose hard drive you're on.

203
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
 You could be full of porn.

204
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 It could be the worst existence ever.

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 You're like great.

206
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,560
 Why did I have to jump into this hard drive?

207
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,600
 Or it could be some bunch of spreadsheets and things like that.

208
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,880
 And then you just get tossed in the garbage and then you're just this shut off hard drive.

209
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,720
 You're trapped in a hard drive of a voided existence and you don't die when they shut

210
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 it off.

211
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
 You're the hard drive.

212
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 You're the information on the hard drive.

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,240
 The hard drive would need to be obliterated for you to go into your next life.

214
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
 So it's horrible.

215
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,640
 No one wants to be reincarnated as a computer.

216
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,960
 I don't think a computer nerd, if they thought about it for a second, would want to become

217
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
 a hard drive.

218
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
 So that's creepy.

219
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,440
 But then we even have this creepy thing.

220
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,200
 What if you get reincarnated as NPCs in video games?

221
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,600
 Like what if all those NPCs you're running over and you're with your car in Grand Theft

222
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,920
 Auto 5 or like those chickens you're selling on Stardew Valley and things like that.

223
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,800
 What if those are actually dead people?

224
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,640
 What if those are reincarnated people as chickens in Stardew Valley and people you're running

225
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
 over with your car?

226
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
 I don't know.

227
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,280
 I don't know what to answer to these questions.

228
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
 Ask the Dalai Lama.

229
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,120
 I just find it really interesting and I think the way he approached it was like, "Oh yeah,

230
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,600
 you can be reincarnated as a computer."

231
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,440
 And I don't think he had any idea of how just chaotic and filthy and dark computers were

232
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
 going to be.

233
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,000
 I'd rather be reincarnated than a lot of stuff than some random computer sitting on a shelf

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,280
 at a Best Buy and just so worried.

235
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,360
 So worried every time someone came by to buy me I'm like, "No, no, not you, not you."

236
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,960
 And you just, it's just don't know where you're going to end up.

237
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,320
 I think he was actually talking about it.

238
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,600
 I think he was probably thinking more like advanced deep blue computers that are playing

239
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,240
 chess against Russians or you know like androids.

240
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,520
 But imagine if you died right now and then you blink and the next thing you know 50 years

241
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,160
 have passed and you're in some bimbo sex robot and you can't move.

242
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,040
 Well you can when the guy's moving your arms and stuff like that and you're just like propped

243
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,120
 up in this dude's apartment and your entire existence is just you propped up in this dude's

244
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,760
 apartment and he's like, he's cleaning you off.

245
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,360
 He's like, "I'm never going to get rid of you.

246
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 I'm going to keep you for as long as possible."

247
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,080
 And he's doing drugs, he's doing a bunch of drugs to make himself live forever.

248
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
 He's taking beta blockers.

249
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,560
 He's like, "Me and you are going to have so much fun."

250
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,720
 That wouldn't be fun, right?

251
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,440
 I mean even if you're into the, even if you're into chess and that's my favorite fantasy.

252
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,360
 Still, okay, fair.

253
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,320
 But you're just sitting in the corner of a room.

254
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,400
 You don't even get to do stuff.

255
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
 You're just a robot.

256
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,600
 You're like, "Chase and that's my fantasy."

257
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 Okay, okay.

258
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,960
 Maybe you are into that.

259
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,840
 But I think most of us wouldn't want to be reincarnated as some like sex toy sitting in

260
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 an empty bucket.

261
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,800
 I don't think that Tully Lama was talking about anything electronic.

262
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,120
 But it's just this.

263
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,000
 It's just the idea from this one interview that I read, from this one thing I read on

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,800
 the internet today that I probably could have done more research on.

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
 I go, "Oh no, don't die guys.

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Don't die.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,440
 You may be reincarnated as a dildo."

268
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 I don't know.

269
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,800
 If it's super advanced, it may not.

270
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,800
 I'm not trying to disrespect Buddhism or Tully Lama, but if it is advanced enough, if the

271
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,920
 technology can actually hold a consciousness and there's no such thing as new consciousness,

272
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,600
 that means that what is in that AI robot is actually a human or potentially a human or

273
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,800
 was a human or all of those things combined.

274
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 Super spooky.

275
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,240
 According to what I'm looking at, that went on for a long time, but I'm not just gonna

276
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,400
 do a robot sex special.

277
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,480
 I don't have time to tell the butterfly story, the Iron Butterfly story.

278
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 It's really interesting.

279
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
 One, Tressa recommended it, but we're gonna have to save that chime.

280
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,560
 Chili.

281
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
 Let's hop in the Carbentercopter.

282
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,760
 I'm gonna find another story to do real quick here.

283
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
 Let's take a look.

284
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
 See what we got.

285
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,560
 Something spooky maybe.

286
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,200
 Okay, so here we go.

287
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,240
 I found one that's short and interesting and actually has some terrifying implications

288
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,360
 for us as fans of the paranormal and the world of the weird.

289
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,120
 Chime Chili, let's go ahead and hop in that Carbentercopter.

290
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,240
 We are leaving behind Tibet.

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:38,520
 We are headed out to Vladvistok, Russia.

292
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,240
 But we're not gonna be wearing our winter gear that we normally have to wear every time

293
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
 we go to Russia.

294
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,520
 We've been doing a lot of stories in Siberia lately.

295
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,240
 We're actually going to the beach, so I hope you guys brought your swim trunks and your

296
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,640
 little tank tops that have the black and white stripes on them.

297
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 It's old-timey.

298
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
 It's actually not old-timey.

299
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 It's 1989.

300
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,800
 But we're going retro.

301
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,880
 We all got giant mustaches and we got strongman clothes on.

302
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,920
 Chime Chili, go ahead and land us at this beach.

303
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
 We all get out.

304
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
 We're throwing a beach ball around.

305
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,560
 And while we're having fun, we should be paying attention to the story.

306
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,240
 We see another group of people there.

307
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,760
 It's a public beach, right?

308
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
 We're not running them off.

309
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
 It's fine.

310
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,240
 There's a group of people there and they see this super convoluted.

311
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,840
 Here's the story.

312
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,400
 I take the beach ball.

313
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,920
 Everyone sits down and goes, "Okay, let me just tell you the story.

314
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,320
 This episode's already running long."

315
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 I think.

316
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
 Can't really tell.

317
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,120
 But anyways, there's a group of people on the beach.

318
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
 That's not us.

319
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,800
 There's a group of people on the beach.

320
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,480
 They see another group of people on the beach.

321
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,600
 That other group of people on the beach, they look like a bunch of weirdos.

322
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
 So there's 12 normal people on the beach.

323
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,200
 And they're looking at a group of a bunch of freaks.

324
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,160
 What they describe them as circus freak dorks.

325
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,320
 It's actually the term they use, which is pretty hilarious.

326
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
 Circus freak dorks.

327
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
 They're staring at them.

328
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,960
 They're trying to like, "What's up with those dorks?

329
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
 I wonder if they have lunch money."

330
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,520
 "Billy, you've been graduated from high school forever.

331
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,480
 I know, but I still want lunch money.

332
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
 You own a restaurant.

333
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
 You don't need lunch money."

334
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,600
 But still, they approach this group of circus freak dorks.

335
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,400
 And as they get closer to them, they realize neither of those three words apply.

336
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,160
 So maybe freaks.

337
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,320
 Because what they're really looking at are great aliens.

338
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:32,080
 What's interesting, they describe these guys not just as dorks, but as quote, "repugnant."

339
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,280
 It's an interesting word because if you saw an alien life form, we shared DNA.

340
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,880
 We nobody likes spiders.

341
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,840
 Some people do, but spiders are gross.

342
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,920
 Slugs and snails are gross.

343
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,760
 But what is a banana but a hard slug?

344
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,560
 And we eat those.

345
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,760
 And what is crackerjacks?

346
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,000
 What is crackerjacks but a brown spider?

347
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,160
 It's the size of a spider.

348
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,440
 And when you kill a spider and they curl up, and then if you painted it brown, I bet you

349
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,320
 anything, do anything, I could trick you into eating it.

350
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,200
 What I'm saying is that even the disgusting stuff on earth, we can see parallels to us.

351
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,240
 And we don't want spiders around us because we know they can hurt us.

352
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,120
 But if you saw a bunch of ants walking around, whatever, you're not going to pay them any

353
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
 mind.

354
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,640
 And most spiders, as long as they're far away from you, walking down the street catching

355
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,080
 a cab, you're totally fine with them.

356
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,880
 But an alien, something that actually evolved on another planet, would be disgusting to

357
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
 us.

358
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,800
 We would go into shock seeing them.

359
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,520
 That's just the fact of the matter.

360
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,560
 It's not like Star Trek.

361
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,160
 We wouldn't be able to process it.

362
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,640
 Human beings can barely process paranormal events from earth, like ghosts.

363
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,320
 You can look down a hallway and get a creepy sensation.

364
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,280
 You don't realize you're actually looking at a child with no eyes standing at the end

365
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,400
 of your hallway.

366
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,520
 That's what you're seeing.

367
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,960
 But your brain won't let you perceive it.

368
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,680
 So you see an empty hallway.

369
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,040
 You just get a little bit of a shiver.

370
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,000
 When you're walking up the stairs and you feel like something's at the bottom of the stairs,

371
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
 sometimes it's just your imagination.

372
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
 And sometimes there's something at the bottom of the stairs.

373
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,880
 But when you glance back down, you don't see anything there.

374
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
 You're relieved.

375
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,160
 Because if your brain let you see what you actually saw, which was the old man with the

376
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,000
 pitchfork, at the bottom of your stairs, you would lose your mind.

377
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Your brain...

378
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Good night, kids!

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,160
 I'm glad you guys enjoyed this episode.

380
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
 You lose your mind.

381
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,360
 So your brain actually will shut down when you're seeing stuff that you can't comprehend.

382
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,960
 We've talked about that a couple times on the show.

383
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,280
 We talked about it last week as well.

384
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,160
 With an alien, it's a physical being.

385
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,320
 You can't ignore it.

386
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
 Although some people do.

387
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,160
 Some people, their minds will shut off and they're like, "I don't remember what happened."

388
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,720
 But they would be absolutely disgusting to us.

389
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,080
 Now you could say like the Pleiadians, the Nordics, maybe they're like star seeds and

390
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 stuff like that.

391
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
 Fine.

392
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,560
 But if you actually saw a reptilian, it would nauseate you.

393
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,880
 It's not a flickering image of Obama giving a speech on CNN.

394
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,680
 It's not a reptilian.

395
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,080
 It's artifacts and digital.

396
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,920
 Because if it was an actual reptilian, it's not like the show V. It's not like anything

397
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,960
 else that has reptilians in it.

398
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,440
 It's not King Koopa!

399
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,000
 It would make you sick to your stomach.

400
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,040
 So when you come across stories, again, I always like this, the outliers.

401
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
 The outliers.

402
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,200
 When we look at these stories, it gives it a little more flavor to it because that's

403
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
 what would happen.

404
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,000
 If you were sitting, if you looked up right now and you saw a great alien sitting in your

405
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,040
 kitchen, you'd get nauseous.

406
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,040
 So the fact that they say they was repugnant really makes the story more believable than

407
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,240
 a lot of stories that I've come across.

408
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,160
 Because we're going to need a little bit of believability for where we're going on

409
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,280
 this one.

410
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,240
 So that's the end of that encounter.

411
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
 But it's not the end of the story.

412
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,840
 There is a group known as Vafuon.

413
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,040
 I tried looking them up.

414
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,120
 It's some sort of UFO organization.

415
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,360
 I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

416
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,280
 They've been really good to us in the past.

417
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,200
 Haven't come across anything knowingly fraudulent.

418
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,400
 And they'll actually call stuff out as fraudulent, so I really trust that website.

419
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,680
 But there was a person who worked for Vafuon, a V-A-U-F-O-N.

420
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,560
 But anyways, there was a person with that organization called Alexander Rempel.

421
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,160
 And they wanted to...

422
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,840
 Okay.

423
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,360
 And as I'm looking at my notes, they didn't describe him as dorks.

424
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,280
 I hate to break the flow here, but they didn't describe him as dorks.

425
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,960
 I don't know why I wrote that.

426
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,080
 They described him as circus freak dwarfs.

427
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,000
 Which makes more sense, right?

428
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,080
 I couldn't understand why they called him a bunch of dorks, a bunch of nerds.

429
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,800
 But they were circus freak dwarfs.

430
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,400
 And as they got closer to him, they realized they were hairless and had gray skin and

431
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
 lipless mouths and big eyes and things like that.

432
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,920
 So they didn't use the term gray alien.

433
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,360
 They were describing them.

434
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,320
 Because in 1989 Russia, again, that wasn't a super well known term.

435
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,960
 We've covered a lot of Russian stories.

436
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,960
 But they'll describe the features of a gray, but the word gray is not used in the original

437
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
 story.

438
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,800
 They also weren't dorks, okay?

439
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,320
 It wasn't casting for revenge of the nerds and nerds in space.

440
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 Copyright.

441
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,400
 Don't steal my idea.

442
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,480
 Circus Freak Dwarfs.

443
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,880
 But anyways, Alexander Rempel and the Vafuon group wanted to see more about this story.

444
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,440
 They wanted to interview these 12 people who had had this encounter on the beach.

445
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,000
 It was a public setting and you had these dorks.

446
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,920
 Yeah, I'm just gonna keep calling them dorks.

447
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,520
 He had these dorks walking around.

448
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,640
 Seven years later when Vafuon was looking at these people.

449
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,360
 So now we're in the year 1996.

450
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,440
 This is what they find out.

451
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,600
 They tracked down the 12 witnesses.

452
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,920
 Three of the witnesses had been killed in car accidents.

453
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,120
 Apparently separate car accidents.

454
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,200
 Five of them had been diagnosed with brain tumors.

455
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,600
 Two of them had already had surgery for their brain tumors.

456
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,640
 Two others were located in a mental hospital and the remaining two were never found.

457
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,240
 Now it could just be that those remaining two moved on with their lives and friends

458
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,880
 separate and Soviet unions collapsing.

459
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,920
 They're not really keeping good paperwork on where people are moving to at the time.

460
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,680
 But they could have also met a bizarre end.

461
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,200
 Three are dead.

462
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,680
 Two are missing.

463
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,520
 The other seven have had a string of bad luck.

464
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,360
 Not saying that's good luck, but yeah, five people have brain tumors and two in mental hospitals.

465
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,120
 This is an interesting story because of the implications of it.

466
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,720
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

467
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
 And let's take a look at this phenomenon that we call UFOs.

468
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,080
 The question always is how come there's not more.

469
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,400
 If it's a real phenomenon, how come they're not flying over Los Angeles?

470
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
 How come they haven't made their presence known?

471
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
 How come it's always some Hick farmer in the middle of nowhere who sees them?

472
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
 Those are all stereotypes.

473
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,600
 There have been sightings over major cities.

474
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,040
 There's been stories of them making contact with governments.

475
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,960
 And it's definitely not always the drunk Hick driving home.

476
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,480
 We've covered literally hundreds of stories on this show that are not that trope.

477
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,520
 So that's not the case.

478
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,800
 But that's kind of the stereotype of it.

479
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,400
 It's not like telling a ghost story.

480
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,560
 People don't really laugh at you when you tell a ghost story.

481
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,080
 Some people might, but UFOs are still considered a funny topic.

482
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,600
 You go ahead, you get probed, you know?

483
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,040
 So people aren't telling the fact that they're seeing UFOs.

484
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,000
 I think a lot of people see UFOs and have more than just the light.

485
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,800
 Again, I'm not talking about lights in the sky.

486
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
 See that all the time.

487
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,560
 I've seen weird things in the sky, flying metal cubes and stuff like that.

488
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,760
 I don't know what it is.

489
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,080
 I don't think it's aliens.

490
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,400
 I'm talking about like closer encounters, second, third, fourth encounters.

491
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,480
 What if these are happening all the time?

492
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,440
 And people aren't talking about them.

493
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,920
 And then these people get a car accident and die.

494
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,520
 These people develop a brain tumor.

495
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
 Seven years later, you develop a brain tumor.

496
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
 You develop some sort of cancer.

497
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,840
 And you don't even think about that time that you woke up in bed, you're reading a book,

498
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,680
 and you fell asleep, and you left the light on.

499
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,800
 When you woke up, the light was off, but there was something glowing at the foot of your bed.

500
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,960
 You don't even make the connection eight, nine, ten years later when you're going to

501
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,840
 the doctor and they're like, "Yeah, we know what the lump is."

502
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,880
 You don't even make that connection.

503
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,600
 What if this happens all the time?

504
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,800
 I'm not saying everyone who developed some sort of disease or everyone gets in a car accident

505
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,600
 has been visited by aliens.

506
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,640
 But just statistically, some of them were.

507
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,560
 I think that's how statistics work, right?

508
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,920
 What if this is more common than we think?

509
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,280
 What if this is the one story?

510
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,560
 And to be fair, we've covered, again, hundreds of stories where this isn't the ending, where

511
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,040
 people have an alien visitation and then they live 20, 30, 40 years after the visitation

512
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,520
 and they're like, "Some day my space brothers will come back.

513
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,360
 We've covered stories like that before."

514
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,520
 But what if those are the outliers?

515
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,440
 And because those stories are around for so long, we're still hearing about Betty and

516
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,600
 Barney Hill and all this stuff for so long after the event, that those are the outliers.

517
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,760
 We're not thinking about Aunt June, who never told anyone that one night she was driving

518
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,080
 home, she saw a craft come over her vehicle, and the next thing she knows, she was two

519
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,240
 miles down the road and two hours had passed.

520
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,200
 And she never told anyone about that.

521
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,920
 And then 10 months later, she died suddenly.

522
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,120
 How many times is that happening?

523
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:48,360
 Again, I'm not saying every sudden death is accountable to UFOs or aliens, but does that

524
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,040
 happen more often than we think?

525
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,880
 Is there a correlation more often than we think?

526
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:02,000
 And if so, could this be the reason, conspiracy caps fully on, why aliens are not disclosed

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,240
 to citizens?

528
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,920
 People go, "Yeah, I believe in aliens.

529
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,160
 They're probably on other planets are so far away.

530
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,360
 It wouldn't bother me."

531
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,520
 If it turns out tomorrow that the government was detecting radio waves from other planets,

532
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,800
 people would be totally weirded out, but you'd get over it.

533
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,560
 If it turns out that for the past 50 years, the governments of the world had been talking

534
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,880
 to aliens and they'd been interfering with human affairs and they wanted us to clean

535
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,280
 up our environment and get rid of nuclear weapons, people would be more upset.

536
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,640
 They'd be upset that we weren't told the truth from the beginning.

537
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,760
 You'd have a whole group of people who would be like, "Not on my planet.

538
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,800
 I'd be one of those guys, honestly."

539
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,160
 And be setting UFOs on fire.

540
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,920
 You'd have a whole group of people who would hate that the aliens were there to interfere

541
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,160
 in human politics.

542
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,640
 Maybe we do want to pollute the planet.

543
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,400
 Maybe we do want our nuclear weapons.

544
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,680
 You'd have all that stuff, and people would be super weirded out, but you would understand

545
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
 it.

546
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,960
 It'd be like a new Cold War.

547
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,920
 You'd have alliances drawn up and you'd have all this stuff, but people would understand

548
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,600
 it because that mimics what we know on Earth.

549
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,960
 It would take longer because people would be upset again at the secrecy in that someone's

550
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,240
 trying to tell us what to do.

551
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,080
 But they could say, "In the future, you're going to be floating around on spaceships.

552
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,200
 You just have to do this stuff first."

553
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,360
 But if it turns out that aliens have been here for a long, long, long time, the governments

554
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
 have known about it.

555
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,480
 They haven't told us anything.

556
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,400
 There's 20 different alien races.

557
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,420
 They all have completely different agendas.

558
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,760
 There is no space brotherhood.

559
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,080
 They come here to look at us the same way we go to a zoo to examine animals.

560
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:46,040
 And not only that, but there is some bizarre mechanism that when you encounter these beings,

561
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,560
 you have, for lack of a better term, bad luck.

562
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,120
 Them being here interferes with our normal lifespan.

563
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,160
 When you encounter these guys randomly, your life will be shorter for the most part.

564
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,040
 Again, there's outliers.

565
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
 We can't negotiate with them.

566
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,000
 They all want different things.

567
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,480
 They view us as tiny.

568
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,440
 They don't really want us to evolve.

569
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,040
 They just like to come down and take our soil and every so often have a hybrid baby.

570
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,040
 And if you run into them, things aren't going to turn out well.

571
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:27,120
 There's no federation in the future.

572
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,560
 How do you think the world would respond to that?

573
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,280
 It would be seen less as an alien government and more of a natural disaster.

574
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,320
 You can't negotiate with an earthquake.

575
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,240
 You can't negotiate with cancer or COVID.

576
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,920
 Simply exists.

577
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,160
 And you hope that it doesn't come and interfere with your life, but when it does, you have

578
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,120
 to prepare yourself for it.

579
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,560
 To fight it or to accept it.

580
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,160
 I don't know what the mechanism is.

581
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,600
 I can't say it's the aliens come down and they cause some sort of radiation sickness.

582
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,920
 You could say the brain tumors for that and the two people who went insane for that.

583
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,280
 The people going missing, people dying in car accidents.

584
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:20,920
 What if the alien encounter is so alien to our reality, it actually throws off our fates,

585
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,320
 our timeline, where we were supposed to be.

586
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,360
 The triggers pulled a little earlier.

587
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,040
 And again, I'm not trying to, this is conspiracy cap fully on.

588
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,560
 I'm not trying to say that everyone who dies of a disease or everyone who has bad luck

589
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,800
 has encountered one of these aliens.

590
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 I'm not trying to minimize that at all.

591
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,560
 I'm just saying I find it very interesting that we have this one story and I'm extrapolating

592
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
 from that.

593
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,060
 We have this one story where we have 12 witnesses and all of them, 100% of them suffered ill

594
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,800
 effects and extrapolating that out.

595
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,880
 We know of all the times people have told us about UFO sightings and they tend to be

596
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,360
 okay except for the people being taken aboard ships and forced hybrids and things like that

597
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,760
 which is awful.

598
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,240
 The after effects.

599
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,600
 Sometimes they're a little not right in the head because of the experience.

600
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,120
 For the most part, the stories that we hear generally have happy endings.

601
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,920
 But those are the stories we hear.

602
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,120
 What about the tens of thousands of stories that people experience?

603
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,320
 Never tell anyone because they're ashamed to tell people and they meet a tragic or unlucky

604
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,200
 end.

605
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,640
 And they don't put two and two together.

606
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,320
 No one even thinks of a two and two together because they don't know about the story in

607
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,800
 the first place.

608
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,520
 And that's the real reason why we don't know that aliens exist.

609
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,000
 Because if we knew that aliens exist and we knew what they actually were, they're harbingers

610
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
 of chaos.

611
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,760
 They're not an enemy fleet that we can destroy with our weapons that we can combine together

612
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,880
 with one race and destroy these alien invaders.

613
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,320
 They're not space brothers to enlighten us so we can search the stars with them.

614
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,640
 They're not even, like I described, just the alien observers who sit up there quietly and

615
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,400
 watch mankind.

616
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,080
 Just by them coming into our environment, they throw things off.

617
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,760
 Just like even the most careful observer of the tigers of Africa is stepping on ant hills.

618
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,040
 Squish in bugs when he sits down to take notes.

619
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,280
 We may not be the future allies of the aliens.

620
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,620
 We may not be the future enemies of the aliens.

621
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,540
 We may not be the future conquerors of the aliens or the slaves of the aliens.

622
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,300
 We may simply be humans in a universe of aliens.

623
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,780
 And the universe belongs to the aliens.

624
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,720
 We are the outliers.

625
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,920
 We are the thing that is wrong in the system of time and space.

626
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,700
 We are like pond scum in a pool.

627
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,820
 And when they come here it's like dropping water into that pool.

628
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,860
 Not even just water, they're dropping in pool cleaner.

629
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,300
 They may not even be doing it intentionally.

630
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,020
 These dorks were just hanging out on a beach.

631
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,020
 And these 12 people suffered tragedy simply because they saw them.

632
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,460
 I can't define the mechanism.

633
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,080
 They may not be a mechanism.

634
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,100
 This is a conspiracy podcast and we're going with the story and taking it out.

635
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:24,780
 This may just be a one story thing that is fun to explore the further consequences of.

636
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:30,660
 But if this story is in the indication of humans' relationship with aliens, the governments

637
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,460
 of the world will never admit they exist.

638
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,580
 Because to admit they exist is to admit that humans are powerless.

639
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:45,060
 It's one thing to know there's a bear in the woods and if the village works together

640
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,020
 they can slay the bear.

641
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:53,860
 It's another thing to know that there is a volcano growing underneath the village that

642
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,860
 will not only wipe out that settlement but will take out the entire continent.

643
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:07,060
 If you knew there was no chance of survival, would you tell the people there was the problem?

644
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:32,780
 Or would you just deny it until the problem swallowed you all?

645
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:59,460
 I'm not sure.

646
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,040
 (upbeat music)
