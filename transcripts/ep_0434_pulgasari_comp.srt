1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 A true crime story reminds you why you are happy to be isolated from others.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,960
 A small town in Indonesia finds an interesting way to enforce their quarantine.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,180
 And then we kick off North Korea Week.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:25,220
 With the story of Kim Jong-il, in the 1970s he really wanted to make a Godzilla knockoff.

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,240
 How do you do that in Communist control in North Korea?

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,440
 And kidnap an entire film crew.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,960
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:42,400
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,040
 It's North Korea Week.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,200
 This really came from a suggestion I was talking to Stealthy Steve on Instagram.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
 Stealthy Steve 45.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,880
 He says "Oh you know about Kim Jong-un, he might be dead" and he goes "Want him to

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 be cool?"

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
 Not that he died.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,280
 I don't know his position on the life or death of Kim Jong-un.

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,000
 But he goes "If he died and then the country was opened up and we discovered all of these

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,720
 cryptids" and I go "That is kind of an interesting thing."

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,080
 I start looking into it.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,360
 There are a ton of cryptids and crazy stories from the Hermit Kingdom.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,680
 And we're going to look at those this week.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,320
 But I want to give a hat, a tip of the hat to Stealthy Steve for suggesting this.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,880
 Really really appreciate it.

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,520
 Then we have to say thank you to our legacy Patreon.

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,720
 Someone who supported the show for a long time.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
 William Bertels.

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,920
 William thank you so much for supporting the show.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
 Really really means a lot.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
 You are going to be our captain this episode.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,120
 You can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,800
 Just help get the word out about the show.

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,840
 That helps out a lot.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,560
 Our numbers are growing because of you guys.

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
 Really really appreciate it.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 William first off we are headed out to Iowa.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,520
 So let's hop in the Jason Jalopy.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,400
 Our broke down, beat up Beverly Hill Billy's car.

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,440
 I'm sitting in the rocking chair on top.

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 That's an old reference.

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,600
 It's a super old reference.

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,840
 Maybe you guys saw the movie in the 90s with Jim Varney.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,640
 But anyways, even that's an old reference.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,120
 I'm in the rocking chair.

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,840
 William Bertels is driving and you are seated somewhere in this rickety old car.

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,160
 We're leaving behind Oregon.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,720
 We're driving out to Iowa.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,280
 Sheldon, Iowa to be exact.

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,200
 Now this is the part of the episode where I say if you're eating anything, anything

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 at all.

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,640
 Just set it down, push it to the side.

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,320
 Now this story is not gory, but it's pretty disgusting.

54
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,080
 March 13th, 2020.

55
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,880
 So very very recent story.

56
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,120
 Right before the entire world went into lockdown.

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,000
 That's all the gates shutting.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
 The gate is slowly closing over the planet you're running.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
 Hurry up Sally, let's go.

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 You have to do a barrel roll.

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,360
 Everyone's in quarantine.

62
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,280
 So anyways, we're all hopefully very safe.

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
 All of our loved ones are doing well.

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 Hope that is the case for everybody.

65
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,960
 But it really depends on who you get quarantined with, right?

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,000
 You could have been quarantined with like, with a practitioner of the dark arts constantly

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
 trying to sacrifice you.

68
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 You're like coronavirus take me away.

69
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,880
 Some guys coming up behind you with one of those daggers that you buy at Hot Topic.

70
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,040
 That's all wavy.

71
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,120
 I don't even know what those would be good for.

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,360
 Other than dark art ceremonies, can you really like cut cheese with them?

73
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 Actually it's a good segue.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,760
 It's a good segue for this story I shouldn't be talking about.

75
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,880
 March 13th, 2020.

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
 So very recent.

77
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,920
 We're going to the Northwest Iowa Community College.

78
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,880
 Tell me that doesn't sound super innocent, right?

79
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,160
 Has the words Iowa in it?

80
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
 North?

81
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,160
 Good things always come out of the North like the Union Army and Santa Claus.

82
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,800
 And then community college.

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,080
 Community, you know a bunch of people together and college is where you learn.

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,120
 So a little etymology lesson from Jason Carver today.

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,080
 Northwest, oh and west is the best.

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 West Coast, West Side.

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
 So it's all perfect.

88
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,040
 Northwest Iowa Community College.

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,400
 There's four young women sharing a dorm.

90
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,680
 I didn't even know community colleges had dorms, but maybe in Iowa, maybe it's so quaint

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
 down there.

92
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
 They allow it.

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 Community college dorm.

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,280
 We have Lindsay Ann Cundiff.

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
 She's 20.

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,680
 We have Kyla Elaine Castner.

97
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
 She's 19.

98
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,520
 We have Ellie Thompson.

99
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,080
 She's 20 I believe.

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
 And then the victim.

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,840
 The unnamed victim.

102
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,280
 Now this is definitely a story where if you were the victim of this, you wouldn't want

103
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,000
 it to get out.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
 You wouldn't want this to get out.

105
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,200
 So this unnamed victim, they're all living together.

106
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,080
 Now there must have been, this again was pre-quarantine.

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,520
 So luckily this is gross that it happened, but it's better that it happened when you

108
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
 could do something about it.

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,320
 Because if this had happened March 18th, March 20th, you're kind of stuck.

110
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,900
 Those three girls, Lindsay, Kyla and Ellie, have a problem with our unnamed protagonist.

111
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,280
 We will call her Samantha.

112
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,480
 We'll call her Samantha.

113
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,920
 So Samantha is sitting there and there must be some bad blood between Samantha and the

114
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,760
 other three roommates, right?

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,560
 Because this type of thing doesn't come out of nowhere.

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,000
 I used to live with this girl back in Davis.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,160
 There's a long story of how I ended up there, but I ended up living with this girl.

118
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,160
 And when I moved in, there was a bag of rotten potatoes just sitting in the kitchen.

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,760
 Now this is like my first day here and I'm like, what's this?

120
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,920
 She's like, don't touch the bag, don't touch the bag, don't touch the bag.

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
 Go why not?

122
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,080
 And she goes, because.

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,520
 So she had previously lived in this apartment.

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
 It actually was a dorm.

125
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
 I wasn't a student.

126
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
 I was breaking.

127
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,040
 Anyways, long story short, I was living in a dorm with this girl and she previously had

128
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,360
 two female roommates and she said, don't touch the bag, don't touch the bag.

129
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
 And I go, why not?

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,720
 And she goes, because that bag, the first day, I guess they all moved in together, that

131
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,520
 bag of potatoes appeared in there.

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,640
 It was a full grocery bag full of nothing but potatoes and it appeared in the kitchen.

133
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,600
 And it's just sat there unattended for like a day or two, but then one of the girls goes,

134
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,640
 hey, who bought all these potatoes?

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,720
 And none of the three girls admitted to buying the potatoes or carrying them in, but they

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
 all blamed each other for the potatoes.

137
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
 They all were like, you need to move the potatoes.

138
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
 I didn't buy the potatoes.

139
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,200
 This went on for so long that the potatoes began to rot.

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,160
 So the bottom, I mean, we're talking months.

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,720
 How long does it take for a potato to rot?

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,960
 Like first they dry out and then like you turn them into a little potato clock and then

143
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,360
 you put them in water and little eyeballs pop out like their science fair experiment,

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,760
 just waiting to happen.

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,720
 But after long enough, they begin to liquefy.

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,640
 So by the time I get there, the other two girls have moved away.

147
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,200
 Stephanie still won't move.

148
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,760
 I wasn't going to say her name, but Stephanie still won't move the bag of potatoes because

149
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,240
 the friends are coming, quote unquote friends.

150
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,280
 The roommates are coming back at the end of summer.

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
 I was there for the summer.

152
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,400
 So I moved the potato.

153
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
 I go, what?

154
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,040
 She tells me this long story and I'm just kind of looking at her and I go, I'll move

155
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
 the potatoes.

156
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,000
 But when I picked the bag up, it was like starting like all soaky at the bottom.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
 Like it was starting to melt.

158
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,640
 Like it didn't, if I remember correctly, I had to get another bag because I kind of

159
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
 picked it up and it was starting to.

160
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,040
 But yeah, and like the floor was kind of messed up for a while with potato mold.

161
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,080
 Anyways, anyways, I learned a very important lesson.

162
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,800
 I was in my twenties.

163
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 Women are filthy.

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,520
 I always had an idea that women were as filthy as men because I had been a janitor and I'd

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,760
 gone into women's restrooms and I'm like, what Cthulhu level horror was defeated by Constantine

166
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
 in this restroom?

167
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,680
 This is disgusting, but maybe it's just an off day.

168
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,440
 I've learned over the years women are just as disgusting as men.

169
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Anyways, so sorry I revealed your secret identity, Stephanie.

170
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,920
 But she's a great roommate and a great friend.

171
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,720
 That potato story, as an aside as it was, is nothing compared to what Samantha deals

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 with.

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 Let's get back to this true crime story.

174
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
 She's having bad blood with her roommates.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,920
 Her roommates decide we got to get back at her.

176
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,560
 Now none of them want to go to the store to buy a bag of potatoes, right?

177
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,920
 You got easier things to do.

178
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,400
 You're going to use the tools that are available for you.

179
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,920
 And what happened was there was some grated cheese that Samantha would use on her food.

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,280
 Maybe she ate a bunch of pasta.

181
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,960
 I think that's the only time you eat grated cheese.

182
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,040
 But these girls thought it would be hilarious if they took the dried skin, okay this is

183
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,200
 where you can start fast forwarding if that's too much of a trigger for you.

184
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,960
 They took the dried skin off of their feet.

185
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,400
 You know how your heels get all dried and cracked?

186
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,080
 Mine do it all the time.

187
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,040
 And they peeled off pieces of their dried feet and put it in the shredded cheese.

188
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,600
 And then sat there and waited.

189
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,520
 And they're buying her extra pasta.

190
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,360
 They're like, "Hey look, we bought you all of this noodles and here's this designer sauce

191
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
 from Whole Foods."

192
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,000
 They're like making it, they're cooking it.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
 Have a fan blowing the smell.

194
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,880
 She's like floating on the smell waves like a cartoon towards the spaghetti.

195
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,080
 Oh, but you need this Parmesan.

196
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,880
 So anyway, she did end up devouring human foot flesh, dried human foot flesh.

197
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,760
 Now this is one of those crimes that nobody should have ever known about, right?

198
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,520
 You do it and then 10 years later when you're drinking wine with your buddies during your

199
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,880
 book club slash reason to drink wine with your buddies, you go, "Oh my God, there was

200
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,360
 this girl in college who was insanely lame."

201
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,160
 And then we decided to peel the flesh off of our feet and we put it in her Parmesan

202
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
 cheese.

203
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,840
 Oh my God, Kaya, you're so awful.

204
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,080
 I know, I know, I know.

205
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,800
 That's when you tell that story.

206
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
 But yeah, so she found out these three girls are being charged with assault and I can almost

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,560
 guarantee whether or not they'll probably face like 30 days probation or something like

208
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,000
 that community service.

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,360
 They are going to be sued into oblivion.

210
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,760
 The lawsuits that they would face from Samantha, this unnamed woman, psychological impact,

211
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,280
 maybe you've now developed a taste for human flesh and you're having to spend every night

212
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,840
 in the sewers with your chud allies looking for new dried feet to eat.

213
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,360
 And then every day you go to the law office and you say, "I need to be reimbursed for

214
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:15,080
 the time that I spent in the sewers plus these clothes I've ruined on human feces and blood."

215
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,600
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

216
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 William, fire up the carbon helicopter.

217
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,760
 We're headed out to Indonesia.

218
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,120
 Now we talked about Indonesia last week.

219
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,040
 They're actually having some pretty interesting ideas on how to deal with this whole quarantine

220
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,760
 because people don't want to be quarantined, right?

221
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,840
 It's against human nature.

222
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,680
 So in Indonesia, last week I told you that they were having people dress up as ghosts

223
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,400
 and walk around.

224
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,760
 Now there's a little town in Indonesia called Serajan.

225
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,260
 Serajan Indonesia.

226
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,200
 That's a pretty dope name if that's how you pronounce it.

227
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 Probably not.

228
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 Sragan.

229
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
 That's kind of cool too.

230
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,280
 Anyway, Sragan, Indonesia is this little town and what happens is a bunch of people are

231
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,720
 leaving the capital, Jakarta.

232
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,040
 A bunch of people are leaving major cities to come to Serajan to hang out.

233
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,960
 Now they don't like that because they're trying to keep a clamp down on this whole COVID-19

234
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 thing.

235
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,760
 So you have to be quarantined.

236
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,640
 Well people are coming to town and just kind of goofing off, messing around.

237
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,160
 They're playing, they're wrestling.

238
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,520
 They're like, "Hey, let's wrestle in this infected water."

239
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
 Splash, splash, splash.

240
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,320
 "Let's wrestle in the sweat of people who previously had this disease."

241
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,600
 The city, this is their title, the Serajan Regency Head.

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
 And then I think this is the name.

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,040
 I don't know if this is still the title, but Kustanar Untung Yuni Sakawati.

244
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 Sakawati.

245
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,240
 Mrs. Sakawati, she said, "This is ridiculous.

246
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,480
 We have all these out-of-towners coming over here wrestling around in the tears of coronavirus

247
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 victims."

248
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
 It's disgusting.

249
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 It's gross.

250
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,880
 I think some of them brought in some quote-unquote "Parmaison cheese" and they're trying to

251
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 get us to eat it.

252
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
 "Hey, come here.

253
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
 Come here."

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,880
 So, what they did was they invented a new way to quarantine people.

255
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,040
 There's some abandoned houses in the area that local legend says is haunted.

256
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
 This is 100% true.

257
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,640
 She said, "I want you to find the scariest, hauntedest house that no one's currently living

258
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,920
 in and prepare it for a short-term jail."

259
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,680
 People are like, "That's an awesome assignment.

260
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,640
 Who would say, 'Nah, I'm busy this week.'"

261
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 I'd be like, "Yes, ma'am.

262
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
 I'll totally do that.

263
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,440
 Get all my ghost hunting equipment."

264
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
 They did.

265
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,840
 They found the spookiest house in the area that locals have--it's been abandoned for

266
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,040
 a long time and people said it was haunted.

267
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,480
 They started arresting people who were breaking quarantine, putting them in the house for

268
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,040
 14 days.

269
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,040
 There's been five people who've been trapped in that house now.

270
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,200
 And in the house, they have it so you have your area and then there's like a six-foot

271
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
 on each side barrier and then there's someone else.

272
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,000
 So it's not like they're just like, "Go in there and die of the disease."

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,240
 They have it set out so you won't be contagious to others.

274
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,800
 But still, you're trapped in a haunted house for 14 days.

275
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,560
 But anyway, so yeah, there are currently five people who've been locked up in this house.

276
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,480
 Then after the 14 days, they're free to go.

277
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
 They're like, "Oh, yes."

278
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,200
 They put on their little wrestling units hard.

279
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,680
 They see the shimmering pool out there of the coronavirus sweat.

280
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
 They're like, "Ugh."

281
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,520
 Been waiting for this.

282
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,440
 And then runs and jumps and it's like freeze frame, credits roll.

283
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
 You know what's funny about this story?

284
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,440
 And I have this, I've always thought about this.

285
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
 I'm surprised no one's ever done it.

286
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,600
 I'm sure some B-movie company's done it, but...

287
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,760
 Zombie movie.

288
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,000
 Zombies are chasing the humans.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,680
 The humans go in a house, houses haunted.

290
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,480
 And it's funny, I have that thought so much and I watch a ton of zombie movies.

291
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
 Just watched a movie last night called Primal.

292
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,200
 It's not necessarily a, it's a zombie movie, I think.

293
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,720
 Really really good.

294
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,880
 Really really good zombie monster movie.

295
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 It's called Primal.

296
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
 I watched it on Hulu.

297
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 Check it out.

298
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
 Stylized.

299
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,920
 The first 15, 20 minutes it's like cabin fever.

300
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,760
 And then once it starts, it doesn't stop.

301
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
 It's super stylized.

302
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
 It's very very well done.

303
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,520
 Like there are certain scenes where you're like, "Whoa, that was a really cool camera

304
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
 trick."

305
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,840
 Like what they're doing.

306
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,400
 Very very inventive monster movie.

307
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
 Dead Rabbit Reckremens, Primal.

308
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,600
 But speaking of, like when I'm watching a zombie movie, a lot of times like they're in the

309
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,400
 house and they're like nailing boards up on the walls and I'm like, "Dude, what if a

310
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,840
 ghost popped out right now?"

311
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,640
 Like I'm always thinking that.

312
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,480
 A zombie movie, they go in the house and then like there's a little poltergeist activity.

313
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,640
 First they think like the other survivors are taking the food or moving something.

314
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
 "Hey, where'd you put my machete?"

315
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,320
 I knew not to trust that guy.

316
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,360
 "No, no, it's okay Barry, it's okay.

317
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,000
 Keep an eye on him."

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,960
 Because paranoia is already high because a bunch of strangers are in a house together.

319
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,800
 But then little things are, "Wouldn't that be an awesome movie?"

320
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
 That would be an awesome movie.

321
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,520
 But anyways, James Wan, I know you listened to this podcast, one of my longest listeners.

322
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,960
 Make that movie.

323
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
 What could we call it?

324
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,760
 I literally spent five minutes trying to figure out a name for the title of the movie, but

325
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
 I did come up with a tagline.

326
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,720
 "First they were hunted.

327
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,200
 Now they are haunted."

328
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 What?

329
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 Uh, uh.

330
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,400
 And then I just came up with titles like Death House or Abandon All Hope or Dead Residents.

331
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,760
 I don't know.

332
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,320
 You come up with a movie title, James.

333
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,000
 Jimi is what I call him when during our Hollywood meetings.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,480
 Let's go ahead and move on to our, now that I've pitched my movie of the episode, which

335
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,080
 is becoming quite a segment on this show.

336
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 Quite common.

337
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
 "William, let's hop in the Dead Rabbit Robo.

338
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
 We are leaving behind Indonesia.

339
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,040
 We are headed to North Korea."

340
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,440
 Now we're going to have to go under the cover of night.

341
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,480
 It's not the easiest country to get into, but we do get in.

342
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,600
 We're all wearing all black ninja clothes and we're sneaking through the jungle and/or

343
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
 forest.

344
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
 I don't know what the ecology is over there, but we are there.

345
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,600
 And we're also headed back in time.

346
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,200
 Now again, hats off to Stealthy Steve for giving me the idea for this and many more

347
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,520
 episodes this week.

348
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,800
 In Korean mythology, and the thing is we have a lot of blends between Korea and China mythology

349
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,880
 because you have the Three Kingdoms era where you had these Korean kings taking over large

350
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,600
 swaths of China and then cultural mixing and everything like that.

351
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,720
 So Korean Peninsula and China are very, very closely related.

352
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,220
 So we have myths and legends that cross the border.

353
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,960
 So that's nothing abnormal.

354
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,920
 And one of those legends is the story of the Bulgasaari.

355
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
 The Bulgasaari.

356
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,980
 It's basically, imagine a dragon that didn't breathe fire and wasn't a huge fan of gold.

357
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,200
 So not necessarily a dragon, but it was a monster and it didn't love the Horde gold.

358
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
 That wasn't what it looked for.

359
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,640
 It loved to devour iron.

360
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,080
 Which is funny because let's say you're a dragon.

361
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,800
 If you are a king or a wealthy man in Europe, a dragon is very fearsome for you.

362
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,280
 It's there to destroy your means of wealth.

363
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,560
 Without the gold, you're a peasant.

364
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:57,040
 Bulgasaari is the same thing in Korea and China because you needed the iron to work.

365
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,160
 So this was a creature that was a direct threat to everyone.

366
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,000
 But especially peasants because they were using farm implements made of iron.

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
 Something goes missing, the Bulgasaari ate it.

368
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,040
 Says the man who has a bunch of iron like underneath his bed.

369
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,400
 Sure, it's not comfortable to sleep in, but he has all the hose that he needs.

370
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,800
 So this creature would walk around and eat iron and iron was a mainstay of the agricultural

371
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 industry.

372
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 You needed it.

373
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,200
 But it wasn't always considered a bad creature.

374
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 Even though it would do that, it would do some good.

375
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,240
 This is interesting because this creature that is actively destroying their means of

376
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,640
 life was also considered a protector against nightmares.

377
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,120
 Which to be fair, having all my farming implements destroyed is a living nightmare.

378
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,800
 Like he eats all that stuff and you're just like looking at your farm, all your crops

379
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,480
 are dying and you're like, "At least they sleep well at night."

380
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,540
 As long as I don't think about my starving children and my own starving self.

381
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,520
 But it also is known to cure smallpox somehow.

382
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,120
 Maybe simply being in its presence, the smallpox would disappear.

383
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,720
 In China, Bulgasaari is the Korean name for it.

384
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,760
 In China it goes by another name, Bu-Ki-Sa.

385
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,760
 Which literally means, "Can't be killed."

386
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,840
 So this isn't one of those cryptids that has a weakness.

387
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,360
 Like throw a shoe at it at high noon and it's like, "No, this thing, when it's coming into

388
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,740
 your town, it's eating all your iron.

389
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,160
 You won't get smallpox and you'll have a good night's sleep.

390
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,120
 It will eat all your iron and there's nothing you can do to stop it."

391
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,320
 Completely impervious to damage.

392
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,400
 Now there is a legend that these things can be stopped if you find a magic amulet.

393
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,760
 Which is not doing anyone any good when it's headed towards your town, right?

394
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,400
 But now we're gonna flash forward to the 1960s.

395
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,320
 I actually thought this story was far more well known.

396
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,240
 I've been talking to a lot of people about this because I've been really excited to

397
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,380
 tell this story and I've been telling it.

398
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,700
 I was talking to Sabine, I was talking to my little brother.

399
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,460
 I go, "Have you guys ever heard this story before?"

400
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,060
 And they're like, "No, I never heard of it."

401
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,300
 I actually am shocked.

402
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,260
 I thought this was way more popular.

403
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,540
 So this is 100% true.

404
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,740
 In the 1960s there was a South Korean director named Shin Sang Ok.

405
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,140
 I don't think it's pronounced "Ok."

406
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,020
 I don't think anyone actually has their last name Ok.

407
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,980
 But director Shin Sang Ok, he was a prolific film director for South Korea.

408
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,440
 He made over a hundred movies.

409
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
 Made some dramas.

410
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
 Made some fantasy horror films.

411
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,840
 He's an award-winning director.

412
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,680
 But as time goes on, his career started to go down.

413
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,720
 And that's just a normal thing.

414
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,320
 He had a wife named Choi Un-hee.

415
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,280
 And she was one of the most popular actresses of the 60s and 70s.

416
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,880
 It'd be like if Steven Spielberg was dating Meryl Streep, right?

417
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,840
 But you know, 20 years ago.

418
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,840
 It'd be that same thing when they were both at the top of their game.

419
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,260
 So you have this award-winning famous director.

420
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,540
 You have his wife, who's an award-winning actress.

421
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,780
 One of the top actresses in South Korea.

422
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,700
 But his career starts to crumble a bit.

423
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,260
 Her career kind of stalls out.

424
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,900
 They are going to get a divorce.

425
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,560
 They're separated.

426
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,820
 Things just aren't working out for either of them.

427
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,300
 Again, such is the way of the entertainment business.

428
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,980
 Kim Jong-il.

429
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,680
 The father of Kim Jong-un, the current leader of North Korea.

430
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,880
 The guy that I grew up with.

431
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
 Not literally.

432
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
 I wasn't like, "Hey, Kim!"

433
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 I wasn't like his neighbor.

434
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,440
 But when I was younger, that was the...

435
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,440
 And Kim Jong-il is the one in South Park.

436
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
 Not South Park.

437
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,520
 Kim Jong-il is the one in World American Team Police or whatever.

438
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,280
 Team America, World Police, whatever.

439
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
 He's in that.

440
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,000
 So he was the original boogeyman along with Saddam Hussein.

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 You had Moe Mardoffi and all those.

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,140
 Those are the ones that I grew up with.

443
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,120
 It's funny because they're all dead now.

444
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,880
 But when I was growing up, those are the faces you saw in the news.

445
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,060
 And Ferdinand Marcos was up there.

446
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,460
 There was a bunch of like boomer super villains that...

447
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,980
 And we really don't have those anymore.

448
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,300
 We had Osama bin Laden, but that guy that Trump nuked, that ISIS head, I didn't even

449
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,820
 know that dude's name.

450
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,140
 It used to be in the 80s, like 60s, 70s, 80s, we had all of these Legion of Doom dudes,

451
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
 right?

452
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
 And you had...

453
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
 It's weird.

454
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,240
 Yeah, Moe Mardoffi, all this stuff.

455
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,420
 But Kim Jong-il was one of those.

456
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,460
 But before he was president, he was being groomed to become president of North Korea.

457
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,240
 He was the head of North Korea's movie industry.

458
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,400
 It was government run, obviously.

459
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,160
 Huge movie buff.

460
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,720
 He had a collection of 15,000 movies.

461
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,020
 Now you go, that's nothing.

462
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,840
 I have that on my hard drive.

463
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,600
 In 1970, physical copies of 15,000 movies.

464
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
 That isn't an achievement.

465
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,180
 I would say most libraries didn't have that many movies.

466
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,860
 Really, if they collected them all back then, they weren't considered the treasures they

467
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,860
 are today.

468
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,540
 But he's watching North Korea's making these movies.

469
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,100
 He's making these movies in North Korea and they suck.

470
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,340
 And it's interesting because he comes to this conclusion.

471
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,740
 North Korea at this point was basically found that in 1945, after the Japanese were pushed

472
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,580
 out of the country, Soviet Union took over the North half, America took over the bottom

473
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,920
 half, took over, allied themselves to probably be a better term for it.

474
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,560
 So since 1945, it had been communist North Korea.

475
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,320
 Now we're in the 70s and Kim Jong-il is going, "Dude, our movies suck."

476
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,400
 And what's interesting is he comes to the conclusion the reason why movies in other

477
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,960
 countries are better, because, quote, "They have to earn money."

478
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,920
 He realized that the capitalist system of making movies, you had to make a good movie

479
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,520
 to get people to come to the theater to pay for the movie.

480
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,940
 And if the movie sucked, they wouldn't pay.

481
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,980
 You wouldn't get the word of mouth.

482
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
 They had to pay.

483
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,260
 Now, they were watching movies from other countries, but obviously the big thing, France

484
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,020
 had an issue with this too back in the early 2000s.

485
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,860
 I don't know if this is still the issue, but they're like, "We're getting all this Hollywood

486
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,140
 garbage over here and it's changing our country.

487
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,260
 We don't want to be America.

488
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,380
 We want to have French cinema."

489
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,620
 So they put a cap on it.

490
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,780
 Again, I don't know if it still exists, but for a while France had a cap on it.

491
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:12,120
 Only 10% or 20% or whatever an percent of movies showing could be from America.

492
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,480
 The rest of them have to be from France.

493
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,680
 So North Korea was like, "Yeah, you know, we can keep showing these American films,

494
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,000
 these movies from other countries, but it's changing our way of life."

495
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,640
 So how do you fix it?

496
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,320
 Kim Jong-il, a huge movie fan, really, really wants to make really good North Korean movies.

497
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,280
 Specifically he wanted to make award-winning films.

498
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,240
 He wanted his movies to win international awards, but he realizes that all of his people

499
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
 suck.

500
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
 They don't know how to do it.

501
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,660
 They don't love cinema as much as he.

502
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,180
 And they are not in it for the money, which drives competition.

503
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:50,140
 Choi Un-hee gets a call one day from a businessman asking if she wanted to help set up a studio.

504
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,780
 She had actually helped set up Shin Studio.

505
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,260
 And it was actually called Shin Studio.

506
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,860
 So she had actually helped set that up.

507
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,380
 So she wasn't just a pretty woman.

508
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,180
 He was married to a business partner.

509
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,820
 But anyways, they'd been separated for a while now.

510
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,100
 A businessman says, "Would you like to help us set up a studio?"

511
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,880
 She says, "Yeah, sure."

512
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,680
 Goes to meet with him, gets kidnapped.

513
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,280
 She's taken to North Korea.

514
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
 She meets Kim Jong-il.

515
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,520
 And he's like, "I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

516
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
 I love your movies.

517
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,400
 So nice to meet you."

518
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,720
 Again, she just assumed this was a business meeting.

519
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,080
 Now she's in another country and it is very, very clear to her she's not a guest.

520
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
 She's a prisoner.

521
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,880
 But he takes her around to all of these like fancy dinner parties, the opera and all these

522
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
 things.

523
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,940
 And whining and dining her in North Korea, showing her a good time.

524
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,420
 Back in South Korea, Shin is sitting there.

525
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,500
 He's trying to raise funds for a new movie.

526
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,140
 Because he still wants to make movies.

527
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,500
 He's just having a hard time getting investors.

528
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,180
 And he hears something through the grapevine.

529
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,860
 Choi, his wife that he separated from, no one can get ahold of her.

530
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,580
 She's gone missing.

531
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,740
 So he starts to look for her.

532
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,640
 Taking some calls, figuring out what the police know.

533
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,520
 Trying to figure out who this business man could have been that she had this meeting

534
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 with.

535
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,080
 And through the course of his investigation, he gets kidnapped.

536
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,240
 Taken to North Korea.

537
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
 At that point, Kim Jong-il, "Hey dude, huge fan.

538
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,680
 I love your movies so much."

539
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,000
 And Kim Jong-il was very passionate about film.

540
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,080
 Like he knew what he was talking about.

541
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,360
 And Shin's like, "That's great and all that you're a huge fan of movies and my movies

542
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
 specifically.

543
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,940
 At one, where is Choi?

544
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,780
 And two, I get to go home, right?"

545
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:38,100
 Well, his attitude wasn't, Choi was just kind of like, "I'm going to make the best of this.

546
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,940
 Like obviously I'm trapped in North Korea.

547
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,580
 What am I going to do?"

548
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,420
 Shin isn't having any of that.

549
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,860
 He tries to walk away.

550
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,060
 They throw him in prison for three years.

551
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,380
 And then finally, Kim Jong-il lets him out.

552
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,740
 Introduces him to Choi.

553
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,580
 Says, "Here's your wife."

554
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,980
 She was here all along.

555
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,360
 Choi finds out that she was bait.

556
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,000
 She wasn't even the main target.

557
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,520
 Kim Jong-il wanted Shin.

558
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,320
 And at this point, Kim Jong-il says, "Okay, here's the deal.

559
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,720
 You guys are going to be our movie industry.

560
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
 You're going to make the movies.

561
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,640
 You're going to star in them.

562
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,520
 And we're going to win us a whole lot of awards."

563
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,520
 Now what do you do in that situation?

564
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,160
 This isn't like, one, you can't say no.

565
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,520
 Two, the dude's been in prison for three years, right?

566
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,820
 But what's interesting is Shin and Choi realize--

567
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,420
 and I know I'm using their last-- their surnames as their first names.

568
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,500
 I apologize for that, but Shin and Choi both come to the conclusion they're like,

569
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,460
 "First off, we got to figure out a way out of this situation.

570
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,820
 Secondly, we got to make movies until then.

571
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,860
 And thirdly, and this was interesting because I hadn't thought about this,

572
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,740
 but this would have been the political ramifications.

573
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,660
 And this is them both thinking ahead.

574
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,180
 When we do escape, no one's going to believe that we got kidnapped.

575
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,920
 Because both of their careers were not doing so good.

576
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,160
 And then all of a sudden they appear in North Korea

577
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,240
 and they're making movies for the government of North Korea.

578
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,880
 If we escape, and we will, no one's going to believe that we were kidnapped.

579
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,400
 People are going to think that we actually came over here to make money and stuff,

580
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,960
 or whatever they get paid in.

581
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,760
 People thought we were going to get paid in Parmesan cheese

582
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,000
 and we were going to bring it back.

583
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,280
 So they begin secretly recording conversations with Kim Jong-il,

584
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,600
 where he admitted, "Oh yeah, guys, we're such good friends now.

585
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,220
 Remember that embarrassing thing where I had to kidnap both of you,

586
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,740
 but look at us now?"

587
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,060
 They recorded that and kept that.

588
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,500
 And that's very, very important.

589
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,020
 I wouldn't have thought about that, but they were thinking ahead.

590
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,860
 They started making movies for Kim Jong-il.

591
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,500
 They made seven in total in North Korea.

592
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,340
 And the last one is the most important one as far as this topic goes.

593
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,700
 And we'll get to that one in a second.

594
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,020
 But after the seventh movie was made, and their movies were revolutionary,

595
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,340
 one of their movies was called "Salt," and it started off with a Bible quote.

596
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:57,000
 And that was the first time in North Korean cinema you ever had a Bible quote.

597
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 But usually there were quotes from the founder of the country back in 1945.

598
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,360
 The country, I mean, it's funny to think that country has such a heavy presence

599
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,800
 in world politics.

600
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,000
 North Korea has been around for like 70 years.

601
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,640
 But the founder of the country, Kim Jong-il's dad,

602
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,600
 they'd have quotes starting with him.

603
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,680
 The first kiss in North Korean cinema was in one of Shin's movies.

604
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,180
 But anyway, so they make the seventh movie, and they are winning awards.

605
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,380
 The movie "Salt" that starts off with a Bible verse.

606
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,900
 That is a vicious movie about a mother.

607
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,940
 It's so bizarre.

608
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,700
 The movies seem to really, really go after the North Korean government.

609
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,220
 And it could be subversive.

610
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,300
 But the North Koreans see it as going after the Japanese or the old way of life.

611
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,220
 "Salt" is about this-- first off, this Bible quote's hilarious.

612
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,580
 I've never heard this quote before.

613
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,800
 Quote, "You are the salt of the earth.

614
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,760
 But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salt again?"

615
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,320
 It's an interesting quote.

616
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,280
 It's funny, I've always heard "salt of the earth."

617
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,360
 But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?

618
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
 Interesting quote.

619
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 Philosophical.

620
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,480
 But anyway, it's a movie "Salt," and this isn't the Angelina Jolie movie.

621
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,620
 Movie "Salt," starring Choi.

622
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,560
 This woman has like eight kids, and she gets pregnant, and she can't feed them,

623
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,460
 so she goes to hang herself.

624
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,820
 Like that's the climax of the movie.

625
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,980
 She tries to hang herself while she's pregnant.

626
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,060
 And then the rope breaks, and then she realizes one of her kids is killing Japanese soldiers

627
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,740
 and stealing their money, so at the end she joins the pirates.

628
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
 Or, "Super bizarre!"

629
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,100
 And you're like, "That sounds awesome, maybe!"

630
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,300
 Except for the whole pregnant woman hanging scene.

631
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,780
 I can do without that.

632
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,180
 Movies are very dark.

633
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,420
 And it was made to be like, "Look how horrible life was before we took charge."

634
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,260
 But anyways, they make their seventh movie.

635
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,240
 We'll talk about that in more detail, because it's hilarious, and I watched it.

636
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,480
 They make the seventh movie.

637
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,000
 They're on tour in Austria.

638
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
 There's like a film festival.

639
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
 They're on tour.

640
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,800
 Imagine being this journalist.

641
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 This Japanese journalist has just gotten an assignment to interview the director Shin

642
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,200
 and his wife Choi, because Kim Jong-il made them get remarried.

643
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,640
 He thought it looked better.

644
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,160
 Now before they go into the-- this is luck.

645
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,920
 Before they go into the hotel, they had quote unquote "body guards" with them.

646
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,880
 They're actually prison guards.

647
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,900
 They formed North Koreans to make sure that nothing happens to this couple, but really

648
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,180
 it was to keep them prisoner.

649
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,740
 They're able to convince the guards to let them go to the interview on their own.

650
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,580
 They've been prisoners at this point for years and years.

651
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,620
 I think it was a-- they made seven movies, so I think it was a total of about ten years

652
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,420
 they were in captivity.

653
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,540
 They are able to talk their way of the guards or standing outside the hotel.

654
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,540
 They go to the interview.

655
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,460
 They sit down, the journalist, he's probably gonna ask questions.

656
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,020
 What was the best scene in that movie?

657
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,780
 Did you guys ever have a hard time working it?

658
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,120
 You know, just pop culture questions.

659
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,440
 Is there ever gonna be a Funko Pop of any of your characters, a hanging salt bubblehead?

660
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,520
 Probably thinking he's gonna ask some ridiculous questions.

661
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,960
 They walk into the interview and they go, "Do you have a car?"

662
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,200
 "Yeah, we need to go to the US Embassy now.

663
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,560
 We've been kidnapped by North Korea.

664
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
 You need help.

665
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,960
 Escape."

666
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,160
 And at that point, the Japanese reporter licks at them and goes, "Let's go."

667
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,940
 They just all get up and they sneak out the hotel and they get in a car.

668
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,500
 Now at this point, the North Korean guards realize, wait a second, the car's like driving

669
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,700
 by, they're like giving them the finger, the guard's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, why'd you

670
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
 do that shit?

671
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
 That wasn't subtle at all.

672
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
 You're supposed to wear a disguise.

673
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,100
 I wanted to do it."

674
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:36,740
 The guards get in a car and there is then a daytime high-speed chase through the city

675
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,680
 of Austria, ending at the US Embassy.

676
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:48,000
 Shin and Choi hop out of the car, run into the embassy, which is now US territory.

677
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,080
 Assuming that the Japanese journalists did as well, North Koreans are like, "This is

678
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
 Austria, baby.

679
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,600
 They're just beating up the journalists.

680
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,760
 What are you gonna do, America?"

681
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,480
 I would have went and hung out there for at least a while, right?

682
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,120
 North Koreans pull up.

683
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
 There's nothing they can do.

684
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,940
 At this point, they step onto embassy soil.

685
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,540
 It's an international incident and all that stuff.

686
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,580
 Now Shin and Choi, South Korea was like, "We don't believe you.

687
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,580
 We think your career was falling apart.

688
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,260
 You went over there to make some money.

689
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
 You defected."

690
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,900
 And Shin was like, "I don't want to go back to South Korea for two reasons.

691
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
 One, people don't believe me."

692
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,820
 He did have the recording, so people were starting to believe him.

693
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,020
 Two, he was afraid it was just gonna happen again.

694
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,140
 He was afraid that he was gonna go back there and then somehow they're gonna kidnap him

695
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,060
 again.

696
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:39,040
 He goes to America and he's a filmmaker by heart.

697
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,280
 He ends up, his next movie, he directs.

698
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,280
 This award-winning South Korean director who's made all these acclaimed dramas, he directs

699
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:53,960
 three ninjas, knuckle up, the story of three ninjas punching people in the face.

700
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:02,040
 And he ended up being the executive producer for three ninjas, kick back, and the ultimate

701
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,260
 blockbuster movie.

702
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,500
 And I'm not saying blockbuster hasn't a big hit, but remember when you used to go to

703
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,780
 blockbuster or hollywood video, you would always see this movie and I can almost guarantee

704
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,580
 you if you went to video stores, you rented this movie at some point.

705
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,180
 It had the best title, it had the best cover.

706
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,820
 It's iconic.

707
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,620
 Three ninjas, high noon at mega mountain.

708
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,740
 Ended up passing away back in 2006.

709
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,300
 He was working on a film that sounds amazing.

710
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,800
 It was a musical based on the life of Genghis Khan.

711
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,720
 So I mean dude, if you're gonna go out, go out big, right?

712
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,560
 Even working, he ended up going back to South Korea.

713
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,280
 Kim Jong-il had his name removed from all the movies.

714
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,520
 He felt absolutely betrayed that this person he kidnapped and forced to work for him would

715
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
 escape.

716
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,800
 But anyways, he ended up passing away before he could finish his musical.

717
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,520
 And then Choi, she passed away in 2018.

718
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,500
 And that was almost a national day of mourning in South Korea.

719
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 She was such a hero.

720
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,700
 Such a beloved figure.

721
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,700
 So I know this episode's running long, but I wanna talk about the last movie he made

722
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
 to wrap this all up.

723
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,380
 It was a movie called Pol-Gasari.

724
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
 Pol-Gasari.

725
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:23,900
 See, not only did Kim Jong-il love movies, he loved Godzilla movies.

726
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,980
 More than anything.

727
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,380
 Loved monster movies.

728
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,240
 So the last movie, and again, Kim Jong-il thought he was gonna be around longer.

729
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,800
 He didn't know this was the last movie, but the last movie he ended up making was a movie

730
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,600
 called Pol-Gasari.

731
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:44,280
 It's the story of a group of peasants in old, old Korea where it's kings and warriors.

732
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,440
 And then you have a peasant class.

733
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,400
 And the peasant class is supposed to represent, again, the modern North Korea.

734
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,640
 And the king is supposed to represent capitalism.

735
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,560
 All of the wealth and all of the trappings of wealth.

736
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,860
 And the peasants are having all their iron taken to be turned into swords so the king

737
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,020
 can go fight other peasants to take their iron to turn into swords and so on and so

738
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,020
 forth.

739
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,340
 But there's a blacksmith in town who refuses to go along with a plan, and he's being starved

740
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
 to death.

741
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,300
 And his daughter is throwing rice into the cell so he can eat it.

742
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,180
 And he goes to eat it, and he goes, "No.

743
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,580
 No, I'm not gonna do that."

744
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,620
 And he takes the rice, he forms it, forms it into a little monster.

745
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,920
 He has a little monster in his hand.

746
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,460
 And he goes, "Please, gods of the heaven and the earth, don't let my people suffer such

747
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
 injustice.

748
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,200
 How can this go on?

749
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,520
 Please give them some type of peace."

750
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
 Ehh.

751
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,000
 Old man dies.

752
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,280
 The little monster is given to his daughter.

753
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
 His daughter takes it home as a memento.

754
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,520
 It's made of rice, by the way, but it doesn't look like it.

755
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,000
 It's a perfect little monster, man.

756
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,640
 And she accidentally pricks her finger while she's sewing in a drop of blood, drips on

757
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,940
 this little monster.

758
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:58,400
 Bringing it to life begins eating her sewing needles.

759
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
 And it's eating iron.

760
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,540
 Now, even though it's called polgisari, it's based on the legend of the bolgisari.

761
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,900
 I don't know why they changed the letter.

762
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,200
 I don't think anyone really knows why they changed the first letter.

763
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,060
 But this polgisari, the people in town realize, "Oh no, he's gonna eat all of our farm equipment."

764
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,300
 So they kick him out of town.

765
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,220
 But then when the army comes and starts messing with the peasants, they go, "Wait a second.

766
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,260
 Don't we have a way to stop the army?"

767
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,140
 So they bring back the polgisari.

768
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,320
 And they go, "Here, we'll give you a couple of hoes you can eat.

769
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,960
 Here's some spades.

770
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,640
 Let's see what you can do."

771
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,440
 The next hour of the movie can only be explained this way.

772
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,400
 Imagine Godzilla meets 300.

773
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,200
 It's basically, the whole movie is just two armies meeting in all these battlefields,

774
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,480
 and then Godzilla coming in and stepping all over the bad guys.

775
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,960
 It's incredibly entertaining, and it's available for free on YouTube.

776
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,000
 It's totally subtitled.

777
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Watched the whole thing.

778
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,580
 Really enjoyable.

779
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,980
 And it has a bizarre message at the ending.

780
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,280
 Bizarre message at the ending.

781
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,180
 Because at the ending, the peasants win with the help of the polgisari.

782
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,700
 But now the polgisari is hungry, so it turns back to the peasants and wants to eat all

783
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,900
 of their farming implements.

784
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,500
 Now they're feeding it.

785
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,340
 And they go, "The young daughter who has a connection with this beast goes, 'We can't

786
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
 keep feeding the polgisari.

787
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,060
 We're giving it the stuff we need to survive.

788
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
 How can we keep doing this?'"

789
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,520
 And they go, "Well, we owe it to him.

790
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
 He helped us.

791
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,920
 Now we have to help him."

792
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,560
 But they're destroying their livelihood.

793
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,600
 She goes to the monster and says, "I know how this is going to end.

794
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,800
 We're going to give you all of our iron, and you're going to get stronger, but we're going

795
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,520
 to run out of iron.

796
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,440
 So we're going to have to invade other countries with you at our side.

797
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,280
 You can't be defeated.

798
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,000
 And you'll eat all of their iron, and then we'll invade another country, and another

799
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,540
 country, and another country until we have taken over this world, but you have devoured

800
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,700
 all of the iron.

801
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,660
 That's not a world that I want to live in."

802
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:07,580
 It's interesting because you can look at the monster, the polgisari, as a force of capitalism

803
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:16,920
 that devours the labor of the people and requires the entire world to be taken over by one

804
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,480
 government, simply so this creature can continue to eat.

805
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,600
 Or some say that Shin made the polgisari a critique of the North Korean government, that

806
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:34,840
 no amount of power will ever satisfy a dictator, even though he may start off fighting for

807
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,060
 the peasant.

808
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,020
 Eventually he wants to be emperor of the world.

809
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,320
 Or it may just be a goofy monster movie made to entertain kids in North Korea.

810
00:38:45,320 --> 00:39:00,640
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

811
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,120
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listen to it today.

812
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,760
 Have a great one, guys.

813
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:24,280
 Bye.

814
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,860
 (upbeat music)
