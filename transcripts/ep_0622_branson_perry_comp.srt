1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
 What happens when a woman goes to park her car?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,840
 But she can't.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,940
 And then we take a look at the whole story for that one,

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,480
 and then we're gonna take a look at a true crime story that has disturbed me for almost 20 years now.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,680
 When a young man leaves his house to return a pair of jumper cables to a shed in his backyard,

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,480
 everyone expects he'll be right back, but he's never seen again. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 *Music*

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:39,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,600
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,600
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun doing whatever you're doing, and I hope you guys are actually doing something towards your

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,320
 90 days to a better you challenge. Hope that is going really really well for you.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,720
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna invite in our

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,520
 legacy Patreon for today. Long time supporter of the show. Give it up for Hunter Johnson. Everyone give a round of applause.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,200
 He's walking in with his bow and his arrow. He's getting ready to shoot the coyotes. They will also listen to the show. Run coyotes, run!

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,720
 Hunter Johnson won't kill you. He's actually a pretty cool guy. Hunter, I hope he doesn't kill you. Hunter,

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,640
 you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. You guys can't support the Patreon, or if you guys aren't true, hunters of God's creatures.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,720
 That's okay. That's okay. It's okay to not want to destroy life,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,560
 but you can also help support the show by getting the word out.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,160
 Letting your friends know about Dead Rabbit Radio really really helps as well. So Hunter Johnson, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,760
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to Durham in England.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:48,840
 Jason Jalopy is driving out and then you hit that little button and flies like chitty-chitty-bing-bing. We're flying out to Durham, England.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,560
 This is actually a requested story by Christian Davison.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,400
 So thank you so much for sending this over. He got it from the 40nMap. Again, the 40nMap's in the show notes.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,560
 It's an interactive map of all these weird events all over the world. Hunter's flying us over in the Jason Jalopy.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,600
 He lands us in Durham, England. It's

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:15,320
 1975. Hunter is giving us a tour of the countryside as he's taking us to Durham, England. And then he's like, "I'm done. I'm done.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,360
 I'm done." Drive in, he kicks back his feet up on the dashboard. We're at a parking lot. And it's just a normal parking lot.

28
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,320
 There's a bunch of empty spaces and then there's cars and so you guys know how parking lots work.

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,480
 This isn't your first time on earth, or is it? We see a car pull up with a mother and her daughter in it.

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,720
 The mother's name is Dillies Cant. Mrs. Dillies Cant.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,080
 And her daughter have just gone out for a drive and they're pulling into this parking lot to not drive anymore, because that's what parking lots are for.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
 She sees an empty space and her car goes to pull in and then, you know, gets stuck there.

33
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,960
 What? She can see the space is empty in front of her, but she backs up the car, goes to go into the space again.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,000
 Nope. I don't know if it actually made a sound effect, but it's a podcast. I have to do something.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,280
 She keeps trying to pull into the space, but there's something blocking her there. It's not like she's

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,040
 slowly moving through it like there's some sort of invisible molasses.

37
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,240
 It's not like she's hitting a brick wall and it's injuring the car. The car simply stops when you get to the parking space.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,160
 Now the first thing she does is see does she have more air in her gas tank than gas?

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,320
 The answer to that one, because I know you guys are asking, is no, that wasn't the problem.

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,240
 She keeps trying to pull into the parking space and she says it's like she's hitting a curb.

41
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,680
 You know, like your car bumps into a curb, where it's kind of like just a gentle bump, but there's no curb there.

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,280
 They get out, they look down, there's no curb. Get back in the car, drive, bounce. It just stops. It won't go any further.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,360
 The daughter trades places with the mom and goes, "You obviously are doing something wrong. You must be hitting the brakes."

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,880
 Maybe this is some sort of practical joke or something like that. The daughter tries it.

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,720
 You know, the car just stops. There are other cars in this parking lot. This one, they're rocking their horn.

46
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,840
 "Hey lady, move out of the way. Take the parking spot." They're like, "We can't.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,960
 We're trying to get in this parking spot. The car keeps bouncing back." The other motorists are like, "You're obviously pulling a joke."

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,040
 So she backs up. Another car go, "Ew." The second motorist can't pull in.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,000
 And then a second motorist also tries pulling into the parking space.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,360
 Can't. So we have three different cars with four different drivers try to pull into a parking spot

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,560
 and it was impossible for them to do it.

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,680
 This phenomenon is known as the Durham Force Field.

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,440
 So that's that story. That that story. I just told that's that story.

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,760
 This is actually an edit. That story. I just told you I've been spent another 15 minutes.

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,880
 15 minutes talking about that story. I went off on this weird

56
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,120
 tangent about secret codes hidden inside mysterious stories and while it may be fascinating,

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
 while it may have been fascinating if I had time to plan it out,

58
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,080
 it was literally 12 minutes of utter nonsense. That's why it's very important to edit.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,040
 You guys have never done anything creatively

60
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,360
 before. Don't assume everything you do is gonna be cold in because if I had released that,

61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:21,480
 had I left that 12 minutes in there, this won't take 12 minutes. This apology for something you didn't even know existed.

62
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,280
 This won't take 12 minutes, but had I left that 12 minutes in there, you would have gotten bored.

63
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,760
 I would have gotten bored editing it and I just gave up halfway through.

64
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,040
 I go even when I recorded it, I go after I recorded the whole episode because the next story coming up.

65
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,600
 It's a dope one. The next story it's coming up. It's super dark as well.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,360
 So I'm kind of buying some time before you get there.

67
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,000
 But after I recorded the episode, I thought about it and I was like dude, that doesn't work.

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,840
 That was just boring. It was boring.

69
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,320
 So anyways, this instead is basically an explanation for why the first story was only five minutes

70
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,640
 and I wanted to add two other things real quick. First off, horrible weather is gripping the United States.

71
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,720
 One of our longtime listeners of the show and/or Forrest Finn Correspondent's Beatrice and her family are currently having power problems

72
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,560
 in one of the states. They currently have no electricity. Luckily they have a fireplace and a gas oven so they do have food.

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,560
 But we're thinking about you, Beatrice and your family. We're thinking about all you guys

74
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,960
 who are suffering from this horrible weather. The fluffle stays warm together.

75
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,320
 I think that snow sucks. I've always said snow sucks and you guys laughed at me.

76
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,720
 But I hope everyone is staying warm. We're going to get through this together.

77
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,240
 And secondly, in a little more upbeat news, Beatrice is like, don't forget about me. We're not.

78
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,120
 But I do have to talk about other stuff as well. Sorry, Beatrice.

79
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,320
 For a couple more days, I don't know how long this is going to be online, but until February 23rd at least.

80
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,400
 So I wanted to get this one out real quick.

81
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,480
 Christie's, the auction house, is doing this amazing sale that's not sponsored by Christie's.

82
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,040
 They're doing this amazing sale of meteorites.

83
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,560
 So I'm going to put it in the show notes. If you guys have nothing else to do with there's no electricity,

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,440
 you're going to waste the last electricity on your cell phone to look at meteorites. Christie's is selling

85
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,360
 meteorites. I've never seen anything like this. I always thought meteorites were like

86
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,680
 a rock. It best a rock with the blob in the middle of it. But no, there's like crystal

87
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,360
 meteorites and like two meteorites that crash together and then they like liquefy in deep

88
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,840
 space and then freeze. I don't know if that's the actual science, but they look dope. They look dope.

89
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,200
 And I didn't know this. Pieces of the moon are on earth

90
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,200
 from meteorites hitting the moon and then pieces of the moon falling on earth. They say that's one

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,720
 of the rarest earth minerals ever is moon pieces. So check out this auction. Hopefully, I don't know

92
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,240
 Christie's if they'll keep the pictures up. I don't think they will. I don't think they'll be like,

93
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,680
 "Look what you missed." But if you guys want to look at some amazing meteorites, I didn't think

94
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,520
 they looked like this. I thought they were just big old chunks of rock. There's some really cool

95
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,960
 things out there. So check that out. So that all being said, there's going to be a weird segue

96
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,360
 here for our next story. And that's about it. That's about it. I got to release the episode.

97
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,520
 It's almost time to be released. Here we go. Hunter, go ahead and call in the carbonic

98
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,920
 helicopter. We're going to leave behind Durham, England. We are headed out to Skidmore, Missouri.

99
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:30,520
 I'm going to tell you right now. This topic is really disturbing. This is one of the stories

100
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,200
 that I remember hearing about back when it happened back in 2001. And it stuck with me all these years.

101
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,480
 I just think it's creepy. It's not super disturbing, but if you get even just slightly

102
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:48,040
 disturbed, I think it just stuck with me for a couple reasons. Obviously, it's stuck with me.

103
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,280
 It is disturbing, but I don't want to scare too many people off, but it is pretty dark. So

104
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,960
 you can bow out here or you can continue on your day. You can press your luck. You can pick number

105
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,360
 three and listen to the rest of this episode. Hunter, Hunter's getting his parachute ready.

106
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,520
 Hunter, you can go ahead and bow out as well. But first, land this carbonic helicopter. It's

107
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,200
 April 11th, 2001. We're in Skidmore, Missouri. We're walking through Skidmore and we come to

108
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,960
 the house of Branson Perry. He's 20-year-old young man. He looks like a typical dude from 2001. He

109
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,600
 looks like a surfer dude. He kind of has the Eminem hairstyle. He has that look. He has like the

110
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,560
 little turtle claw necklace. And you know the type. You know the type. If you've ever seen a boy band

111
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,880
 video, that's who Branson Perry looked like at the time. Him and his friend Jenna are cleaning up

112
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,360
 the house because Branson's dad is in the hospital. He's going to be coming home soon. And two of his

113
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,040
 father's friends are actually working on his dad's car. Everyone's kind of coming together to help out

114
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,240
 Mr. Perry. And Branson's just kind of going about the day, cleaning stuff up. At one point he tells

115
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,480
 Jenna. He goes, "Hey, let me put these jumper cables. Let me go put them in the shed in the backyard."

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,360
 And Jenna's like, "Okay, yeah, you know, I'll be in here. I'm still cleaning up." That's 3 p.m. April

117
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:11,080
 11th, 2001. April 12th, 2001. Branson's grandma stops by the house. The house is unlocked and

118
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,800
 deserted. Grandma thinks that's a little weird, but goes about her business. She does try calling

119
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,680
 there a couple times over the next few days. No one answers. But you know Branson's a young man.

120
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,480
 He's out partying. He's out hanging out with his friends. He's not going to sit at home attending

121
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,600
 the sewing circle. But Branson's mom can't get ahold of him either. And Branson's dad finally

122
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:40,280
 gets out of the hospital and they go back home and Branson is nowhere to be seen. It's April 17th.

123
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,240
 It's six days after he walked outside with the jumper cables that he's actually reported as a

124
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,240
 missing person. The police get involved. They begin asking around what happened to him. They

125
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,800
 actually asked Jenna. And that's where they hear the story about the jumper cables. The police said

126
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,840
 that they did go to the shed and there were jumper cables found in the shed. However, there's some

127
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,560
 dispute. Some of the police officers said, "We heard the story about the jumper cables. We checked

128
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,320
 just to see if he had ever made it there." There were no jumper cables in the shed. They were found

129
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,120
 later. They were found after he had gone missing. Some reports say the jumper cables weren't found

130
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,240
 until two weeks after the search had already begun. And the police said we searched that area before.

131
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,640
 Now, we see this a lot in missing people stories. We see this a lot in murder investigations where

132
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,600
 they search a 1,000-foot radius. They don't find anything. Two weeks later, they find the backpack

133
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,080
 that's always seen as suspicious like the killer dropped the backpack off. A lot of times I just

134
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,160
 account that for sloppy police work. They're not Robocop. When you have the search radius and they're

135
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,880
 like, "The body was discovered and that area had already been searched." That doesn't, that's people

136
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,720
 are walking through with sticks, poke and stuff. They could be thinking about which Pokemon they're

137
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,840
 going to catch tomorrow or whatever. Their wife yelling at them. All sorts of stuff. So the fact

138
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,240
 that they found the jumper cables two weeks later, that doesn't make me think that the jumper cables

139
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,280
 weren't there originally. I do think that the jumper cables were there that Branson had walked

140
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,880
 off and dropped the jumper cables off at the shed. But the point of the story is he disappeared

141
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,560
 somewhere between the house and the shed. Now, you go, "Why was the house empty? What happened

142
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,960
 to everyone who was there?" Well, Jenna and the people who were working on the car finished

143
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,760
 working on the car and left. And Jenna apparently waited in the house for a while, but when Branson

144
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,680
 didn't show up, she just left as well and she didn't have the keys to lock the place, she figured

145
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,560
 Branson was going to be back any minute. Because Branson was having some issues.

146
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,440
 Jenna said that he had actually began to experiment with marijuana and methamphetamines.

147
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,080
 So when he walked out to drop off the jumper cables and he didn't come back for a while,

148
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,440
 she's thinking he's probably smoking something. He'll be back, he'll be fine. So she just finishes

149
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,800
 doing what she's doing and she leaves. There was another issue, something far more serious than

150
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,320
 methamphetamine use. Four days earlier on April 7th, Branson was over at the neighbor's house

151
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,520
 and he was drugged. It doesn't say whether or not he was drugged against his will. He may have

152
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,720
 been using drugs, but it doesn't excuse what's about to happen. But he was drugged, he then

153
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,000
 stripped off all of his clothes, began to dance around naked and ended up having sex with his

154
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,560
 male neighbor. And Branson was deeply ashamed by this. And he told his father. Now his father,

155
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,040
 when he's talking to Branson, said, "Listen, I think you might be gay. Like, I think you might

156
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,000
 have feelings towards men. That's just something I'm picking up as a father. However,

157
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,880
 what happened to you at that house was a crime. You don't conflate the two. Which is amazing

158
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,480
 that a father is having this discussion with a son. This is where the father was actually

159
00:13:51,480 --> 00:14:00,120
 kind of explaining how he, because like, I knew you were gay. I knew you were gay and I support

160
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:12,040
 you in that. But this was rape. Don't let this ruin your feelings towards your sexuality. Which

161
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,840
 would be a very, first off, your first thing is you want to go over and just be the neighbor to

162
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,080
 death and take an advantage of your son in that state. But basically, the dad's like saying,

163
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 "It's okay to be gay, but don't think that this was okay." Don't think that this was okay.

164
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,440
 And so he talked his son through it, which is very supportive. You've got to be supportive of your

165
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,120
 children. And he believed in the beginning, this is why the father wasn't super worried about it.

166
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,720
 This is why when people were trying to call home and figure out where it was, the father goes,

167
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,040
 "I figured he was just going to go and blow off some steam." He didn't know about the, that he was

168
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 actually using methamphetamines. He didn't know about that. But he goes, "I thought my son was

169
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,440
 going to go off and blow some steam and kind of clear his head and figure out what he wanted in life.

170
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,360
 Get away from the small town and maybe even figure out what he wanted to do to this guy criminally."

171
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,400
 So when he first went missing, the father just figured he'll be back. He just needs to clear his

172
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,680
 head. But even the father knew he shouldn't be gone this long. That was in 2001, April 10th, 2003.

173
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,840
 Hunter, are you still with us? Are you still with us? Hunter's given us a nod. Hop back in that

174
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,040
 carbon helicopter, we're leaving behind Skidmore. We're headed out to Fulton, Missouri.

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:31,320
 And as we're flying overhead, we see FBI vans start driving through the neighborhood

176
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:39,400
 of Jack Wayne Roberts. All these vans pull up, doors open, FBI agents pour out, and they rush

177
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:46,840
 into the house of this 59-year-old Presbyterian minister, Boy Scout leader, and doctor.

178
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:54,520
 An upstanding citizen, why are the FBI at the house of this man? He's arrested during a sting

179
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:02,520
 of child sexual abuse images. So sharing distribution, all of that disgustingness. Presbyterian minister,

180
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:11,480
 Boy Scout leader, and doctor has been hoarding images of child sexual abuse.

181
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,480
 And that is horrific enough. That's all you really need to be in a disturbing story.

182
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:27,160
 A man in that level of power with that disgusting desire. But he's not really a doctor. You're

183
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,800
 like, "Isn't this not one? What is nothing?" You're like, "Oh no, he faked his medical degree. He's doing

184
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,560
 all this other good stuff." He's not really a doctor. We've actually covered quite a few people

185
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,920
 on this show like this. He's an amateur castration enthusiast. He tells people he's a doctor,

186
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,480
 tells people online he's a doctor, and tells people that he can perform gender reassignment

187
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:56,280
 surgeries. But if you expect to go to a clinic to go see Dr. Wayne Roberts, nope, it's at a hotel

188
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,960
 room. Could you imagine having him getting to a hotel room next to this guy? Come on guys,

189
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,800
 we're gonna have a party here. Get a couple brews, get a couple babes, and then the next hotel room

190
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:11,960
 over. Ah, here's someone screaming in a hotel. And the maid. And the maid who has to clean it up.

191
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,040
 Dr. Roberts would perform gender reassignment surgeries in random hotel rooms. One of his

192
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:26,200
 victims, really, was Madison Ambercrombie. She went to him to have her male genitalia removed

193
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:33,640
 and to become a woman. And he botched it, obviously. Howard Johnson's right. They might have a great

194
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,640
 continental breakfast, but it's not the best setup for gender reassignment surgery. He botched it so

195
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,960
 badly that she actually was bleeding for six days. She had to go to a hospital and have multiple

196
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,040
 surgeries just to correct the mistakes that he made. But even then, when the FBI was investigating

197
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,040
 all this stuff and when they found out he was a fake doctor, because they were there for the

198
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,040
 child sexual abuse images out, so what he was arrested for, they begin this full investigation,

199
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,360
 they find Madison Ambercrombie and they ask her, "Do you want to press charges against this guy?"

200
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,440
 And she says, "Listen, it was not the most comfortable operation I've ever had. It was

201
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,040
 actually the least comfortable operation I've ever had, but no, I don't really see myself as a

202
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,000
 victim." And the FBI, because they want to just get this guy locked up for life, the FBI goes,

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,720
 "Well, we gotta tell you some information about this guy. We gotta let you know what's really

204
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,480
 going on." This might, I don't even know the FBI could do this, really, but apparently the FBI

205
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,160
 started revealing information to Madison and saying, "He most likely ate your testicles."

206
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,800
 What? Yes. Yes, that's Madison throwing up. FBI just like, "We expected that. We brought this barf bag."

207
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,760
 He, there's photos of him, because he's done these gender reassignment surgeries on other people,

208
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:56,440
 of him after he removes the genitals, he would chop them up and like dice them up and eat them.

209
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:07,560
 And there were photos of him eating Madison's penis and testicles. And the FBI goes, "This is

210
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,200
 what he did after he removed them from you." So Madison goes, "Oh yeah, definitely. I want to

211
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,640
 press charges." Like, that's not super disgusting. As far as Madison was looking at it, it was a

212
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,560
 botched surgery, but it turns out he was a cannibal. While they're doing this search,

213
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,920
 poor FBI agents, right? Poor, poor FBI agents. While they're having to look through all of this stuff,

214
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,920
 they come across chat logs. It's just another way for these sickos to indulge in their fantasies.

215
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,760
 They come across these chat logs under names like "Bugger Butt" or "Oh Hail Satan," so edgy.

216
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:52,120
 He has these chat logs and he talks about young men, how he's kidnapped, raped, mutilated, tortured,

217
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,960
 and killed these young men. And the other people on the forums are like, "Oh yeah, I totally want

218
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,240
 to do that too. Yeah, you're so dope. You're totally awesome. Let me tell you about my story."

219
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,920
 And it's just grossness, grossness all around. In these chat logs, though, the FBI has gone

220
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:16,360
 through all these chat logs and they're just, again, just like really cringy, sexual, disgusting

221
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,160
 stuff to get him off and to get other people off. But while they're reading these chat logs,

222
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,880
 one of the agents goes, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Scroll back up. What did he write there? What did he say?"

223
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,160
 The agents scroll up and there's a story that was written by John Wayne Roberts. And he goes,

224
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:42,600
 "Guys, listen to this. One day I was driving through Skidmore, Missouri and I saw a blonde kid

225
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:53,400
 who's young in his 20s. I picked him up, put him in my car. You know what I did next. You know what

226
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,040
 Jason doesn't want to repeat. You know what Jason doesn't want to say again on the show. I did that

227
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:05,160
 stuff. I did that super gross stuff. I took this young kid out, did what I do, and I murdered him,

228
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,800
 and I buried him in the middle of nowhere. No one will ever know what happened to that boy from

229
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,000
 Skidmore, Missouri. He's being charged with child sexual abuse images. He's being charged with working

230
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,560
 illegally as a doctor. Now they have a murder charge on him. But the images they found on his

231
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:30,360
 hard drive and they had photos of him eating the genitals of Madison. I think that's abuse of a

232
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,280
 body. That's a misdemeanor. But you have the acting as a doctor without a license. That's illegal.

233
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,680
 Obviously the child sexual abuse stuff is highly, highly illegal, rightfully so.

234
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,760
 And then you have this story. Now they're looking at a murder charge, but they don't have evidence.

235
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 Other than a written confession that's posted online. So they go to him and they go, "What can

236
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,960
 you tell us about Branson?" And he says, "I don't know what you're talking about." They go back in 2001,

237
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,680
 we had a young blonde boy go missing from Skidmore, Missouri. Funny enough, a man who talks about eating

238
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,160
 genitals and talks about raping and murdering and torturing and mutilating young men.

239
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,560
 We have a missing young man that you, in a way, identified his, where you picked him up, his

240
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,920
 physical description. So tell us what happened to Branson. Jack says, "I don't know what you're

241
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:30,840
 talking about. I fantasize. I've never killed anybody. I might chop off their penis and eat it.

242
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,440
 What do you think I am? Some sort of monster? I've never killed anybody. I don't know what

243
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,840
 you're talking about. Maybe I read something in the news about a kid go missing and I saw his

244
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:48,280
 photograph and thought he was cute. Maybe, maybe, but this story is fake. It's not true. So it's

245
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,760
 known as a lorp. It's a live action role play officer. I did not kill Branson. They bring in

246
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,400
 cadaver dogs just to be safe. Check out his property. They pick up the scent of something,

247
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,280
 but it's nothing definitive. In his narrative, he said that he buried the body in the Ozarks.

248
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,080
 So unless they can just bring cadaver dogs all through the Ozarks and find every corpse from

249
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,760
 the hillbilly wars that have lasted three generations, they're not going to find him. His house, though,

250
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,480
 was heavily searched. His property was heavily searched. They're looking for something that could

251
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:27,080
 connect him to the disappearance of Branson. They find nothing at all until they find a turtle

252
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:34,840
 claw necklace. The same kind of necklace that Branson wore all the time, including the day he

253
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:43,640
 disappeared. A written confession and a turtle claw necklace. Still not enough to convict him.

254
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,200
 That's not a one of a kind necklace that was made by some artisan. If something you could buy at

255
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,600
 Hot Topic, he maintained that the confession was not a confession. It was a story he was telling to

256
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,520
 a bunch of perverts to try to get some sort of pleasure out of it for him and the other perverts.

257
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,400
 Branson's mom begged him, begged him for the location of Branson's body. He goes, "I don't

258
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,200
 know what you're talking about. I never killed him. I was just making it up." Written confession,

259
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:24,760
 physical evidence. He denied it, denied it, denied it. The police could not charge him with this.

260
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,240
 He got 17 years for assault against Madison by performing the surgery without being a licensed

261
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:37,080
 doctor. He got 17 years for assault, 7 years for performing an illegal surgery, 30 years

262
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,080
 of having child sex abuse images, but it is concurrent sentencing. So basically all of

263
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:48,680
 those sentences are served out at the same time. He went to prison around 2003-2004.

264
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:55,080
 He's halfway done with his sentence. He'll be around 80 when he gets out, 80, 90 years old.

265
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,480
 There's a chance he will be out in our lifetime. Never admitted to the murder,

266
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,720
 never convicted of the murder. Eventually the mother of Branson came forward and said,

267
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,960
 "I don't know if he did it, but I'm glad someone that evil is off the streets regardless."

268
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:20,440
 Branson is still missing. He's never been found. I think it's most likely that this sicko did it.

269
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,280
 I don't think it was a lark. I think that he probably did murder him and he may have murdered

270
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,040
 others. It was just that story had enough information in it that the police could connect it to a

271
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,520
 missing person's case. A minister, a Boy Scout leader has access to all sorts of victims. Boy

272
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,520
 Scouts are just looking for a little bit of fun in the wilderness and to become a man.

273
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:50,280
 As a minister you have access to people who are so weak and desperate that it's just the

274
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,520
 perfect honey trap that a pervert could live in and just collect victims one by one.

275
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,320
 But this story has completely disturbed me and it's not so much because of the fact that I have

276
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,440
 to think about people like Jack Wayne Roberts existing. It's the fact that you can disappear so

277
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,520
 quickly. You always hear stories about like little kids walking out and they're like walking home

278
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,600
 from school and then they just disappear halfway through and the kid was only a block away and was

279
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,200
 never seen again. He was blocked away from home and he's never seen again. That's absolutely tragic.

280
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:32,760
 But to disappear in your own backyard is especially disturbing to never be seen again. On that level

281
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,880
 it's disturbing. There's also a level of it that is disturbing where you have a young man who is

282
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:49,240
 accepting his sexuality and you have predators out there that specialize on young men exploring

283
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,400
 their sexuality or accepting their sexuality. I think that's absolutely tragic as well. We see it

284
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,880
 a lot. We see women being targeted by serial killers and we see gay men being targeted by

285
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,600
 serial killers and both are equally tragic. Both are equally tragic. I just I think it's weird.

286
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,200
 Not only are there people like that exist like Jack Wayne Roberts but they're literally like

287
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:22,200
 vultures that watch society and they're picking off the I don't want to use the term weakest but

288
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,400
 the most naive because we know not to get in people's cars. We know not to get in random people's cars.

289
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:38,280
 So why did Branson or did he willingly get in the car? Was he snatched out of his backyard?

290
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,880
 Was he being stalked for a while? Did he drop the jumper cables off and hang out in the shed

291
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,800
 and maybe smoke a little meth and then when he came back in everyone had left and then

292
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:54,680
 he was kidnapped? We don't know. There's so many unknowns to this but he disappeared where he should

293
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:01,720
 feel the safest. His own home. The last sighting of him was walking out of his back door to go to a

294
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:10,120
 shed and he's never been seen since. I don't know if he got into a car. I don't know if he hooked up

295
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,280
 with someone for drugs. I don't know if he was a young man questioning who he was on a sexual

296
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,680
 level and got picked up by a chicken hawk or if he dropped off the jumper cables and as he was

297
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,480
 coming out of the shed someone grabbed him. Someone was in the shed waiting for him and grabbed him.

298
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,920
 He walked back into his house. It was empty. Someone was hiding in the closet and grabbed him.

299
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:41,560
 Did he go willingly at first? Was he kidnapped? This story just disturbs me on a bunch of different

300
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,760
 levels. We had just the initial encounter and then knowing what may have happened to him afterwards.

301
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,200
 I researched way more true crime than I cover but this story for the past 19 years has stuck out to

302
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:01,800
 me. It's so bleak and dark and depressing and it ends with no answers. It ends with a man in

303
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:09,640
 prison right now who most likely did rape, torture, mutilate, and murder a young boy who was just

304
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:18,120
 walking from his house to his shed and disappeared. It's a terrifying story and a terrifying reminder

305
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:27,000
 that true evil exists. Not metaphorical evil but true evil. Not only does it exist, it hides and

306
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,760
 it waits and it reaches from the darkness. The moment you least expect it.
