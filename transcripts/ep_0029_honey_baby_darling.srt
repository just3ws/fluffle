00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
 Honey that was once used as a weapon of war and we take a look at UFO sightings interfering

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,000
 With our military maneuvers today on Dead Rabbit Radio

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,240
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,200
 Hope you're having a great day. I'm having pretty good day. It's 98 degrees. I'm recording during the day again

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,880
 But I have a sore back so I have a heating pad on my back. So my back is probably closer to like 105 110

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,880
 I think I told you before that I made my own back ointment with the

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,860
 It took a I think it's called a dragon pepper or devil's tongue or something like that. It's one of the top two hottest peppers

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,600
 Scorpion maybe

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,240
 anyways, I

10
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,600
 Took one of those and I squished it into a bucket of been gay and just like mushed it around

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,560
 And so I've been used I've only used it a couple times because it's pretty intense obviously what's interesting about it

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,720
 Is you rub it on your back? You don't feel anything like normally when you put on an ointment on your back you feel stuff immediately

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,040
 This one you rub on your back. You don't feel anything and then you rub it on your back a little more and you still don't feel anything

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,880
 And what happens is you get to a point where well I did I put it on my back

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,520
 I woke up. I didn't get much sleep last night. My back was hurting

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,460
 Because I'm sleeping on the couch, but that's another story

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
 and so

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,000
 I'm walking to work. I have this ointment all over my back

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,560
 I need to come up with a name for it, but I'm walking to work and I begin sweating and my back's on fire

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,840
 It really has to be water activated for it to work. So it's kind of an interesting

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,560
 Interesting little little thing little thing going on, but yeah, I just got some muscle pain in general

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 I think I'm just not sleeping well or whatever

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,120
 So we got some really good stories for you today

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,160
 One of them is actually off of that conspiracy list I often reference and it's one of the ones that people have always kind of laughed at

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,080
 And just the name of it. They're like what that's stupid. That's totally made up and I went and looked it up and it's real

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,640
 It's actually real

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,600
 There it's made today. It still exists today. So a lot of stuff on the conspiracy list

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,880
 I think is word salad just a couple words put together

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,920
 But some of it I found some documentation for some of it what happens is it gets a life of its own so

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,720
 Someone will throw something on the list and then people will then work backwards to try to find a conspiracy for it

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,360
 And that's always interesting too because whether or not the story is true sometimes is irrelevant

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,000
 It's the fact that the story exists in any way the cylinder man is not a true story

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,080
 But it's an interesting fun story and the fact that it has become a

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:48,000
 Quote-unquote true story. It's become a myth of our times the story behind slender man is more fascinating than slender man

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,240
 himself

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,760
 And so I think when we go deeper into some of these conspiracies, we're gonna run into those things

37
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,240
 I'm going to

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,040
 Make a quick plug for a product. It's not I'm not getting sponsored by this, but I use it all the time

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,280
 And it's something everyone uses all the time, but this is phenomenal

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,400
 So deodorant and here's the thing I think a lot of people get this mixed up

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
 You don't just need deodorant you need deodorant anti-perspirant because they're two completely different things

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,880
 I think a lot of people get them mixed up deodorant just coverage up any sort of smell you're gonna have any perspirant

43
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,960
 I don't know if I'm saying that right, but any perspirant keeps you from sweating

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,080
 And I get that you know some people don't like to use anti-perspirant because it

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
 Blocks the pores in your armpit and so you can't secrete

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,080
 The the you know toxins you're supposed to but I like to use both. I don't like to just buy a deodorant or an anti-perspirant

47
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,600
 Why would you buy an anti-perspirant and not a deodorant? I can understand if someone just got the deodorant, but anyways

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,560
 Old spice wolf thorn

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,280
 Is the best deodorant I have ever had it's a little it's probably about 380 of

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
 For just one bar of it. I think it's called the bar

51
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640
 It smells great. It works great. I've never had any trouble with it

52
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,000
 Doesn't stain any of my shirts old spice wolf thorn if you're looking for a good smelling

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,120
 Effective deodorant that's the one and I've tried and I think everybody has and I've tried all sorts of stuff

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 And sometimes I want to save some money

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,400
 So I'll buy like the two pack of arm and hammer deodorant, which is okay, but it's just doesn't I don't really like the smell as much

56
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,320
 It's effective in what it does, but and it kind of stains my shirts, but old spice wolf thorn

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,440
 I know that totally sounds like an ad and it kind of is I'm not getting paid for it, but it's like my favorite deodorant

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,480
 I love the smell of it. It's just super efficient. I kind of gone on for that for a bit now. Okay, so

59
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
 We'll go ahead and get started on this episode here

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
 Sponsored by wolf thorn deodorant. No, I'm joking. I'm joking

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,600
 So I came across some interesting stories and the food based one is actually

62
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,040
 The conspiracy the one that's on the conspiracy list

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,160
 It's one that a lot of people have requested a lot of people have questions its existence

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,640
 They thought it was just something funny that someone put in the board and that is mad honey

65
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,840
 So mad honey is actually a real thing and it's manufactured today

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,640
 It comes from turkey

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,800
 now

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
 Mad honey kind of got its reputation

69
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,600
 Because of an event back in 67 bc

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,640
 I wasn't able to find any sourcing for this story

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,760
 This is from an article that you all post below and I was hoping to get some more detail on this actual battle

72
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:50,480
 But I wasn't able to so in 1960. I'm sorry 1967 in 67 bc these roman soldiers were invading

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,120
 the black sea area

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
 and

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,080
 The king the the king in that area king. Let's see how much I butcher this king myth right dates myth redates

76
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,480
 Knew that these roman soldiers are just going to plow over his troops

77
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,600
 This is the turkey region region what wasn't called turkey back then. I don't believe but anyways

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,760
 The he sees that these roman soldiers are coming through and he's like how am I going to take these guys on they're very well trained

79
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,080
 You know, we got a good army too, but

80
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,720
 We've got to take care of this. You don't want to have to fight them in an open field

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
 So he ordered his men

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,040
 Hey

83
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,240
 Go get some of that mad honey, and I want you to break off huge honeycombs of mad honey

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
 And it's actual honey, and I want you to just drop it

85
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,600
 In the area leave it around so as the troops are marching they'll run into it. They'll find it

86
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,160
 Now you're a soldier. It's 67 bc. You're not you know an army marches on its stomach

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
 There's no snicker bars back then you're getting a little hangry

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,600
 You want to kill some turks, but you're also just kind of hungry right now

89
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,560
 And you look down and you see a big red honeycomb laying on the ground

90
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,200
 Looks delicious looks kind of like a pomegranate. Maybe you're hoping maybe it tastes like one so you pick it up

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,640
 Take a big bite of it. Hmm. Dude. This is this is like honey

92
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,800
 This this tastes delicious and the other roman soldier goes oh man here. Let me see that glass devias or whatever

93
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
 Oh, you know what I found out too

94
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,280
 that the

95
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
 roman word for sheath

96
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,560
 Means vagina

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,320
 So if you back and if you traveled so basically a vagina is just the latin form of saying the word sheath because it makes sense

98
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
 You're kind of like putting

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,520
 Your your your quote-unquote sword into a sheath

100
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,520
 So you're gladius into a vagina

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,800
 So if you traveled back in time you would hear a bunch of roman soldiers being like oh man, where's my vagina?

102
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
 I left it at home

103
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,360
 I got to go because otherwise I can't carry the sword all the time. No here borrow my vagina. It's a little worn out

104
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
 But it'll fit your sword. Oh, thank you. Thank you

105
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,800
 favius

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
 anyways, so

107
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
 I'm sure that ruins the narrative

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,880
 The narrative immersion of my well crafted story here, but anyway

109
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,520
 So these the roman soldiers with vaginas at hand taped to their waist

110
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,480
 Are walking through they're marching through this

111
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,240
 path to invade to take on the turks

112
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,800
 And they keep finding chunks of this red honeycomb and oh man. This is delicious

113
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
 Eatin it

114
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
 having a good time

115
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,160
 And then the side effects kick in

116
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,600
 First a couple of the soldiers

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,840
 Get a little nauseous

118
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
 A little sick

119
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 Some of them are complaining about blurred vision. You can't see anything really well

120
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,760
 Then the hallucinations kick in they see the god Saturn fly across the sky

121
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,400
 Throwing out rose petals at their feet. They see two squirrels

122
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,880
 Playing ping pong or the roman equivalent of ping pong back then

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,040
 Their vaginas begin to talk to them. Hey put a sword in me

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,880
 And in the midst of the nausea blurred vision and general unwellness not to mention the

125
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
 Crippling hallucinations the turks showed up and slaughtered

126
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
 slaughtered the romans

127
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
 So what is mad honey?

128
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
 Mad honey is actually

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
 Honey create obviously, but it's some honey created by bees

130
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
 that

131
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,400
 Are let loose in an area that has

132
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,600
 A bunch of uh rojijeron

133
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,040
 So it's these flowers. So what happens is even today the turkish beekeepers in the area

134
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
 They'll create their regular honey

135
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,240
 And then they'll load up their big boxes of

136
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,440
 Bees and they have to hike them up this huge hill where that's where all the rojijeron things are all the rojijeron

137
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
 I know i'm not saying that right, but

138
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,960
 rojido

139
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,160
 den drawn anyways, so they take them up there and

140
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,160
 Bees can pollinate those type of flowers really anywhere, but up there. There's no other flowers around

141
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,000
 So every bit of pollination the bee gets it's from those flowers. They go back to their beehive

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And they the one of the chemicals in those type of flowers is a hallucinogenic

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,840
 So the bees basically are making hallucinogenic honey

144
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,280
 In turkey it's considered to have a lot of health benefits and that's why people still still make it

145
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,800
 It's very expensive too. I think it's like 120 dollars a bottle

146
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,360
 And you can order it online if you're so inclined. However before you do that

147
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 We'll get to the health warnings soon enough if the nausea and hallucinations didn't

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,080
 Didn't get you

149
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,800
 But in turkey it's kind of a cultural thing where oh you're sick. Just take a scoop of mad honey

150
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,680
 Oh, you're you know lethargic take a scoop of mad honey a little depressed. It's a scoop of mad honey

151
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,960
 If you just take a scoop you're fine, but it's very easy to overdose on it can actually kill you if you take too much of it

152
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,920
 So it starts off and it low blood pressure irregularities on the heartbeat

153
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:11,440
 Nausea numbness blurred vision fainting potent hallucination seizures and death in rare cases

154
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
 So it's nothing to be toyed with

155
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
 and this article

156
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,560
 It was a very interesting article this reporter goes to turkey and kind of talking to different people and a couple of them

157
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,320
 Are like oh a couple of other people from the west are like, yeah, I really want to get some mad honey

158
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,400
 I can order it online, but you never know what's going to be in it could be fake

159
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
 This is kind of like the holy grail of honey

160
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:40,000
 I wonder if bees pollinate marijuana. It doesn't have to be a flower. I wonder if they could cross breed a flower

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
 and marijuana

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,000
 And then bees would pollinate marijuana. I don't know how does marijuana grow its seeds, right?

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,080
 Seeds fall off. So maybe that's different, but do bees pollinate sunflowers because those have seeds too

164
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,200
 anyways anyways

165
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,280
 So they're making this honey over there

166
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,760
 And you can buy it and it's you can buy it from a shop there

167
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,520
 But they don't really advertise it because again if you're in turkey, you know where to get it

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,680
 They don't want a bunch of westerners coming over taking three scoops

169
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,480
 Flipping out and calling themselves the messiah as they run down the street naked and on fire

170
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,320
 And it basically causing the government to regulate their business

171
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,400
 They keep it on the download they keep it under the shelves

172
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,640
 Every so often some you have to have a friend who will introduce you to the right shopkeeper

173
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,800
 And they usually keep it under their counter

174
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,080
 Fascinating and again, you can order it online, but you don't know what you're getting

175
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,120
 So mad honey

176
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,520
 Very simple

177
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,000
 Um, it is a it's such a lesser known conspiracy that it shows up on the conspiracy list

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,280
 It's actually fairly easy to find I just googled mad honey

179
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,200
 A lot of people are like, what is mad honey? This is fake and it maybe maybe it was a little more than googling it

180
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,640
 I think it it took me maybe like five ten minutes, but it wasn't hard at all

181
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,640
 And I thought it was fascinating that it was it's basically a

182
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,920
 Biological weapon

183
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,360
 You can use it against an invading force and they don't know what they're into it takes very specialized

184
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,120
 It's like only can grown a certain area like you can't have a bunch of other flowers around

185
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,240
 And I always think that's interesting. So like how did they first discover this like who was the first guy?

186
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,120
 Who saw a cow and goes, you know what?

187
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,920
 Yeah, I'm drinking out of that udder

188
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,680
 Who at what point in human history because I mean someone had to sit there and go man, you know what my sons

189
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
 Drinking from my wife's boob

190
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,280
 And that calf is drinking from that cow's boob

191
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,520
 Ergo, I should be able to drink from that cow's boob

192
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,920
 Like you you had to have a chain of events a chain of decisions to get there

193
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
 And the same thing with this, you know

194
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,680
 That there are beekeepers in the valley for a thousand years

195
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,600
 And they're like making honey and stuff like that and since they're like

196
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,320
 Some guy shows up

197
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,920
 Charles Charles the Turk shows up and they're like get out of here, Charles. You can't put your beehives here

198
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,880
 This whole area is taken. He's like fun. I'm gonna go somewhere else

199
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,360
 So he climbs up the hill to get away from all the bullies and he puts down his beehive and he's like, okay

200
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
 I think I'll put him up here

201
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
 And then he starts noticing his honey's red and he's like, oh, that's a waste

202
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,360
 It throws it out and then more bees they make more honey and it's red and he's like, what am I going to do with this red honey?

203
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
 I'll taste it and he takes a bite and he's like

204
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,520
 Oh

205
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,560
 Oh, this actually isn't that bad even though it's red. It tastes pretty good

206
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,520
 What do you think bee goddess and the bee goddess is talking to him because he's having horrible hallucinations

207
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,320
 And then from that point on somebody said, you know what I bet you this has some health benefits

208
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,920
 Lowering blood pressure is a health benefit. I don't see really see how blurred vision is a health benefit, but

209
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,600
 It's that that chain of events had to happen

210
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,680
 I mean, maybe they found a red just beehive one day and they're like, hey, let's take a bite out of that and see what happens

211
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,240
 But even then that's weird to get to the point where they're manufacturing

212
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,840
 Mad honey and they know enough about it that they can use it effectively against an invading force

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,480
 It wasn't just a fluke. Nothing's ever a fluke and I think that a lot of times when we look at society or world history

214
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
 we jump from

215
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
 We jump to like point

216
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,200
 12 the point 12 was being mad honey exists. We don't know who found it. We don't know why they found it

217
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,920
 You know same thing with shaman

218
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,720
 Who are like take this bean and put it in your ear and then blow out your left nose while chewing on an onion root

219
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
 And it'll get how do they know all that stuff?

220
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,320
 More importantly, how do they know which stuff in the

221
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,800
 Forest is not poisonous

222
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
 Shamans are like, hey drink this but don't drink too much or you're gonna die. Like how do you figure that out?

223
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,920
 ayahuasca things like that the

224
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,480
 You think evolutionary wise someone would have found it eaten it died and then everyone else would have been like no not doing that anymore

225
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
 That's what animals do

226
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,560
 Animals eat plants and they keep dying and then they go they evolve to where they're stop eating that plant

227
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,800
 So it's weird how we just jump we skip whole parts of human history and it's just like oh this exists

228
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,760
 humans drink milk

229
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,640
 And who was the first guy was like, mmm that white mucus coming out of that udder that dirt covered mud covered udder

230
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,280
 Yeah, i'm putting that in my mouth

231
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,360
 Fascinating because somebody had to do it

232
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,040
 somebody had to do it

233
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,560
 Our next story

234
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
 We're gonna go in the completely opposite direction

235
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
 from

236
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 I can't think of a pun

237
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
 From bees in a box

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
 To ufo's

239
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,800
 Yeah, I got nothing. Okay, so I always saw this was an interesting story. I it's one of those stories that

240
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:58,640
 It's one of those stories that you have to take a lot of stuff on faith like mad honey can be tested

241
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,760
 So there are some stories like dovelyn wisconsin, which they really has no backing information the town that disappeared

242
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,760
 And we we run into those fairly often then there's stories that have some backing information

243
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,720
 And that's eyewitness testimony first person eyewitness testimony. I was there

244
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,280
 And then you get stories where it's like third person then you get stories that are like

245
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,520
 Very well documented this story kind of falls into that area of the first person. So we have to

246
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,680
 Assume these people are telling the truth if we're going to believe in this story

247
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,360
 If you don't believe that they're telling the truth the story completely falls apart

248
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,320
 Because the government has said now it's not happening

249
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,720
 But you know again when you ever you're building a conspiracy you have a group

250
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,200
 You have a factor in it as a group that people don't normally trust which is the military

251
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,080
 so

252
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,280
 This is the idea and this kind of plays into a couple of theories. I have with aliens in general

253
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,920
 And I've heard this story. I don't think this story will come as a surprise to anybody

254
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
 Maybe some people I guess if it didn't come to a surprise to anyone I wouldn't cover it

255
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
 But we've been having a problem

256
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,800
 With our nuclear bases

257
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,600
 United States nuclear bases now they're scattered across the United States when I was a kid

258
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,440
 I actually was told that there were certain skyscrapers in New York that had no nothing in them

259
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,840
 They were just a nuclear missile and they built a building around it to hide it

260
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,640
 And I don't really think I believed that I think it's an interesting

261
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,800
 scenario

262
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,480
 But I would be the point of having one nuclear missile in New York ready to launch and

263
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,800
 Hidden in a building

264
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,920
 New York's getting nuked anyways. It's not like it would be a total shock

265
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,640
 It's not like you'd like be able to save it for after the war or something like that

266
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,320
 Anyways, that was an old urban legend and there's at least one or two buildings in New York City that have a nuke in them

267
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
 It's a kind of an empty shell of a building

268
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,040
 so

269
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,240
 We have what we do have nuclear bases across the United States

270
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,360
 back in the 60s

271
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,960
 They were having reports the u.s. Air Force was getting reports from servicemen

272
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
 saying

273
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
 There's bright lights in the sky

274
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,800
 And our nuclear weapons deactivated

275
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,040
 Air Force command is like what are you talking? What are you talking about?

276
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,880
 Oh

277
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
 Servicemen there's bright lights in the sky. We see them

278
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,880
 They come through the perimeter

279
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,560
 And our missiles just get deactivated. So of course Air Force. It's like you guys are nuts. That's not happening

280
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,200
 And these kept popping up these stories kept popping up

281
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:49,120
 One of the stories we have a witness. It is Air Force captain robert salis c a l as

282
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,800
 He was at maelstrom air force base in montana

283
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,520
 And

284
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
 He hears

285
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,960
 So this that basically the security the base security tells him

286
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,480
 That we have a problem. There's some bright lights very high up and they're moving into our perimeter

287
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,800
 So everyone's freaking out. They don't know what's going on

288
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,720
 This is you know, not necessary. I guess it's like the height of the cold war 67 1967

289
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
 You see these bright lights moving overhead

290
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,960
 And what are you going to do you're going to open fire on them? You don't know what they are

291
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,920
 You don't know if they're us. You don't know if they're russian

292
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,520
 You don't know if it's uh

293
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,480
 Even if it's us if it's some sort of shadowy group, you know, who knows they don't know so they're not going to just open fire

294
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
 and what happens is

295
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,240
 10 of the icbms that

296
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,560
 captain salis

297
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
 Had control over

298
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,720
 Just all deactivated

299
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,160
 They all shut down now this testimony. He didn't give this in a smoke filled apartment while he's sitting in his recliner

300
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,400
 And you know with an iron lung counting these days down

301
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,720
 This is part of the disclosure project where he was at the national press club

302
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,640
 And they had a bunch of people coming out. I think the number was over a hundred of

303
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,240
 previous soldiers previous airmen

304
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,320
 A military personnel who were coming out. So this wasn't just him saying this

305
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,080
 Yeah, well, he taught okay, so here's an interesting

306
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
 This is funny

307
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,080
 So what I just said I just said 120 airmen and servicemen were testifying about this

308
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,120
 and then

309
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,160
 I the reason why i'm leaving this part in because I think this is important when we're talking about any stories like this

310
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,520
 I stated that as a fact. I read it on this website earlier. This is the actual this is the actual information

311
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
 so

312
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,560
 Okay, so here's here's what it said. So from what it looks like salis was at the

313
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,600
 National press club and I have watched footage of this and i'm going to post it up as well some other servicemen

314
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,160
 But originally I said there was 120 servicemen part of this

315
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,720
 That's not true. So hastens the ufo researcher robert hastens said he has talked to more than 120 former service members

316
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,880
 Who have seen ufo's near where nuclear weapons are stored and and tested

317
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,800
 Some of these incidents involved ufo's deactivating nuclear missiles

318
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,720
 So now we're talking third party again 120 people did not join the disclosure

319
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,600
 pro

320
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840
 120 people did not

321
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,080
 Join the disclosure program a man who makes his living

322
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,120
 Researching ufo's has talked to 120 people and they confirmed his story now. I'm not throwing

323
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,920
 I'm not saying he's a liar or anything like that, but

324
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,800
 The amount of proof the amount of evidence changes drastically versus 120 people coming forward

325
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,120
 Versus one person saying i've talked to 120 people because at best

326
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,680
 He's telling the truth and he did talk to them, but at worst he's making it up

327
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,480
 He's misinformed

328
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 He's exaggerating and all of those things and i'm not going to say which one is which because I don't know

329
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,480
 But I think it's interesting because and it chalk it up to my ignorance

330
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
 But I think it's important when we talk about conspiracy theories and paranormal stuff

331
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,320
 That too I watch a lot of these conspiracy videos and I listen to these podcasts and they will make blank and statements

332
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,760
 A very very common one is no one can go to antarctica. I've heard that multiple times

333
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,560
 No one can go to antarctica

334
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,960
 Nobody can go to antarctica and I heard that on maybe two different podcasts in maybe the span of three or four days

335
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,720
 I went home and googled that that is 100 not true

336
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,920
 There's like no only seven nations can go to antarctica and there's this treaty that bans anyone from going to antarctica. That's not true

337
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:54,320
 There are restrictions to going to antarctica. They don't want you to go in there and drilling for oil

338
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,600
 But if zanzibar

339
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,120
 Decided if they got their act together and had a good gdp

340
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,560
 And got all their finances in order and began to explore and they said hey, we want to go to antarctica

341
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,520
 There is no law preventing them from going to antarctica

342
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,400
 If you have the money you can charge a complaint to antarctica

343
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,800
 They may say hey, don't go super far inland because your plane is going to crash

344
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,280
 But you're not going to get shot down by f-18s

345
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,960
 It's flat out not true and I've heard multiple podcasts say you can't go to antarctica and and

346
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,480
 They got their facts wrong just like I got my facts wrong and I almost just kept going and if you're listening to this podcast

347
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,560
 And you never checked it out. You're like whoa 120 servicemen went to this one meeting and they all stood there and told their stories

348
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,840
 And that's just not true. But anyways, let's get back on topic

349
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,960
 I again, I'm going to call it out when I make mistakes too because again, it's important and then you know

350
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960
 They also quote a retired air force lieutenant colonel dwin amazon and again. This is important

351
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,760
 He comes out and says oh I in 1967 I was in montana and I saw a

352
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,040
 A message come over the wire saying nuclear weapons were disabled

353
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,280
 Well, you know, again, that's third party. I get it that you're in the military and he may have seen that message

354
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,360
 I'm not disputing

355
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,080
 Some of the facts here. It's funny because as I'm reading this story and this kind of happened with

356
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,800
 Um, and uh, what was the other consp- oh the titanic conspiracy is I'm reading this article

357
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,000
 I've heard about this story for a long time and as I'm reading this article

358
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,080
 I can feel like my skeptical

359
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,280
 Vibes picking up. So we have this article

360
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,520
 I read it over a few times. I'm very familiar with the story of

361
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,240
 UFOs being spotted over military bases and UFOs shutting down nuclear missiles

362
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:49,520
 But according to this story that story that I've been hearing for five to six years come really can be verified by only one person

363
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,480
 And that is captain salas

364
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
 Uh, lieutenant colonel aimson

365
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,720
 arnson

366
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
 Said that he saw wire message that it came through and then hastens is saying he talked to other men who have the story

367
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,760
 But they've never come forward. So the story I've been hearing for five years really

368
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,760
 Can only be verified by one person who says he was there when it happened

369
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,840
 Is it possible that he saw bright lights come overhead? Yes. Is it possible that the nuclear missiles were deactivated? Yes

370
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,960
 Is it possible that?

371
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,360
 The air force obviously saying this isn't a threat. This isn't a problem now

372
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,040
 I was kind of reading the story and I again I've heard about it. It's a fairly famous incident that they're doing this

373
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,960
 And it's not only happened in america. There's reports of it happening in

374
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,600
 britain and in

375
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
 russia

376
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
 But again, it's real sparse information. It's kind of the same level of evidence

377
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
 But I was hoping to do this story about UFOs, you know

378
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,760
 Flying over military bases and people were like, what is that and all of a sudden ring

379
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
 Like a light comes down like I imagine like this is 1960s light

380
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,080
 So the special effect is just a light fading on and off and people were like call the captain

381
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,160
 Should we shoot it down? No, sir. Ba da da da. They're just kind of like looking at stuff

382
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:12,720
 Their their vaginas are hanging off of their waist. The soldiers just still have swords in 1967 and they're looking up

383
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,600
 and then all of a sudden like

384
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,680
 Their Icbm's what's going on here get the

385
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,120
 President on the line. We got to figure out what's going on

386
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,240
 That's the story I wanted to tell

387
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,520
 And maybe it happened. Maybe it happened just like my 1960

388
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,200
 sci-fi movie brain wanted to have happened

389
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,080
 Do okay here. Let's do this. Let's get this let's get this episode back into

390
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,040
 Hopefully conspiracy land. Do I think this happened?

391
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:57,200
 Man, I really just can't do I think this happened based on the information that I've read about

392
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,920
 and this article

393
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:10,960
 Well, you know here let's end it like this. I'm not going to worry so much about debunking it

394
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,160
 I think everyone should go out and do their own own own information on this

395
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,760
 The resistance of light. I don't have any problem debunking

396
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,600
 There's some stuff that you just on the on the face of it is fake. It's fake. See, I think that's the difference

397
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,680
 I don't think this is necessarily fake. There's some of the details could be mismatched and we only have like one real eyewitness

398
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,360
 About this, but I do think this is interesting because when they talked to

399
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,280
 um lieutenant colonel Arneson

400
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,200
 He said

401
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,240
 He he they the article ends like this. He has many questions about these sightings. He goes

402
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,000
 Are they extraterrestrial? Who knows? Are they from other dimensions? Who knows? Are they from underneath the earth? Who knows?

403
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,240
 Your guess is as good as mine

404
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,600
 And I think that's how we're gonna have to wrap that story up because I can't come out and say this is 100 fake

405
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,520
 I don't have

406
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,200
 Then full knowledge based on that. I've done reading on this, but I

407
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,080
 Don't have a full knowledge based on this story or on really anything

408
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,960
 So i'm not gonna come out and debunk it. There will be other like the anthony bordain thing

409
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,600
 I think that that was just a tragic event

410
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,320
 And I'll debunk that

411
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,560
 I don't believe that he was murdered

412
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,640
 this story i'm going to put in the

413
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,000
 I'm going to put it in the possible category honestly, and I think that when you have someone going, I don't know what it is either when you have a

414
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,440
 Uh retired air force colonel lieutenant colonel going height

415
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,280
 I don't know they could be from another dimension. They could be from underwater. Who knows your guess is as good as mine

416
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,680
 Sometimes stories have to end like that

417
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,120
 Sometimes stories aren't going to have conclusive evidence and they're going to have an alien footprint or a bigfoot hair

418
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,560
 You're just going to have to go from that that might be true

419
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,560
 Again like I was saying it depends on how much trust you you put into your source in the beginning

420
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,360
 And I'll trust these gentlemen unless i'm given information that says otherwise

421
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,320
 So I think we came back around on that. I was if I when I was going on there for a while

422
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,360
 I was like, oh

423
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,160
 Yeah, this story's a buzzkill, but no, I think it actually is hopeful because I think sometimes you can find

424
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,520
 You do have to just say it might be your guess is as good as mine

425
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
 It might sound like a cop-out answer, but I think saying if I had gone and said this is not true

426
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,240
 That's being ignorant and if I said, you know what despite all my misgivings, this is 100 true

427
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,040
 That's just being ignorant as well. They're just opposite sides of the scale

428
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,840
 We're going to go ahead and end

429
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,080
 This episode of dead rabbit radio right now

430
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:52,080
 My name is jason carpenter you can hit me up at dead rabbit radio at gmail.com. That's a preferred method of

431
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,640
 Communicating with me. You can also hit me up at twitter at jason o carpenter

432

 We have our facebook group that is facebook.com/dead rabbit radio

433
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,520
 Thinking about getting an instagram going on we have our youtube channel. That's under dead rabbit radio as well

434
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,760
 And we're basically taking these episodes and cutting them into smaller little portions

435
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,160
 So that's always nice to get a different audience

436
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,760
 A different audience there and tomorrow we'll be continuing

437
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,040
 Our food based conspiracy theories with a tasty yet tricky

438
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,440
 story

439
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
 Hope to see you guys back tomorrow. Have a great day

440
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
 Yeah
