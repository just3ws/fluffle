1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
 A series of FBI raids proves the power often lies behind the throne.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,800
 And then we take a look at the tragedy that happened this weekend at the Travis Scott

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,680
 concert in Texas.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,160
 Was it just mismanagement?

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,080
 Or was the entire event a satanic sacrifice today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:34,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,280
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,320
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,800
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest patron supporters.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,640
 He's running in, he's super excited to get this episode started.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,440
 Give it up for Mike Hall.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,120
 Give a round of applause to Mike.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,640
 Give you a salute, 21 gun salute.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
 Mike, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,240
 Hey, if you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,360
 Just tell your friends, tell your family about the podcast.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,440
 That really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,680
 Now Mike, I really like this episode because we got some breaking news stories.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,160
 Now I guess it's less exciting if you're in the future.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
 Six months from now, you're like, "Yawn."

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,080
 No, there's still good stories even if you're not alive right now.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,320
 But yeah, we got some interesting stuff.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,600
 I always love breaking news and not a lot of conspiracy content gets to do that nowadays.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,640
 So, Mike, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,920
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,160
 We are headed all the way out to Florida.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,560
 Mike's driving us out to Florida.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
 It's a long journey.

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,200
 This is such a bizarre story.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,400
 And I think that one of two things is going to happen.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,680
 This podcast will be completely removed because of this story.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
 And that'll be the end of it.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,480
 Or we'll be able to look back and go, "This is when the conspiracy theory really blew up."

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,920
 No, I'm not saying that this show is going to make the conspiracy theory blow up.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,640
 But what I'm seeing right now is the growth of a massive, massive conspiracy theory.

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,400
 Right now it's a little pimple, right?

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,920
 It's a little pimple on the face of history.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,560
 Will it become a blackhead?

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,920
 Will it just become a giant erupting pus bubble?

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,440
 We don't know yet.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
 So let's go ahead and get started.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,640
 Let's also end the disgusting analogies.

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,160
 I hope you are not eating vanilla pudding.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,400
 It's 2019.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,040
 And in Florida, there is a young woman named Ashley Biden.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
 This is of the Biden family.

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,680
 This is Joe Biden's daughter.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,960
 And she is in a rehab clinic in Florida.

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,880
 And she's 39 at the time.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,720
 And part of her rehab is to keep a diary.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
 In this diary.

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
 Supposedly.

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,840
 So let me back up a bit here and kind of give this some context.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,720
 In October 2020, there was a really, really obscure right-wing political website called

57
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,200
 National File.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,560
 And they said, "We have a copy of Ashley Biden's diary."

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,480
 He gave it to us because they felt that their media bosses, they obtained it somehow.

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,960
 They felt that their media bosses wouldn't publish a story, so they gave it to us, the

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 National File.

62
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,240
 And we will publish this 39-year-old's diary that she wrote while she was in a drug rehab

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
 center.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,480
 Here you go.

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,840
 And they released this diary about a week or two before the 2020 election.

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,800
 I read a lot of political stuff.

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
 And I read a ton of political conspiracy theories.

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,480
 I just never talk about them on the show.

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,360
 But I never heard of the National File.

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
 I never heard of this group at all.

71
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
 They published this article.

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,160
 It did not get covered by anyone else in the mainstream media, in the left-wing media,

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,000
 in the right-wing media even.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,680
 Nobody covered this story.

75
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,080
 And so it was basically this website saying they had Ashley Biden's diary.

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,040
 And you look at it, they had scanned pages of it.

77
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,200
 And it's handwriting.

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
 And it's saying this stuff.

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,480
 And you're like, "That's horrible if this is true."

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,360
 But at the end of the last page of the diary, basically, because I was flipping through

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,400
 it, the last page of the diary is basically like, "And that's my diary.

82
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
 Who?

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
 It's good old me.

84
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
 Ashley Biden.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
 Yep.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
 Don't do this to me.

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
 I'm going to sign this."

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
 And you're like, "This looks fake."

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
 And it's coming out a week before the election.

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,160
 And it makes some really damning allegations, one in specific against her father.

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,920
 But you're like, "This is obviously a forgery.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,200
 It's a dirty trick.

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,240
 These things are as old as politics themselves."

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
 And it came out.

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
 Nobody read it.

96
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,040
 Nobody went to the website.

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
 Election happens.

98
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,400
 Joe Biden becomes president.

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
 Still no one reads National File.

100
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,600
 Still no one's reading this diary.

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,800
 And it just kind of becomes one of their daily articles that just keeps moving further, further

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 back in the past.

103
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,240
 A dirty trick gone wrong.

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
 And that's where it would have remained.

105
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,240
 And that's where even people who are super into conspiracy theories and spend a good

106
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,240
 bulk of their time reading conspiracy theories never, ever would have heard about Ashley

107
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,760
 Biden's diary.

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,640
 And what it suggests is there's a passage and it says she's listing all the things that

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,920
 she think led her to be hyper-sexualized as a child.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,360
 This 39-year-old woman's in rehab and she's looking back and she's listing these things.

111
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,280
 The one, they're all horrible, right?

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,880
 It's all horrible when children are in these terrible environments.

113
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,200
 But the one that is politically applicable is the statement, quote, "showers with my

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,960
 dad."

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,560
 And then in parentheses she wrote, "probably not appropriate."

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,120
 Dirty trick, right?

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,920
 And that's where this would have remained.

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,360
 This would have even to the most devout political conspiracy theory aficionados never would

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:08,800
 have heard of this until on November 4th, a year later, after all of this stuff happened,

120
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:18,080
 the FBI begins kicking down doors going, "Where is Ashley Biden's diary?"

121
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,960
 They went to Project Veritas, which is a right-wing media outlet and they do a lot of undercover

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,760
 work and their founder and two other people had, the FBI showed up at their houses on

123
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,840
 November 3rd and November 4th saying, "Where's the diary?

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,200
 Where's Ashley Biden's diary?"

125
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,320
 So the FBI are saying this diary was stolen.

126
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,960
 Now Project Veritas, which did not publish the diary, there are a much bigger media outlet

127
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
 than the other one.

128
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,400
 I don't have a name national file.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,420
 They said, we didn't know whether or not it was true, there was some salacious stuff

130
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,960
 in there, we didn't want to publish it.

131
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,320
 Also we weren't really sure on the, you can see the FBI says it was stolen from Ashley

132
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
 Biden.

133
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,280
 Project Veritas goes, "We were told that the diary was left in a common place like a hotel

134
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,760
 room and someone else checked in the hotel room so it wasn't, there was no break-in,

135
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,600
 but Project Veritas goes, "We weren't going to publish it."

136
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,000
 So we decided to try to get a hold of Ashley's lawyer so we could try to facilitate a way

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
 for her to get it back.

138
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,640
 Because I guess there everyone is just being sent screenshots.

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,440
 So Project Veritas chose not to publish it, national file did, no one read the article,

140
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,480
 nobody knew this existed.

141
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,080
 And even if you knew it existed, even if you had read the national file article, even Project

142
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,320
 Veritas, they're like, "We don't know how much of it's true."

143
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,360
 And you didn't until the FBI showed up at their door and said, "Where's the diary?"

144
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,440
 So this is the conspiracy theory here.

145
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,840
 If the allegations are true, that's absolutely awful, obviously.

146
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,680
 I don't want to sugarcoat that.

147
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,640
 But it's removing that, removing the politics from everything.

148
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,000
 I want to look at the conspiracy theory part of this.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,960
 This is a unforced error.

150
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,760
 The FBI, by acknowledging they're looking for the diary, acknowledge the diary exists

151
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,160
 and it's real.

152
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
 That's the same thing.

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,080
 They acknowledge that it's real.

154
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,200
 That's what the FBI's doing.

155
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,440
 And if they had done nothing or local law enforcement, because it's really this type

156
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,440
 of theft, federal, local law enforcement do it, FBI makes some phone calls, have some

157
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,040
 goons show up, Reflete Project Veritas wears the diary.

158
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,720
 But by the FBI doing this, it became a national story.

159
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,280
 They were talking about it on Fox.

160
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,800
 They're like, "Oh, now people are looking for this diary."

161
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,240
 And it is two, three clicks away before you find out what the diary says.

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,680
 So was it an unforced error to the FBI?

163
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,880
 They didn't need to do this, right?

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,680
 No, and no one believed that the diary was real in the first place by them investigating

165
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
 it.

166
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,040
 Now people are reading the diary.

167
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,280
 For the national file used to just publish in the excerpts and no one is reading them.

168
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,320
 And now they've published all 112 pages.

169
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,120
 And let's also say for a bit here, it's absolutely disgusting to be publishing somebody's diary.

170
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,440
 Like I don't want to sugarcoat that either.

171
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,760
 I actually debated a lot over whether or not to even reveal any information in the diary,

172
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,680
 but I had to add some context.

173
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,760
 But I read, I did read a lot of the diary, I've read it, but it's awful that they were

174
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,840
 publishing it in the first place.

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,880
 Here's my thing, and this is where we come to.

176
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,920
 This was not an unforced error, this is my theory.

177
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:38,320
 Everyone in the "deep state" or multiple people are trying to take Biden down.

178
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
 If not take him down completely, take him down a couple notches.

179
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,720
 They didn't have to do this.

180
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,600
 And when we talk about the deep state, it's really interesting.

181
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,520
 That is a term that's been around since I was a kid.

182
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,000
 They would go by deep state or shadow government.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,520
 The people truly pulling the levers of power.

184
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,960
 It became more pop culture in the past five years.

185
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,360
 But all it is, is, think about it this way.

186
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,960
 Imagine if at your job, your boss quit every four to eight years.

187
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,640
 And you could work, they could never work more than eight years at the company no matter

188
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,440
 how well they were doing, but you started when you were 18, you could work 40 years,

189
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,520
 you could work 50 years there.

190
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
 Who really has more power?

191
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,320
 Who has more alliances?

192
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,920
 Like sure, that dude is on television, that president, that senator, whatever is on television.

193
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,720
 But the people, the accountants, it doesn't even have to be something super sexy like

194
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
 the CIA, FBI, polling strings.

195
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,120
 It could be your accounting division.

196
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,680
 It can be all sorts of stuff.

197
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,440
 The postmaster general.

198
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,640
 You can have all these other players that people aren't paying attention to.

199
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,040
 And they're building alliances that last decades.

200
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,120
 Nobody knew who Barack Obama was until he was like a state senator.

201
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,680
 And then he's the president.

202
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,040
 And now he's Netflix.

203
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,960
 But he didn't have all that time to build up all that political power.

204
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,960
 And I'd say even now there are people working in DC that are more powerful than Barack Obama

205
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,360
 ever was, or Trump ever was, or Biden ever was.

206
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,840
 And these people know how to pull the strings of power.

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,360
 So my prediction, this conspiracy theory just popped up.

208
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,440
 The rates just took place on November 4th.

209
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
 It's three days later.

210
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,040
 And it's starting to go viral.

211
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,680
 So this could be a huge thing if the people in the media start pushing it.

212
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,760
 Like the people in the adversarial or right wing media, whatever you want to call them,

213
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,680
 to Biden start pushing it.

214
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,080
 The other side will say it's not real, but the front of the FBI is looking for it.

215
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
 It's fascinating.

216
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:56,680
 Somebody, somebody deep within that entire power structure in DC made this call to do

217
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,180
 this.

218
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,480
 And it's not a good look.

219
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 I knew nothing of these allegations.

220
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,880
 And there will be hundreds of thousands of people who never knew anything about this

221
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,720
 or that the diary existed or that it was published until the FBI went knocking on doors.

222
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 Fascinating story.

223
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,520
 And this is, I love looking at conspiracy theories obviously, but when we start to see

224
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,000
 them, these are levers going in action.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,160
 This isn't us having a disaster and then watching a movie that came out in 2003 and

226
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,760
 saying predictive programming.

227
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,960
 We're watching people pull levers right now that are causing real world chaos.

228
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,840
 Fascinating stuff for any conspiracy theorist to see this.

229
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,920
 You have, there's just so many layers to this.

230
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,300
 You have the horrible allegations, which will basically be a true crime.

231
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,640
 And then you have conspiracy on top of conspiracy.

232
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
 Did the diary exist?

233
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
 How did it get stolen?

234
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,080
 Oh, the diary does exist.

235
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
 The FBI is looking for it.

236
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,640
 Who ordered the FBI to do this?

237
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
 Why are they looking for it now?

238
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,720
 Why is it a federal case?

239
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,560
 Fascinating, fascinating dissection for any true crime enthusiast.

240
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,400
 I don't know if the allegations in the diary are true.

241
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
 Obviously, hopefully not.

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
 Right?

243
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 Hopefully not.

244
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,640
 And you know, you would hope that the diary was fake.

245
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,420
 But it did not exist in anyone's mind until the FBI started knocking on doors.

246
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,260
 Super bizarre story.

247
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,740
 And, I mean, it's just been a crazy week because, Mike, let's go ahead and toss you

248
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,900
 the keys to the Carbonercopter.

249
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,500
 We are leaving behind Florida.

250
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,460
 We're headed all the way out to Texas.

251
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:43,120
 We're in a weird state with conspiracy theory content right now because two things are happening

252
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
 at the exact same time.

253
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,680
 One, established long-term conspiracy stuff like conspiracy theory communities growing.

254
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,080
 We're going to start seeing the end to that because YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 going to be trying to block that stuff.

256
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,120
 They don't want a rehash of the Q movement.

257
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,300
 They don't want a rehash of these groups popping up and them not doing anything for months

258
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,500
 and years and so on and so forth.

259
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
 Same thing with Flat Earth.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,580
 Anything that you have these conspiracy theories at the mainstream media, they're like, "Huh,

261
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,080
 not this again."

262
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,120
 They've put mechanisms in place to kind of make it so your algorithm doesn't flood you

263
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,580
 with that type of content.

264
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,540
 However, so that's happening.

265
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,700
 And I've been noticing that.

266
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,460
 The big conspiracy theories that already exist, they're going to be here for a while.

267
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,840
 The new ones, they're not given a lot of chance to grow, but at the same time we're seeing

268
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,920
 conspiracy theories pop up so quickly after the event, so quickly, and it is going to

269
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,200
 have this whack-a-mole effect.

270
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,840
 They're not going to be allowed as much chance to grow these new conspiracy theories, but

271
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,880
 this Travis Scott concert, this was kind of my evolution through it and probably similar

272
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,320
 to a lot of what you guys went through.

273
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,600
 Mike Hall is flying us around the carbon helicopter.

274
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,060
 We're going to land, we're going to try to render aid at this concert.

275
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,100
 And I guess if you don't know, you're like, "Oh, Travis Scott is my favorite musician,

276
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,700
 but I've been asleep for the past three days."

277
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,540
 Let's build the scene here a bit in case you don't know.

278
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,300
 Just this weekend, it was just on Friday, it was November 5th.

279
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,460
 In Houston, Texas, there was the Astro World Festival.

280
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,220
 Apparently, this has gone on for a couple years.

281
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,500
 And it's a big music festival.

282
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,780
 This was supposed to be on November 5th and 6th.

283
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,480
 It was Friday and Saturday.

284
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,160
 The very first day of this music festival, the place is already at capacity.

285
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:40,600
 By 2pm in the afternoon, hundreds of people started to storm into the VIP area.

286
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,000
 So the VIP area isn't like a velvet rope and it's like a seating area in the back of the

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 stage.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,600
 It's basically like this giant stage area.

289
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,640
 So I mean, you did have a lot of people already there.

290
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,980
 I think it was just the VIP section you were closer to the stage.

291
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,780
 So you had hundreds of people break into the VIP area where they had already said there's

292
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,540
 going to be this many people in this area.

293
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,100
 Now you have hundreds more.

294
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,220
 Now I don't really know anything about Travis Scott.

295
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,260
 I know Fortnite and then McDonald's and then he's a musician.

296
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,220
 I've listened to more Travis Scott music over the past 48 hours than I have before.

297
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,580
 But Travis Scott, super popular.

298
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:25,200
 And apparently in previous shows he's encouraged people to like, "Everyone rush up to the stage.

299
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,800
 It's just chaos."

300
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
 He encourages chaos at his shows.

301
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,800
 So the people are breaking into the VIP area.

302
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,720
 He's not on stage at this point, but it's kind of, this is the type of audience, this

303
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,800
 riled up, a bunch of Tasmanian devils locked into a little room audience.

304
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,880
 You had a bunch of people breaking into this VIP area.

305
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,020
 By 9pm, you've already started having people getting injured.

306
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,180
 But by 9pm when Travis Scott takes the stage, and I'm going to stop right here, I may have

307
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,100
 called him Travis Walton more than once.

308
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,740
 That's the guy from "Fire in the Sky."

309
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,740
 If I did that, I apologize.

310
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,380
 Travis Walton had nothing to do with any of this, but Travis Scott gets on stage and

311
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,140
 there's just a massive surge of people.

312
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,260
 And people are getting crushed.

313
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,460
 People are getting knocked down, trampled.

314
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,560
 People are dying.

315
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,600
 They're just dying while this concert's going on.

316
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:28,040
 And there's tons of footage coming out of people trying to stop the show, trying to

317
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,960
 climb up on, there's one horrible video of a woman, a young girl, yelling at a cameraman

318
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,360
 trying to get him to stop the show.

319
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,920
 She goes, "There's people dead down here.

320
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
 There's a dead guy right down here, stop the show."

321
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,360
 And the cameraman's like trying to wave her off in awe as of now.

322
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,300
 It's only been a couple days, but as of now we have eight people dead.

323
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,940
 Twenty-three people were taken to the hospital, eleven of those from heart attacks, and a

324
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,420
 total of three hundred people treated with injuries at the site of the event.

325
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,780
 So it's being considered a mass casualty event.

326
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,140
 And they were completely understaffed like medical wise.

327
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,600
 But minutes after people were leaving the show, this is very, very fascinating, something

328
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,800
 that social media can grant us, people were, obviously we have videos and footage, we have

329
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,240
 some horrifying footage of dead people at the show.

330
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,960
 Within minutes, hours after the show ends, you started to see people say, "This was not

331
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,720
 an accident.

332
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,560
 This wasn't brought about because Travis Walton, damn it, this wasn't brought about

333
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,400
 because Travis Scott, Travis Walton.

334
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,180
 He has enough problems, aliens are chasing him down.

335
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:48,140
 This isn't because Travis Scott was riling up the crowd, it wasn't because of poor management

336
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,900
 at the park, they didn't have enough emergency personnel and they didn't stop the rush of

337
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
 people.

338
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,740
 This was a satanic ceremony.

339
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,860
 That Travis Scott was doing this on purpose.

340
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,100
 Fascinating, fascinating, it's just such a quick turnaround for this conspiracy theory.

341
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
 So let's take a look.

342
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,040
 So we have the baseline, we have the facts.

343
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,240
 Except for one, I actually saved one fact.

344
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,360
 We'll take, we'll look at that in a second.

345
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,280
 We have the basic facts of the story.

346
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,240
 But we start to see all these posts on Twitter, on Facebook, everywhere.

347
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
 This was a satanic ritual.

348
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,600
 And they were saying when the crush, the initial crush first started happening, I can't verify

349
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 this, right?

350
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
 I wasn't there.

351
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,040
 But there was a, their portal, right?

352
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,940
 Not like there was a picture of a portal, right?

353
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
 You're like, whoa, was this in the news?

354
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
 No.

355
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,020
 They're like the background stage was of a black hole when the crush first started, like

356
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,540
 it was welcoming in the souls.

357
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,500
 And the opening song was called Escape Plan, which apparently is like escaping from your

358
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 body.

359
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 That's a bit of a stroke.

360
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,340
 And this one's so interesting about these is that some of them you're going to go, oh,

361
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,500
 that does sound a weird.

362
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,700
 Why would a human react like that when there's so much human suffering going on around them?

363
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,680
 But other ones you're like, well, okay, anyways, he was singing the song Escape Plan when it

364
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
 first started.

365
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,440
 So maybe that was them supposed to be escaping from their bodies.

366
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,720
 There's video footage of an ambulance, an ambulance, mind you, has the sirens, has the

367
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 little flashing lights.

368
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,360
 You can't hear anything at these concerts, right?

369
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,800
 It's trying to get through a crowd of people.

370
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,820
 There's like 50,000 people at this event and this entire area is completely packed in.

371
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,420
 This ambulance is trying to get through the crowd of people.

372
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,140
 And Travis Scott is like, oh, hey, guys, what's up?

373
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,420
 You guys having a good time out there?

374
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,620
 He's actually telling them, put your middle finger up in the air, guys.

375
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,580
 Put your middle finger up in the air.

376
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,580
 Hold it to the sky.

377
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,380
 And people are like, dude, there's an ambulance right here.

378
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,020
 You want to stop this show?

379
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,740
 And then two guys kind of walk up to him and they start talking to him.

380
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,800
 And he ended like two of his crew members.

381
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,080
 He goes, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

382
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,240
 And they're thinking, oh, did they say, hey, Travis, this is cool show.

383
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,160
 Although we might want to make room for the ambulance and he just blew them off.

384
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,680
 We don't know.

385
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,320
 But based on what happens next, he goes, put both your hands in the air.

386
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,880
 Put both your hands in the air.

387
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,040
 People are like, what?

388
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,080
 And people weren't doing it, right?

389
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
 People were doing it.

390
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 They're like, I'm not in the ambulance.

391
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,520
 It's not my problem.

392
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,960
 And then Travis starts the next song as an ambulance is stuck surrounded by his fans,

393
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,340
 having them chanting for him to stop the show.

394
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,660
 The other half cheering him on.

395
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:47,100
 As there's an ambulance trapped in all of these people, he has his two crew members

396
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,900
 stage dive into the crowd.

397
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,980
 And they start, I mean, it's so ridiculous.

398
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,860
 They start surfing the crowd.

399
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,400
 And you're like, what?

400
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,040
 This is what's so interesting about this conspiracy theory.

401
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,800
 On the one hand, that's on video.

402
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,960
 That is on video.

403
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
 On one hand, I have all of it in the show notes.

404
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,080
 On the one hand, the conspiracy theories really seem to reach sometimes.

405
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,240
 Like they're like, oh, his entrance to Astro World was his head.

406
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,680
 And that also looks like this old painting of Satan's head.

407
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,560
 And you're like, yeah, they both have mouths.

408
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,820
 Maybe they both have open mouths that you can walk through.

409
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,180
 And then you have a dude watching an ambulance trapped by a bunch of people.

410
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,820
 And he's like, one, two, three, four.

411
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,780
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

412
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
 He's like, everyone jump.

413
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
 Jump.

414
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
 They're all jumping on the hood of the ambulance.

415
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,940
 Like, I mean, like, it's clearly an emergency going on.

416
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,860
 And of course, all of these footage, all these other YouTube videos have shown up there.

417
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,800
 Like this is what bands should do when you need to stop a show and there was like really

418
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,480
 cool footage of all these other bands like stopping the show and being like, hey, guys,

419
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
 can you get someone over here?

420
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,680
 I think that guy's passed down.

421
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
 People are stomping on his head.

422
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
 People get rescued.

423
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,200
 So there's a lot of people stop shows, right?

424
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,920
 A lot of people stop shows.

425
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
 But he continues to do this show.

426
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,480
 And then there's another video of him.

427
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 This it does.

428
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,560
 It looks a little demonic.

429
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,060
 And you know me, like, it's so funny.

430
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,180
 When I started this story, I go, oh, that's weird.

431
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,060
 People are already trying to take this tragedy and turn it into something.

432
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,060
 And I won't really say where I sit on the fence just yet.

433
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,500
 I'll kind of say that at the end.

434
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,100
 But as I'm watching this stuff and I'm like, oh, yeah, you know, the big face, walking

435
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
 through the mouth, whatever.

436
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
 I do that every Saturday.

437
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,720
 I was like, hey, whose mouth am I going to walk through tonight?

438
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,620
 But then I'd come across footage of people stage diving into this disaster zone.

439
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:50,040
 And then there's another one where he's standing on this platform that's probably like 20 feet

440
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,160
 above maybe 15 feet above the audience.

441
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 And it's just him.

442
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,600
 He's standing up there.

443
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,080
 And he has this auto tune.

444
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,000
 He sings with the auto tune thing.

445
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,600
 And there's someone filming it in the audience.

446
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,860
 And they're filming a man who is deceased or unconscious.

447
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,180
 And then the camera, the person turns the camera up to Travis Scott.

448
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,420
 And he's clearly looking at this guy.

449
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
 No, it's not.

450
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,940
 You're like, Jason, you know, concerts are chaotic places.

451
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,180
 He's being carried out by medical personnel.

452
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,620
 People are picking his prone body up and carrying it.

453
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,620
 He's not having fun.

454
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,540
 He's not a beach ball.

455
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,240
 And Travis Scott is clearly looking at this guy and he sees everyone step aside.

456
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,400
 He sees the people come in.

457
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 They pick him up.

458
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
 He's not moving.

459
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,560
 It doesn't look like he's sleeping.

460
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,920
 It looks like he's dead.

461
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,840
 And they carry him out and then the camera goes back up and Travis Scott is looking at

462
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
 the whole thing.

463
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,040
 He's like, what are we gonna do, honey?

464
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,640
 And they're like, dude, seriously, you're just going to sing?

465
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,740
 And there's another video that's been popping up.

466
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,380
 Travis Scott stopped the show mid song because someone stole his shoe.

467
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,220
 And then for the next three minutes, just yelling at his private security guards and

468
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,700
 the surrounding fans to murder him.

469
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:27,740
 To be fair, he didn't say murder, but he did ask 10,000 random strangers to fm up, fm

470
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,460
 up, fm up over and over and over and over again.

471
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,920
 And he did eventually stop the show.

472
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,880
 And some people say that the concert promoter stopped the show or he stopped the show.

473
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,640
 So the show does not go on to this day.

474
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,760
 And if you walk into Astro World on a gloomy Saturday afternoon, you may still hear Travis

475
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,960
 Scott auto-tuned in the darkness.

476
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,320
 They did stop the show eventually and that's when they started being able to access these

477
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,680
 bodies, a lot of these bodies.

478
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
 So people did die.

479
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,240
 This is what's interesting about this.

480
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 People did die.

481
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,300
 There was imagery that you could say was Satanic.

482
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,340
 And again, like he had a bunch of fire coming out of the stage.

483
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,740
 That's pretty typical with shows.

484
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,020
 I don't think just having fire makes you Satanic.

485
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,980
 Some person said Astro World means Astro as in Star, which Star is like the Morning Star,

486
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,860
 which is like Lucifer.

487
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,300
 So then they said it should have been called Lucifer World.

488
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
 That's not helping.

489
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,220
 I mean, like, if you really believe this is a Satanic ritual, that's not evidence, right?

490
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,040
 That's not helping the cause.

491
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,320
 Now, so here's the question.

492
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,000
 Do I believe it was a Satanic ritual?

493
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,600
 We're all allowed to make up our own minds, right?

494
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 You can agree with me or disagree with me.

495
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,480
 But do I believe it was a Satanic ritual?

496
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,440
 Well, let me break that in half here for a second.

497
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,280
 Let's kind of discuss the pieces and we'll wrap it up like this.

498
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:00,200
 You have this weird thing with fame that we talked about this before with like cell intersoles

499
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,900
 the devil to become famous and things like that.

500
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,260
 What I've heard of in the past, and I believe a lot of people when they say I sold my soul,

501
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,580
 they mean it as a metaphor.

502
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,460
 Like they started doing stuff that they wouldn't have done normally to gain power.

503
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,100
 But if you do take the literal thing of selling your soul to the devil, there is always that

504
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,500
 thing that the price comes cheap in the beginning.

505
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,740
 Maybe at first they go, "Yeah, I'll sell my soul for fame because what does it matter

506
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
 for eternity?

507
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,100
 I want to be rich and famous now."

508
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
 And so you do that.

509
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,040
 But then once you have a taste of that fame and that wealth and that power, then the bill

510
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,320
 really comes a-knockin'.

511
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,440
 And that's when the Lucifer, the devil shows up and renegotiates the terms.

512
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,640
 "Hey, I can't do that.

513
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
 You can't do that, man.

514
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,640
 We signed a contract."

515
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,400
 And that's when the devil goes, "Ha ha ha ha ha.

516
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,320
 That was just the contract for the contract."

517
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,720
 And he pulls out a new one.

518
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,100
 This is pretty common in the lore when we talk about Satanic deals, where at first you

519
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,080
 just sold your soul, but now to continue to be famous, you have to sacrifice people close

520
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,300
 to you.

521
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,740
 Whether or not, I've heard that both in literature and in people who have said they've actually

522
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,620
 sold their soul to the devil.

523
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,620
 People who are like, "That was not a metaphor.

524
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
 That was not a metaphor.

525
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,180
 I mean, totally accurate."

526
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:16,340
 And it could be something like that, right?

527
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:19,660
 On our scale, we're going to put that as the least likely one.

528
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,820
 The least likely one.

529
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,700
 But that's kind of what the conspiracy theory is saying, is that Travis Scott causes Satanic

530
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
 ritual.

531
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,920
 I personally believe if there was a Satanic ritual there, did he have anything to do with

532
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
 it?

533
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
 I don't know.

534
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,520
 He definitely could have shut the concert off earlier.

535
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,480
 You could argue with 50,000 people there.

536
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
 It's really hard to tell what's going on.

537
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,480
 Jason, maybe he didn't really know.

538
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,600
 He stopped the concert after three or four songs or whatever it was.

539
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,120
 And maybe, maybe.

540
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,160
 But then we have, we're going to break it up into three.

541
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,760
 I forgot what the other two was.

542
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,080
 That was the first one, then.

543
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,160
 He actually was doing a Satanic ritual.

544
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:01,620
 Oh, and then the second one was that I used to be a musician a long time ago.

545
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:09,300
 And I find the relationship between a musician and the audience super, super bizarre.

546
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,620
 Where you are deified.

547
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,660
 That's why you are up on a stage.

548
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,380
 Or if you're, if there's not a stage, if you're at like a smaller venue, there's like this

549
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,260
 clearing in front of you.

550
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,280
 Go Jason, that's because all your equipment and everything like that.

551
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
 That's part of it.

552
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,440
 But if you've ever been on stage in any sort of performing aspect, I've acted way more

553
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,840
 than I've done music.

554
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,520
 But when you're performing in any sort of way, you are elevated.

555
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,440
 And I don't think it's a good thing.

556
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,040
 But you're elevated above the rest.

557
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,120
 And if it's not physically elevated on a stage, which it generally is, you have basically

558
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,900
 a cleansed area where you are deified.

559
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,340
 And I don't like that part of it.

560
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,740
 I didn't like it as a performer.

561
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,180
 And I don't like it as an audience member either.

562
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,660
 I'm not saying I don't want to be standing next to G.G. Allen while he's pooping, right?

563
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,300
 But there is this weird separation between the artist and the audience.

564
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,180
 And I get that it's a safety thing.

565
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,580
 But is it a safety thing?

566
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,940
 Or is it because they're so fanatical over you?

567
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:21,840
 Like does music create the problem in the first place?

568
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,680
 It's just a really interesting thing.

569
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,360
 So I think, and it was interesting because as I was reading this, a lot of people were

570
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,440
 saying that concerts in and of themselves are satanic rituals.

571
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,840
 And I don't believe in that.

572
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,040
 I don't believe in that.

573
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,720
 But I do believe concerts in and of themselves are rituals.

574
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,600
 It's 100%.

575
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,480
 When you go to see a musical act, specifically, plays are a bit different.

576
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,140
 But when you go to see a musical act, you are going to a ritual.

577
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,340
 You are going to have a religious experience if it is a band you like.

578
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,740
 If it's a band you hate and you were dragged there by someone, you're like, oh man.

579
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,820
 But then that's when you become their antichrist.

580
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,860
 That's when you start stalking that band.

581
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,620
 But it is a religious experience and they're actually elevated and the fire and the lights

582
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,700
 and the noise and all of this stuff.

583
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,860
 And I didn't like it as a musician.

584
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,080
 It was super weird.

585
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,920
 It's the same way why I may slip up from time to time, but I never, ever call you guys fans.

586
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,520
 I don't like, I don't consider you a fan of my work.

587
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,640
 I'll use the term listener.

588
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,000
 So on the second, so on the second thing that I do think that music and concerts in particular

589
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,800
 are ritualistic and you can have good rituals and you can have bad rituals.

590
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,640
 You can have rituals that uplift.

591
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,180
 You can have rituals that cause chaos.

592
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,700
 And I'm not, there are some people who love chaos.

593
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,540
 If you're into heavy metal, if you're into death metal and you like to go to crazy concerts

594
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:55,820
 and thrash around and headbang and everything like that, that's totally fine.

595
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:02,380
 I'm not anti the chaos because those shows can all be done safely.

596
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,340
 Those shows you don't have to have crushes of people.

597
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,300
 But you have, you're going to have a chaotic ritual which still feels like a religious

598
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,760
 experience and you can have a very uplifting or the chaos can be uplifting.

599
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
 You know what I mean?

600
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,720
 There's different music for different people, but when you go to a concert, you are going

601
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,640
 to a ritual.

602
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,480
 So in that sense, it is interesting to think that this astral world was a two day magical

603
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,040
 ritual where people were going to be around like-minded people listening to music that

604
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,760
 infuses their soul with joy.

605
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,480
 I'm not a fan of Travis Scott.

606
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,760
 I mean, I can't remember his name.

607
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,260
 But there are millions of people who are.

608
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
 It's a ritual.

609
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
 So that's my second thing.

610
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,220
 But the last thing I want to talk about, it's a piece of information I left out earlier

611
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:55,340
 and we'll see if anything comes of this because right now this is really, really interesting

612
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,900
 and it ties back into the other two things we're talking about.

613
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:08,660
 If concerts are a ritual, I can go to a concert and perform satanic black magic and the singer

614
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,320
 not even know, right?

615
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,840
 I could go to a Travis Walton.

616
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:22,480
 I could go to a Travis Scott concert and let him get all that energy whipped up.

617
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,440
 Get him that frenetic, chaotic life force.

618
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,640
 He's sucking it towards him.

619
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:37,480
 He's creating this vortex and I do the ritual unbeknownst to him.

620
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,180
 I do the ritual.

621
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,660
 I make the sacrifices as of today.

622
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,540
 So it's only been two days since this happened, but this is being reported by the local law

623
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,780
 enforcement.

624
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:59,620
 They believe that someone was walking through the crowd with a hypodermic needle and injecting

625
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,180
 people with it.

626
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,560
 There's a story that there was a security guard and a medical technician standing there

627
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,440
 and the security guard felt a prick on the back of his neck and he told the medical examiner,

628
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,920
 "Ah, I just got something poked me in the back of the neck."

629
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,080
 And while the medical examiner was looking at them, the security guard collapsed and they

630
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:30,640
 administered Narcan, which is an anti-opioid, and he revived them.

631
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:37,300
 So the question is, these people who had heart attacks, were they murder victims?

632
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,380
 Was someone walking around injecting this stuff into them?

633
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,420
 Now you can have a heart attack from being crushed.

634
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,540
 You can have a heart attack from being trampled.

635
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:52,940
 But we have eight people dead and then other than those 18 people and other 11 people with

636
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,940
 cardiac arrest and 23 people in total in the hospital.

637
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,720
 So we'll see what comes of that story.

638
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,480
 That sounds awfully demonic to walk into a crowd of people reveling in their favorite

639
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,920
 music and murdering them one after another after another.

640
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,800
 And people were saying, "When a body would fall down, that made people panic and start

641
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:25,880
 moving around even more and hurting more people."

642
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,780
 So how many of these, is that an urban legend?

643
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,780
 Is that a way to kind of hand wave away safety concerns?

644
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,500
 They're like, it wasn't because, the reason why this happened wasn't because we weren't

645
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,860
 fully prepared with the right medical staff.

646
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,540
 It was because some lunatic was walking around with a needle.

647
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,220
 Like which one's scarier?

648
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,420
 Mismanagement and incompetence?

649
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,140
 Or that, or that crazy guy at the needle who's still out there?

650
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,020
 He's like, "All right, lullapalooza's coming up next."

651
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,360
 That's very demonic and that's actually, if you were that sinister, that is a good ploy.

652
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,760
 Not, I'm not advising you do this, but I could see someone who is a practitioner of the dark

653
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,920
 arts doing this, causing chaos, taking lives during this heightened emotional energy and

654
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,280
 then feeding off of that energy or saving it for later, saving it for some other ritual.

655
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,460
 But what I find, we're gonna wrap it up like this, the demonic, the spiritual coin, right?

656
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,100
 The spiritual balance of the universe.

657
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,300
 I found this story really, really fascinating.

658
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,940
 You flip that coin, you have demonic activity if we are assuming this guy was walking through

659
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,180
 the crowd stabbing people.

660
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,380
 There was a Twitter user going by the name of Madeline and she tells this story.

661
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,000
 She goes, "I was at Astro World and I had been at Astro World Festival before, but this

662
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,080
 time it just felt totally different.

663
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,840
 There was way too many people.

664
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
 Things were getting out of control."

665
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,600
 And she got crushed and she actually couldn't breathe and she passed out.

666
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,400
 She goes, "I found out after the fact that I had passed out in the audience and my friend

667
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:13,040
 and a bunch of random strangers, crowdsurfed my unconscious body over to this fenced off

668
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,580
 area where there were some EMTs."

669
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,740
 And she goes, "What I remember was being in the audience realizing things had gone way

670
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:26,220
 too south and I have no idea what's going on and then I'm sitting in a tent with a bottle

671
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,740
 of water between my legs like she was completely unconscious and as she's coming to, she sees

672
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:41,220
 bodies lined up in this EMT area and people are doing CPR."

673
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:51,640
 She's an EMT and she puts that bottle of water down and immediately starts saving lives.

674
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:56,320
 One of the first things she does is she sees people doing CPR in this dead person and she

675
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,840
 checks their pulse and goes, "Move on to the next one."

676
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
 These they were just random.

677
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,440
 She goes, "I saw teenagers trying to give CPR trying to bring people to life."

678
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,760
 And she goes, "Move on to the next one."

679
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
 She goes, "They didn't know.

680
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
 You checked the pulse?

681
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,900
 They don't have a pulse."

682
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
 Triage.

683
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,020
 Go to the next person.

684
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,500
 Get the people that you can.

685
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
 She starts coordinating supplies.

686
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,140
 She saved lives by being on that side of the fence.

687
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,420
 I found that such an interesting sight to this.

688
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:38,300
 Had she not gone unconscious, which I don't think she enjoyed, but had she not gone unconscious,

689
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,560
 had her friend and other strangers not carried her, she easily could have just died on the

690
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,400
 ground, right?

691
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,840
 They carried her over and dropped her off in this EMT area where her training helped her

692
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,800
 save lives.

693
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,160
 Not everyone's life, but some of them.

694
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,640
 Even while a mass casualty event is going on, even in the midst of a possible satanic

695
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,040
 ceremony, God can still send down some of his angels.

696
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:34,500
 And put them in the right place, where they need to be, to save lives.

697
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:54,500
 God bless you.

698
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,500
 God bless you.

699
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,080
 (upbeat music)
