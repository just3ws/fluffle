1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 A debate rages online.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,040
 Is there really a cannibal in Iowa?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,560
 And then we travel back in time to meet a man

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,640
 who is so adamant he has proof that Bigfoot exists.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,720
 He turns to an unlikely ally.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,680
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,800
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,880
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,360
 I hope you guys have an awesome weekend.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,320
 So our first story we're going to 4chan.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,600
 So sit down you're like Jason and brother not no sit down.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,720
 We're going to 4chan because this is where we have

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,160
 a bizarre exchange going on right now.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,880
 A man jumped on 4chan today and he said guys you won't believe what happened.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,040
 I had a conversation with a cannibal from Waterloo, Iowa.

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,120
 This is the conversation this guy logs into a meagle right.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,240
 What allows you to talk to random people you put in what you're interested in.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,760
 Other people put what they're interested in.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,600
 It just lets you chat to random people.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
 This guy supposedly gets a conversation here's some screenshots.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,040
 Well you can't see screenshots I'm going to read them to you.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,360
 Gets his conversation this how it starts off.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,160
 Our intrepid young conspiracy paranormal researcher whoever he is 4chan poster.

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,920
 Doesn't matter we'll call him Gary.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,120
 Gary is sitting there and this is the first message he gets hit up on Omegle.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,960
 Just out of the blue very first sentence.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
 Hello that's very polite I'm glad that the stranger's saying hello.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
 Hello would you like to be fattened up and eaten by a cannibal family?

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 Now this that's bizarre obviously.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,440
 This is actually the second conversation that Gary has with a cannibal.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,200
 In one day Gary came to 4chan he goes guys you won't believe it but

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
 I talked to a cannibal earlier and he told me all sorts of stuff that he belongs to this

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,800
 cannibal family in Iowa.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,320
 He wants to eat me he wants to see if I can eat fattened up but I don't have

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
 screenshots or any proof whatsoever and I'll never find the guy again.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,960
 But here's his kick which is another message now.

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,760
 And people immediately go whatever dude you got someone burned you in a drug deal.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,760
 They sold you like mushrooms off a pizza and told you that they would get you high

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,640
 and you've been eating them all day long and nothing's happening.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,800
 You're just trying to get someone in trouble and then he goes wait no no no no no no.

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800
 Hours later I found him again on the massive website on the massive messaging app known

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,640
 as Omegle against all odds I found him again and that was the screenshot I just read you.

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,640
 So not only did he find a cannibal twice in one day but the cannibal has no intro.

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
 Imagine you are just hanging out on Omegle.

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,680
 Now he put in that he is interested in death which is a very broad subject.

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
 Maybe you like the Sandman comic.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
 Maybe you enjoy Death's Head the other comic but with head at the end of it.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,120
 Or maybe you enjoy dying but there's a far cry between I enjoy death and hello would you

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
 like to be fattened up and eaten by a cannibal family.

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
 First thing the dude says.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,160
 Gary says perhaps.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,240
 Now that would ring if I was a cannibal and I was just hitting people up randomly

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,040
 saying hey yo you want to get fattened up and I can eat you.

56
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,360
 You're going to expect people to go the first thing they're going to go is what wait what

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,680
 huh what but if someone goes perhaps I'm going to assume they're a fed at least the city cop.

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,960
 And then the cannibal responds don't worry it'll be quick and painless end terrible grammar.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,080
 You would have figured that cannibals because they're eating all those brains would be a little

60
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,400
 bit smarter and then Gary responds really what's the process and then it just kind of goes on from

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,240
 there. The cannibal goes what's your height and weight and the Gary says six this is a lie.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:07,840
 Six feet point two five point two five inches so you're five foot eleven like I don't understand

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,120
 why people are sensitive about their height but I've never heard anyone describe themselves as

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,400
 six feet point two five inches. Is he trying to say he's six foot two or is he a quarter of an

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,840
 inch is he's just a quarter of an inch over six feet and a hundred and seventy four pounds and

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,560
 you can hear the cannibal like salivating delicious and then the cannibal says so you'd be fattened

67
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,880
 up we got to fatten you up and the guys like it's my fetish for being eaten and then they go on and

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,800
 on basically at this point that's the story now people now that he's provided this quote unquote

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,720
 proof with these screenshots people are like oh no it's true and they start looking into the kick

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,760
 they find a name associated with the kick start finding people in Waterloo Iowa whose name is

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,840
 close to that name it's not the same but close enough and becomes this web of investigation now

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,440
 I here's the thing I think it's a lark because the guy tells a story of this is what the cannibal

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 said to me that's what he says in the very first post on the thread people don't believe him and

74
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,880
 then he randomly finds the guy again and it's the same conversation it's the same conversation

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,120
 when's the last time you had the same conversation in four hours like four hours apart you meet someone

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,320
 you have a conversation and then four hours later you have the exact same conversation it's going to

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,040
 ring some alarm bells you're going to be suspicious yourself you're like wait a second then I just

78
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,760
 have this conversation secondly that's a pretty bold way to start off just talking to someone hey

79
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,920
 you want to get eaten I think that the I think the screenshots are photoshopped and there was some

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,120
 allegations in the 4chan thread itself that these are fake this isn't what a screenshot would look

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,320
 like on omegle other people are like no no no because it's on the mobile app I don't know I've

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,880
 never used omegle I don't know what it's going to look like but what's interesting is people then

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,400
 started finding these people in Waterloo Iowa who have a similar name and going like isn't this

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,960
 suspicious isn't this suspicious isn't this suspicious to be fair and I'm not going to say the

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,040
 name because I'm not trying to dox the guy because I think it actually is a lark I don't know if it's

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,760
 a lark this is interesting either the OP is larpine or he got incredibly lucky and found the guy twice

87
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,160
 and was able to take screenshots and that guy is larpine making it all up or they're both larpine

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,800
 it's him and his buddy doing something who knows or it's a real cannibal or it's a real cannibal

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,840
 because one of the people in the 4chan thread said if you go to the Iowa missing people website

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,240
 it has some bizarre statistics if you look at the city of Waterloo 11 people have gone missing

91
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,920
 in Waterloo this year alone from ages 12 to 17 that's what this this post says what's interesting

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,800
 and I'm continuing this quote what's interesting is those 11 people are all from this year while

93
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
 other missing person reports are more than 20 years old I kind of looked into that there's a lot of

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,360
 info there's really like 20 pages of missing people men and women and he could be that could

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,360
 be part of the lark that could be accurate I really didn't check I mean like I looked into it and

96
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,560
 there's a lot of missing people what it's the OP made it sound like the dude wanted to eat dudes so

97
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,040
 there are 11 people but are they all dudes that would be the thing are these 11 people fat too

98
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,280
 missing persons don't normally say man was excessively chubby the man had sweet tasting sweet

99
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,040
 sweet delicious meat it's usually not included in missing persons things so the reason why I wanted

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,320
 to cover this was because 4chan has a history of doing this and we've actually covered this before

101
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,560
 the mysterious daycare center actually I think that started on Reddit but the mysterious daycare

102
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,840
 center we did a couple episodes back this daycare center is there it looks creepy and then people

103
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,000
 start bombarding them with phone calls and sending pizzas to the door knocking on the door because

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,480
 they thought it was some sort of child trafficking thing Hillary Clinton was eating babies there

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:14,880
 is all sorts of weirdness then recently there's been a thing about snack food like there's a snack

106
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:22,080
 food company this was actually a request to it from max f on youtube max f mentioned this

107
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:30,080
 there was a thing recently on youtube a company called stone creek stony creek they make little

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,680
 bags of food that you buy at the gas station and some guy bought some and they were super disgusting

109
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
 it was like pumpkin seeds he said they tasted like chemicals he hold on guys I know you guys are

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,720
 getting ready to type in the comments let me finish this he eats the pumpkin seeds they taste

111
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,760
 like chemicals he goes to complain to the company he writes him a letter or tries to call a number

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,280
 on the back of the package and no one answers the phone it turns out that this company has like a

113
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,320
 bunch of empty it turns out this company apparently has like five different mailing addresses and a

114
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
 bunch of different phone numbers and it's like four people work there and it's a multi-million

115
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,960
 dollar company and the ex paranormal board lost their head over this trying to figure out like is

116
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:17,280
 this some sort of conspiracy is it money laundering human trafficking always it's always human trafficking

117
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,240
 it can never just be like drug deals but it's all there's always human trafficking behind every

118
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,800
 conspiracy hillary clinton's waiting there with a bib the picture of a baby on it people are trying

119
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,560
 to call up stony creek stony creeks basically starts complaining i'm getting harassed this is

120
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,280
 ridiculous then it turned and it was weird too because then the conspiracy kind of ended

121
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,480
 because it turns out the original poster who started the stony creek thing never ate pumpkin

122
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,960
 seeds he ate gummy bears and people are like what and i was like this is ridiculous i knew from the

123
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:58,160
 beginning on that one that 99 probability that this company my guess was this with stony creek was

124
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,080
 that the packaging was older and so some of the packaging had different contact information on it

125
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,880
 because when you make candy for a gas station you're pumping it full it's you're eating candy from

126
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,440
 the carter administration basically when you're buying stuff at a gas station it's super old

127
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,360
 so you're buying stuff from say 2005 and then other stuff from 2017 maybe it's not the carter

128
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,600
 administration but that was my first guess the second guess was that they just had different

129
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,320
 distributors they're not shipping pistachios all the way from washington dc that i figured it was

130
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:43,040
 just something like that so but you can sometimes you it's for sometimes the most mundane conspiracy

131
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,640
 totally gets blown up you have a creepy looking daycare center therefore human trafficking you

132
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,400
 have disgusting pumpkin seeds or gummy bears therefore human trafficking or money laundering

133
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,880
 or whatever it was this is going to be the same thing this this iowa cannibal thing most likely

134
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,360
 will just continue to grow and grow and grow and grow it'll keep getting pushed out there now

135
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,000
 i don't think the i don't think the conversation actually happened i don't think any other people

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 involved are cannibals but i think it's a good look at how these things grow it could completely

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 die off i didn't think the stony creek candy thing was going to go anywhere and it lasted for like a

138
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,400
 week multiple threads as people try to unravel the mystery of disgusting gas station food it's

139
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,360
 gas station food it's going to be disgusting and i would argue that you could you could conti

140
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
 you know what here's an actually interesting thing the i eat these beef jerky sticks these

141
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,960
 jalapeno beef jerky sticks made by tilamook the packaging says it's three grams of carbohydrates

142
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:49,120
 three grams of dietary fiber so basically makes it a net zero for keto and i thought that's not

143
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,760
 accurate and i know that the nutritional value things on food there's you can lie on them

144
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,160
 you can lie on them you the FDA gives you some wiggle room so i thought this is weird this can't

145
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,160
 be right so i went to tilamook's website they listed the nutritional value on the website for

146
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,080
 the jalapeno things three grams of carbohydrates zero dietary fiber huge difference if you're on

147
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,000
 keto that's a massive difference so i emailed them and i said hey there's a difference here now

148
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,200
 i'm thinking in my mind they're lying with the stuff on the shelf because that's where people are

149
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,440
 going to grab them and they know that people are looking at that stuff nowadays i think it's some

150
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
 sort of conspiracy i think you're trying to rip us off i ended up getting an email like two weeks

151
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
 later so at that point like enough time had gone by is like that's where they haven't gotten back

152
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,040
 to me they're a company i'm emailing them stuff i started thinking did my email go through it wasn't

153
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,200
 a huge deal but i was curious i ended up getting an email about two weeks later and they're like oh

154
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,600
 thank you so much for pointing that out to us the website is actually outdated it is three grams

155
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
 of dietary fiber so thank you for pointing that out to us they didn't send me anything for you so

156
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,800
 whatever tilamook you suck but my point is is that in those two weeks had i posted that onto a say

157
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,200
 like a nutrition form or something like that i really could have blown their spot up and been

158
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,680
 like guys look if we're getting lied to by this company i could have gone to some keto reddit or

159
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,760
 something like that like they're they're messing with us they're it's really easy to get a conspiracy

160
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,120
 theory rolling because people are naturally suspicious and whenever you have a sexy conspiracy

161
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,840
 like i get human trafficking cannibalism they're not sexy but they're intriguing people like to hear

162
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,880
 about that stuff so if some random dude you've never met before tells you he has no proof shows

163
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,800
 the and you go well that i don't believe you shows up four hours later with proof of a totally

164
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,440
 different but same conversation you shouldn't believe that you should be very very leery about

165
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,920
 anything that comes out of that and when they start naming people and saying i think it might be this

166
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,600
 person here you should be more suspicious and what's funny is that people kept saying contact the

167
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,000
 police dude if you have this conversation you know what city it's in contact waterloo police some guy

168
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,720
 looked up the police department of waterloo police and goes here's the link just call them

169
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,000
 wouldn't call them the original poster wouldn't call them people are like dude maybe like we

170
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,080
 should figure out like this is super sketchy like look at this information look at this article i

171
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,040
 found on this guy with a similar name and that's it other people be like just call the police

172
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,080
 just call the police nobody would do it everyone wants to talk about the conspiracy theory no one

173
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,640
 wants to call the police now i don't i would call the police if i actually thought there was any

174
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,200
 truth to this but i don't i think it's a lark i think it's an entertaining lark and then i think

175
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,320
 it's great for a friday episode of dead rabbit radio interesting story and an interesting insight

176
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,280
 to how this stuff is created let's go ahead of though and move on to our next topic so we're

177
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:56,080
 going to say goodbye to iowa we're saying goodbye to waterloo waving goodbye to our new non cannibalistic

178
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,200
 friends they're like hey see you later jason oh by the way keto's dangerous don't that's not a good

179
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,080
 diet for you you should just eat what you want i'm like huh and they're like and come back and visit

180
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,600
 us soon after Easter when you eat all that candy we're like that's cool they invited us back after

181
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,480
 Easter and you're right i shouldn't be on keto and you're you're super suspicious you're like no

182
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,560
 dude stay on that diet you're looking good i'm like nah man let's go eat some cake so we stop at

183
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,680
 the cake store and we're eating a bunch of cake and there's people from iowa just with their hands

184
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,840
 on the window licking the glass and we leave we leave iowa behind but we'll visit them again in

185
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,360
 Easter we're headed up to the dowels in Oregon that's where i'm at not the dowels the it's so funny

186
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,320
 when i first moved up here i asked someone i go hey so uh what's the dowels like and they're like

187
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,520
 don't go to the dowels the kids they're smoked duct tape they're all idiots they don't even

188
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,520
 let you buy duct tape if you're under the age of 18 in the dowels and i go what that has to be in

189
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,720
 urban legend and so every time i met someone not that's okay that's a bit of an exaggeration i'm

190
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,480
 not like nice to meet you ma'am so do the kids in the dowels smoked duct tape but i would meet people

191
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
 and we'd be talking for a while and i'd be like hey have you ever heard that about kids in the

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,880
 dowels smoking duct tape and some people would be like yeah yeah i've heard of that and other people

193
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
 would kind of laugh off and say yeah i heard that but it was like an urban legend but it's real

194
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,040
 popular in hood river that kids in the dowels smoked duct tape and you have to be over 18

195
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,640
 to buy duct tape in the dowels i eventually ended up running into somebody from the dowels

196
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,120
 after a couple months of being up here i said hey dude is it uh is it true that you can't buy

197
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,160
 duct tape and the person's like that's not i'm so tired of that that's doofur so i guess farther

198
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,960
 out east there's a town that's supposedly dumber than the dowels called doofur which to be fair

199
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,560
 that's a pretty dumb name for a town and they're the ones who smoke duct tape it's not the dowels

200
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,040
 but it's funny we basically just have these different towns and each one the farther east

201
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,960
 you go the dumber you get anyways we're not talking about smoking duct tape i imagine you

202
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,040
 know i imagine if you smoke duct tape you actually would get some sort of high simply

203
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,320
 because you're inhaling a chemical and or you're cutting off blood flow to your brain by trying

204
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,800
 to like suck on something i don't know don't try it kids i think you have a better chance

205
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,000
 find them in cannibal in iowa than you do get in high up duct tape but we're going to the dowels

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,640
 and in the dowels i've heard about this for a long time too since i've been up here there used to be

207
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,840
 a mobile home that was the bigfoot information center and exhibition it was this guy had parked

208
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,120
 this mobile home in the dowels his name was peter c burn and his little bigfoot museum

209
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,040
 and apparently at one point bigfoot walked through the dowels so bigfoot's really big up here like

210
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,760
 if you walk around hood river you're going to see a ton of bigfoot related merchandise you're not

211
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,000
 actually going to see a ton of bigfoot but you're going to see like shirts and mugs and hats and all

212
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,360
 sorts of stuff now and statues there's quite a lot of bigfoot statues around town it's kind of cool

213
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,720
 for like to being into cryptids and stuff like that it's kind of cool little area but back in 1976

214
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:19,360
 the year i was born peter burn had the bigfoot information center and exhibition or bice i just

215
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,480
 realized is the acronym for that this guy had been hunting bigfoot that was his thing he was a

216
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,160
 bigfoot hunter which you know i don't want to crib a joke but listening to the parapod is one of my

217
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
 favorite podcasts of all time highly recommend you guys listen to it the guy on that show the

218
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,320
 skeptic on that show goes if you hunted foxes your entire life but never caught a fox could you call

219
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,680
 yourself a fox hunter that's kind of i know that's kind of a flippant way to describe bigfoot hunters

220
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,560
 but i think there's probably another way to describe them researchers or investigators but

221
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,760
 yeah can you call yourself a hunter if you've never actually caught one anyways peter burn i'm not

222
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:06,000
 trying to burn him uh peter burn found some bigfoot hair picks it up look at it found it little

223
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,240
 little little hairs little follicles and there's a piece of skin attached to it too now it's 1976

224
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,600
 when i was growing up and i've talked about this before on the show bigfoot people not actual bigfoot

225
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,640
 people bigfoot researchers ufo oligists paranormal people they were basically like you had to join

226
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,800
 a mailing club or you could have a magazine maybe if there was enough people in your area you can

227
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,080
 meet up and talk about it but there were no there was no internet i was born in 1976 that wasn't

228
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,920
 around until the late 90s if you were into this stuff you either knew someone in town who was

229
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,880
 into it as well maybe three or four people or you mailed letters back and forth you were part of

230
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,920
 some correspondence club so everyone felt fairly isolated i think nowadays you have way more communication

231
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,560
 between people double edged sword though because now you can combine your efforts and be like let's

232
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,880
 really look at all the evidence we have on bigfoot or you can combine your efforts and possibly

233
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:10,320
 end up harassing some innocent people in Iowa but in 1976 this guy has this hair and he goes hmm

234
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,040
 you know i've been studying bigfoot for a long time i found evidence before but i think this is

235
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,920
 conclusive i don't really have anywhere to turn to though and again that was another thing back

236
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,080
 then like nowadays every show opting you'll get some research scientists you'll get like neil degrasse

237
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,240
 thyssen talk about like alternate realities or you have people who grew up on more sci-fi stuff

238
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,880
 enter the sciences and they have a bit of more open mind back then people who are running the

239
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,680
 colleges running the scientific organizations they were like no this is all goofy i'm not going to

240
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,400
 ruin my name by talking about bigfoot so if you had a bigfoot hair sample there wasn't really a lab

241
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,920
 you could send it off to there was no national group that had the ability to do dna testing or

242
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:57,200
 anything like that so he has this sample of hair and he turns to the federal bureau of investigation

243
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,040
 he sends the fbi a letter and he's detailing listen i found this fur it has a little bit of

244
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,680
 skin attached to it now i know this is going to sound crazy but i believe it's bigfoot and he puts

245
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,520
 in the letter and he puts in the letter here's a quote please understand that our research here

246
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:20,400
 is serious this is a serious question that needs answering and the fbi doesn't respond which is what

247
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,640
 you would expect so peter writes another letter basically please pretty please with the cherry

248
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,440
 on top draws a little picture of a sunday a little scented sticker attaches that that says you're doing

249
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,360
 a great job you scratch it and it smells like federal building it's a little fbi sticker

250
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,800
 on the fbi the second time they're like oh they're so cute they actually say secondly yes and it's the

251
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:50,000
 fur send us the fur we'll take care of it so on the fbi side there's a guy named jay cochran jr

252
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,480
 the assistant director of the fbi scientific and technical division or std which i'm sure he was

253
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,240
 reminded of all the time hey jay you're still working in the std division he's a single tier

254
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
 i'm the assistant director you can't make fun of me like that they put a sign on his back

255
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,520
 just says got std he's like oh that's not even a reference yet that commercial hasn't come out

256
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,560
 so anyways he's sitting there crying in his laboratory and he gets this second letter

257
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:24,640
 and he scratches the sticker and smells like linoleum and chlorox and he goes yes we'll take

258
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
 care of this he actually writes back and says yes send us the sample and he tells his team

259
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:38,880
 normally we're set up to help local crime units however we have in the past helped with scientific

260
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,000
 research museums have sent us stuff laboratories have sent us stuff so we will actually help this

261
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,120
 guy out because why not and i've mentioned this in another episode too it's really easy for us to

262
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,240
 look at federal agents and police officers and stuff like that as the other as this separate thing

263
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,800
 from society but people in those groups love to watch science fiction shows they read spooky books

264
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,360
 they play magic the gathering and doom whatever game they're on at this point they're just like

265
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,360
 you and me they have a different job and sometimes that job involves you know knocking you over the

266
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,400
 head with the billy club but really at the core there's still people so i'm sure that there were

267
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,560
 people at this laboratory who were familiar with the legend of bigfoot back then they had read

268
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,080
 these books they had heard about in the news and they were curious as well so when the fbi gets the

269
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,880
 skin sample and then peter hears nothing back from them at all never ever gets an answer from them

270
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,640
 and we're at that point where we've talked about this before as well i don't mean to keep doing

271
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:41,360
 callbacks but there's always that story of the smithsonian like someone finds proof of a giant

272
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,080
 skeleton and the smithsonian shows up and they're like what giant skeleton as a giant truck is

273
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,840
 driving away with a giant tarp on it they're like i don't know what you're talking about so there's

274
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,560
 always that like you send off information and you hear tons of UFO stories like that as well

275
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,160
 people take photographs of alien ships or they find a broken component and they send it off to

276
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,760
 the government and the government's like what are you talking about what what component and you never

277
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,680
 send anything to us so a lot of people in the meantime for 20 years thought that's what happened

278
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:18,480
 that a they sent the equipment off and that was it they just never tell peter what they find

279
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,040
 or if they find anything peter sends off the skin sample with the hair on it

280
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,560
 he never finds anything out now you could say that it might have been lost in the mail it could be

281
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:34,400
 that they found it and it wasn't worth anything it could be that they found it and it proved bigfoot

282
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,800
 existed and as a national security issue they refuse to let people know what was going on

283
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:50,080
 possible too right so 42 years pass peter is still alive still alive today sends it off never

284
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,800
 hears back and i'm sure that was always going in his head i had proof that bigfoot was real

285
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:03,760
 senator the fbi never got a letter back heartbroken 2019 2019 though fbi's been opening up their files

286
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,280
 and they open up a file that they have it was no longer top secret about their bigfoot investigation

287
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,440
 about this skin sample

288
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:24,800
 it was deer they the fbi said it was most likely from the deer family is the terminology they used

289
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,280
 so that was it right sends off the sample fbi probably investigated it right away saw that it

290
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:37,040
 was deer family but still it was a classified investigation they didn't respond to him because

291
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,680
 something like bigfoot would be a national security threat something that could walk around

292
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,040
 america completely undetected could teleport in and out leaves giant footprints you would never

293
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,880
 be able to fix the road destroying everything wet concrete is safe nowhere in the united states

294
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,440
 national security threat so it was classified at the time but now that it's been declassified comes

295
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,920
 out that it was related to the deer family there's two takeaways for this first off we're going to

296
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,360
 look at an article written by hannah chin this was for the williamette week newspaper it was

297
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,400
 written last year about this story and we're going to take a look at this man named peter bern turned

298
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:21,520
 94 in 2019 94 years old he says quote i'm still in it but in a much milder way so to speak he says

299
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,480
 nowadays he goes actually the technology makes everything so much easier he goes him and his

300
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,160
 team they put up trail cams where they know that bigfoot has been spotted have them all over the

301
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,080
 place pick up deer they pick up mountain lions they're seeing all sorts of stuff elk but no bigfoot

302
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,240
 here this is a little heartbreaking quote you have this 94 year old man sitting there talking

303
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,400
 to this reporter he says quote i would love to see a bigfoot i've never seen one i've seen

304
00:26:52,400 --> 00:27:00,320
 footprints that's all i'm still hopeful i mean think about it he's been researching since before

305
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,440
 i was born for this one particular creature is looking all over for it i never found anything

306
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,880
 more than footprints probably spent 42 years holding on to hope that he had actually found proof

307
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,840
 that the fbi thought was too dangerous to get out so they kept it but now he's being told it's just

308
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,320
 deer family which he accepted that belief you know what are they why would the fbi lie to me

309
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,720
 it's probably true but don't feel bad and it's funny because when i read that i actually kind of

310
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,280
 felt bad for him i was like oh peter you're just kind of hanging out elderly man looking for something

311
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,360
 that may not exist dude spent my lifetime looking for something that may not exist however i did

312
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,960
 look more into this dude he's had an awesome life dude he's been a himalayas looking for the yeti

313
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,160
 there he has a personal website it has all these amazing adventures he's gone on to in world war

314
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,440
 two he was working for the navy and there was a plane crash and him and his buddy jumped in a boat

315
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,960
 and like saved five people pulled him out of a burning aircraft great man great man he may be

316
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,000
 looking for something that doesn't exist but it's definitely not a life wasted he's done

317
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,560
 crazier adventures and done more than i've ever done and he's still having fun whether or not

318
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,680
 he finds bigfoot he has a crew of people they're out looking for something he has a purpose in

319
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,200
 his life and he's like i said he's had some great adventures already so when i read the

320
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,800
 article originally it's like that's i can just imagine this old decrepit man sitting on his porch

321
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,560
 waiting to find you know like a leprechaun for all intents and purposes and then i read more about

322
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,280
 him and he's actually pretty dope dude and then i came away with another thing though the FBI is

323
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,600
 in the laboratory and they're testing that fur looking at it under a microscope or spinning

324
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,000
 around in a spinny thing or whatever csi device they had back in 1976 they had it just like a

325
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,080
 light bright they in the shape of a double helix and they're like holding it up against it

326
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,680
 and they go well that's part of the deer family and we know bigfoot if it exists has to be related

327
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:05,840
 to humans or apes right that's the common idea so just put it in a vault somewhere or probably

328
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,480
 just threw it away if it was just deer related they went on with their business and then i thought

329
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,560
 about something how many times do they find bigfoot fur supposed bigfoot fur there's like

330
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,440
 footprints around and they find fur and they send it off to lab and it gets brought back as deer

331
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,920
 fur a lot of times it's deer fur sometimes it's dog fur but a lot of times it's like deer fur

332
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,320
 why do we assume that bigfoot is a descendant of an ape or a man

333
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:42,880
 just because it walks on two feet who's not to say that bigfoot isn't related to the simians

334
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,760
 but to one other species a deer perhaps now i know what you're thinking jason that's brilliant

335
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:57,680
 and i know i know isn't it just because he looks like a big old monkey doesn't mean he is a monkey

336
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:04,160
 he's he's related to a monkey because you think about it i think humans look more like gorillas

337
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:11,520
 we walk more like gorillas but we're more related to the chimpanzee so even in that sector of the

338
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,000
 simians like we don't you very rarely see like tiny little people walking around they're normally

339
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,560
 like big old dudes i mean maybe not gorilla big but and you're like jason that's brilliant too

340
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:32,400
 that one that arguments a little weaker but hear me out what's to say that a deer couldn't evolve

341
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,440
 to walk on both feet now i know what you're thinking because i just realized this as i was

342
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:45,120
 saying this that yes bigfoot's have hands with like five fingers and feet and i know you guys

343
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,200
 probably think in this couple minutes ago i just i just realized this and a deer has hooves right

344
00:30:51,200 --> 00:31:00,320
 but but give me a second to think about that one what what if the reason why it has hooves

345
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,160
 is because ooh think about it this way

346
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,720
 it has hooves i actually don't know why animals have hooves

347
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:19,760
 over fingers and toes but if let's say that a million years ago dude okay yes yes okay that's

348
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,160
 a weakness in the argument and sure the antlers the antlers in the snout but but what i'm saying is

349
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:33,920
 that think about it a kangaroo looks like a deer the head if you just saw the head of a kangaroo

350
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,520
 and the head of a deer lying on the line on the ground you would go i can't tell the difference

351
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,360
 or you would be able to tell the difference because you're an outdoorsman but i wouldn't

352
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,520
 if i saw a chopped off kangaroo head no not even chopped off if there i'm not going to get gruesome

353
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,520
 with this if there was like a board with two holes in it you're like this is more weird this is your

354
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:01,680
 weird living room there was a board with two holes in it and one had a deer head like there was a

355
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,560
 live deer under there and then the other one had a kangaroo head would you be able to tell the

356
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,520
 difference now you might you might be able to however they're not the same family so just

357
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,040
 because they look alike doesn't mean they're related crocodiles and alligators they're different

358
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,920
 and they look exactly alike to me i get a mix up all the time so is it possible

359
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,400
 think about oh here's a good one here's a good one you're like jason this is this is totally

360
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:36,160
 gone off the rails snakes have no legs and lizards have legs but they're both related

361
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,960
 because they're both reptiles so a deer can have hooves and then a different kind of deer

362
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,360
 that walks on feet because it's walking on two feet evolved feet and hands because it doesn't

363
00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:01,120
 need hooves so kangaroos have hands and toes so they have the same head but different bodies so

364
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,640
 who's to say that a bigfoot is not related to the deer family but it just has different

365
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:14,000
 different appendages and a different face and a different height and totally acts differently

366
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,760
 than any deer possible and doesn't have antlers but everything's different every every possible

367
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:28,640
 thing is different except the fur except the fur right so my my point is i think i think it's

368
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,640
 a couple different takeaways here one you realize i know nothing about biological science or nature

369
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,960
 and i can't tell the difference between a deer and a kangaroo secondly that's all true secondly i

370
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,080
 think you've realized that i had an idea and then once i started to process it out loud i realized

371
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,400
 the hoof dilemma the hoof dilemma is a new rule for dead rabbit radio that's where once you state

372
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,920
 something out loud you realize that there's a flaw in it but you won't give up your argument i will

373
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:06,960
 still say this stubbornly say this who's to say that bigfoot is related to apes or humans who's

374
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,280
 to say if you grab the patch of bigfoot hair you sent it to a lab and it wouldn't come back what was

375
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,240
 supposed to come back a gorilla or human it wouldn't come back it can't come back we don't know what

376
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,600
 it is because it has to be something everything on this planet is related to something if you found

377
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:33,120
 a new fruit on a tree and you sent it to a laboratory they're not going to say this is nothing

378
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,640
 they're going to say it's related to an orange it has to be related to something if it's from this

379
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:45,680
 no see now we're back on track it has to be related to something nothing comes out of nowhere so

380
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:52,160
 it's not that maybe let me correct that it's not that bigfoot is a deer it's that the closest thing

381
00:34:52,160 --> 00:35:01,040
 to its fur is a deer maybe bigfoot's are naked and the fur we see is deer fur that would have been

382
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,160
 an easier argument to make five minutes ago that is possible bunch of naked people running through

383
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,280
 the woods that have never been discovered wearing deer fur so don't let that be proof that bigfoot

384
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,600
 doesn't exist you should when they tell you that that's really deer fur you should say ah just more

385
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:31,840
 proof of my giant naked humans wearing deer fur or actually bigfoot theory be like peter and never

386
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,880
