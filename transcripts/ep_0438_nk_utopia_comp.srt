1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
 A 911 call puts first responders face to face with an infestation.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,120
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy iceberg theory that North Korea isn't some

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
 backwater communist dictatorship, that it's not a country where the people are slowly

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,960
 being starved.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
 No.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,440
 North Korea is a utopia, a glimmering technological marvel that no other country would dare to

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
 go to war with.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 And that's today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:41,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,440
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,080
 We have a jam packed episode.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,800
 A lot of stuff to get to.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
 But first off I want to do this.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
 This episode is coming out May 1st.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,400
 And I want to issue you guys a challenge.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,720
 Episode 300 I said.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,800
 By episode 600 I want all of my listeners and myself to be in a different place than

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,000
 we were when episode 300 came out.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,800
 That was my challenge to you.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,080
 That's a long range challenge.

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,040
 It's a long range goal and sometimes you have to have little goals in the middle of that.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,000
 I hope you guys are doing that.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Some of you guys, I didn't listen to episode 300.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
 I didn't know we were going to get challenged.

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,520
 I didn't know you were going to be walking into my house and shaking me by the collars.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 Do it.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,760
 And I might do that.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
 But not now.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,160
 I don't have the capability.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,640
 Someday though I will be kicking down your door and motivating you.

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,600
 Right now this is the Dead Rabbit Radio Initiative.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,000
 Six weeks to a better you.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,640
 May 1st to June 15th.

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,120
 I want you to be a better person by June 15th.

36
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,360
 This isn't some sort of subscribing to my email.

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,520
 I'm not asking for money.

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,920
 This is just for you and me.

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 I'm doing it too.

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,560
 I'm going to hit the fitness really hard.

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
 Long time listeners no.

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,400
 I was 350 pounds two years ago.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,680
 I'm 275 today and I've kind of always been around 275 for the past year.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,460
 I've had a hard time dipping below that.

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,200
 So these next six weeks I'm really going to focus on getting below that.

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,120
 That is my goal.

47
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,200
 That is my fitness goal and I know I can do it if I focus on it for six weeks.

48
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,600
 Maybe you want to start a webcomic.

49
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,280
 Maybe you want to write a book.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
 It's time to stop doing the character designs.

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,440
 It's time to stop the world building.

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,160
 Let's put pen to paper.

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,720
 Six weeks.

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,080
 Maybe you have a hobby you've always wanted to start.

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,880
 That might be hard during the coronavirus.

56
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,760
 I always wanted to fly kites.

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
 Okay.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,900
 It's not a perfect time to do this.

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,700
 But if there's an instrument you want to play, something like that, let's do this

60
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
 now.

61
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,060
 Pick up that dusty guitar in the corner or that dusty marionette doll.

62
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,060
 Let's do this.

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,060
 Six weeks to a better you.

64
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,060
 Six weeks from now.

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,580
 I want emails and YouTube comments, Instagram comments, Twitter responses, whatever.

66
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,060
 Tweets, whatever they're called.

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,740
 I want them coming from you telling me that you are in a better place.

68
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
 That's what I want.

69
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
 I'm doing it.

70
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,940
 I want you guys to do it.

71
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,440
 And let's say you're listening to this episode.

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
 You're like, "Dude, it's December 2022.

73
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,960
 I'm listening to this episode way in the future, June 15th."

74
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,080
 Six weeks from the day you listen to this episode, I want you in a better place.

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,640
 Because you can do it.

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
 You can do it.

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,360
 People, you can listen to my old episode, behind the scenes episode I did.

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
 And I talk about my journey from just walking down the street one day to starting this podcast.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,240
 This podcast changed my life one day.

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
 One day I made that decision.

81
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,880
 Six weeks to a better you.

82
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
 Six weeks to a better me.

83
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
 Six weeks to a better all of us.

84
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
 Let's do it, guys.

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,700
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

86
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,980
 And actually, even before I do that, and I don't like having these long preambles, I

87
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,100
 got to give a shout out.

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,340
 I give Patreon shoutouts all the time.

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,660
 I got to give a shout out to someone who's supporting the show in her own way, Sabine.

90
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,860
 Sabine, thank you so much for you guys who don't know.

91
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,580
 Sabine has been incredibly helpful during this pandemic.

92
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,940
 She's a really good friend of mine.

93
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,100
 She was buying me groceries.

94
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
 I was giving her the money.

95
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,900
 I'm not a freeloader, but she was picking up groceries for me.

96
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,680
 She's driven me around town.

97
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,040
 She's totally taken care of me.

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,840
 So I want to give her the keys to the Carpenter copter today.

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,640
 Technically she is a real life Carpenter copter.

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,240
 Whenever I need to ride somewhere, she's more than happy to take me to the grocery store.

101
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
 I'm kind of thinking she has a crush on me at this point.

102
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,720
 But I want to give the keys to the Carpenter copter.

103
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,160
 She is going to be our vehicle.

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,840
 Technically, again, she is the Carpenter copter.

105
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,960
 So imagine for today's episode, it's the normal Carpenter copter.

106
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,700
 Go with a big smiley face on it and cartoon eyeballs like Thomas the Tank Engine.

107
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:34,540
 That's Sabine's spirit infusing this metal monstrosity that we've flown all over the

108
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,260
 world through alternate dimensions.

109
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,780
 So go ahead and fire up that Carpenter copter Sabine.

110
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,500
 Your anthromorphics of the key just turns automatically.

111
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,820
 Let's climb inside of her.

112
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,540
 We are flying out to Pasadena, California.

113
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,940
 Now this story takes place on Doomsday.

114
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,000
 And it's so funny how people, apparently now August 16th, 17th and 18th is supposed to

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 be the end of the world.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
 I don't know if you guys have heard that.

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,680
 I really haven't.

118
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,640
 You're like, "No, Jason, I haven't because I don't hang out with lunatics like you do."

119
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,760
 Apparently that's the new Doomsday thing.

120
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,080
 August 16th through 18th, the three days of darkness and blah blah blah.

121
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,120
 These dates always get moved.

122
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,960
 Remember just a couple months ago?

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,280
 The paladrome day.

124
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,160
 February 20th, 2020.

125
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,180
 It's only going to happen once every 10,000 years, dude.

126
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,940
 And it's totally impossible, man.

127
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
 Remember that?

128
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,340
 That was supposed to be a big day of awakening.

129
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,660
 You're like, "Jason, we are in the middle of a pandemic, so maybe something happened

130
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,660
 on that day?"

131
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
 Yeah, yeah, whatever.

132
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
 Here's the cycle.

133
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,100
 Make a prediction.

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
 Nothing happens.

135
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,100
 Then you go, "Oh no, no, no.

136
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,220
 I was just saying it was going to start then."

137
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
 That's always the thing.

138
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,500
 But anyway, so August 16th through 18th is supposed to be the end of the world.

139
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,580
 I mean, if there's any more information about that, I mean, obviously if the world starts

140
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,680
 ending, I'll probably report on it, but it's just against some lunatic theory.

141
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,440
 But this has really nothing to do with that.

142
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,960
 February 20th, 2020 is an actual day, though, that this event happened.

143
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,520
 Let's go ahead and land the carpenter copter in the middle of Pasadena, California.

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,680
 And as we're flying over, we intercept the 911 call, which I'm sure is illegal.

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
 911, what's your emergency?

146
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,240
 Oh man, I got stung by a bee.

147
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,700
 I'm on the corner of this street and some other street.

148
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,220
 A bee sting in the 911 operators.

149
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,860
 Were you like allergic?

150
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,140
 No, I'm stung.

151
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,500
 So anyways, the 911 operators probably like, "Oh, it's kind of being a big baby about

152
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 it."

153
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,140
 But let's send out some first responders.

154
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,340
 So woo, woo, woo, that's the fire engine.

155
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,140
 That's an old-timey police car, car 54.

156
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,640
 That was an old reference.

157
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,680
 They're driving down the road, turn the corner, fire engine, turns the corner.

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
 Now here's the thing.

159
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
 I'm reading this story and the story makes it sound like that's what happened.

160
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,040
 A guy just called 911 and says, "Oh, I got stung."

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,840
 Because the police and the firefighters were not expecting, like they literally turned

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,400
 a corner into this.

163
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,880
 If the 911 call was like, "Help, help!"

164
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,280
 Then they probably would have shown up a little better prepared, but they didn't.

165
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:24,620
 Fire engine turns the corner, police car turns the corner, 40,000 Africanized bees flying

166
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,340
 everywhere.

167
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,100
 So again, if you got a call from a loved one being like, "Oh, I got stung by a bee, will

168
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,740
 you come and help me?"

169
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,380
 You would be like, "Oh, what a big cry baby."

170
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,540
 Again unless you're a loved one is allergic to bees, then you're like over there in heartbeat.

171
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,680
 If you drove over there into your driving and you see like a brick wall of nothing but

172
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,320
 bees, and then they form a fist and they're like punching your car, and then they form

173
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,440
 a bow and arrow and shoot an arrow of bees at your...

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
 You would be a little upset.

175
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,120
 They didn't tell you about the cartoon bees there, right?

176
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,520
 You would at least, and if they did tell you, "Hey, watch out," because I'm pretty sure

177
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,040
 these bees can form any shape possible.

178
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
 You'd be prepared for that, right?

179
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,260
 You'd bring like giant net or water hose, which I guess the firefighters brought a water

180
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,300
 hose, and they probably have giant nets.

181
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,500
 It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

182
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,460
 The point is, is that these first responders drove into the middle of 40,000 bees and got

183
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
 overwhelmed.

184
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,820
 "Ah, shots fired, shooting at the bees."

185
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,660
 The bees form a bulletproof vest, the bullets are bouncing off.

186
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,260
 "Ah, firefighters, ah."

187
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,820
 So anyways, they had to run for cover too.

188
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,580
 Now you're like, "Tayson, I'm sure the guy who called 911 didn't go.

189
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
 I'm stung."

190
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,600
 As 39,999 other bees are flying around.

191
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 The guy on the ones like, "Should I tell them about..."

192
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
 Nah, I'm not gonna tell them about those.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,240
 He probably said, "Look out, there's 40,000 bees."

194
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,960
 And they didn't know how to deal with them, they just went out there anyways.

195
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,240
 But the point is, is that the cops were quickly overwhelmed.

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,360
 The firefighters were quickly overwhelmed.

197
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,680
 They had to shut down a city block.

198
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,000
 The bees form Godzilla, they're stepping through the city.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,420
 Eventually though, the firefighters called a professional beekeeper.

200
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,020
 This is where the story gets interesting.

201
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,940
 Not that beekeeping is interesting in and of itself, but this is where the story gets

202
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,440
 interesting.

203
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,740
 Firefighters call a professional beekeeper.

204
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
 "Keep that."

205
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,540
 You're like, "Tayson, why are you making suspicious noises?"

206
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,780
 "Hold on, hold on."

207
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,500
 Firefighters call a professional beekeeper in, right?

208
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,620
 And they go, "What we're gonna do..."

209
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,440
 It was on the roof of a Hampton Inn.

210
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,240
 So basically, you go, you check in, you're like, "Yay, we're on vacation."

211
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
 Open the door to your bathroom bunch of bees, come out.

212
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,840
 They're like, "You were vacationing from Africa."

213
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,240
 You're like, "Oh man, if I never see an Africanized killer bee again, I'll be totally fine."

214
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
 "Now I'm just gonna turn on my shower."

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,960
 There was 40,000 bees on the roof of this hotel.

216
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,140
 Which must have been horrible for their cable reception.

217
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,140
 You're trying to watch shows.

218
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,900
 They're all hanging out on the dish, hanging out on the satellite dish, getting a sunpan.

219
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,900
 How did they not know?

220
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:18,100
 At what point did it go from a thousand killer bees to 40,000 and maintenance never knew?

221
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,180
 They're like, "Dude, you're checking the roof, right?"

222
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,740
 "Yeah, yeah, I check the roof every day."

223
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
 At what point?

224
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
 It's not overnight.

225
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,820
 It's not just 40,000 bees showed up there.

226
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,580
 Anyways, they have this giant nest.

227
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,520
 The firefighters had to get a big old ladder, which luckily they have.

228
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,000
 It's a four-story hotel.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,280
 And the beekeeper walks up.

230
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,200
 Now they're spraying it with CO2 and foam extinguishers.

231
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
 And the bees are like, "Ugh, getting all disoriented and stuff."

232
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,400
 Now, that's pretty ballsy, right?

233
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,600
 You feel like we need to get rid of 40,000 bees.

234
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
 Let's go smash their house.

235
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,320
 Let's go attack their house, right?

236
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,160
 It's like, clindath through all over again.

237
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,180
 They're going in there, they're spraying the hive with foam.

238
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,660
 Now I love the last two lines of this article are just absolutely great.

239
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,780
 Because it's just the imagery involved.

240
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,780
 Second last line is, "Some of the bees were killed."

241
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,900
 I think that's an understatement.

242
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,580
 I'm sure a lot of them are getting, "Get off of me."

243
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,100
 They probably killed maybe a thousand, just by stepping on them.

244
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,620
 Some of the bees were killed while others left the area when the sun went down.

245
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,540
 Isn't that like romantic like the sun?

246
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,480
 You're like, "Jason, I'm allergic to bees."

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 Nothing's romantic.

248
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,200
 But imagine like the sun is slowly dipping below the horizon.

249
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,880
 You just see bees kind of flying off credits roll.

250
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,040
 I think that's kind of romantic.

251
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,780
 I mean, again, if you're not allergic to bees, if you're not in the middle of 40,000

252
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,400
 bees, if you are in the middle of 40,000 bees, then flying away during sunset is the biggest

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,880
 relief you've ever had, which is kind of romantic.

254
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 Then the last sentence.

255
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
 Okay.

256
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,780
 "Beehive just magically appeared on this rooftop."

257
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,260
 And you're like, "Jason, you really don't know how bee hives are made if you use the

258
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
 word magically."

259
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,340
 "40,000 bees suspiciously appear in the middle of downtown Pasadena on this roof of this

260
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,620
 hotel."

261
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,820
 And they swarm out and a bunch of people are getting stung.

262
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
 They shut down a city block.

263
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,180
 Here's the last sentence of this article.

264
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,540
 And this article is from CNN.com.

265
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,540
 It's in the show notes.

266
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,040
 "The beekeeper," he's back.

267
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:36,360
 This dude, "the beekeeper safely removed the hive so that the bees could not return home."

268
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,960
 They're like, "What?

269
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,360
 How is that suspicious?"

270
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,960
 Now we're standing on the roof.

271
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
 We're standing on the roof.

272
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,280
 Carbonar copter is parked behind us.

273
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
 Sun's setting.

274
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
 We're watching bees fly away.

275
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,980
 And you go, "Jason, that's fine, but why are you making noise?"

276
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,160
 Every time you talk about the beekeeper.

277
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,900
 Here's my conspiracy theory.

278
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:06,760
 And allegedly, so don't sue me, beekeeper, or beekeeping industry, what if the beekeeper

279
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,620
 takes the hive, safely removes the hive-- he didn't smash it with a hammer-- safely removes

280
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,300
 the hive so the bees cannot return home?

281
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,280
 What if, somewhere underneath the city of Pasadena, there's a beekeeper?

282
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,240
 And he's walking around in his beekeeping suit, right?

283
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,560
 And he has Indiana Jones storage boxes.

284
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,520
 Not boxes full of Indiana Jones, but-- remember in Raiders of the Lost Ark when they had

285
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,200
 all those boxes at the end?

286
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,880
 He has hives, a bunch of bee eyes, right?

287
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,720
 And he takes bee hives.

288
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,100
 How could 40,000 bees appear on a roof?

289
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,180
 He takes bee hives under the cover of darkness when all the bees are away because they're

290
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,780
 flying into the sunset.

291
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,900
 And he installs bee hives around, right?

292
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,180
 And then he leaves.

293
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,700
 He puts them in places where he knows janitors won't look.

294
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,180
 So basically, your hotel room, he leaves.

295
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,420
 And then he just sits at home and waits-- not home, he sits in his underground lair that

296
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,660
 I've created and waits for a phone call.

297
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,340
 "Oh no, watch out, a bunch of bees come."

298
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,520
 And he's like, "I'll help you for $10,000."

299
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,000
 [laughs]

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,540
 "Jason, Jason, you've-- this professional beekeeper, you've made up that he's some sort

301
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
 of super villain."

302
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,960
 "True, I have done that.

303
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
 I have done that.

304
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,240
 And I may get sued by the Beekeepers Association of America."

305
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,320
 "Which would-- oh dude, Beekeepers Association of America?

306
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,820
 BOA?

307
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
 Like Cobra?"

308
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,060
 "This might go deeper than I thought."

309
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,260
 "This might go deeper than the underground catacombs of Pasadena."

310
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,180
 "It's a perfect money-making scheme, right?

311
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,620
 You just put bees everywhere and then you put out the bees and you don't smash the hive.

312
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,260
 He safely removed it so he can keep it for his next adventure."

313
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,700
 And then he takes his beekeeping helmet off and he's a giant bee.

314
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,820
 What if he's just a bunch of bees in a suit?

315
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,060
 And he's like, "I'm sorry some of us died in our last-- our last money-making adventure."

316
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
 The other bees are like, "Why?

317
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,300
 You're-- you're made of bees in a suit.

318
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,740
 Why do you need-- why do you have to blackmail the city of Pasadena for money?"

319
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
 And he's like, "Revenge!"

320
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,540
 Anyways, that's the story.

321
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,220
 That article is literally like four paragraphs along.

322
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,980
 And I read it and I thought the bee-- the first time I read it, I go, "The beekeeper did

323
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
 it.

324
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,500
 This is a beekeeper conspiracy."

325
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,340
 Because really, how much money does a beekeeper make?

326
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:43,900
 Like, how much honey can you sell in a week to afford a box full of wax?

327
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,740
 And you need farmland or passages into the city.

328
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,060
 Okay, I think I've spent enough time on my beekeeper conspiracy.

329
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,260
 And I'm sure you guys all agree.

330
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,460
 Let's hop-- let's go to the store you guys are all here for.

331
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,900
 Let's hop back in the carbonicopter, subine, fire yourself up.

332
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,100
 We are headed out to North Korea.

333
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,340
 Now this-- and I should have said this way earlier, because you guys are probably looking

334
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,460
 at the cover art for this episode and being like, "What in the world is going on?

335
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:14,380
 What does any of this artwork have to do with bees?"

336
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:19,860
 The artwork you're looking at was created by John from Scar Group.

337
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,340
 He's the guy who did the cool, like, pencil dead rabbit logo that we see.

338
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,900
 It's like the profile shot.

339
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,220
 We use that.

340
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,260
 That's one of our alternating artwork.

341
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,420
 This was one he came up with when he was listening to our "Heaven Lake" North Korea episode.

342
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,980
 You'll see Kim Jong-un as a lake monster and his father Kim Jong-il as the son.

343
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,500
 It's really-- he said he just sketched it out.

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,820
 I really like that picture.

345
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,100
 So thank you so much for that, John.

346
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,500
 Also got to give a heads up to Stealthy Steve.

347
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,100
 He was the one who recommended in his own way the North Korean week in the beginning.

348
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,340
 It was just a conversation we were having.

349
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
 Started it off.

350
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,820
 Also want to give a shout out to YouTube user 99900 all week.

351
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,340
 He was like, "Dude, do North Korea's a utopia?"

352
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,340
 And eventually had to tell him, "Shut up, dude.

353
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,620
 That's Friday's episode, man."

354
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,020
 He kept calling, "Hey, man.

355
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
 When are you going to do this one?

356
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
 You should do this one."

357
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
 And finally I was like, "Shh.

358
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,620
 Dude, you're giving it away."

359
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,420
 And he's like, "Oh, okay."

360
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,060
 But I wanted to give him a shout out because it is recommending an episode, even though

361
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,140
 it was planned.

362
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,660
 That's still totally fine.

363
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,620
 And then a last shout out for this story goes to Ori.

364
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,580
 Ori actually recommended the Space Force.

365
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,060
 Is Space Force being built to fight alien story?

366
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,260
 Part of his conspiracy theory actually involved North Korea and in a way something similar

367
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,820
 to what I'm about to talk about.

368
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,300
 I didn't discuss it in the episode for time.

369
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,420
 I didn't think it was super important for the other part of the narrative, but I wanted

370
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,740
 to give him a shout out too because that also put a little nugget in my head to take another

371
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,740
 look at North Korea.

372
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,020
 So Ori, 99900, Stealthy Steve.

373
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,100
 Thank you guys so much for making this all happen.

374
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,940
 It's been a lot of fun.

375
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,900
 Let's talk about this conspiracy theory.

376
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,420
 This episode is going to run a little long.

377
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,140
 I probably could have cut out some of that beast stuff.

378
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,980
 This one's one of those ones that I really want to go into.

379
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,260
 Now on the conspiracy theory iceberg, one of the old ones on there is North Korea is

380
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,500
 secretly a utopia.

381
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 One of the earliest references I could find predating the conspiracy theory iceberg was

382
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,020
 a Reddit post for writing prompts.

383
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:28,740
 One of the writing prompts, and this was like in 2017, North Korea is secretly a utopia.

384
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,980
 And then we started to see it pop up on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

385
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,860
 It had predated it by a couple months.

386
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,700
 So let me see this right now.

387
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,260
 I'm going to do this super early.

388
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,780
 We're going to put on our conspiracy caps.

389
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,800
 I think it's fairly easy to debunk this.

390
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,180
 So I can just say it's probably just put on the conspiracy theory iceberg because someone

391
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,980
 thought the writing prompts was interesting.

392
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,860
 It's something that people have thought about anyways.

393
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,180
 It's probably not true.

394
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,980
 But that being said, let's actually put on our conspiracy caps and let's look at this

395
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,980
 as if it was true because I found some interesting coincidences.

396
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,900
 Some interesting coincidences.

397
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,420
 So being, take that carpenter copter nice and low over the North Korean forest.

398
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,580
 We are back in the year 1945.

399
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,500
 And this beginning is going to be a little historical jumping around stuff.

400
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,860
 So I hope you don't get sick as we go through time portals here.

401
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,380
 Even ruled Korea.

402
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,740
 And then after 1945, they got kicked out.

403
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,700
 The Soviet Union takes over the North.

404
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,580
 Now what's interesting is there's a lot of, again when I talk about coincidences, there's

405
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,780
 a lot of weird stuff going on.

406
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,860
 North Korea is taken over by the communists and America is like, uh oh, we don't want

407
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,380
 them to have this whole peninsula.

408
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,940
 This point China is not communist, but we're still dividing things up.

409
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,300
 And so America asks Soviet Union.

410
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,420
 Hey, can we split that down the middle?

411
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,180
 And oddly enough, the Soviet Union said, yeah sure.

412
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,980
 We didn't even have sizable troops in South Korea at the time.

413
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,980
 It's not like we went up to the 38th parallel and said, no more.

414
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,020
 That's the type of stuff happened in Berlin.

415
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,980
 But here we asked.

416
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,540
 And the Soviet Union divided a country up with us.

417
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,380
 It's almost like they didn't want to govern it by themselves.

418
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,820
 It's almost like they couldn't govern it by themselves.

419
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,500
 38th parallel is divided up, separates North and South Korea.

420
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,460
 June 25th, 1950, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh, pshh,

421
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,420
 war breaks out.

422
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,700
 North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and China, invade South Korea, backed by the United

423
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
 Nations.

424
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,060
 The US was the main fighting force, but it was United Nations' effort to control South

425
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
 Korea.

426
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,260
 The war is quick and brutal.

427
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,740
 You have North Korea push almost all the way down to Seoul, South Korea.

428
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,500
 And then the war pushes almost all the way up to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea.

429
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,820
 June 25th, 1950, the war begins.

430
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,740
 The war ends three years later.

431
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,340
 July 27th, 1953.

432
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,860
 And when the war ends, basically it goes back to the 38th parallel.

433
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,220
 And it doesn't even end.

434
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,060
 Right now there's a ceasefire.

435
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,780
 It's like a 40-50 year ceasefire.

436
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,580
 So no one was ever declared a victor.

437
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,020
 There was no one suing for peace.

438
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,740
 The war is still on.

439
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,740
 They're just not shooting.

440
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,740
 There's never been any official documents as far as that goes.

441
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,620
 The war is technically still on.

442
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:36,940
 1962, North Korea declares the all, this is a mouthful, the all fortressization of North

443
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
 Korea.

444
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,300
 They basically turned the country of North Korea into a bunker.

445
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,020
 Never militarized is the term for them.

446
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,700
 1963, North Korea goes to the Soviet Union and says, "Hey, you know how you want to do

447
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,980
 that whole thing with the nukes and Cuban Missile Crisis and all that stuff?

448
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,540
 And you know, no one knew what was going to happen.

449
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,980
 We're all going to wake up tomorrow at Atomic Heap."

450
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,020
 So the Union's like, "Yeah, we're quite aware of that."

451
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,100
 And it happened in 1962.

452
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,980
 1963, Korea goes, "You know what would be dope if you gave us some nuclear weapons because

453
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,380
 we got American?"

454
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
 Nope.

455
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,380
 What?

456
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:18,540
 Like, no, you got Japan here, that's American controlled, you got South Korea, that's a

457
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,740
 ton of...no.

458
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
 No nukes.

459
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
 What?

460
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,940
 North Korea's like, "Okay, it's got weird.

461
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,300
 Ready to give him to Cuba.

462
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,500
 Work closer to you.

463
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,740
 We've actually fought in a war with you."

464
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,820
 Well, I asked our neighbor China, "Hey China, can we get some..."

465
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,820
 Nope.

466
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,500
 "Let me finish my sentence."

467
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,300
 Yeah, but Soviet Union called before he came over and said, "Dude, he's going to

468
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 ask if he can borrow some nukes.

469
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,980
 Don't give him any."

470
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,380
 And that's weird.

471
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,100
 That's really weird because of the huge...and you could say it's because the Cuban Missile

472
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,580
 Crisis, the Soviet Union...the Cuban Missile Crisis was an issue because it was so close

473
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,420
 to America that if missiles were launched from Cuba, we'd have no early warning system.

474
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,020
 Soviet Union had nukes all throughout the Soviet Union.

475
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,740
 China had nukes.

476
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,260
 North Korea is an ally of both, spilt blood with both these countries.

477
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,980
 Why wouldn't they give them nuclear technology?

478
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,580
 This is where I'm going to start throwing out suppositions and things like that.

479
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,900
 Is it because they felt a nuclear North Korea was too much of a threat, not just to the

480
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,820
 West but to everybody?

481
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,620
 "Well yeah, Jason, the leaders of North Korea are so crazy."

482
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,580
 If that was the case, why don't they do a regime...and that actually is a good lead

483
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,580
 into our next thing.

484
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,500
 They won't give them nukes.

485
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,860
 And you go, "Well maybe they're too crazy because the Kim family...why hasn't there

486
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,860
 been...if that's true, if that's true."

487
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,620
 And Soviet Union doesn't want to give them nukes, China doesn't want to give them nukes.

488
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,380
 They've been spending this whole time trying to get nuclear technology, nuclear missiles.

489
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,060
 Why don't they do a regime change over there?

490
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,100
 I mean, America would love to do a regime change over there.

491
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,260
 It's called South Korea winning the war and then everything is discovered by South Korea.

492
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,140
 But how come Soviet Union's never went in and taken out Kim and put someone in there

493
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,020
 that they would trust with nuclear weapons?

494
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
 Or China.

495
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,260
 China has a lot of problems with North Korea.

496
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,820
 There are big fears that if North Korea fails, you're going to have millions of starving

497
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,580
 people pour over their border.

498
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,620
 You have North Korea, we talked about it yesterday, distributing drugs over the North Korean border,

499
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,620
 buying chemicals, the precursor chemicals to make the drugs from China, and then being

500
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,700
 like, "Oh thanks for giving us those chemicals.

501
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
 Here's the finished drugs."

502
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,820
 And causing drug problems in China.

503
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,260
 And it also makes China look bad because they're a rogue state.

504
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,780
 However America is like, America, they'll tell North Korea to knock it off.

505
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,260
 And then they go to China and say, "Can you get North Korea to knock it off?"

506
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,180
 And China, their answer generally is, "We'll try."

507
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,620
 Like recently they stopped buying coal.

508
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,420
 I think they're doing it again, but a couple of years ago they had to stop buying coal

509
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,940
 from North Korea to get them in line with the international community.

510
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:02,540
 They make, North Korea is your crazy neighbor whose house is painted pink in a perfectly

511
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,780
 beige subdivision.

512
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,300
 And people don't feel comfortable going to the pink house, so they go to the pink house's

513
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,420
 neighbors, which would be Soviet Union China.

514
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,540
 And they're like, "Dude, we're trying man, but that guy's nuts over there.

515
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,700
 He's playing AC/DC all night long.

516
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,220
 Pretty sure he's on meth most of the time."

517
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,140
 So why hasn't China or the Soviet Union, they're not around anymore, but when they were around,

518
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,820
 why didn't they take out the Kim family?

519
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,620
 North Korea has the second largest supply of an element called magnaesite, or mineral

520
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,860
 called magnaesite.

521
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,340
 Magnaesite while not super rare, it definitely has uses.

522
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,180
 And they have the second largest supply of it.

523
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,700
 They are the 18th largest producer of iron and zinc, and has the 22nd largest coal reserves

524
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
 in the world.

525
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,260
 And you're like, "Well, why aren't you doing podcasts about the other 21 coal reserves?"

526
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,420
 Well, here's the thing.

527
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,460
 The other 21 coal reserves have been claimed by other empires.

528
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,500
 And then you have this little tiny hermit kingdom that's sitting on all of this stuff.

529
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:13,180
 Massive supplies of fluorite, copper, salt, lead, tungsten, graphite, gold, and on top

530
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,140
 of all of those natural supplies, massive lumber industry, like as China buys their

531
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:26,140
 coal from North Korea, they have a massive amount of it, up to $6 trillion of rare earth

532
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,580
 metals.

533
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,060
 That cell phone in your pocket can only be built with rare earth metals.

534
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:39,780
 China has invested billions of dollars into Africa for their rare earth metals.

535
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,820
 And yet North Korea is just sitting on them.

536
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,900
 It's one of those things.

537
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,100
 You can go across the street to borrow a cup of sugar, or you can drive to the store and

538
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,540
 buy a bag of sugar.

539
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,420
 Why is China investing so much into Africa, where some people are afraid that China is

540
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,940
 actually going to conquer Africa economically?

541
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,900
 It's going to be a recolonization of Africa.

542
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
 Why are they doing that?

543
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,220
 When literally across the street there's a lake full of monsters separating China and

544
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,220
 North Korea, $6 trillion worth of rare earth metals.

545
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,060
 Not including the metals that I listed.

546
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,420
 Those are all not rare earth metals.

547
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,860
 There's just stuff you want.

548
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
 You want lead.

549
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
 You want tungsten.

550
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,500
 Why aren't people trying to take this country over?

551
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 But Jason, we did.

552
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,740
 It was the 38th parallel that you talked about the Korean War and all that stuff.

553
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
 Here's the thing.

554
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,860
 They invaded the South.

555
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,820
 It was a pushback against that.

556
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,780
 But even then, the war ended in 1953.

557
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,220
 We didn't know how valuable rare earth metals were back then.

558
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,180
 I don't even know if we really knew what they were.

559
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,420
 I'm sure geologists knew what they were, but we didn't need them.

560
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,300
 And now there's $6 trillion of it sitting in that country.

561
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,020
 Why hasn't America finished the job?

562
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,740
 Why hasn't China put in a China-friendly, business-friendly leader?

563
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
 Take out the Kims.

564
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,540
 Move in.

565
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
 Or the Soviet Union.

566
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
 Do that back then.

567
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,540
 Now, it's interesting because all this week I've been talking about how the Kim family

568
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:07,820
 of North Korea has been trying to tie themselves to the old kingdoms, the old waves, that they

569
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,100
 are the bloodline.

570
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,180
 They are the true rulers of true Korea.

571
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,060
 Let's take a look at the founding of North Korea.

572
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
 There was a guy.

573
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,660
 This is a creation myth, basically.

574
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,780
 A guy named Hwang, which means supreme divine regent.

575
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,140
 He lived in the sky, but he loved humans.

576
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,980
 So he got permission from whoever is above the supreme divine region to come to earth,

577
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,500
 but not alone.

578
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,060
 He brought 3,000 of his people.

579
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,660
 They come down to Korea.

580
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,580
 That origin story kind of stands out, doesn't it?

581
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:53,940
 We have stories of the world being created, biblical stories, stories, religion.

582
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,660
 That's not what this is.

583
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,060
 This story of Hwang, I'm sorry if I mispronounce that, I can almost bet money that I am, isn't

584
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,860
 the story of the beginning of the world.

585
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,780
 It's the story of the beginning of Korea.

586
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,600
 Humans were already established, things were already going on.

587
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,940
 But someone from the sky came down with 3,000 other of his kind to inhabit Korea.

588
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:25,420
 That sounds less like a creation myth, how were humans formed, and more like alien visitation.

589
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,740
 It's interesting that we have a number.

590
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,140
 It's interesting that it's someone who's already existing in a world full of humans and they're

591
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,940
 looking at seeing how much they love humans.

592
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,260
 Totally doesn't deal with the creation of the world, doesn't deal with how humans evolved

593
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,620
 or how they were created or anything like that.

594
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:50,620
 Things going on and 6,000 years ago.

595
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:58,300
 6,000 years ago, this wasn't super ancient, they come down from the sky to live in Korea.

596
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:07,540
 A place of beauty, of riches nestled in between empires and ends up becoming an empire itself.

597
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:14,500
 But you know empires will fall apart as time goes on, legends will be lost, ruins will

598
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,140
 fall apart, Japan eventually invades Korea and then it gets divided up.

599
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:27,220
 Soviet Union comes into North Korea after World War II and they start to hear whispers

600
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,020
 from the population.

601
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:36,100
 Local leaders are telling the Soviets things that both intrigue them and scare them.

602
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,340
 Things of long lost technology.

603
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,580
 In a world where the rocket is the most advanced piece of weaponry, could the North Koreans

604
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,940
 have been telling the Soviets things that their country's founders had brought to Earth?

605
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,780
 And so when the United States says hey, do you need help dividing up this country?

606
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,500
 Do you need help governing this?

607
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,340
 The Soviet Union says yes.

608
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:05,140
 Every other place that was divided up between the West and the East was hotly contested.

609
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:08,660
 Soviet Union welcomed the US Presence in South Korea.

610
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,000
 Could they contain what was actually there themselves?

611
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,080
 As North Korea is beginning to form and you have this leadership that claims to be related

612
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,500
 to the empires of old, they start to wrap their fingers around the levers of power,

613
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,260
 Soviet Union China get a little nervous.

614
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,220
 And when North Korea decides to invade the South to reunify their country, Soviet Union

615
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,620
 and China does fight alongside them.

616
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
 And the war?

617
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,540
 Which really should have been.

618
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,780
 It came so close to ending twice.

619
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,660
 When everything got pushed all the way down to the South and then everything gets pushed

620
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,100
 all the way back up to the North.

621
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:50,400
 And then a defeat, a retreat back to the 38th parallel, back to the line where it started.

622
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,660
 Even though each country pushed so far in.

623
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,580
 No gains were made.

624
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,700
 Why would the US back down?

625
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,860
 Why would we go yeah, let's just go to that original thing after all that money and all

626
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,500
 those lives lost.

627
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,460
 The Korean War is often referred to as the forgotten war.

628
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,220
 It's just been brushed aside.

629
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,900
 It's not as sexy as World War II or not as gritty as Vietnam.

630
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,620
 But is that the reason why it's just been brushed aside?

631
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,340
 That's what we've always been told, right?

632
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:22,980
 So Jason, are you trying, are you telling us that because of these weird coincidences

633
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:29,940
 that maybe North Korea has access to some sort of UFO technology?

634
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,060
 I'm not telling you that because of those coincidences.

635
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,620
 I'm telling you that because of this coincidence.

636
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,380
 UFOs were all the rage in 1952.

637
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,220
 That was really the year that UFOs took off.

638
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,500
 No pun intended.

639
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,620
 Roswell happened in the 40s, but a lot of people don't know that.

640
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,580
 Roswell did not become a well-known event until the 70s.

641
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
 Nobody talked about Roswell.

642
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,700
 There was the newspaper article and it just kind of disappeared.

643
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,220
 It wasn't until the 70s when books about UFOology started being published was when Roswell,

644
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,780
 contemporary UFO enthusiasts, like especially in the 50s, which is closer in the 70s when

645
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,980
 I say contemporary, Roswell was nothing.

646
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,140
 They didn't even know about it.

647
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,980
 It wasn't until the 70s when that came out.

648
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,620
 1952, though, was the year of the UFO.

649
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,460
 That was the year Project Blue Book got started.

650
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,140
 So people were talking about UFOs.

651
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,980
 The media was dismissing it as little green men, but UFO sightings were at an all-time

652
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
 high.

653
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,020
 There were even wars in full swing, by the way.

654
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,940
 July 12, 1952.

655
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,500
 UFOs seen over Washington, D.C.

656
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,900
 It's called Invasion of Washington.

657
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,540
 There's been a lot of documentation of this.

658
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,220
 Sightings all over the place.

659
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,500
 From July 12 to July 19, we were seeing these UFOs in the sky.

660
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,700
 They were showing up on radar.

661
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,260
 You had pilots, both civilian and military identifying these things.

662
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,780
 At one point, we launched two fighter jets to chase these UFOs.

663
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,820
 They disappear from radar.

664
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,340
 The jets start to go low on fuel.

665
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,340
 They land.

666
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,540
 They appear back on radar.

667
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,260
 And that's when the military goes, "Whatever these things are, they are actually able to

668
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,300
 monitor our radio transmissions."

669
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,860
 So this goes on from July 12 to July 19, 1952.

670
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,620
 Then it disappears for a few days.

671
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,420
 July 26, July 27.

672
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,060
 The UFOs reappear.

673
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,740
 Fighters are scrambled again.

674
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,020
 And the official report is weather problems.

675
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,820
 Making the radars go off and people were seeing these things was no big deal.

676
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:36,260
 But this frustrated the CIA so much they started what's called the Robertson Panel in 1953.

677
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,460
 Because of this Washington, D.C. flap, frustrated them so much.

678
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,100
 And the Robertson Panel basically, the CIA wanted to know what was going on with UFOs

679
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
 at this point.

680
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,380
 And they had two directives.

681
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,580
 One, our fear is that UFOs aren't real, but other governments will fake a UFO invasion

682
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,500
 to overwhelm our early warning to systems.

683
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,100
 And then they'll be dropping tons of troops in our area.

684
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,420
 Their second directive was they went to Project Blue Book and they said, "You guys need to

685
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,700
 shut up.

686
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,780
 You guys are only allowed to talk about UFO stories that you have dismissed."

687
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,700
 I don't want to hear you guys talking about stuff you can't identify.

688
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,380
 Project Blue Book is only allowed to talk to the media about UFO stories that they have

689
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,580
 100% debunked.

690
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,540
 Changed the course of Project Blue Book.

691
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,620
 July 27th, 1952.

692
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,900
 One year to the day.

693
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
 One year to the day.

694
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,060
 July 27th, 1953.

695
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,780
 America, Soviet Union, China, North Korea, South Korea.

696
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,220
 Call a ceasefire to the Korean War.

697
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,740
 The guns fall silent over the Korean Peninsula.

698
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,780
 Here's my theory.

699
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,820
 Again, conspiracy hat firmly on head.

700
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,700
 UFOs that we're seeing are coming from Korea, specifically North Korea.

701
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,700
 The country was founded in part by alien visitors.

702
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:02,060
 And the early expansion of Korea into China, this powerful empire, stories of the romance

703
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:09,420
 of the three kingdoms, these early warlords/emperors who conquered the peninsula in parts of Asia,

704
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,140
 were powered by alien tech.

705
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,300
 But over years that technology becomes stories, that technology becomes legends.

706
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,660
 Some of it breaks down, some of it is lost.

707
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,660
 So by the time Japan invades Korea, it's just a steamroll.

708
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,420
 But as the Soviet Union moves into Korea, this technology is rediscovered.

709
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,900
 The stories about the Kim family trying to connect themselves to the old kings may be

710
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,100
 that the Kim family has found the old kings weaponry.

711
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,740
 Now if you came across the UFO in 1910, you wouldn't know what to do with it.

712
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,220
 It just looks like a big dome.

713
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,260
 But by the time things are industrialized, you do know what to do with it.

714
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,340
 You can replicate it.

715
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,820
 You can go in and go, this is a control panel.

716
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,020
 K-man doesn't know what a control panel is.

717
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,860
 Clear button pre- they don't even know what press is or what button is.

718
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,260
 But by 1950, they know what these things are.

719
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,740
 A lot of people say that the UFO sightings started because we started modern UFO sightings,

720
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,580
 started because we started dropping nukes.

721
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,300
 You know what else was going on after the end of World War II?

722
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,420
 The ascendancy of North Korea.

723
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,460
 A country that was supposedly founded by people from the sky now are becoming more powerful

724
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,620
 and at the same time, flying discs and UFOs are being seen all over the world.

725
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,420
 That's always been the big question with the military.

726
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,620
 Is are these from another planet or are these from Earth?

727
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,780
 Because if they are from Earth, they are 10 times more dangerous.

728
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,300
 Because that means an unknown government or an unknown organization is flying them.

729
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,260
 Beep-Bop-Boop aliens flying from planet Gleepglorp?

730
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,620
 That's weird, but we don't know what their motives will be.

731
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,180
 North Korea, we know what their motives will be.

732
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,420
 North Korea has access to these UFOs.

733
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,260
 Soviet Union knows they can't contain these people on their own.

734
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
 America comes in.

735
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,020
 North Korea invades South Korea.

736
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,740
 Am I saying they use UFOs during the Korean War?

737
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,740
 Not likely.

738
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,540
 Because I think this is where we go with this.

739
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:19,300
 Is that the goal is to not only have access to this technology, but to not widely reveal

740
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
 it.

741
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,260
 However, the UFO flap over Washington DC may have been a warning shot from the Korean

742
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
 government.

743
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,860
 This is our level of technology.

744
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,420
 We disappear off radar years before stealth.

745
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
 We can be anywhere, anytime we want.

746
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,940
 I think you need to come to the negotiation table.

747
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,860
 I think you need to call a ceasefire.

748
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,460
 Because at that point, North Korea wasn't doing very well in the war.

749
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,660
 And you go, "Jason, Jason, Jason, you put your hand on my shoulder."

750
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,660
 You take off my conspiracy theory cap.

751
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,060
 Didn't you just say earlier this week that they're selling meth because they don't have

752
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,140
 enough money for food and all this stuff?

753
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
 Well, here's the thing.

754
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,020
 If you had access to this technology, would you want the world to know you have access

755
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,020
 to this technology?

756
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,940
 Sure, you'd want the other governments to know to leave you alone.

757
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:13,020
 And maybe every so often you'd talk about like shooting a nuke or, "Oh no, my people

758
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,020
 are starving.

759
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,540
 Aren't you guys starving while everyone over there is well fed?"

760
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,340
 The illusion is the illusion.

761
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:27,260
 The illusion that it's this starving country that's super behind is actually the illusion

762
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:35,260
 when really it is a completely peaceful utopia where everyone's needs are met, where no

763
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,660
 one goes hungry, where no one is afraid, where everyone knows what the future will be because

764
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,620
 the future is now.

765
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:50,300
 While you have 7 billion other people surrounding you, sick and dying and hungry involved in

766
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:57,940
 strife and war and chaos, would you want the world to know that you were a utopia?

767
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,420
 China's worried about North Korean refugees coming over.

768
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,900
 You would have all of the people of the world trying to get into that sci-fi wonderland.

769
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,540
 So if that's true, why don't other countries of the world expose North Korea?

770
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,060
 Say, "Hey, we're dying of these horrible diseases, but they have this alien technology.

771
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,140
 They have these cures."

772
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:24,700
 Because then you're admitting you're technologically inferior to another country, you've lied about

773
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,540
 it for years and years and years and years and years.

774
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
 It's possible.

775
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
 I mean, here's the thing.

776
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,780
 Let's take off the conspiracy theory.

777
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,540
 I'm willingly taking off the conspiracy hat at this point.

778
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
 Is this conspiracy theory possible?

779
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,300
 I mean, sure, anything's possible, right?

780
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:48,120
 So while the rest of the world sits and wonders what happens next, whether it be well enough

781
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:55,660
 or whether the other war break out anytime soon, wins the next pandemic, how is our economy

782
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,620
 going to survive?

783
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:05,220
 The Hermit Kingdom may have all the answers, and they're hiding them from us.

784
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,340
 North Korea may have the technology.

785
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,260
 They may have advanced weaponry.

786
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:17,340
 They may have cures to all known diseases, brought to them by their alien forefathers.

787
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,200
 But more importantly, they have the will to hide it.

788
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,600
 To let the world think they're a fourth-rate country.

789
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
 Starving.

790
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,560
 Destitute.

791
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,200
 Because sometimes when you have the power, you can't show it.

792
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,760
 Because if you're better than everyone else, everyone else is going to do everything to

793
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,440
 tear you down.

794
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,980
 And it's not that you're worried about being defeated.

795
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,580
 Your worry is that you have the ability to unleash hell on the rest of the planet.

796
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,140
 But you don't want to do that.

797
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:04,380
 You just hope that someday they can find one sliver of your utopia that you've so expertly

798
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:09,340
 hidden from the rest of the world.
