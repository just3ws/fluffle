00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 Today, we take a look at two really cool apps you can use to increase your own paranormal

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
 skills.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then we travel to Michigan to find a giant copper ore boulder sitting in the middle

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 of nowhere.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,120
 But when the US military got involved, were they trying to make unlimited pennies or trying

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,800
 to contact an ancient Native American deity today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:38,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 I'm your host Jason Garbender.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,360
 I just woke up from one of my patented night naps.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,560
 But you guys didn't know about this, but you guys didn't know that you can nap at night.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
 It's great.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,560
 You guys are like, "Do not run out of time to nap."

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
 What are you talking about man?

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
 That's super busy.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,800
 There's nothing more beautiful than taking a nap at night.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 Not sleeping.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
 Not sleeping.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
 Well you're asleep.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
 You're asleep obviously.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 You're not just pretending.

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,600
 You're just laying there.

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,480
 Your kids are like, "Dad, dad, what are you doing?"

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,280
 You're just staring off into the void.

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,600
 You do sleep, but dude it's awesome.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,960
 And the person who just woke me up from my night nap is our newest Patreon supporter,

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
 BankedSassyPants.

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,920
 Everyone give a round of applause to Banked.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,600
 You gotta podcast it to.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 You gotta podcast it to.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,120
 Everyone give a round of applause to Banked.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,240
 Banked, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,080
 You're gonna be our official nap waker up.

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,360
 If anyone falls asleep to this episode, you're gonna wake up to a dude just standing next

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,600
 to you at the broom handle.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,880
 If you can't support the Patreon or if you don't have a broom handle, that's fine too.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
 Just helps spread the word about the show.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,680
 Really, really helps out a lot.

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,800
 So Banked.

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,280
 Let's go ahead and toss you some coal.

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,240
 Let's hop in the Carboner Caboose and we are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,960
 We are headed out to Ankara, Turkey.

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,200
 I can't fight this feeling.

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,480
 Little babies dancing.

46
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,320
 The Carboner Caboose is leaving behind.

47
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,400
 It's going to Ankara, Turkey.

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
 As we're on the way to Turkey, I wanted to talk to you guys about some really cool stuff.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,000
 Both of them were recommendations from you guys.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 One of them I've barely investigated, but it's the weekend.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 This is the start of the weekend.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,880
 I think you guys will have a lot of fun with this.

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,800
 It takes a while to get started.

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,560
 So I want you guys, well, you can decide whether or not you want to use this.

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
 I'm not saying like do it.

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,800
 But I probably will cover a full story on it in the future, but I think it would be

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,520
 cool to get some feedback from you guys as well.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,040
 Nate, Patreon supporter Nate.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,200
 Thank you very much for this.

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,560
 I'm going to get me over a link to an app called the RV Tournament.

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
 And it's not as cool as it sounds.

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
 It's not Mortal Kombat.

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,040
 It's not Mortal Kombat with RVs punching each other.

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,920
 It's a remote viewing tournament.

65
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,320
 And I've actually been doing it for the past couple of days and I'm getting ready to read

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,520
 some articles and do some research on it and all that.

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,520
 But before I did absolutely any research on it, I downloaded it onto my phone.

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,680
 It's a remote viewing tournament.

69
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,400
 And what it is, it's actually super simple.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,400
 This isn't a paid, this is going to sound super chilly, but I'm not getting you paid

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 for this.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
 It's actually really simple.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 Download it to your phone right now.

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,620
 What it is, is they want you to look at your phone in the future.

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,800
 So when you have your phone, they want you to picture looking at your phone tomorrow

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,160
 at like say 1.30pm or 2.30pm or something like that.

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,720
 And then it has you draw a sketch of what you think that might be.

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,840
 And then it presents you with two images.

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,360
 And you choose which image you think it is with like a slider.

80
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,440
 Like how confident are you that it's the top image or the bottom image?

81
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,640
 So when you saw it's really, it's kind of a cool thing.

82
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,040
 Because it'll present me with the white image.

83
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,440
 And I saw it and then I just was imagining, it's imagination, right?

84
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,500
 But I imagine like a waves.

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,100
 So I actually drew like these waves.

86
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,220
 And then the pictures that were presented to me was like a factory and three tennis

87
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,820
 balls right next to each other.

88
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,080
 And even though the three tennis balls next to each other weren't waves, that was the

89
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,800
 image I was seeing, like the lumps.

90
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,200
 So I selected that picture with 100% confidence.

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,900
 If the polls weren't there, I'm canceling the show basically.

92
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,520
 And then today at 1.30 I got the notice that yes, I did select the right one.

93
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,520
 It's really cool.

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,420
 Right now I have a score of 14, which I've been doing it for a couple days.

95
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,020
 You can only do it once a day.

96
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,620
 It's not like Farmville where you can keep going back and watering your crops and stuff

97
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,620
 like that.

98
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
 But it does keep track.

99
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,900
 Apparently right now I'm the 1300th most powerful remote viewer in who is currently

100
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,540
 using this app in the month of January.

101
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
 So watch out.

102
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
 It's kind of anything.

103
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,540
 I joked with Nate.

104
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,820
 I said great now when Professor X sends a bunch of goons to throw a bag over my head

105
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,980
 and throw me in a truck.

106
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
 I'll know why.

107
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,360
 That's my concern about the app.

108
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,880
 Like obviously it's kind of a cool thing.

109
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,360
 Oh and you can win money too.

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,560
 I glossed over that part because I don't think I'll ever win money using this app.

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,640
 But apparently if you get high enough in the ranks you can actually win money.

112
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,440
 It's like $10 gift cards.

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,160
 You know it's not like, it's not like they're asking you to look inside of a bank and they're

114
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,320
 like and what is the man with the key doing now?

115
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,640
 You're like oh he's saying goodbye to his family.

116
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,360
 No you win a couple bucks.

117
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,840
 But my concern with it, I did load it on my phone and I have been using it pretty consistently.

118
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,060
 I've been using it for about four or five days now.

119
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,220
 I've gotten two right.

120
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,900
 I've gotten two dead on.

121
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,420
 And I think I got one that was okay and the other two I got off.

122
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,700
 So my concern is that this is an app used to find superheroes.

123
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,340
 Like they gave up.

124
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,860
 The governments of the world gave up sending agents out to like find a little girl who's

125
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,540
 levitating a teddy bear.

126
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,700
 They're just like screw it.

127
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,420
 Let's just put it in TikTok.

128
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,400
 Just turn it into an app and these goombas will download it and be like hey look at me

129
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
 mom psychic and then the cops break down your door.

130
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,920
 Hopefully just the cops.

131
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,760
 Again a professor X comes and goes I want you to come to my, I don't know, professor

132
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
 X would be dope.

133
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,760
 If anyone's going to kidnap me, I hope it's professor X and the X men.

134
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,080
 But they're fictional.

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,720
 So I guess my choices are organized crime or people trying to take my top 1300 psychic

136
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,220
 skills.

137
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
 It's on a phone now.

138
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
 They can track me wherever I go.

139
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,960
 It has proof of my psychic abilities as well as a bunch of photos of Taylor Swift.

140
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,400
 They'll be like what a weirdo.

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,360
 And then, well actually there is no end the end.

142
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
 That's the end of that one.

143
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,480
 So I wanted you guys to check, you guys might want to check that out this week after that

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 glowing after that glowing review.

145
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
 You're like what?

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,640
 No I don't want a bunch of people kicking down my door.

147
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,120
 I'm taking a night nap.

148
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,000
 I'm trying to sleep.

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
 Bank though is taking us not to the app store.

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,220
 It's actually taking us to Ankara Turkey for another really cool thing that I want to share

151
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
 with you guys.

152
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,340
 I had actually come across this a while back and was kind of puttering around with it.

153
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,900
 But then I got an email from Vertigo, long time listener of the show Vertigo.

154
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,340
 He goes hey have you seen this map?

155
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,660
 Have you seen the 40 end map?

156
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,260
 The 40 end map is what I think.

157
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,020
 I don't want to oversell it.

158
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,980
 But I think it's the evolution of the conspiracy theory iceberg.

159
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,680
 I think the conspiracy theory iceberg is cool.

160
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
 We've hit so many topics on it.

161
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,160
 We've hit almost all the good ones.

162
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,080
 There's still probably about 30 or 40 really good topics on there.

163
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 But we've covered a lot.

164
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
 We've actually covered a lot on that show that I didn't even know was on the conspiracy

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,560
 theory iceberg.

166
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,040
 Like the Stonehead of Guatemala.

167
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,160
 I'll put that on the show notes.

168
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,760
 That's a really cool mystery.

169
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
 But it's a static image.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,960
 And at this point there's almost weekly attempts to just fill it up with jokes.

171
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,500
 There's left testicle as an animated character.

172
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 Do not research.

173
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
 And you're like oh come on man.

174
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,860
 And then you research it and you're like hmm.

175
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
 But you know you just see a bunch of attempts for humor.

176
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,260
 There's a new thing out there and again I wanted to share this with you guys and thank

177
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,500
 you Vertigo for bringing it back to my attention.

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,380
 The 40 end map.

179
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,580
 It has the same weird issue as the conspiracy theory iceberg.

180
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,140
 We have no idea where this came from.

181
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,580
 And you can just, somebody took the time to put extremely obscure paranormal events and

182
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,880
 mysteries and tag the locations all over the world.

183
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,680
 It's a really really cool app or map thing.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
 You go through it.

185
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
 You look through it.

186
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,840
 I would look through it a long time ago.

187
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,120
 There's a lot of really cool like boat mysteries.

188
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,680
 I want to cover some of them where it's just, again it's not just like oh they found a boat

189
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 it was empty.

190
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
 Like yeah that's a mystery.

191
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,040
 But that's like really bizarre stuff that's happened at sea.

192
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,920
 And then they have a lot.

193
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
 Did Ricky's story yesterday.

194
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,480
 The one that I talked about the guy turning in a mist.

195
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,900
 I had never heard that one before.

196
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,980
 I found it on the 40 end map looking around and then I saw all the list verse articles

197
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,060
 and things like that.

198
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,220
 So most of the stuff on the map can be verified but if you're curious about really obscure

199
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,140
 stuff happening in your area.

200
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,820
 This is a really cool thing to check out.

201
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,100
 I want you guys to check it out.

202
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,060
 If you guys come across some really really cool stuff don't hesitate to send it to me.

203
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,500
 If you guys send me a whole list of things it can make it harder for me to respond to

204
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,740
 the email just because I want to click on everything.

205
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,640
 But if you guys find like two or three really really cool mysteries on there don't hesitate

206
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,800
 to send them over.

207
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,960
 And that's what Vertigo did.

208
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,240
 Vertigo actually had been clicking around on this map and he goes hey you know this

209
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
 is really cool.

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,960
 I don't know if you haven't seen this before but I've come across these two stories that

211
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,600
 I just can't verify.

212
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,840
 Like do you know anything about these?

213
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,280
 Choo choo choo choo.

214
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,760
 The train has stopped in Ankara, Turkey.

215
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,960
 This is one of the ones Vertigo sent to me.

216
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,240
 Really really cool.

217
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 Really really cool story.

218
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,900
 Check out the 40 in map if you get a chance this weekend.

219
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,380
 The year is 2015 and in Ankara, Turkey there's this beautiful movie theater.

220
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
 I don't know if it's beautiful.

221
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,300
 I'm just assuming it is going to be totally run down.

222
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,780
 But the name's nice.

223
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,620
 It's called the Cinema Maximum Panora Theater.

224
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,540
 It has an elevator so there you go it's classy.

225
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,540
 How many movie theaters do you know that are gross that have elevators?

226
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,100
 So we're in the theater now.

227
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,820
 We're wearing our nice movie going clothes.

228
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,420
 The elevator doors open up ding.

229
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,760
 And inside is a dead body.

230
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,800
 Now when the police show up we go see the movie.

231
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,280
 We were like we'll just take the stairs.

232
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 We go see the movie.

233
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,160
 When we come back the police are there and this is what they figure out.

234
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,400
 The man's name was Belial Ruzgar.

235
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,360
 It was the cashier of the movie theater.

236
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,400
 He was shot twice in the chest which was curious because of course people go did you guys hear

237
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 any gunshots?

238
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
 Nobody did.

239
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
 I mean you're at a movie theater.

240
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,280
 Every movie is nothing but gunshots right?

241
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,800
 They're playing like the expendables in one theater, Transformers 3 and the other.

242
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,860
 But nobody heard any gunshots.

243
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,220
 They said when the door opened up that was it.

244
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,140
 The door opened up and the body was in there but this elevator has been in operation.

245
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,620
 So it's not like this body had just been laying there for four days or something like that.

246
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,740
 Like you would figure the attack took place in the elevator going up or down when the

247
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,860
 doors opened up you would assume the murderer would run out.

248
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,980
 That's just not the case.

249
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,980
 The doors just opened up.

250
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,740
 There's just this body.

251
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,880
 And I know what you're thinking, John McClain.

252
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,320
 He escaped through the trap door at the top.

253
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,640
 Well no, they did check that there was no movement on the trap door at the top.

254
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,080
 So where did the killer go?

255
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,760
 And the most odd thing of all when they take him and they do an autopsy on him, they do

256
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,920
 next to the concession stand, cops are eating popcorn, blah blah blah.

257
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,960
 When they take him actually to the coroner's office, do the autopsy on him, he was dead

258
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,360
 for four days.

259
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,840
 But that elevator had been in operation that whole time.

260
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,180
 Now that's one of the ones that Vertigo sent me and I was not able to verify anything about

261
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,180
 it.

262
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,900
 So it's labeled as the elevator riddle.

263
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,860
 It's the name of that story.

264
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,900
 So you go, maybe it's some sort of thought experiment.

265
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,540
 So maybe you guys are familiar with that riddle.

266
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,740
 I never heard of that.

267
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
 That movie theater exists though.

268
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,300
 I was able to track it down.

269
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
 The elevator's real.

270
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,660
 I couldn't verify the name of the cashier.

271
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,340
 I couldn't verify that there was a murder there.

272
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,220
 I could figure that there was a super spooky murder there.

273
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,140
 That was something that was found on this paranormal.

274
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,480
 It's called the Fortian map.

275
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,520
 Fortian is a term meaning the exploration of the weird.

276
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,960
 So some of the stuff you'll find on this map are things you can't back up.

277
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,280
 Most of the stuff I've been able to find articles on.

278
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,880
 But banked sassy pants, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

279
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,160
 We're going to leave Turkey.

280
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
 We're going to check out another part of this map.

281
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,160
 We are going to head on out to Thornton Township, Illinois.

282
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,400
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is flying back to the United States.

283
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,140
 It's January 1846 and in this little area in Illinois there's two boys.

284
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,340
 There's Bill Groves and William Curtin.

285
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,220
 They're just kind of walking on little kid feet.

286
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,780
 They're like 11 years old I'm assuming.

287
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,940
 The story only makes sense if they're kids, if they're both like 32 years old.

288
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,740
 It doesn't make sense but I don't know what their ages are.

289
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,300
 They're walking through the snow field and all of a sudden William gets hit in the back

290
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,540
 of the head with a snowball and he's like "Ah, Bill, you big old galoot, what did you do

291
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
 that for?"

292
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,580
 And then they are 33 year old men and Bill's like "I didn't do that at all William.

293
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,460
 You're drunk, you're on the sauce again and you promised better you wouldn't drink again."

294
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,340
 Then Bill gets hit with a snowball and then more snowballs start hitting them.

295
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,720
 So they're in the middle of this snowy field and they figure out it's probably some jerk

296
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,680
 from the mechanic shop next door to the bar that's always spitting on them.

297
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,520
 They turn around and they're seeing snowballs fly across the field and hitting them.

298
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,140
 But they're the only ones in the field.

299
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,900
 They said that the snowballs didn't break on impact which is actually quite hilarious

300
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
 right?

301
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,900
 It's just like a ball of snow hits you and then the ball would fall to the ground so

302
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,400
 they weren't turning a powder when they hit you.

303
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,820
 They said it also seemed like they were rising up in the air by themselves, flying across

304
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,780
 the field and pummeling them.

305
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,260
 They said it would almost like they would go up like 10 feet in the air.

306
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,920
 These things were gaining some distance and then raining down on these kids.

307
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,760
 So they run and they get Bill Grove's dad and he doesn't believe him obviously.

308
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,840
 He's 80 years old at this point and he has these two 33 year old kids and he's like "Guys

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,440
 come on, it's not snowballs hitting you out of nowhere."

310
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,080
 Bill Grove's dad goes out there to take him out to the field.

311
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 He doesn't see anything.

312
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,600
 There's no weirdness going on.

313
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,880
 It's just a snowy field.

314
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,860
 Then the snowball reign of terror begins again.

315
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,580
 They just lift up out of nowhere and begin pelting all three of them.

316
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,380
 But this time the snowball assault is so violent.

317
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,900
 Poor William Kurt.

318
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
 William Kurt.

319
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,140
 "Ah, ah come on, ah!"

320
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
 He's getting hit with them.

321
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,140
 He falls on the ground and he's like "Ah, tell Betty I love her.

322
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,700
 Betty I love her."

323
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,380
 He dies.

324
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,060
 William Kurt actually gets hit by so many snowballs.

325
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,060
 He dies.

326
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
 I can't believe it.

327
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,740
 Even on this show that's a bizarre statement to make.

328
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,760
 So according to this little blurb on the 40 in map, this was backed up by newspaper accounts.

329
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,600
 This was backed up by police records that said that the boys both had suffered concussions

330
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 from the snowballs.

331
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,000
 The dad apparently was using the kids' shield.

332
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,240
 He didn't get a concussion.

333
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,800
 I was not able to find anything to back that up.

334
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 That's called the Grove Kurt incident.

335
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,400
 So it's interesting because you'll have, if you saw the Grove Kurt incident on the conspiracy

336
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,440
 theory iceberg, it would kind of put a little puzzle in your brain.

337
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,500
 You try to figure it out.

338
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
 It's like that.

339
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,540
 They have stuff that you can easily verify and then there's others.

340
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,500
 All of them have a description though.

341
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
 I should add it that well.

342
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,220
 It's not a super vague as a conspiracy theory iceberg.

343
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,220
 All of them have at least a little paragraph.

344
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,340
 It's kind of wet the whistle.

345
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,700
 But these are two that Vertigo couldn't find anything on and I couldn't find anything on

346
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 these either.

347
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,020
 I looked all over for the Kurt groves incident.

348
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,500
 I looked all over for Boys time from snowballs as I laughed the whole time.

349
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,360
 I'm like, "What a job you have, Jason."

350
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,080
 And yeah, I couldn't find anything on it.

351
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,120
 But it's still a spooky story.

352
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,480
 I mean, I hate snow anyways, but that's why it's spooky to me.

353
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
 But yeah, check out this Forty in Map.

354
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,400
 It's a crazy weird world out there.

355
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,520
 You guys will also find some really weird stuff.

356
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,400
 Most of it again is verifiable.

357
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,280
 Or, if it's not true, you can track it back to its source, which can be an interesting

358
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,840
 story in and of itself as well.

359
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,700
 I have a story coming up about a lot of people falling into portals.

360
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,260
 I found about four accounts of people falling into portals and we'll fall into a portal

361
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,340
 as we tell that story, but we'll tell that story at a later date.

362
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,420
 Right now we're going to give banked sassy pants the keys to the Carbentercopter.

363
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,740
 We are leaving behind Thornton Township, Illinois.

364
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:51,500
 We are headed out to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

365
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,300
 Carbentercopter is headed out to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

366
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,800
 We're specifically headed to the Ontonagon River, which is right off of Lake Superior.

367
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,480
 Now sitting there, this had been here for quite a long time before the settlers got here,

368
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:12,280
 there was a massive chunk of copper ore sitting on a river beach.

369
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,360
 Carbentercopter lands next to the ore.

370
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,600
 We're going to set a base camp because we're going to be here for about 150 years.

371
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,760
 So I hope you guys made plans for a babysitter.

372
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
 I hope you said goodbye to your loved ones.

373
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,380
 We're going to sit here at the beach and we're going to watch time pass.

374
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,460
 Now you have this giant copper ore, the native population in the area.

375
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,380
 They had several tribes around Lake Superior.

376
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,220
 Most of the native tribes in the area used this copper stone.

377
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,460
 One you could just mine it if you knew where the mines were.

378
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,900
 But let's say you know you were tired that day, you didn't want to go mining.

379
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:49,540
 You could walk up to this giant ore deposit just sitting on the beach and grab some off

380
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540
 of it.

381
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,400
 Maybe they think it was an iceberg, not an iceberg, an ice wall that during the ice

382
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
 age pushed.

383
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,240
 It's like no copper here.

384
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,080
 Man get out, find a new place to live.

385
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,800
 The ice flow pushed the copper down and then it just ended up on the beach.

386
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,640
 It's like fine, I'll just sit here for a thousand years.

387
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,880
 And then when the natives were in the area, they would go up, they would be able to chisel

388
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,360
 pieces off of it and take it and they would use it for jewelry.

389
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,540
 They would use it to actually help conduct heat, they'd use it to help boil water.

390
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,060
 But you had to be really careful where you got your copper in the area.

391
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,140
 You had the Jibwa tribe who had a legend about what happens if you take copper from

392
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,260
 the wrong area.

393
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,620
 There was a story of four young warriors who went out to get some copper off of this island

394
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,860
 in Lake Superior.

395
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,740
 Beautiful beautiful island with untold riches of copper.

396
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,340
 They actually took some of it.

397
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,200
 They were headed back to their village.

398
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,080
 Why did you take my child's playthings?

399
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,960
 They hear and they're like, was that you Bill?

400
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 Was that you?

401
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
 I don't have any kids.

402
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
 Was that you Jerry?

403
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
 Uh-uh, no, no.

404
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,800
 My kids are, they don't have playthings.

405
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 They're boring.

406
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
 They're super boring kids.

407
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,680
 They realize there's something underneath their canoe.

408
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,320
 Why would you take that from my island?

409
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,740
 Because they furiously try to make their way back to the village.

410
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,780
 They're getting killed off one by one until the end.

411
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,020
 There was only one survivor.

412
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,740
 He makes his way back to his village holding a piece of copper and he says, don't do that.

413
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,780
 Don't ever go back to that island.

414
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,060
 We all got killed.

415
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,940
 There's something protecting it.

416
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,260
 But the Jibwa tribe in the area, they didn't care about any of that stuff.

417
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
 They're like, what?

418
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,780
 Now I kind of heard about that.

419
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,620
 I kind of heard about the four people getting picked off one by one.

420
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,320
 They furiously rode back to the beach, but you know, fake news.

421
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 We don't believe that.

422
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,360
 They were totally fine with just picking up copper and they had access to this giant

423
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
 chunk of copper.

424
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,120
 They don't need to go to a mysterious island shrouded in fog.

425
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,920
 Just go to this giant thing.

426
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:05,440
 Now when I say giant, early estimates of it was this was a chunk of raw copper that weighed

427
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
 10 tons.

428
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,200
 That's a lot of pennies, ladies and gentlemen.

429
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,320
 And this is happening back in old colonial times where they still made pennies out of

430
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,620
 copper.

431
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,100
 As the settlers are moving into the area, by the earliest 17th century, they start getting

432
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,620
 reports of, dude, you won't believe this.

433
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,380
 There's a giant thing of copper sitting on a beach.

434
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,180
 You just walk up and grab a handfuls off of it that's so malleable that you can reach

435
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:37,420
 in and everyone's pretending they're super villain and just pulling off a chunk of copper.

436
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,620
 In 1766, that's when you start seeing reports that it's 10 tons.

437
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,000
 By 1798, you're actually able to get people out there.

438
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,800
 There's no longer a tall tale that one-eyed explorers are telling in some trading posts.

439
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,400
 Now you've got two-eyed explorers telling these and trader folks they can see it all.

440
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,080
 It actually weighs 2,200 pounds, so it's close to a ton or it's over a ton.

441
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,440
 So people were a little disappointed.

442
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
 They imagined it to be bigger.

443
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 But what are you going to do?

444
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,720
 It's still raw copper.

445
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,120
 It's still very, very valuable.

446
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,260
 And in 1841, I love this story.

447
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,620
 I thought this was so funny.

448
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,180
 So now we're done camping.

449
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,260
 We took many, many night naps over the past 150 years.

450
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,300
 For now it's time for us to start joining a crew.

451
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,060
 We're going to become active participants in this story.

452
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,580
 In 1841, there's a man named Julius Eldred.

453
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,220
 He owns a Detroit hardware store and he says, you know what?

454
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,500
 I'm going to take that copper ore off that beach.

455
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,180
 I'm going to do it legally because I'm a legal man, but I'm going to take it.

456
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,680
 So he actually is able to contact members of the Chippewa tribe.

457
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
 That is the land.

458
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,600
 They controlled the land in that area.

459
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,760
 He spies it from them for $150, which now a day money is $3,700.

460
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,160
 It's like, fine.

461
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,240
 It's worth way more than that.

462
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,360
 Gets it prepped for travel.

463
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,280
 They have to like build this whole mechanism for it.

464
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,880
 Now it's in the middle of no, well now back then it was in the middle of nowhere.

465
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,080
 Nowadays there might be a bunch of houses there.

466
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,120
 He started this in 1841.

467
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,660
 He first had to build this mechanism to kind of prop it up and he owns this at this point.

468
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,060
 But it's 1843.

469
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:19,580
 That's the soonest he can come back to start really moving this thing because it's just

470
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,340
 way too massive.

471
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,620
 He gets there and there's a bunch of miners hanging out.

472
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,580
 The occupation, not the kids.

473
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,580
 They got their pickaxes.

474
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,260
 Now they're not messing with the ore.

475
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,460
 They're just kind of hanging out, you know, probably digging in a hole like miners are

476
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,900
 supposed to do in a cave.

477
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
 This shows up.

478
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
 He's like, hey guys, what's up?

479
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,400
 Yeah, I'm just here to pick up my copper rock and they go, no, that's our copper rock.

480
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
 And he goes, no, no, no, I bought it.

481
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,360
 I bought it from the Chippewa tribe and they say, oh, they never owned it.

482
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
 They ripped you off, dude.

483
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,800
 We actually own this land.

484
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 Here's the deal.

485
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,320
 We've owned this land for a while now.

486
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,040
 You just happen to talk to a bunch of Native Americans walking by on the way to the store

487
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,520
 and you're like, hey, can I buy this?

488
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,480
 And they're like, yes, give us money.

489
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:11,340
 So then he has to pay the miners $1,300, which is the equivalent of $37,000 in today money.

490
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,620
 I don't know if he had it on him.

491
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,540
 I don't know if he just had like a giant wallet, a comically sized wallet or screws

492
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,380
 McDuck money bag with him.

493
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,820
 But now he's like, great.

494
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,980
 But he still knows that this rock is worth enough.

495
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,180
 He's still going to make a profit, but now he still has to move it.

496
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,600
 It's at the bottom of this river bank, but not like underwater, but just like sitting

497
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
 on the shore.

498
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,880
 And he needs to get it 50 feet up this mountain to enact his final plan to move it out of

499
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
 the area.

500
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,080
 Because it's this little tributary off the river.

501
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,280
 It's not like on the main river.

502
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,560
 They build one of those giant cranks that they use in that movie Conan.

503
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,560
 You know that prop?

504
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,040
 They got the prop replica from the movie where you get the giant wheel and everyone pushes

505
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,780
 and Julius is there with the whip and everyone gets stronger and stronger and they all become

506
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
 Conan.

507
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,620
 It's like a giant wheel that people pull and it lifts a rope.

508
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,620
 They lift this rock up 50 feet takes a week to do that.

509
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,100
 That would be rough to be like, okay guys, we're done for the day.

510
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,260
 There's a ton of rock just swinging on the wind.

511
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,540
 We're going to lift it another two feet tomorrow guys.

512
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
 Get ready.

513
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,020
 Everyone's like, oh my muscles are so sore.

514
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,220
 They then build a railroad.

515
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,800
 This is like, I didn't even know they really did stuff like this.

516
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,480
 I guess in the back of my head, I knew they built railroads, but the way they did this,

517
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,920
 I guess I kind of figured they did this, but I've seen it in movies.

518
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,640
 They get it loaded onto a rail cart and they'll build a railroad, but they don't have, again,

519
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,120
 this is like a traveling group.

520
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,400
 Basically a group of traveling circus freaks, but they're moving copper.

521
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,640
 They got to put it in this railroad cart and they build the rail out and they push it.

522
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,840
 And then when they get to the edge, they would disassemble the track that was behind it and

523
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,620
 then move it in front of it and then push it another 30 feet.

524
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,780
 They did that for miles and miles and miles until they get to the main river where they

525
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,740
 can now put this on a boat, take a long rest, just sit there for the longest time, soak

526
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,780
 in their entire body in epsom salt.

527
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
 It's done.

528
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,500
 Now they're just going to take this ore to copper harbor, ironically.

529
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 Weird.

530
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,260
 The story gets really weird from here on out.

531
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,880
 Not just the fact that it's called copper harbor.

532
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,280
 I'm like, the end.

533
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,160
 They take it to copper harbor and who's there to greet them?

534
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,040
 The US War Department.

535
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
 All of them.

536
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 Every single one.

537
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
 Every general.

538
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
 Every true.

539
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,440
 They get there and there's an emissary from the US War Department and they're like, "Hey,

540
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 it's really cool.

541
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,760
 It's a feat of engineering that you're able to move this giant boulder.

542
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 Thank you.

543
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,920
 We're taking possession of it."

544
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
 And Julius is like, "What?"

545
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
 No, you're not.

546
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
 And he's like, "Yes.

547
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,140
 The Secretary of War has sent me here to demand you turn over that giant piece of copper."

548
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,140
 Julius has already been ripped off at least once.

549
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,500
 The miners may have been ripping him off too.

550
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,580
 But he's like, "There's no way I'm letting him do this."

551
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,420
 So he puts on like a little, "That 90s stage is a talent show."

552
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,620
 The Secretary of War is like, "What?

553
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
 I love talent shows."

554
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,740
 And all the miners are like doing different axe trap, he's axe and stuff like that.

555
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,740
 Pie throwing contest.

556
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,140
 It was all a distraction.

557
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,240
 But Julius didn't really do that.

558
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
 What Julius didn't really do is he did distract them somehow.

559
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,180
 That's now part of the lore.

560
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,840
 He did distract them somehow and they moved the ore to another boat and they shipped

561
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 it off.

562
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
 So the next morning when the Secretary of War wakes up, he's like, "Oh, what a great night.

563
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
 And I won.

564
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
 I won best talent show he has this sash."

565
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,480
 He goes, "I didn't even enter.

566
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
 It's amazing.

567
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,360
 My mom's going to be so proud of me."

568
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,240
 The copper ore is gone.

569
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,920
 Julius has run away with the copper ore.

570
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,260
 The Secretary of War is like, "Damn it, we'll never find it now."

571
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,820
 Well Julius took the giant copper ore.

572
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,980
 Julius, who had just outrun the Secretary of War's inchmen, took the giant copper ore,

573
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,380
 took it back to Detroit, put it on display.

574
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,260
 You could pay money to come and visit this giant, inanimate piece of ore.

575
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,940
 No touching because then you just take enough copper to pay for your ticket.

576
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,500
 No, you'd come in and you'd look at the biggest piece of like freestanding ore ever.

577
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,300
 One quarter, please.

578
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,760
 Well of course it wasn't too hard.

579
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,040
 I mean they're looking for the dude anyways.

580
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,840
 He's outrunning authorities and then he put what he stole.

581
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,320
 Well it was his, but the government wanted it.

582
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,680
 So as far as they're concerned, he was stealing it.

583
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,120
 They show up and they all have a quarter and he's like, "Damn it, so much for the

584
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
 policemen with quarters."

585
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,240
 He's like, "Aw, great."

586
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 They go to take it.

587
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,320
 He takes them to court.

588
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,480
 It's this whole thing.

589
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,040
 The judge orders the government if they want the ore, they're going to have to pay this

590
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 man $5,600.

591
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,060
 He has a big smile on his face because nowadays that's one of used car $5,600.

592
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,180
 But in old timey money that was $154,000.

593
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,220
 So he made it out like a bandit.

594
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,460
 He definitely made a profit on that even including all the people building that railway and all

595
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
 of that.

596
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,140
 The talent show, he still owes money for the talent show.

597
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,260
 He rented out that entire gazebo, but he's made out like a bandit.

598
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,180
 Plus all the quarters he got from people who wanted to look at copper.

599
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,160
 Eventually it ended up at the war department.

600
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,240
 They took possession of it until 1860.

601
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,760
 Then the Smithsonian took possession of it.

602
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,420
 And now it's on display at the National Museum of Natural History.

603
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,160
 But it's not.

604
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
 Here's my theory.

605
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,440
 We're going to wrap it up like this.

606
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,520
 We'll put on our conspiracy caps here.

607
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,880
 Our copper coated conspiracy caps here for a second.

608
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,360
 They say that it's owned by that museum, but it's behind the scenes.

609
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,520
 They go, "We can't show it to you.

610
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
 It's too heavy."

611
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,500
 I find it, which might be true.

612
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,680
 I don't know if they have really crummy floors there.

613
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,660
 It is a government building after all.

614
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,020
 I think it's interesting that the, I imagine when I was reading that story that the government

615
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,360
 just wanted to make pennies out of it.

616
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,060
 Why would the secretary of war specifically want it?

617
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,540
 And they kept it up until the year 1860.

618
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,380
 And then the secretary of war goes, "No wars are going to happen.

619
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,860
 We don't foresee a war coming that's going to rip the country apart anytime soon.

620
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,860
 We don't need this ore."

621
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,320
 So then they relinquished control of it and the Smithsonian got it.

622
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,000
 But when I was researching this copper rock, I kind of just stumbled across it.

623
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,680
 And at the same time, in another group of tabs, another group of browser tabs, I was researching

624
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,800
 the story, no joke of the underwater panther of Lake Superior.

625
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,440
 I hadn't even made the connection between the two.

626
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,280
 I had two, I had maybe 24 tabs open spread across two windows.

627
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:33,140
 And in a single evening looking at all these articles, I realized, I can't believe that

628
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,780
 this even happened this way.

629
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,900
 At the same time, in another section, I was looking at this water panther.

630
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,460
 His name is Mishie Peshu.

631
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,900
 And he's very, very well-known in the Great Lakes region.

632
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,860
 Some people say that he's even well-known by the Mississippi mound builders.

633
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,940
 That this was such an important deity for the Native Americans in the Midwest that it

634
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,260
 went down to the South.

635
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,080
 Someone was talking about this guy.

636
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,880
 He was one of those creatures that was both a hero and a villain, depending on his mood

637
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,040
 and depending on what you did.

638
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:13,720
 He could either save you from that boat accident or devour you and everyone back at your tribe.

639
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,600
 It was Mishie Peshu who went to war with the feared thunderbirds.

640
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,800
 The underwater panther was the one creature that could actually destroy the thunderbirds

641
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 that controlled the skies.

642
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,020
 It is what it sounds like.

643
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:34,800
 It was a massive cat, but it also had bison horns and spikes on its back.

644
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,360
 What looked like fur was actually scales to protect it in its war against the thunderbirds.

645
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,900
 It was the master of all underwater creatures.

646
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,140
 If you were able to fish and get a bountiful harvest, it was because of the underwater

647
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,140
 panther.

648
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,900
 If you died in the lakes, in the rivers, in the ponds, it was because you made him mad.

649
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:59,360
 But when he wasn't blowing up thunderbirds or sinking ships or helping them, or both,

650
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,080
 you're on a sinking ship and you look over and he's giving other guys a piggyback ride

651
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,840
 on their boat, he was guarding copper.

652
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,200
 It was the one thing he loved the most.

653
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,120
 If you wanted copper, you had to be very specific where you got it from.

654
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,720
 There was mines all over the area of the Great Lakes where you could harvest this copper.

655
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,580
 But if you got the copper from Mitch Patokin Island, that was HIS copper.

656
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,260
 You never take it from that island.

657
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,420
 He will come for you.

658
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,060
 He will take it back, and that's where those young warriors had gotten it earlier.

659
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,700
 They had gone to this forbidden island and took HIS copper.

660
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,540
 But remember that giant chunk of copper, that boulder?

661
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,700
 It didn't belong on that beach, it came from somewhere else.

662
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,940
 Here is my suggestion.

663
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:53,300
 Years ago an ice flow breaks off a giant chunk of loose copper and pushes it not far from

664
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,780
 that island, but far enough.

665
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,580
 Did the government take possession of this not because they wanted to make a bunch of

666
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
 pennies?

667
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,940
 Did the US War Department take possession of this because they wanted to contact this

668
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,980
 underwater deity to help them in their wars?

669
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,940
 It's far fetched, but we have precedent.

670
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,460
 Just yesterday we talked about the Ethiopian government might have been trying to take

671
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,540
 control of holy muslim relics and trying to take control of the Ark of the Covenant.

672
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,500
 There's all sorts of talk about people searching for the spear of destiny during World War

673
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
 II.

674
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 There's precedent for this.

675
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,500
 Why wouldn't you go after a relic even if you didn't believe in that particular religion?

676
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 Why not go after it?

677
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,660
 And if you had been hearing these stories of stealing copper from this island brings out

678
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,180
 this vengeful god, what happens if you could find a ton of it and move it and take possession

679
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,180
 of it?

680
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,540
 And then you bring in the military brings in their scientists and their mediums and

681
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,220
 their mystics and they study this.

682
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,380
 Some of them just shake their head and go "no it's just copper, I don't know why you're

683
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,940
 here, I'm just a scientist, I'm a chemist."

684
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,180
 But then you'd have the mediums standing over and they're like "this is, this piece of ore

685
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,380
 is actually from that island and the panther has been looking for it.

686
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,820
 We can contact him and ask for his assistance."

687
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,220
 This may have not just been a giant chunk of copper, it could have been a bomb waiting

688
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,380
 to go off.

689
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,540
 Halfway through pushing it through the wilderness of Michigan, that entire crew could have been

690
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,700
 slaughtered, they would have been chalked up to some accident, a wild fair attack or

691
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,660
 they were laid upon by natives in the area.

692
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,540
 Or Julius could have actually got it on the boat and they were sailing away and the boat

693
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,860
 sank in Lake Superior.

694
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,620
 All hands were lost.

695
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,140
 He brings it back to the store and it's just sitting on display, everyone's having a ball

696
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,420
 looking at this giant chunk of metal but one night Julius doesn't open up his store.

697
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,580
 He's never seen again.

698
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,860
 None of these things did happen, so either the underwater panther wasn't aware that

699
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:06,300
 the rock was being moved from its location or it was fully aware of what was going on.

700
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,900
 But it didn't want a trifle in the matter of a bunch of people building a railroad or

701
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,820
 knocking out a boat.

702
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,620
 It was beginning to become forgotten by the people who once worshipped it.

703
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,220
 It wanted a whole new way to access power.

704
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,740
 So when this chunk of ore that an ice flow moved from the underwater panther's island

705
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,900
 to this small tributary is now in the hands of the government in some warehouse, there's

706
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:40,140
 generals and mystics and mediums, stand around it, the underwater panther reappears.

707
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:45,900
 He's now no longer fighting thunderbirds, he's no longer simply guarding Copper in a

708
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,540
 lake.

709
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,900
 He's a weapon of war.

710
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,580
 He helps sink enemy ships.

711
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:59,500
 He destroys enemy aircraft that goes down all hands lost for no reason.

712
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,780
 And you're saying, "Jason, why would a Native American deity align itself with the United

713
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
 States government?

714
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
 Why would it work with the United States government?"

715
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,620
 Oh, I'm not saying that.

716
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,420
 That was the plan.

717
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,060
 But if you look at stories over the millennias, these deals always go wrong.

718
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,740
 The underwater panther isn't working for us.

719
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,820
 Our government is working for it.

720
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,820
 A secret cult.

721
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,460
 A secret god that runs everything in this country.

722
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:37,500
 We thought we were going to control an ancient god, instead we became enthralled to it.

723
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,260
 The underwater panther once ran the Great Lakes region, and the tribes of the area

724
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,100
 worshipped it because they had to.

725
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,660
 Now the underwater panther controls the world.

726
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:59,780
 And you worship it without even knowing.

727
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,980
 It gains in power every single day.

728
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,100
 Now obviously.

729
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,580
 Conspiracy cap fully on.

730
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,780
 Possibly a work of fiction.

731
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
 Possibly.

732
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,780
 But the next time you are at the grocery store, the next time you're spending some money,

733
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,500
 remember that those pennies in your pocket are completely worthless.

734
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,860
 There's no longer any copper in them.

735
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,500
 Where did all of that copper go?

736
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
 Was it an economic decision?

737
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,740
 It was just, it just cost too much to mine the copper, to mint something that was only

738
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,980
 a penny?

739
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,940
 Or are the mining operations still going on full swing?

740
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:47,420
 But all that copper for all those pennies is being sent as an offering to the creature

741
00:36:47,420 --> 00:37:09,500
 that runs the world.

742
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:36,780
 So, that's it.

743
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,360
 (upbeat music)

744
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:49,360
