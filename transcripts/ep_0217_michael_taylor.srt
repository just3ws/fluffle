1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 We kick off totally true week with the story that you didn't think was based on a true story, but is.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at a story which I have a hard time believing is true because I've never heard of it.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 The details are stunning, the crime is chilling, and you'll find out more today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you had a great weekend.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 This is the start of... I don't remember what I called it. I think it was like True Story Week or Too Good to Be True.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I don't know. Anyways, Too Good to Be True actually sounds like a good name. We'll stick with that and see if I remember.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I was thinking I want to do five segments on stuff that people don't know is true, but it's actually based on a true story.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And I found them and I was like, "Oh my god, I found a couple at least." And I was like, "Oh my god, this is like... I didn't know this stuff."

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 One of them I knew was based on a true story, but the rest of them I had no idea. So I went and I could only find four.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Of course, there's like hundreds of things that are based on a true story, but I was like, "I want stuff that people wouldn't assume was based on a true story."

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So I mean, I could have done Titanic or A Few Good Men or whatever. Everyone knows Titanic's based on a true story, but...

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You know, I could have done all this stuff, but I was like, "Come on, was Fight Club based on a true story?"

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Supposedly Child's Play was based on a true story, but it was really some stupid doll that never really moved, or slightly moved its head on windy days.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That was its superpower. I'm like, "That's stupid."

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Yeah, the writers of Chucky May Have Inspired may have been inspired by Robert the Doll, but come on, it's not based on a true story.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But I found some interesting ones. Now, this first one you may go, "But, but, I'll admit, it's the least interesting of the four."

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I won't have one on Wednesday because I can find five of them. It's the least interesting of the four, but it's still very, very interesting on its own.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So, take a sip of a little Diet A&W Root Beer.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The year is 1994. I graduated from high school, but I'm not in this story. This story actually takes place in Hawaii.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But you know, I mean, you had grunge music, was still rockin' hard. The chronic had just come out, I think, about a year earlier, maybe two years earlier.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And in this amazing, exciting time where nothing could ever go wrong, the 90s were great.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I don't think they're necessarily better than now. I think I enjoyed, like, the close and the...

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The year is 1994. An amazing time to live in.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 They haven't made any Matrix sequels yet, so you're, like, excited for what could happen.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 They haven't even made the Matrix yet, but that doesn't matter. Because movies were really kind of just exploding.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 You had the... You had Pulp Fiction really come out. I remember Pulp Fiction came out when I was in high school. I think it was in '93, '94.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Because my brother made me... He didn't make me, but he had me skip school, and then he drove me to go see Pulp Fiction at the local theater, and I was blown away.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I had never seen anything like it. It really was a phenomenal movie. And it's funny, because it basically created an entire new industry of, like, these independent type...

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 The year is 1994. And in the Hawaii... What is it? Would you just call it the Hawaii Islands? Like, do you say you're in Hawaii?

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But then there's particular islands. I'm not... You know, I get that Hawaii's not an actual, like, island. It's like Maui, and then, like, Honolulu. I think that's a city, actually.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But anyway, so, in Hawaii, there is a woman named Michelle Philpots. And what you just experienced with the podcast is what she experiences every single day.

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Every day, 1994 happens again. She suffered a massive brain injury in 1985 in a motorcycle crash. And then in 1990, she was in a car crash.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Only five years later, in other severe car crashes. And at that point, the doctor's... I'm not going to go back in time, so you guys don't have to be paranoid that the episode is going to reset yet.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So, obviously, she's having some serious problems with her brain. Her brain got all bashed up. Now, she doesn't look like a monster. She can still walk around. She can still interact with people.

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 But there was some severe damage going on inside. By 1994, she was diagnosed with epilepsy. So, even though the last accident was a 1990... Well, the last severe accident.

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 She could have been carrying like jam bottles down the stairs and be like, "Woo-oo-oo!" And then like fall down. For all I know, she was a life... She was like a real life goofy.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Well, golly, she's like running through a plate glass window. I don't think Goofy did that. But Goofy was an idiot.

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Now, she could have had a lifetime of bumbling down the stairs and like burglars throwing oil at her feet. And she's like, "Woo-oo-oo!"

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And then those type of hijinks continued after her two massive automobile accidents. But what it seems like, besides her being a member of Goof Troop, is the fact that she was suffered with brain damage in 1990 and then it degenerated over time.

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So, by 1994, she was diagnosed with epilepsy. She was having some major brain rot, basically. She ended up not being able to function in society.

43
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 At one time at work, she printed the same... She would like be sitting at her desk and she goes, "Oh, I need to make a photocopy."

44
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And she went up and she used the photocopy. She'd go back to her desk. She did that all day long once. She kept having such problems with remembering stuff. They had to fire her from work.

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And then what it has finally done is that she had... Like, your doctor's like, "Listen, you have this major brain damage stuff."

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And she's like, "What?" And he's like, "Listen, you have your major brain damage stuff." And she's like, "Golly, what's the brain?"

47
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And he's like, "Ugh." He has to show a video. He has to show a goofy cartoon explaining biology. And she's like, "Yuck, yuck, now I get it."

48
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So, but he's like, "You have some major brain damage." And what they start to figure out is that her brain basically will reset to the year 1994.

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And that, because that's really like when it really had a decline. And she's married, so that helps. But she wakes up and he's like, "Oh, here, I'm your husband. Don't freak out. Don't freak out. I'm your husband."

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Here's wedding photos and stuff like that. She leaves post-it notes on the board so she can wake up and be like, "Who was I?"

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 She has tattooed on her chest like grocery list of what she needs to go shopping. She's trying to make the best of it, but she says,

52
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 "Sometimes it's not even just when I wake up it's 1994. Sometimes I'll just forget I'm talking to you right now."

53
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Now, that's supposedly if you guys have seen the movie "51st Dates" where Adam Sandler is trying to bang this chick who every day she wakes up

54
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and she thinks it's like the 1980s or something like that. It was funny. I don't think it was his best film, but it was definitely the,

55
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 I think the first Adam Sandler you could take your date to. Maybe that was wedding singer, but, you know, it was just like it was just kind of a charming,

56
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 romantic comedy and da-da-da-da. I liked it. I only saw it once. It was, I mean, it was just an okay movie. I know other people love it.

57
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 But anyway, so that's the true story behind "51st Dates." Now, the writers didn't pay her any money for it. They were just basing it on stuff.

58
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So I'm reading it and I was like, "That's interesting. Who would have thought that a movie like "51st Dates" would actually have a true story behind it?"

59
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 The end. But then I thought, there's some, I read a bunch of articles about this and I could totally be wrong, but there's some weird stuff that goes on in this story

60
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 with this story. Now, she obviously did, you're like, "Great. Jason, now you're being skeptical about a woman's mental brain damage. Hear me out. Hear me out."

61
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 She's making the photocopy over and over again. And I've read, that experience was listed in almost every article I read.

62
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It's like she even got fired from her work for making a photocopy of the same page for a day. And I'm thinking, one, a journalist has obviously never worked in an office building

63
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 because a lot of people are that stupid in an office building. Two, how would you fire an employee who didn't remember they got fired?

64
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Like she would have, how long did it take for her to realize she didn't work there? How do you fire someone who doesn't remember they're fired?

65
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 That should be an Adam Sandler comedy. But a guy who gets fired from an ad agency suffers massive brain trauma and then comes back the next day and the whole movie is just so sad.

66
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 It's so sad because he looks forward to going to work each day and each day he goes home absolutely crushed. And then he wakes up and he's super happy to go again.

67
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But that's not why I'm skeptical of this story. One of the parts said that in the very matter of factually they're like, "Hey, you put Post-it notes up around the house so she knows what to do that day."

68
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And let me say this, when I say I'm skeptical, I think she does brain damage. I think they've sexed it up. I think they've made it a little more sexy.

69
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 She puts up the Post-it notes around her house and then when she goes out, she keeps a little GPS unit on her so she knows how to get back home.

70
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Now, think about it, and this is why she probably has a really, really bad memory. But I don't think she actually like resets to 1994.

71
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Because again, how unsettling would that be to wake up in bed and with the guy next to you. Now, they got married in 1997, but I guess they grew up together so she'd be like, "Oh my God, it's my best friend, why are we in bed together? Oh my God, what did I do last night?

72
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I don't want to ruin our friendship." And he's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm way past the friend zone now. Way past the friend zone."

73
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Here's her wedding album. That would be literally the first two or three hours of your day. And then she would go up and she'd be looking at the Post-it notes, she's like, "What, Pake Satellite Cable Bill? What? What satellite? What's cable? What is all this nonsense?"

74
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 She's wearing baggy jeans and a flammable shirt, putting her baseball cap on backwards, getting a skateboard, and her husband's like, "No, no, no, we don't do that."

75
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 So, yeah, it just is weird. And then every time she went outside, she'd be like walking around Hawaii and she's like, "Good thing I have this GPS so I can find my way home. Oh my God, what is this amazing piece of technology?"

76
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 It's like, as a little picture of me walking on the street, who's watching me, who tagged me? And then there would be a post-it note on it and it would be like, "Don't be afraid of the magical watch you're wearing. It's modern technology in the year 2018. It will protect you."

77
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And then she's like, "Oh yeah, yeah, I forgot. I keep forgetting stuff." Then she takes the post-it note off, walking down five minutes later, she's like, "Oh my God, why is this magical device on my hand? Like, how would you even function outside of a medical facility?"

78
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And the articles are like, "Well, every episode of EastEnders is new." Wait a second, she's not in Hawaii? Why isn't she in Hawaii?

79
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Oh, because the movie takes place in Hawaii. She's from England. She is not from Hawaii. People who probably know the story are like, "This guy's an idiot." I'm not going to go back and edit it. I'm not going to go back and fix it because I love that little intro, but anyways, forget Hawaii. Forget Hawaii.

80
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 She's in England. Jolly old England. Sorry about that. That is actually, I think it's while I'm mocking, not mocking. I love it how an episode where I'm talking about forgetfulness, I forget countries and states.

81
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Anyways, so that's the story of Michelle Philpots. That's a very Hawaiian name, very, very Hawaiian. You can tell she's a local. Michelle Philpots, the Hawaiian woman who lost her memory and inspired 51st States in a roundabout way.

82
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But again, I think that in real life she just has a crippling mental illness or brain damage and all these journalists go, "Hey, that vaguely reminds us of this comedy. Let's do that."

83
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 That'd be like them taking a church shooting and being like, "Hey, remember that movie Wedding Crashers? I wonder if we can angle this in."

84
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Sometimes it won't work just because they both involve people going into churches and other people wanting to keep them out. You can't really angle it that way.

85
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 But Michelle, I hope you get better and I hope you visit Hawaii. I hear it's a beautiful state, but you probably want to remember that it was there.

86
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 But again, I wish you the best. I'm not skeptical. I don't think she's faking it. I just think the journalists take on it, not accurate.

87
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to this other story here. Now, this story is particularly odd because it's one that I've never heard of.

88
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And you may go, "Well, Jason, you're not the watcher. You don't know everything."

89
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 But there are certain stories that, based on what you read and based on the type of stuff you're into, you should know. You don't necessarily have to know all the details, but you should have an idea of what it is.

90
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But yeah, this story really is shocking. Shocking story.

91
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And I think the reason why I probably don't know about it is because it's in England. This one actually is in England and it took place quite a while ago, but still.

92
00:13:48,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Why bizarre. Let's go ahead and get into this. Let's leave Hawaii, hop in the rabbit rowboat, and we're going to row all the way from Hawaii to the town of Osit, which is in Yorkshire, England.

93
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Now, if I had done my previous story fine, we'd probably just crossed the street. I hope you enjoyed the boat ride because this story is creepy and 100% true. Quite odd. Quite odd story.

94
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 There's a dude named Michael Taylor. He's 31 years old. He's married. He has kids. But he suffered a back injury. He had a pretty bad back injury and not only was he dealing with the physical pain of it, but he lost his job because of his back injury.

95
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So he's sitting at home. He's on the dole. He's not having a good life. He feels like an utter failure. Wife and kids depend on him and he can't even really move about that much.

96
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He's just crushed, literally, because his back is all jacked up, and emotionally, because he doesn't feel like a man anymore.

97
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And a friend of his says, "Hey, hey Michael, why don't you come join our prayer group? I think that would be good for you to kind of get out of the house.

98
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It'd be a good group of people to hang out with. It might be the right thing for you." Now Michael's like, "Yeah, maybe." But eventually he does go. He does go to this prayer group.

99
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And there's this super hot chick. It's run by this super hot chick named Mary Robinson, this 22-year-old girl. She's running this prayer group.

100
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Now it was like an angelic prayer group, but it was almost like a little bit of offshoot of the angelic church as well.

101
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And while they're there, Mary Robinson, they're doing like this, not ceremony, but just like a standard, like, "Get up and pray, pray to the Lord."

102
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 That's more like the black church in America, but they're singing, they're dancing, and Mary Robinson starts speaking in tongues.

103
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Now speaking in tongues is not necessarily just blah, blah, blah, it's this weird language that's supposedly like Anokian or the language of angels being spoken by humans.

104
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 So it sounds weird, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da, beat-a-ba-da,

105
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 So it sounds weird, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

106
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 The passion of your God that you just start speaking gibberish, it could be some actual manifestation of some sort of angelic power. I don't know. Never really looked into it.

107
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Probably should, because I do a paranormal podcast, but I never really looked into it. But anyways, you get to the story of Mary Robinson, time to time to time to shoot, time to time to shoot, time to time to time to shoot.

108
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And then Michael, and you're supposed to be quite devout or have a connection to God to be able to do this.

109
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 It's not like you're just walking on the street like some hobo. Well, no hobos would talk like that. It's not like some like atheist should be able to start speaking the language of the angels.

110
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 But Michael is sitting there and he gets caught up and he starts speaking in tongues, like, "Bam!" And everyone else is shocked because they have their spiritual leader in Mary,

111
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 but now this guy, his very first meeting, begins exhibiting the same powers that she has. People are like, "That's really bizarre."

112
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, people are impressed. And he's like, "I don't know where that came from. I just started speaking gibberish."

113
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, you're speaking in tongues. It's the language of the angels. Everyone's laying hands on him and all that stuff."

114
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 So he starts actually hanging out with Mary Robinson a lot. She's giving him one-on-one counseling and trying to lead his spiritual journey.

115
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But the wife is now, this is over the course of months at this point, the wife is at home alone.

116
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And he's like, every night going out to hang out with this super hot chick and he's like, "Oh, don't worry, honey. We're just gonna go praise the Lord. Praise the Lord!"

117
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And like runs out of the house. And then obviously after that happens, like, the tenth hundredth time, she begins to think and they're having an affair.

118
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 He comes back. He's all sweaty. He's clothes are on backwards. He's like, "Man, I sure had a good time praising the Lord tonight. Praise the Lord!"

119
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And then just like falls asleep on the couch. He goes, "What? Why are y'all covered in lipstick? Oh no, that's the angels lipstick. Praise the Lord!"

120
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 So anyway, so Christine though realizes, I gotta do something about this. He's cheating on me. Nobody loves Jesus that much.

121
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 So she goes to the prayer meeting and Christine walks in. His wife Christine walks in and as they're dancing around speaking in tongues,

122
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 she accuses Mary Robinson and her husband Michael Taylor of banging, bumping uglies.

123
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And she begins like calling out Mary in the middle of this prayer group. Now everyone else is completely shocked because he wasn't having an affair with her.

124
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They realize how devout he was. He really was spending all this time with her. They were praying and talking about spiritual stuff.

125
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 They weren't banging each other. But Christine is like, "Oh, you know, you're banging my man. You're banging my man. Let's go. Let's go."

126
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 She's basically like straight up trying to gypsy. She wants to bring her out in the alleyway and beat her up.

127
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But while she's yelling at Mary, almost like, you know those movies where there's like a baby and there's like two sets of parents

128
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 and they're like, "Come to me, baby. I'm the one who really loves you and like the mean parents."

129
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You're like, "No, no, no. Come to us. We'll give you riches." And the baby's like trying to figure out which team to choose.

130
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 That was kind of what happened, except to replace baby with killer pit bull.

131
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Because as Mary is trying to defend herself and say, "Listen, we're not having an affair. Michael, tell her we're not having an affair. We've never had an affair."

132
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Then Michael's turning to Christine and Christine is saying, "I know you're having an affair. That slut, that hussy, she's sleeping with you."

133
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And he's like trying to figure out what team to go on.

134
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 He then turns to Mary and just straight up gets on top of her and starts attacking her. Completely overpowers her.

135
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And everyone in this church like totally flips out.

136
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And they're trying to pull this grown man off this 22-year-old girl and they're having a real hard time doing it.

137
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And they finally throw him off, kick him and his wife out.

138
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Now, he didn't like beat her to death, but it wasn't, he also wasn't, it wasn't heavy petting.

139
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Like he roughed this chick up to the point that he's like, they kicked him out.

140
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 They said, "You're never coming back to this church."

141
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 So he goes home with his wife.

142
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 But the next day him and his wife show back up at the prayer meeting because it was like this.

143
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And this is where it should start be setting off alarm bells.

144
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 They're here almost all the time.

145
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 They show back up to the prayer meeting and they said, "I'm sorry. She's sorry for accusing us of having an affair and I'm sorry for beating you up."

146
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 "Do you forgive us?"

147
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And the group goes, "Yeah, we forgive you. Come on in. Let's praise the Lord. Praise the Lord."

148
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Now, in this area, this little group, they had a...

149
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 People thought they were a cult.

150
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 People knew it was connected to like major denominations.

151
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 But this particular group of people were kind of considered a cult.

152
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They seemed too religious. That makes sense.

153
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Like they seemed too, too into it.

154
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 But what, we'll get to, and that will come up later.

155
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 But what happens at this point is that word gets out that Michael had attacked Mary.

156
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And she's a little more cautious. I don't think they're having their one-on-one meetings anymore.

157
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 But so what happens is the vicar of the church gets involved and he goes,

158
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 "Based on everything that I know that he showed up, he started speaking in tongues immediately."

159
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 "He's been super obsessed with God and all this stuff."

160
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "And his attack of Mary, I think he's possessed."

161
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I think he's possessed. So it's fine that you're letting him come back to the meetings,

162
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 but I think we have to do an exorcism on him.

163
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And they go, "Well, listen, the vicar thinks you're possessed and we want to do an exorcism on you."

164
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 He goes, "I think that's a good idea."

165
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So on October 5th, 1974, two ministers, a Methodist and an Angelic,

166
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 walk into an exorcism room and they're like, "Hey, why the long face?"

167
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But no, they go into this room with Michael and they begin performing an exorcism.

168
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Seven hours, they're in there.

169
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Get out, demons! Get out, demons!

170
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And you think, "Okay, well, you know, that's weird."

171
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He just seemed like he kind of had a bad back and stuff like that.

172
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And then he attacked some woman because his wife was basically mad at her.

173
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 What really, like, when you think of exorcisms, you think of people throwing up blood and headspinning around

174
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 and flying around the room and stupid stuff like that.

175
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 But anyways, the seven hour long exorcism for what this guy was doing was basically just kind of being a layabout

176
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 and a loud and then attacking a woman. Seven hours to do that.

177
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 But the priests come out and they go, "Listen, this dude is chock full of demons."

178
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Got a ton of them in him.

179
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 They actually said he has 40 demons inside of him.

180
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It's gonna take a while. And people are like, "What? That guy seemed totally normal.

181
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 You're telling us he has 40 demons inside?"

182
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 "Yeah, we gotta get back there."

183
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So after seven hours from October 5th, now we're in the morning of October 6th, they say,

184
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 "Okay, we're done." And they're like, "All 40 are gone?"

185
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And they're like, "Eh, not exactly."

186
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 We're just tired. We're super tired. This is a really exhausting thing to do.

187
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 So we've gotten the demons out of him.

188
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 We've gotten 37 of the demons out of him.

189
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Some of the demons that these ministers said that came out of him was incest, bestiality, blasphemy,

190
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 lewdness, masochism, heresy, and carnal knowledge.

191
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So quite the list of sins just flowing around in this dude's body.

192
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And they're like, "Okay, see you later."

193
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And people, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait. You said you got 37 of the demons out of him

194
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and you can name some of them. What are the names of the three demons that are still in him?"

195
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 The priest turns around and says, "Anger, insanity, and murder."

196
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 But some sunglasses walks through his car and they're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

197
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I don't care if he is being in bestiality. I don't care if he's lewd. That's fine.

198
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Go come back and get out insanity, anger, and murder."

199
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And the priest said, "Listen, we're really, really tired.

200
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 What harm can happen in the next few hours?

201
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 We're gonna start the exorcism again this afternoon.

202
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Just, we have to get rest. He needs to get rest."

203
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Now you're thinking, "Okay, Jason, this story is fake.

204
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Like, this story is just too good to be true."

205
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And if it wasn't for basically the police reports that follow and the court documents, you're right.

206
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 When I was reading the story, I had a really hard time believing that any of this stuff was true.

207
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 'Cause I didn't know how it was gonna end either.

208
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Could just be, and then one day he came home and it turns out that that was the day he died 20 years ago.

209
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And the whole thing was an hallucination of his insane wife.

210
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 I didn't know where it was going.

211
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Two hours after the exorcism, and they left insanity, anger, and murder.

212
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Aim! They left aim inside of him.

213
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 They're like, "Oh, the priest's right home kicking up on the couch.

214
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 We did a pretty good job. Oh, yeah, man. Getting that incest out of him.

215
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Man, that was quite the honor."

216
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 They're like, "Are you sure we shouldn't have gotten the murder out?"

217
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 "No, no, no, he'll be fine. What trouble can someone get into?"

218
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Two hours after the exorcism, police get a report of a naked man walking down the street covered in red paint.

219
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Cop car, woo, woo, what's all this then they get out with their billy clubs?

220
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 They see the naked man dripping with this red paint and he's saying,

221
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 "It's the blood of Satan. It's the blood of Satan. It's the blood of Satan. It's the blood of Satan. It's the blood of Satan."

222
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And while he's saying all this stuff, a neighbor comes out and he goes,

223
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 "Uh, I know that guy, and he has a wife and kids."

224
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And the cops are like, at this point they're like, he's not, they could tell it wasn't paint,

225
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 but they don't know if he's injured himself or somebody else.

226
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 But when the neighbor said, "I know who that is," and that's his house over there, and he has a wife and kids,

227
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 the cops are like, "You stay here. I'm gonna go check out his house."

228
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Police go to his house. First off, they find his dog.

229
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Now if you have a problem with dog injury stories, you just start fast-forwarding.

230
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 They walk into Michael's house two hours after this exorcism.

231
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 They find his dog strangled and all four limbs pulled out of the socket.

232
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Just furious anger to do something like that.

233
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Cop looks at his partner. "What the... Oh my God."

234
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Step over it, put a little evidence tag next to it.

235
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 The guy's like, "I don't think you're gonna forget that's there.

236
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 I don't think you need to put an evidence tag there."

237
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Shh, there wouldn't be someone else in the house, but you're right.

238
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I probably didn't need to put one there. That's gonna haunt my dreams forever.

239
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 They go and they find Christine in the house.

240
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 She's dead. With her eyeballs ripped out, her tongue pulled out by hand,

241
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 and just using his hands, Michael ripped her face off.

242
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 It's just hanging partially still on her skull.

243
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 She died from choking on her own blood when her tongue was ripped out.

244
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 So now, big trial. Obviously he gets arrested.

245
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 The defense basically says, he was the victim of a cult,

246
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 that this group of people were so wacky that they found this guy who was so mentally damaged

247
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 that they were going to kind of take advantage of him.

248
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Imagine if you were already having some depression issues,

249
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 and then you found a group of friends and they started hanging out with you,

250
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 and then they said you were mentally ill, but they could fix you by doing,

251
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 removing a curse on you, and then at the end they said,

252
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 "Well, we got most of it except for the insanity, anger, and murder part. See you tomorrow."

253
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 If he was already on the edge, if he already believed these demons were in him,

254
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 then that could have set him off.

255
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And he was found not guilty due to insanity, which is a super, super rare way to win a case.

256
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 It's very, very hard to win not guilty due to insanity.

257
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 He did two years in one mental institution, did two years in another mental institution,

258
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 and he was 31 in 1974, so he would be, what would that be, another 40 years since?

259
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Yeah, yeah, about that, about 40 years.

260
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 So he'd be in his 70s now. I couldn't find any proof that he had died since then.

261
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 We do know in 2005 though he was re-arrested for fangolin,

262
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 like a teenage girl or a preteen girl or something like that,

263
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 so then he was brought back into the court system, and then he's just kind of disappeared.

264
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 But I was reading that story and I thought, "How, how, one, how come they've never made a movie of this yet?"

265
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Because it's just so compelling, too. How have I never come across this in any of my research ever?

266
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Because it really is right up that trifecta of things that I look at.

267
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 It has the paranormal aspects with the demons, it has the conspiracy with the cult angle,

268
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 and it has the true crime with ripping eyeballs, and how do you rip someone's face off with your bare hands?

269
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 But he did it, and he got away with it.

270
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 I mean, I've seen photos of the guy. He basically looks like Hank Hill. He's just like a shlub.

271
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 The strength it would take to peel someone's face off with your bare hands is outrageous.

272
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Truly outrageous. Jim couldn't even do it.

273
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 So when you look at stuff like that, is it possible that this man was actually demonically possessed?

274
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 I know that the court system was like, "Ah, the church, the bloody church, they set him up to do this,

275
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 and they made him think he was insane and demons and all this stuff."

276
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 It wasn't his fault, but what I think is creepy about this is that we don't have any evidence that he was violent or angry

277
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 before he started going to the church.

278
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 It was when he got there that we see this behavior, and I think that's why people go,

279
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 he was mentally, he probably had some underlying depression, obviously that,

280
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 but some underlying mental illness issues got hooked up with these bunch of religious nut jobs,

281
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 and then just ran with it.

282
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 But let's take the paranormal angle.

283
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Imagine you are a demon, and you're like, "Oh, that's awesome. I'm totally buff with giant wings now."

284
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But imagine you're a demon looking for the perfect target to take down.

285
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Are you really going to find like goth kids and being like, "Yeah, these kids are so edgy, they're going to summon me,

286
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and I'm going to make them like buy extra cigarettes?"

287
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 You want to go after something juicier than that.

288
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 You really want to earn your bones, earn your wings.

289
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 You could hang out outside cemeteries.

290
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 You could hang out at punk rock clubs.

291
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 You could hang out at heroin dens.

292
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 But what if you just hung outside of a church, just stood there in the darkness watching everyone who walks by,

293
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 and you're like, "No, no, I'm good, no, no."

294
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And then one day you see a man coming in, and it's just delicious looking.

295
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 You can see his pain.

296
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 You see him walking under the church, and you're like, "That's what I want."

297
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 He's weak.

298
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 He has a bit of hope.

299
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He has a family.

300
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I don't necessarily think there were 40 demons in him, and there's like one demon that just sits around,

301
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 and he's like, "Man, I want to be lewd. I want to be lewd."

302
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 But I will say that it's possible that this man was demonically possessed.

303
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 That's within my wheelhouse of beliefs.

304
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 I think that Michael Taylor was possessed by a demon.

305
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Was he possessed by a demon long before he got to the church,

306
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 and he was just in waiting, waiting for a trigger?

307
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Or was it like my scenario, where the demon was looking for something to not only attack

308
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 that was starting off its churchgoing experience,

309
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 but to actually make the church look bad as well?

310
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 It never really says, but I doubt this prayer group met many times, if at all, after this.

311
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Mary Robinson's name was in the news. The whole story was out.

312
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 She was having the affair, but she wasn't having the affair, and all of this stuff gets out.

313
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 It's so funny because the movie The Exorcist came out around this time,

314
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 and this was basically a real-life version of that.

315
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It didn't have the creepy girl. It didn't have some of the hallmark elements,

316
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 but it has a poodle getting its legs ripped off, and a woman getting her face peeled off by hand.

317
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 That's some Hellraiser stuff. That's way more intense than Exorcist.

318
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Because it's real, and it's gross, and it's sticky, and it's wet,

319
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 and that is exactly what a demon would want.

320
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 I said earlier I don't know if Michael Taylor is still alive,

321
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 but I can almost guarantee that the demon is.

322
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 But you have to wonder, is it out there? Is it still out there at some church?

323
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 It had so much fun last time taking a body for a joyride

324
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and experiencing the pleasures of the flesh with the power of dark forces.

325
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Is it out there again just looking for someone to take over

326
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 and then become a forgotten story, but the demon never forgets how much fun it has.

327
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
