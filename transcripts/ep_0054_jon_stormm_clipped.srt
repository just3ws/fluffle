1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 The deadliest tree in the world that you can't even stand underneath when it rains.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,240
 And we take a look at one of the most dangerous men on the planet, according to himaly's

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,600
 John Storm today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. Just a quick update.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,760
 I am going to end up taking a week off of the show. We're going to go ahead and do a couple

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,640
 more episodes to fill this week out. And then the last and then next week I won't be producing any

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,080
 episodes. It's not that the reptilians got me or the Illuminati has me in their basement. I'm just

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,640
 taking a week off for vacation. I've been on vacation for about two weeks now and I've still

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,200
 been putting out episodes. But that last week I think I'm going to take off. So there's a possibility

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
 that I might release an episode or two during that week. But for right now you're going to get four

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,400
 more episodes. Then there'll be a week break and then I will be back. Don't know if we're calling

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,240
 it season two yet. Probably not. Actually I already know I'm not going to do that. But so yeah,

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
 we're going to take a week off. We're going to have about four more episodes take a week off and

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,040
 we will be back at the beginning of September for a whole new batch of episodes just to give

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,280
 it a little time. It's actually the hardest part of doing this show on vacation is not the recording

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,560
 but the research. We're going to go ahead and see how this goes. It's possible that I'll release

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,680
 episodes but just to heads up if I don't that's why I'm not kidnapped. Okay let's go ahead and get

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,160
 on with the first story. So you've listened to the show long enough. Maybe you're a first listener.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,040
 Thanks for listening to Dead or Ever Radio. And you guys know I mispronounce stuff. This story

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,880
 involves a tree and I'll probably going to mispronounce it too. It is called the Mancheele Tree.

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,840
 The Manny Cheele Tree. Whatever it's called it's creepy and I never want to see one. So

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,400
 okay so the more we'll call it the man the Mancheele Tree because that's the easiest way to pronounce it.

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,040
 And I think that's actually the way you pronounce it but the Mancheele Tree

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,000
 is a tree that's found in like the Caribbean. It's actually some in Florida and South America,

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,160
 the northern part of South America. It is a tree that produces like fruit like trees do.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,320
 Delicious looking fruit apparently. So much so that they have to put signs in near the trees.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,960
 They'll have signs that say the leaves, bark, and fruits of these trees contain a caustic sap

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,320
 which may be injurious if touched. Columbus described the small green fruits as death apples.

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,840
 The trees are common along Caribbean shores. Avoid contact with any part of this tree exclamation

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
 point. When I say signs I don't mean that there's like signs in the tourist lobby. These signs are

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,680
 nailed up outside like right next to the tree. You're not supposed to go anywhere. The trees are

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,520
 super toxic to actually almost all living creatures. There's certain lizards that like hang out in them

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,440
 and eat the fruit and they have no problem with it. But animals stay away from them, humans are

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,280
 supposed to stay away from them. If you chop them down the sap is toxic, can cause blisters. Eating

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,040
 the fruit can kill you. It'll definitely blister up your throat and cause severe burning and start

37
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,200
 to close up your esophagus. There's actually a researcher went to a beach and was like oh look

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,400
 I would never just eat random fruit. I'd barely eat fruit at the store. So the fact of someone

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,720
 walking along the beach and going hey look at here's this thing I've never seen. Let's put it in

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,040
 our mouths. That's super bizarre. But anyway so this researcher was there with I think it was her

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,480
 friend and they take these fruit and she gives it to her friend and says hey let's eat these.

42
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,560
 Weird enough. 15 minutes later they're coughing and gagging. They poisoned themselves on this tree.

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,320
 Now I know what you're thinking. This tree is so toxic. Why do we allow them to grow? Like why don't

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,360
 we chop them all down? Oh and the other thing is even being under the tree while it's raining

45
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,280
 can cause the liquid to come you know like the tree chemicals to come off and land on you

46
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,160
 and start to burn you. Oh and you're not supposed to burn them either because the smoke will also

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,200
 cause respiratory problems and skin problems and all that stuff. Super toxic. Super super toxic.

48
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,080
 Now so your question is before I so rudely interrupted you earlier Jason if these trees

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,520
 are so dangerous why do we keep them growing? Well because they're actually supposedly like

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,240
 really good for the ecosystem and they help like shore up um what's this stuff called erosion. Like

51
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,800
 they help prevent erosion on the beach so they do serve a purpose just you know stay away from them.

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,200
 The legend goes that the explorer famed explorer Pawn Staleon was killed by one of these trees not

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,080
 like it was an ant and chased them around but that the indigenous people stuck their spears into the

54
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,640
 apple juice I guess or the sap and then shot them with one and if that arrow gets in you then you

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,760
 start blistering from the inside out and you look like you made a bad wish from a wish master

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,520
 and you killed them. That's a legend though they don't know for sure if that's what happened.

57
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,640
 I just think it's interesting there are actually a surprising amount of plants that kill people

58
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,040
 right on site not on site but I mean there's a good amount of just like poison that's around.

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,280
 As I was researching this story I found out there used to be an issue with cow's milk being poisoned

60
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,360
 because back in olden times and not like Assyrian olden times but Abraham Lincoln's mom died because

61
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,240
 cows were eating this poisonous herb near where the cows were and then they made their milk poisonous

62
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
 and then the farmers would just sell the milk. Well they didn't know it was poisonous but

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,200
 you know they would just distribute the milk as normal and his mom died from poison milk

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,480
 and then eventually the farm and this was a national problem it wasn't just this one farm.

65
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,800
 Once the farmers realized what was going on they had to start like destroying the weeds

66
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
 near the cows but cows are stupid they'll eat anything so yeah I mean there's a lot of poisonous

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
 plants out there. I think it's interesting because hot peppers are technically supposed to be

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,280
 not necessarily poisonous but the capsaicin is supposed to be a defense mechanism. The pepper

69
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,600
 plants are like dude if I evolve them evolve and then they like evolved capsaicin and they're like

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,800
 I'll do this is awesome no one wants to eat me I can freely just germinate nobody has to you know

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,880
 I'm just shooting seeds out of me I guess that's how plants work and then they're like I have the

72
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,920
 perfect defense mechanism who wants to eat spicy food dogs don't want to do it birds don't want to

73
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,000
 do it and then we're like eventually humans are like oh dude this is spicy I'm gonna mass like

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,640
 I'm gonna create a genocide like I'm going to grow you just for the purpose of cutting you open

75
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,040
 when you get top spiciness I'm actually going to breed you to be as spicy as possible so that was

76
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,880
 a defense mechanism that actually made us eat them made us go that you're more delicious than

77
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,160
 that I don't know st germain root over there I don't think that's real but you get my point

78
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,360
 it's a self-defense mechanism that actually encourages us to eat them so sometimes it doesn't

79
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,360
 work manchill tree sometimes we we may start finding you delicious I won't know because you

80
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:12,000
 sound terrifying having lesions in my throat would be bad I once I found out about butt herpes you

81
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,760
 get a herpes sore in your butt that sounds terrifying as well anything that has to do with

82
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,440
 your digestive system having open sores no way because you use it all the time so one thing you

83
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,320
 use all the time whether or not you're sick or healthy or bedridden or run up a mountain

84
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,360
 you gotta eat and you gotta poop so I don't want anything that has to do with either of those

85
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,800
 having open so open sores I can have an open sore in my hand I can have an open sore in my ear but

86
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,840
 I don't want one in my esophagus let's talk about john storm john storm actually is going to lead

87
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,040
 into another story we're going to do tomorrow but to really I originally tried to do it all in one

88
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,640
 story and I thought no because john storm is going to set up some of the major issues I have with the

89
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,920
 next story tomorrow so a little bit of a teaser so who is john storm I know what you're thinking

90
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,560
 hey isn't he johnny storm the meant for the human torch from fantastic four yes he is but that's not

91
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,480
 the one we're talking about we're talking about a guy who calls himself john storm who believes

92
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:20,080
 he is a superhero now not in the sense of stockton's batman we covered him on an earlier show who is a

93
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:30,880
 concerned citizen stopping crime john storm believes that he actually has 100 mutant powers powers that

94
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,040
 were given to him by the government so he believes that john storm is probably like 67 at this point

95
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,760
 he's in his late 60s so let me tell you his version of events so when he was a baby he was brought into

96
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,080
 the he was basically brought into mk ultra which was mk ultra was a secret government program to

97
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,040
 test mind control techniques on us citizens for the most part so they introduced lsd into them

98
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
 and they did all these sort of mind games and a couple of people died and a couple of people went

99
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,520
 crazy and it got disclosed and it was quote unquote shut down now in john storm's world that's not

100
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:13,360
 what happened mk ultra was about building super soldiers highly classified mobile units of just

101
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,880
 you could drop him into vietnam and he would be snapping necks and killing people and then come

102
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,480
 back to the base and smoke a cigar and the highest general general would be thank you john storm for

103
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,440
 your service he believes that he believes that he was dropped into the jungles of vietnam by himself

104
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,600
 taken out people one on one he believes he has a sonic scream attack that he yells and using

105
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,720
 key energy defends you and it's the last sound you'll ever hear he believes he did not age from

106
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,880
 20 to 40 did not show any signs of aging whatsoever he looked exactly the same he was the perfect

107
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,960
 genetic specimen created by the u.s government and now he's turned against them now he knows

108
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,280
 he knows they programmed him to fight and to kill in a dishonest war and all the special

109
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,120
 weaponry that they gave him all the special training they gave him the psychic reserves the

110
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:21,280
 just ability to do insane martial art maneuvers jumping off walls flicking people so hard in the

111
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:28,880
 forehead they fly across the room and fracture their skull now he's going to use that those skills

112
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,480
 to save us us homo sapiens us normal people he's going to use them when you come across stuff like

113
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,880
 this there's always the question because i've read a ton about this guy there's always the question

114
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,680
 is he delusional enough to believe that he was created by the u.s government oh oh oh and you're

115
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,880
 thinking okay jason there are people who are trained by the u.s government who are dropped into vietnam

116
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,360
 and take out people and stuff like that sure enough do they know spider-man because he does

117
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,040
 john storm also in vietnam met peter parker a young black man who went by the co-named spider-man

118
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:14,240
 who who is an expert acrobatic martial artist and they'd used to spar and he goes he had this great

119
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,520
 move so john storms like six foot five but peter parker aka spider-man could do back flips over

120
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,080
 his head and kick him in the back of the head john storms quick to point out he didn't kick me that

121
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,920
 hard because he knew better it was just kind of a love tap because john storm knows that he can

122
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,200
 actually kill spider-man in real life and then years later john storm is in new york and he went

123
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,800
 to a circus and who was there a guy dressed as spider-man jumping around and john storm goes hey

124
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
 it's you peter parker and he goes it is me and then they went into the dressing room and they

125
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,920
 fought some more and they had a couple drinks so i mean there's the yes the military trains people

126
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,280
 really really well they don't train people named john storm and peter parker aka spider-man

127
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,440
 they don't train you and and he said what they do is they break your bones over and over again to

128
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,400
 make your bones stronger that was something he endured as an infant infant that's not how it

129
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,720
 works dude you get mic for okay i don't know why i'm quibbling because there's so much to cover

130
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,160
 with this guy so yes he makes outrageous claims now let me go back to the thing so he's either

131
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,760
 delusional and he actually believes that he knows spider-man and that he has these super he's a

132
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,840
 trained ninja who has like 140 missions under his belt he actually believes that or he's ripping

133
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,920
 people off and he's telling these stories to young men and women and being like yes i was a super

134
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,360
 soldier once there's a picture of him wearing like 1970s clothes because he is actually quite old at

135
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,480
 this point and on the picture it says in this photo are two knives eight shirking three chain weapons

136
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
 and blah blah blah and you're like it's supposed to be like look at what a badass i am i have all

137
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,200
 these weapons hidden and i can understand if i was a 16 year old boy being like oh yeah do this

138
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,440
 guy's totally awesome this guy's a super soldier and he was trained by the government but now he's

139
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,680
 using his powers to help us he constantly asks for money and that's what makes me suspicious

140
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,200
 that he doesn't even believe these claims he constantly asks for money because at a certain

141
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,880
 point we don't have any proof that he ever served in the military at all he has conveniently photos

142
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,600
 of his MRIs that he posts online and it's like look at here that's an implant look at here that black

143
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,120
 spot i don't know what that is well why are you circling it then if you don't know what it is but

144
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,360
 anyway so he can provide photos of his MRIs but i'm not seeing any he talks about being discharged

145
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,560
 or honorably discharged he talks about the the government now needs to stop him they're constantly

146
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,240
 trying to kill him and at one point he went to his pharmacy and the pharmacy tried to kill him the

147
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,640
 pharmacist tried to kill him and then he leaves the pharmacy he never goes into much detail with

148
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,920
 these claims then he leaves the pharmacy and a car almost hits him and he's like yeah luckily then he

149
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,880
 almost gets hit by an other car and another story i'm thinking how often is this guy jaywalking i know

150
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,720
 this sounds super rambly and it might be but trust me this is going to pay off maybe maybe i should

151
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,960
 have included it all in one episode so we have this guy who's a super soldier who was trained by

152
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,760
 the US government they're they're out to get him and he's ready to fight them so that's his story

153
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,680
 now we're going to jump to what's really going on post youtube videos of him showing crotty tricks

154
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,800
 him singing songs and him complaining about the cops coming into his house and he's like

155
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,520
 oh and the other thing all he does is talk about how he's diabetic and has an arcolepsy

156
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:51,520
 narcolepsy to the point that he passes out and sleeps through his next next insulin shot

157
00:14:51,520 --> 00:15:00,080
 and gets sick how are you a super soldier bro how uh the explanation i'm sure he has one

158
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:06,640
 that the all of the testing in him has started to break down his body and now he needs diabetes

159
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,880
 and anti-narcoleptic medicine that's why he's going to the pharmacy all the time so he claims

160
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,720
 he was a super soldier now he has our narcolepsy and he needs insulin shots all the time he claims

161
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,800
 the government is after him but he gets disability so the government knows where it's at the government

162
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,840
 wanted to stop him they could just stop giving him disability checks and say oh it was an error

163
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,880
 it was an error or just say you know what john storm yes you are a secret operative that we created

164
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,400
 and you've gone rogue guess what you're not getting your seat you're not we're not getting your

165
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,080
 disability checks anymore he's created this world where both things can be true he depends on the

166
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,800
 government for his medication and his money yet the he's the biggest threat to the government

167
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
 and they're going to stop him at any cost even to the point of contacting his pharmacist to have him

168
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,760
 killed and when that fails to have him slightly hit by a car a block away from the pharmacist

169
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 and when that fails have him slightly hit by a car later on you're praying on people one way or

170
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:14,080
 the other you're either delusional and you're bringing people into your delusion or you know it's

171
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,280
 all bull you know it's all fake and you're taking their time and their money it's one of the two

172
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,440
 the third option of him actually being a secret a super soldier is flat out not true and this is

173
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:33,440
 this is why i would i would believe that the government has a labs where they experiment on

174
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,360
 people and turn them into anchoring candidates or super soldiers to me that's not outside the realm

175
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,240
 of possibility at all they could be taken willing recruits and say we're going to test these drugs

176
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
 on you and it's going to turn you into a more effective fighter it's going to give you a faster

177
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,600
 ability to heal we're going to train you in the top techniques from around the world and even some

178
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,920
 experimental fighting combat skills that we have i believe that's 100 possible do i believe the

179
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,440
 government may kidnap people or take prisoners and also say we're going to put you under extreme

180
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,400
 conditions to train you and if you fail no one cares because you're dead or you're a runaway

181
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,960
 that's possible too a little less likely a little less likely than 100 but i'd still we know they've

182
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,920
 experimented on prisoners in the past i'm not saying them experimenting on prisoners is unlikely

183
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,840
 i'm saying them capturing you know kidnapping people or taking people out of prison and trying

184
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,960
 to turn them into a super soldier but i definitely think that's within the realm of possibility

185
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:39,040
 what i do not believe is possible for one second that you are a super soldier with all that training

186
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:48,000
 who has gone rogue and now talks about taking down this power structure this this mk ultra power

187
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,520
 structure and talking to other super soldiers and empowering them to do that and they still

188
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,560
 give you disability i don't believe that for one second at all because either the government

189
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 wants to shut you up or they don't it's a problem with a lot of these conspiracy groups when i was

190
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,480
 looking into super soldiers there was a guy who posted on the super soldier forum i tried sending

191
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,160
 this message out once but the cops are already on this site they deleted my last message so i'm

192
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,360
 retyping it how often have you been typing a message on like say facebook or a comment board on reddit

193
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,280
 or four channel or something like that and it doesn't go through or the message gets deleted

194
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:40,160
 before you were able to post it it's not the cops it's user error or site lag but here's my thing

195
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,640
 if the cops deleted it like he thought how was he able to post the next message

196
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,560
 don't you think the message saying the cops are on this website is more important than anything he

197
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:55,040
 could have said before because he repeated what he said before and simply added the cops are on

198
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,920
 the site they deleted my message while i was typing it delusional delusional delusional people

199
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,360
 so either the cops are on your site and no information can get through or they're not

200
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,960
 and you made a mistake either you are being hunted by the us government because you are a top

201
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:20,320
 operative who has left the system and is exposing them or you get disability checks from them

202
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 so one or the other guys the reason why this is important is that all of this nonsense in a way

203
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,440
 led to the death of a young man because he ran with these guys he believed in this conspiracy

204
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,000
 and my hypothesis which i will lay out tomorrow so consider this part one my hypothesis

205
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,120
 is that max spears the conspiracy theorist who died in 2016 suspiciously i believe that the

206
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,440
 delusion that everyone was after him everyone from the highest government level so the doctor

207
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,920
 led to this young man's death and that's why i get i'm getting a little irritated talking about

208
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,240
 the super soldier culture but we're going to explore more about the death of max spears tomorrow

209
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,400
 and i think it'll be a good episode i'm actually now that i've done it i'm glad that i've split it

210
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,760
 up into two because i think you kind of have to delve into the insanity of what is a super soldier

211
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,040
 and who these people are and then look at how that impacts a young man listening to these fairy

212
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,760
 tales and buying into this nonsense dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to be our email address
