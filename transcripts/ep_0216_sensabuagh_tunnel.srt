1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 Two creepy stories to finish off the week.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 First off, we head to Pennsylvania to earn a merit badge in terror.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:22,500
 And then we travel to Tennessee to drive through Sendsbaugh Tunnel, shut our lights off, and see what happens next, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,000
 *Music*

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. I'm tired actually. I had to take a nap. It's 9 p.m. right now.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,500
 I got off work and I sat there in front of the microphone and I was like, "I can't record anything. I'm too sleepy."

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,000
 But you know what's funny when I woke up? I had a thought. I don't know why this popped in my head.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Maybe it had something to do with the dream I was having, which I don't remember.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,500
 But I thought, you know that phrase, you know, someone goes like, "Oh, I'm gonna beat you up."

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 And then you go, "Ugh." No, you don't burp. You go, "You go." Yeah, you and what army?

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 And then the dude's like, "This army." Or usually, like, I remember saying that as a kid, with some kids saying he's gonna stop me.

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 And I'm like, "Yeah, you and what army?" It's usually people, and of course the British say it differently.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,000
 They say, "You and who's army?" That's so st-- That doesn't make any sense. "You and who's army?"

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But what's bizarre is that that's a relatively recent phrase and nobody knows where it came from.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Like, I did some cursory investigation, like, since I woke up, I looked around.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Nobody knows where that phrase comes from. So bizarre. They think it started around the 1940s, 1950s,

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 but there's not like a single book or movie that they can track it back to. Kind of weird.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,500
 I don't think it's as popular as the phrase as it used to be, but people say it all the time when I was a kid.

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 But yeah, you don't hear it very often now. But still, it's weird to have a phrase that that's recent,

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,000
 that that is that well known. Nobody knows where it came from.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,500
 And then someone says, "Hey Jason, you should do more research on that." And I go, "Who's gonna make me?"

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 Wait, no, that's not how it goes. You go, "Jason, I'm gonna pummel you if you don't do more research."

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 And I go, "Yeah, you and what army?" Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here.

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 What we're gonna do is we're gonna have to go to Pennsylvania and we're going back in time like we do so many times in these stories.

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,000
 I don't know why I said it like that. Let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,500
 The slowest, noisiest, most transportation possible at Durgible. You'd think it would be quite quiet,

28
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 because it's mostly air, but you know those big propellers. I imagine they're noisy.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 I've never been near a blimp. I've just seen them. Anyways, we're gonna take the Dead Rabbit Durgible and go through time.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 We're going back to the year 1970. So imagine a bunch of paisley and bell bottoms are just kind of everywhere at this point.

31
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 A lava lamp was recently elected as president. It is the most 1970-ish time in 1970.

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,500
 But to escape all of the paisley overdose and all these people kung fu fighting,

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 a lot of people wanted to remain part of the simpler life. They wanted something better for their kids.

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 And the kids liked it too. And they joined the Boy Scouts. April 25th in Chester County, Pennsylvania.

35
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 There's a little Boy Scout camp. And it's a nice spring day. And there's a church.

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 And behind the church there's like this little river, the stream that you can camp in.

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 There's actually like woods and a little grassy area. So I think it was like 200 yards from the church itself.

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 So it wasn't like right next door. They weren't car-sparking next to them. It was a nice camp spot.

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 Boy Scout Troop 275 is setting up camp. The day of the 25th is their first day.

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 So they go and they set up their camp. Kids are like carrying wood and the scout master's like, "Yes, that is a great branch."

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 And then they're like humming and they're fishing in the river. Doing little merit badge stuff.

42
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 Doing stuff boys like to do when they hang out. And they're Boy Scouts.

43
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 So it's mostly like stuff that would probably bore you and me. They're like, "Look at me, I whittled this flute."

44
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
 Okay, yeah. That's adorable. But you know, that's not what I like. But anyway, so they like all this nature stuff.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 Chopping trees down, whatever. Whatever kids do in the Boy Scouts, I don't know.

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 But at night, it's time for the kids to settle down. Settle down kids. Put your whittling stuff away.

47
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 No more making flutes. No more doing what you guys do.

48
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 It's time to go to bed. The kids are like, "Aww, I really like making this wooden stuff."

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 I have no clue what the Boy Scouts do. I know they have merit badges. I know they have knives.

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 That's about it. So anyways, they're like, "Widn't making wood stuff because that's apparently all we know how to do."

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 It's time to go to bed. There was 23 Scouts and 6 adult leaders.

52
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,500
 Now, technically when you think of adult, like I would imagine there was at least one or two people there my age,

53
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 but we don't know for sure, at least from what the details that I have. We don't know for sure.

54
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 Adults could obviously just be Eagle Scouts. They're like 18. Just turned 18 type of adults.

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 And they set up their little camp. The camp's already set up. There's just wood shavings everywhere from all their wood-based activities.

56
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 And everyone crawls in their sleeping bag and goes to sleep. Now, there were a few tents if people kind of whisked out and couldn't stand the temperature,

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,500
 and it's April 25th in Pennsylvania. It's not snow and it's not a storm and nothing.

58
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 So most of the kids, man up, sleep in their sleeping bag.

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 Their sleeping bags are set up in like a circular fashion. And 23 kids and 6 adults quickly fall asleep.

60
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 Dreams of cutting more wood tomorrow. Timber. They hear in their dreams. They're all dreaming about Paul Benning.

61
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 April 26th. Next morning, everyone wakes up.

62
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 [Groans]

63
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 [Groans]

64
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
 Man, that was-- I had a good night's sleep. It was awesome.

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 But one kid doesn't get up and do a stereotypical yawn and stretch. One kid named Terrence Bowers.

66
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,500
 11 year old boy. As the other Scouts and the Scout Masters are, you know, kind of waking up and everything like that,

67
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 they see one sleeping bag in the circle that the kid isn't moving in. Deep sleeper, maybe.

68
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 But they also notice all the blood. A massive amount of blood coming out of the sleeping bag, soaking the sleeping bag,

69
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 to the point where they're like, "Okay, that's not normal." Some people are deep sleepers,

70
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 but most people don't bleed out leaders of blood. I mean, there's kind of no brainer.

71
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 I guess I don't think you would have to be a Boy Scout. Or actually even like an adult to realize that something was wrong

72
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 if a man was sleeping in a bloody sleeping bag. I have no-- Okay, I have no idea why I structured this segment like this.

73
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 But anyways, here we are. We're committing to it. They go, "Oh, no, this sleeping bag is covered in blood."

74
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 They call the cops. They call the parents of all the kids. The parents-- 100% true story.

75
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 So first off, they call the cops, but then they call the parents and they say--

76
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 And they didn't have cell phones back then, so how did they call everyone so quickly?

77
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,500
 But by the time the cops got to the campsite, there was parents everywhere, holding their kids, hugging their kids.

78
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,500
 And the cops show up. The sleeping bag with the body in it had been moved.

79
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 It was an 11-year-old boy had been moved and parents were tromping all over the crime scene.

80
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 The police are like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, nobody goes anywhere. You don't get to take your kid home at all."

81
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 We have to interview everyone here, all 23 of you, plus the scout masters, plus anyone else who's walking around.

82
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 We got to figure out what it is. This is what we know about this crime.

83
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,500
 Terrence Bowers was 11 years old. He was killed with a Boy Scout pocket knife.

84
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 That's it. That's all they know. This happened in 1970. They have no other information other than that.

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 And the pocket knife was never found.

86
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 They think, based on the way that the injury is in his body, it looks like a Boy Scout's pocket knife,

87
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 which ranking different weapons would be killed by-- that would be very, very, very low down on my "wanna be killed by."

88
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 They're fairly dull. I mean, I own Swiss Army knives. It's kind of the same thing.

89
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 They're fairly short. They're pokey, but they're kind of dull. It seems like it would take a long time.

90
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 But according to the report, I mean, like, how did he not make any noises?

91
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 It must have been a super sudden attack and was able to do enough damage, like, straight to an aorta or a carotid artery.

92
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 Like, it's grim, but how do you not wake up 23 kids with this pocket knife?

93
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 But they've never found it. They've never, ever found the murder weapon. They just go based on the injuries.

94
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 It looks like this was that type of weapon. All 23 kids and the six adults said they didn't see anything.

95
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 They hadn't heard anything? Because we didn't have a story on the Girl Scout murders,

96
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 and you had all these people waking up through the night and hearing these noises and things like that.

97
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 All of these kids are like, "We didn't hear anything. We just woke up and he was dead."

98
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,500
 Cops start investigating like a normal thing, and I didn't know this. This is, I thought this was interesting too.

99
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 The Boy Scouts have a thing called the "Proversion Files," which is basically a list of all the local pedophiles in their area

100
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,500
 who tried joining the Boy Scouts and got booted out. They looked through the Proversion Files.

101
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 They do find this guy named Lawrence Whackley. He was in the Proversion Files at the time.

102
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 In 2012, Lawrence Whackley was actually in prison for a rape.

103
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 In prison, he said he did it because he wanted to get back out of the Boy Scouts for not allowing him to be in the Boy Scouts,

104
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 and they put him in the Proversion Files. But then the cops go and they investigate this guy, and they rule him out.

105
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,500
 They said he didn't do it. He's just bragging because he's a big old sicko dude sitting in prison somewhere.

106
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 He had nothing to do with this murder. So in 2017, though, there's always been a reward,

107
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 but in 2017 it's topped out at $25,000 for any evidence that can lead to a conviction in this case.

108
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 You know, it's just so creepy because you think, like, "Okay, listen, you get it."

109
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 If you're walking through the woods by yourself late at night, you have a chance of getting murdered.

110
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 If you're walking through a neighborhood late at night, you have a chance of getting murdered.

111
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 If you're living in a house in a bad neighborhood, you have a chance of getting murdered at it.

112
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 When you're sleeping with a group of 29 people, I think you feel like you're fairly safe.

113
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 When you're going to sleep and you're surrounded by 29 people, 29 friends, not just 29 random people,

114
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
 but you're going to sleep around 29 people, you may think, "Best case scenario, I have a good night's sleep."

115
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
 Worst case scenario, someone draws a penis on my face.

116
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 And if you're camping in that scenario, you go, "A skunk may spray me or a cougar may get me,"

117
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 but there's 29 of us, the chances of the cougar landing on me directly, 1 in 29.

118
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:16,500
 But you don't imagine as you go to bed that a dull knife is going to go in and out of you.

119
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 That is the last thing you really worry about unless you're, "Stick a butter."

120
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 It's not a concern of yours, but it's so bizarre. And really, like modern-day sleuths, they say,

121
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 one of those scouts had to have done it. Or Scoutmaster.

122
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
 One of them had to have done it and they completely got away with it.

123
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 But I don't know, because that would require, that would basically be a crime of opportunity,

124
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:49,500
 and you'd start looking at motive, like, which Scout didn't like Terrence, which Scoutmaster didn't like Terrence.

125
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 I think it's more terrifying than that.

126
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 I think someone was walking through the woods 200 yards from this church one night, came across 29 people,

127
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 picked up a knife that was already one of those kids, and silently killed a guy at random.

128
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 It could have been anybody, and then took the knife home.

129
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 Somebody took it home, washed it off, put it in their pocket, put it on their shelf.

130
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 A trophy for a long time of an unsolved murder.

131
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 Now it's just sitting in someone's junk drawer. Never to be examined by the police.

132
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 Never to have any DNA run on it. Just a dull Boy Scout knife sitting in a junk drawer somewhere.

133
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 And maybe that guy's son runs across and goes, "Dad, I didn't know you were the Boy Scouts."

134
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
 And Dad's like, "Oh, yeah, no, I got that from a friend."

135
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:51,500
 Unsolved murders are just so weird, but I think just the randomness of this one really elevates it to a terrifying tale.

136
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 But let's go ahead and move on to something equally terrifying if you're terrified of tunnels.

137
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 You know what's funny is when I was researching this story, what kept popping in my head was the opening to that show Tales from the Dark Side.

138
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 It's funny because if you watch that show as a kid, Tales from the Dark Side was an American horror anthology show.

139
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 It was kind of like Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits in the 80s.

140
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 Had one of the best television openings of all time.

141
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 So good, in fact, that when you watch the show, you're like, "This show is garbage."

142
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 The show itself was mediocre at best, but that opening credit scene is so creepy.

143
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 And I don't know if it translates well now.

144
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 If you look at the comments for the YouTube, when I watch it on YouTube, the comments are like, "Man, they totally scared me as a kid."

145
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 Like, "It would come on and I'd race to shut the television off. Sometimes I'd be walking through the house and my father would be watching it and just the noise scared me."

146
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 I don't know if you just watched it on as a YouTube clip. It would terrify you.

147
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 But it's funny because I got that feeling while I was researching that story and I went back to watch that opening and I was like, "It still is terrifying."

148
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 Tales from the Dark Side, the opening itself is just about how there is a world of light and then there's a opposite world, a world of darkness.

149
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 And it just has this really creepy ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.

150
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 And it has a voiceover narration. It's like a minute long, but I don't know if it translates.

151
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 But anyways, I was thinking about that when I was looking at Sensibleg Tunnel.

152
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,500
 So we're going to leave the Dead Rabbit Durgible in Pennsylvania.

153
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 We're headed to Tennessee. More specifically, we're headed to Kingsport, Tennessee, and more specifically than that, we're headed to Sensibleg Tunnel.

154
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 Now, there's only one way to get into a tunnel. We need a car.

155
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 And now, I have been working on the Jason Jalopy. I've been trying to get it back.

156
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 We need our vehicles to go on these stories. And, good news, I got the frame banged out.

157
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 Don't know anything about cars. I got the tires on. I know that much.

158
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 No engine yet. So we're going to the Sensibleg Tunnel in the Jason Jalopy.

159
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 But you can't drive. We need someone to push it. And actually, the person pushing it is Ryan T.

160
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 He requested the story on YouTube and because he's the one who requested it, he's got to push us all the way to Tennessee.

161
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,500
 So I hope you got good legs. I hope you're like, "Oh, that sounded, that sounds..."

162
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,500
 I hope you have good legs, Ryan. You know what I mean? I didn't mean like that. Like muscular.

163
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 Okay, that's not open. I hope you're fit. That's still... Okay, that's fine.

164
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 Ryan T. is not pushing it. There's a big hill that leads from Pennsylvania because I don't want to imagine how thick his body is.

165
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 There's a big hill that leads from Pennsylvania to Tennessee somehow.

166
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 And we all get in it. Me, you, and Ryan, and we roll all the way down to Tennessee to visit Sensibleg Tunnel.

167
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 And we need a car because that's part of the magic. Now, let's talk a little bit about this tunnel.

168
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:04,500
 It was built in the 1920s and it was actually built to... From what I could gather from my research, it was built to help support a railroad that was going on top of it.

169
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 How does that even work? Like, does the arch help the mountain be like more stable?

170
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 I don't know, but it's a road that you drive cars through, but it doesn't have a railroad track.

171
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 But for some reason it was built so you could like railroad over it. I have no idea.

172
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 I just imagine Thomas the Tank Engine like chugging butt up this mountain.

173
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 How actually, why would cutting a hole in a mountain make it stronger for a train to go over?

174
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 But instead of researching that, I can't read searching more about this spooky, spooky tunnel.

175
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 It's only 380 feet, I'll give or take, long. So quite short, but if you're paranoid of driving through mountains, that's incredibly long.

176
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 I don't have a problem with tunnels. I don't have a problem with tunnels at all, but I know a lot of people do.

177
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 We're in the Jason Jalopy. It's back in action, halfway.

178
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 And what we have to do is we have to drive or push the Jason Jalopy. Ryan with his muscular legs.

179
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 I'm like, ooh, looking in the mirror. As we push the Jason Jalopy into the cave, into the tunnel, what's the difference between a tunnel and a cave?

180
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 It's a cave? Well, actually, that's a good question. What is the difference between a tunnel and a cave?

181
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 Does the tunnel have two openings and a cave only has one?

182
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 Anyways, as I'm trying to figure that out, we're getting pushed into the middle of the sense of bog tunnel.

183
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 Now, here's the thing. If you're driving or being pushed through this tunnel and you shut your lights off around halfway through, the car won't turn back on.

184
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

185
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 Oh, wait, wait, it wasn't on in the first place, so we didn't have to worry about that.

186
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
 It wasn't turned on. I'm like, hey, just jump out and keep pushing there.

187
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 Like, okay, it didn't turn on in the first place, so we can't tell that.

188
00:17:45,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 But you hear, "Wah, wah, I'm a baby crying, wah, wah!" in the tunnel, which there's very few times when being in the dark and hearing a baby crying are good.

189
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 I don't think there's really any time that that is.

190
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 Unless you're like a spooky ghost, then you're like, yes, this is awesome.

191
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 Unless you're trying to power your city through children's tears, other than that, it's all, it would always be terrifying.

192
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 Sometimes, though, you're sitting in a sense-a-bog tunnel and you look in the rear view mirror and you see a dark figure of a man standing at the mouth of the tunnel.

193
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 It starts walking towards us.

194
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 Footsteps becoming faster now.

195
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 He's running, is what I meant to say. He's running towards us.

196
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
 Hurry up, Ryan, get back in, get back in. I can't, my legs hurt.

197
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 Sorry, bro.

198
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 And this figure will run towards the back of your car, and if you don't get the car started by the time he gets there, you're dead.

199
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 I think you're already starting to see some issues with this story, but anyway, there's a lot of stuff that can happen in this tunnel.

200
00:18:52,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 The other thing is you'll be sitting in the tunnel, shut the lights off, you look in your rear view mirror, you see a dark figure sitting in the back seat of your car, staring at you.

201
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 You've got to get that car started.

202
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 Or finally, you will shut your lights off, you'll shut your car off, you'll turn it back on. No problems, light will come back on, nothing.

203
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,500
 And you drive out of the tunnel to the safety of the light, and you're like, "Man, that was kind of disappointing.

204
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 I thought some dude was going to start chasing us or a baby was going to be crying. Whoa, what's that?"

205
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 You see a little handprint, a little kid's handprint on your car to let you know that although you didn't get one of the cool ghosts, the kids still care about you.

206
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 Left a little handprint on your car.

207
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 So, like any good urban legend, it has origin stories.

208
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 What's weird about it though is that all those things seem fairly separate.

209
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 One, if you're in a dark tunnel, how do you notice a black figure is walking up behind you?

210
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 Two, if you're in a dark tunnel and your lights are off, how do you know there's a black figure sitting in the back of your car?

211
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 Three, baby crying. Yes, that's creepy.

212
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 But what does that have to do with the handprint on your car? Is it a baby handprint?

213
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 Which you wouldn't even be able to tell. Baby handprints look like when leaves fall in water.

214
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 That actually sounded quite poetic.

215
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 But you know what I mean? They don't actually have like, can you tell what a baby handprint looks like?

216
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 I mean, it's almost just like a mush of flesh.

217
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 I mean, if they're not caribers, they have fingers and stuff like that.

218
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 But you know what I mean? Like, I don't think if a ghost of like a kid left a handprint on my car,

219
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 I'd be like, oh my god, that's like a human handprint, but smaller.

220
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
 But if a baby ghost left a handprint on my car, I would be like, oh man, I've got to take my car to the car wash.

221
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 There's this weird blob-like stain here.

222
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
 Wiping it off. I'm like, oh, and here's another one. Looks like the Virgin Mary.

223
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 Wiping that off. I'm like, what's going on with my car?

224
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 Obviously, I can't tell miracles unless they're like, or ghosts unless they're like concrete.

225
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 There's ghost babies floating all around me. I'm like, what? Where's all the simulac coming from?

226
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 I must have just blown in on the wind. I only pay attention to non-baby ghosts, apparently.

227
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,500
 So you have all those different symptoms, I guess we should say.

228
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Most urban legends tend to be a little more specific, but this one's kind of all over the place.

229
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,500
 And I guess I should say this too. This is a real place. The place exists.

230
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 The question is whether or not it has any of this stuff.

231
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 There's basically three rumors of why this place is haunted. I love the first one, at least.

232
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
 The first one's great.

233
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 Number one, a homeless man. So the rumor started back in the 1960s, and again, it comes down to which one of these stories is true.

234
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 One, a homeless man committed a robbery, and when he was breaking into these dudes' house,

235
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 because it's kind of residential in that area, but it's not like the suburbs.

236
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,500
 There's just houses here and there. There's this dude broken into a house, and he's robbing,

237
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 and he's like, "Oh, dude, this is my greatest haul ever. I can't believe what a great robber I am."

238
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
 And all of a sudden, people come home, and they're like, "Dude, you're breaking into our house."

239
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 And he's like, "Oh, no, gotta go fast." So he's like running around the house, and to get them to stop chasing them,

240
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 this is one of the dumbest criminal things that's ever happened, to get the people in the house from catching him for robbing them,

241
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 he steals their baby as well and takes off into the night. If you want people to stop chasing you,

242
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 don't continue to steal stuff, including human babies. Like, if someone corners you and you're like,

243
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 "Oh, my God, I'm holding all this gold," don't think they're gonna stop chasing you if you then grab their daughter and jump out the window.

244
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 They may or may not keep chasing you if you just have their gold. They definitely will chase you if you take a child.

245
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,500
 Anyways, he's running from the house with a baby, and all of a sudden he realizes that wasn't a good idea.

246
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 I better get rid of this baby so he throws the baby in a pond of water and the baby drowns,

247
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 and that pond of water is right outside of Sensa Bog Tunnel. Now, never happened.

248
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 That there has never been any report of a robbery in that area, no report of a baby being tossed in a pond,

249
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 but it did allow the legend to be like, "Why there's a baby crying in the middle of the tunnel?"

250
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,500
 There's another legend, and this one almost makes it like the Sensa Bog Tunnel was already hunted.

251
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 The legend was that there was a young woman whose car broke down in the middle of the tunnel,

252
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,500
 and she went to go get help, so she had to then walk out of the tunnel, obviously.

253
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 She just didn't stand there going, "Help me, help me," like olive oil. She had to leave the tunnel.

254
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 Never seen again. When the cops arrived the next day, there was just a car in the tunnel.

255
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 No one in it, no one ever found. They were able to track down the woman and go, "Oh, she's not here."

256
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 Like, you know, they looked around for her and all that stuff, go through her registration to find out who she was,

257
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 open a missing person's case on her, never find anything.

258
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 I added 90% of it. The actual legend is a young woman's car broke down, went to get help, but was never found.

259
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 That's pretty much it. Multiple websites just leave it that big.

260
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 I added the whole cop investigation, looking at the registration of the car, full-sert...

261
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 There's no report of any of that happening, happening at all. No report of that.

262
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 I'm sure people's car broke down in the tunnel before, but no one had gone missing.

263
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 So that brings us to the third possible story of what caused this.

264
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 This one has a little name recognition.

265
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 Ed Sensebag, who the tunnel's named after, has a house at the end of the tunnel.

266
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 It's the Sensebag house, and in the Sensebag house, he had his family.

267
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Good, hardworking man, Ed was. His family, hardworking as well.

268
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 Everyone, hardworking. Even the baby. The baby was hardworking and growing up.

269
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 Basically, human beavers. Always doing stuff with their hands, always doing...

270
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 I don't know where I'm going with this. The point is, is that one night, Ed flips out and decides to murder his entire family.

271
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 I have no idea what that whole bit was about them hardworking, but anyways, he murders his entire family

272
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 and, to top it all off, throws his baby into the pond of water.

273
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 Where the robbery story took place. He's like, "I hate you, baby." The baby's like, "Pshh."

274
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
 Falls under, dives into the water. Doesn't dive.

275
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 Involuntary. He wasn't doing a little...

276
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 Olympic dive. He just falls into the water, dies, and then Sensebag, Ed Sensebag, kills himself in the tunnel.

277
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 Now, Ed Sensebag is real. The family's real. He was actually a hardworking man.

278
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 Loved his family. That story never happened either.

279
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 So, where... there is no reason why this tunnel should be haunted.

280
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 I was reading one website and they said, "When they were blowing the tunnel up, a couple miners died."

281
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
 And they were just kind of like buried in there.

282
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 Then the website went on this weird, like, racist rant.

283
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,500
 And it was like, "Yes, the Italians were taken advantage of by the rich white men."

284
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 And I read that and I go, "Aren't Italians white?"

285
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 Why is this in this story about these dudes blowing up a tunnel? It was so bizarre and out of place.

286
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,500
 I was like, "What?" And I couldn't find any other reference to these guys being blown up.

287
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 But that aside, that bizarre, like, political thing aside, we don't know, one, if people actually blew up making that tunnel.

288
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 That may or may not have happened, but why is the tunnel having these experiences?

289
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 Now, again, most likely it's not. It is a creepy looking tunnel. It is.

290
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 And it's in the middle of nowhere and it's in the middle of a mountain, like, all tunnels.

291
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 So you think, "Okay, it's one of two things. It's not real at all." And that's the reason why they're all different.

292
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 Some people see a dark figure chasing you, sometimes it's in your car.

293
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 And see, the idea was that the dark figure was Ed Sensenbog.

294
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 And then the baby was the baby in the story, in the two versions of the story, both thrown into the water.

295
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,500
 And then the child's handprint, again, probably a baby's handprint, but I wouldn't even notice that.

296
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:04,500
 What I think is the truth is that there may actually be something in that tunnel.

297
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:10,500
 And I think it all starts with the one thing that can actually happen in that tunnel.

298
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 The one logical thing that can actually happen.

299
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:20,500
 And that is if you go into that tunnel and you shut your car off, when you go to turn it back on, it doesn't turn on as easily as it should.

300
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 I think that is very, very likely.

301
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,500
 That could be attributed to anything giving off any sort of electrical interference in that area.

302
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 That was in the mountain that was blown away.

303
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 Now, I couldn't say exactly what it was.

304
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 There's like giant magnetic rocks around, or just something.

305
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 But I think that is possible.

306
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 And I think it's interesting that anything else would be created after that.

307
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 There's a tunnel that people have gone into and they've shut their lights off because it's spooky and they want to scare their girlfriends, or she like, comes closer to him.

308
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 And then he goes to turn the car back on and it takes a little bit longer to get it started.

309
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 She's like, "Hurry up, Tyler! Hurry up!"

310
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
 And he's like, "I'm trying, Mary, I'm trying."

311
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,500
 And then he finally gets it started and they go home.

312
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 That is likely.

313
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,500
 And from that story, from that incident, say, happened in the 1960s, like when these legends started,

314
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 it just kept going on and on where people would be like, "Yeah, that did happen to me."

315
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 And a ghost chased me and people would be like, "What?"

316
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 And then another kid goes, "Yeah, that happened to me too."

317
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 And a baby touched my car and people were staring at him and they're like, "What?"

318
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 It's a weird de-escalation. This guy's getting chased by a ghost.

319
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
 You just have a baby touch your pinto.

320
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 He's like, "It's a wacky world. It actually happened, though."

321
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 And then again, it could just be 100% made up and people like telling this story because it's spooky.

322
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 It does give you something to do on a Friday night in the middle of Pennsylvania, which I can't imagine is super fun.

323
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 Super fun state.

324
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 I mean, what else is there to do in Pennsylvania?

325
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,500
 What else is there supposed to do in that part of Pennsylvania, especially?

326
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 Other than, hey, let's go out to this spooky tunnel and tell this crazy ghost story.

327
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 I love local urban legends. I really do.

328
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 I think it's fascinating to think of all these little isolated places spread out across the nation,

329
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 across the world where people go, "Don't go in that cave. Don't go down that road that time of night.

330
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,500
 Don't walk through that church unless you're in church."

331
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 It's Sunday and people are like, "Don't go there. There's a ghost. It's the Holy Ghost."

332
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
 People are like, "What? Yeah, I know he's supposed to be there. I see him every week."

333
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 But these local legends, I always find these super fascinating.

334
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 And it really comes--it's one of those things like whether or not it's true at a certain point is irrelevant.

335
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 The fact is there is a geographical feature that a community has got together and created a modern myth about.

336
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 That in and of itself fascinates me because otherwise this is just a dark tunnel

337
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 sitting out in the middle of nowhere that people drive through and nothing happens.

338
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:00,500
 But by creating this myth and passing it down from generation to generation,

339
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 they've turned that ordinary tunnel into the sense of Bogtunnel.

340
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 They've turned it into an icon of a haunting and a symbol of how weird the world really can be.

341
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
 I wouldn't have any problem driving through that tunnel and shutting my light off.

342
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 It wouldn't matter to me.

343
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 And if I saw a ghost, it would totally terrify me.

344
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,500
 But if I didn't, I'd still be able to say, "You know what? I went through a sense of Bogtunnel and I tried it and nothing happened."

345
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 But of course, I could be the one person who does shut the car off, turn the lights off,

346
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 see something, and can't get the car started in time.

347
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 And then years later, someone's doing another podcast.

348
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 Talking about the podcaster who ran his mouth on a show,

349
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 went to visit a local legend and became part of the myth himself.
