 A creepy, true crime case has finally been solved.
 Or has it?
 And then we often ask the questions, alien life does it exist, has it visited Earth before?
 And most of the time these questions are asked and answered by people who have never gone
 to aliens home turf, aka space.
 So what happens when one of the most decorated astronauts of the US space program comes back
 to Earth multiple times and tells his bosses the truth is up there today on Dead Rabbit
 Radio.
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio I'm your host Jason

 Wobb I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider we're gonna leave Dead Rabbit Command
 we're gonna take a nice leisurely journey because this first story is a little rough
 we're gonna take a nice gentle glide all the way out to Durango Colorado
 and as we were headed out there I'm sure I'm sure you heard the sound of a couple people
 letting go of Wobb's ankles they're like now I'm good I'm good I don't want to hear this
 story this story is fascinating to me it's one of my favorite true crime cases and I've
 been just with lack of a better word digesting every bit of information that pun will not
 make sense now the people who are plummeting away from the hair hang glider they're like
 I get it because they're aware where this story is going but I've loved this story it's
 a tragic true crime story so as much as you can love a story like this but the mystery
 involved has kept me the edge of my seat and I'm not saying any of that to downplay the
 real tragedy of this story it's just as a true crime aficionado this one tell my attention
 for quite a while it's been this ongoing process so November 18th 2012 in Durango Colorado
 there is a man named Mark Redwine a divorced father of a couple boys from a couple different
 marriages and he would have custody of his kids from time to time he was legally considered
 a good pop so the court gave him custody on certain dates mandatory custody whether or
 not the kids wanted to go they were legally obligated to go they had to that's the worst
 it's almost like prison at that point now you hope that the kids would come to love their
 dad despite all of his flaws like yeah mom and dad couldn't stay together sons but I
 still love you you know it takes a court mandated order for to give me the time to tell you this
 and maybe over time you will learn to forgive me for cheating on your mom or whatever but
 in this case the obligated court ordered visitations were not doing Mark Redwine any favors because
 a couple years ago his sons Corey Redwine and Dylan Redwine are at his house and he's
 asleep it's late at night and they get his laptop I don't know it's very the story is
 very interesting I don't know what sparked them to do this maybe it was just childlike
 curiosity you find a laptop you're chasing his son along with wanting to use laptops what
 are you talking about what are you some sort of Luddite all of a sudden they had his their
 dad's laptop is locked and they bypass his security lock that's one and then they take
 the laptop into the bathroom because they don't want the dad to know that they're on his laptop
 maybe they're expecting to see porn maybe they're like oh dad might be into boobs right
 you think dad's into boobs now I think dad's more of a butt person that they were having
 this super disgusting conversation we shouldn't be but maybe they want to look at some porn
 see what their dad who who who I do not I don't know if they're trying to find their dad's
 porn but I'm gonna tell you right now that's what they found I don't know if that's what
 they said out there just trying to download some V bucks app and they found their dad's
 porn now it's not as bad as you think usually when we talk about stuff like this like finding
 their dad's porn it's child porn it's not that bad but it is so gross it's so gross
 that I go to true crime websites all this is so funny I with bated breath waited honestly
 like half the year like six seven months for these photos because although crime websites
 will constantly show video footage is like a young woman's walking down New York and
 a man walks up and shoots her in the brain it's just like it's like an autoplay you go
 to the website and this is a little like web m or this gift of this woman getting blasted
 they refused true crime websites at least the ones I want to refuse to show the photos
 that they found they would describe them but they would barely describe them they would
 just say a sentence and the sentence wait what I want to see these photos and then finally
 maybe like in June it was very very recently June of this year they said okay guys there's
 a website to go to every day it's called crime online dot com it's really cool crime website
 they go okay we're going to show you the photos but these photos are so disgusting we're not
 going to host them on our website we're going to have a link to someone else's website so
 get them while you can guys they may end up taking these down here were the photos these
 boys because they boys take the laptop into the bathroom they see these disgusting photos
 and Cole the older brother pulls out his cell phone and starts taking pictures of the photos
 now this whole part of the story is happening like a 2010 I think 2011 so it's like really
 not the best film quality camera but it actually makes the photos so much more creepier and
 I with with great suspense I know you guys are waiting for this the photos are imagine
 you find these photos of your dad the photos of anyone would be gross finding these photos
 of your roommate would be unsettling but if they if you found them of your dad and you
 were trapped in his house right now you're both minors it'd be horrifying what they find
 are photos of this there's a photo of Mark Redwine and he's wearing women's clothing
 that's fine that's not that's crazy thing a man's ever done it's not that he's wearing
 women's clothing just to build the mood and he has this brown material all over his face
 you're like I didn't know my dad was in chocolate and fish the annatto and then there's like
 a close so I'm going off memory I'm already seen him twice and they're disgusting so it's
 a little bit closer and you can see more chocolate someone is face that there and the third photo
 looks like it looks if if a black metal album from Sweden has their cover people would go
 too much bro too much that one with your bandmate you committed suicide yeah that was that was
 okay but this one it's a close up of a man of not a man Mark Redwine with a poop filled
 diaper this was described all the time on crime online like he did Cheerios I'm like
 I want to see those photos it's a picture of a man with a poop filled diaper stuffed in
 his mouth and easy the poop there you go Jason Jason you haven't seen two girls one cup Jason
 I've seen way worse stuff on this website blah blah blah blah well here's the thing one probably
 yeah I have seen two girls one cup is absolutely disgusting I hated it I didn't finish watching
 him super gross but it was super glossy look like they shot it at evil angel studios or
 some porn place right this was this because the cinematography of it was so grainy and
 made it even creepier and it was two girls one cup right you're like Rebecca no it was
 just two models that got paid to do that they were probably into it and they're having a
 good time it was disgusting I think it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization
 if you ask me I think that you talk about 9/11 everything changing I think two girls one
 cup I should have never said on that I actually think that that was the first push towards
 oblivion for civilization I really think of I've never seen it so widely accepted something
 that disgusting that was real but anyways you know to this day there's a lot of podcasts
 called like two girls one ghost or two girls one true grand podcast and they're playing
 off that it's that much of a meme and I do think that that was the beginning of the end
 of civilization but I will talk about interesting concept try to remind me I'll probably forget
 to talk about it but I'll never forget I do I do think that I think that was a site op
 think that was that was promoted on it naturally not a naturally because of the fetish I think
 that it shouldn't have gone viral and it did and I think someone or a group was behind it
 for some reason or another but we'll talk about that another time were we talking about oh
 yeah yeah poop poop eat a poop filled diapers I forget what we're talking about I just talking
 about two girls one cup and so it's not only is it somebody you know in this video or these
 photos and it's it really gross cinematography which does add a creepiness layer to it these
 photos may have led to a murder and let me add there is one more photo to of him wearing
 the poop filled diaper that's a de-escalation though after eating it after you're eating
 it he's like num num num now you know it'll be really gross if I use it for its intended
 purpose but I think the prosecutor because the photos were laid out the prosecutor probably
 should have shoveled them to make it like less gross to most gross but maybe the maybe the
 prosecutor hates sitting in poopy diapers and so he's like that was the worst photo guys
 I almost didn't show that to you and everyone's like as he's eating he's eating chipotle at
 the trial he's like as long as I have to sit down and poopy diaper everything's a okay
 creepy story but this has led to murder allegations November 18th 2012 in Durango Colorado Dylan
 red wine has to go spin Thanksgiving with his dad Mark and he doesn't want to he doesn't
 want to for two reasons one one the photos I mean you just don't visit a guy who you're
 stuck with like if you have a friend who's into this and you can leave you can leave
 whenever he starts going I'm hungry you're like okay dude I'm out he's reaching for the
 denizen's chili he's like making a marshmallow diaper you can leave but you don't want to
 be stuck with someone who's eating poop I'm just assuming my audience could be like I'm
 unsubscribing to this podcast he obviously doesn't get me he doesn't understand the
 deliciousness of my fetish you'd I you wouldn't want to be there but also he was hated the
 way that his dad was talking to his mom he could hear him arguing over the phone and
 he was like this is just a piece of trash you don't want to be with him the mom is like
 it's court ordered you have to go November 18th 2012 he goes to Colorado Mark Redwine
 picks him up they go to I think a McDonald's in a Walmart there's surveillance footage
 of them going to a couple different locations in 956 a text message was sent from Dylan's
 phone and since then no one has ever seen Dylan again and that's where the mystery stood
 from 2012 to 2013 so that first half a year first six seven months you had Mark Redwine
 go and listen we got in a fight we did but Dylan ran away he just left the house you guys know
 that he hates me first off officers do you have anything to eat do you have anything to eat
 because they happen to be can we stop at the maternity ward on the way to the police station
 I'm famished but then he goes listen he ran away and who knows what happened to him we live in
 this mountainous region we're in Colorado for crying out loud there's like bears and mountain
 lines in the area and the cops are kind of like looking at each other and they're like yeah I
 guess but they don't have enough evidence to charge him in 2013 though about five miles away
 from the Durango household of Mark Redwine they find bones a couple bones some clothing
 and they test it and they are the bones of Dylan Redwine and at this point Mark Redwine goes I
 told you guys that I told you I told you guys exactly where the location of the body would be
 no he goes listen I told you he ran out it was most likely he got attacked by some sort of
 animal which is rare but not unheard of and he's a 13 year old boy who's running into the wilderness
 anything could happen he goes on the Dr. Phil's show Mark Redwine goes on the Dr. Phil's show with
 which god bless Dr. Phil's heart but I really wish his shows were available online I get it
 it's not an easily accessible show to watch but I watched a couple clips from this episode
 and it's what you would expect from this type of story his family saying that he's gross and a
 murderer probably more they probably more accusing him of murder first and then him going I didn't
 do it I didn't do it he took a polygraph test and then I couldn't find I couldn't find the
 polygraph test but I'm assuming he passed it or was inconclusive or anything like that because
 because he's still walking around free in 2013 in 2015
 they find Dylan's skull
 and when they're looking at the skull they see what appears to be blunt force trauma
 now could a wild animal cause blunt force trauma it's unlikely like the swat of a bearish paw
 that's like about 10 baseball bats hitting the side of your dome but it's enough for the coroner to
 rule he probably got his head caved in and it probably wasn't a wild animal in 2017
 Mark Redwine is finally arrested a good five years after the event his disappearance
 and then prosecutor Fred you know prosecutors defense lawyers they're really they're salesmen
 they're speech givers they're politics that's why lawyers make sedgeka politicians I want to read
 you this bit of prosecutor Fred Johnson's very short quote here talking about this trial or
 talking about this event I love this type of stuff quote after 9 56 that evening all communication
 from Dylan Redwine stopped that night under the shadow of middle mountain the defendant murdered
 Dylan Redwine unquote that's really cool I'm not saying that it's cool that he murdered this kid
 but it's very visual it's very evocative isn't it and apparently he also lived near where the
 dwarfs hide all their gold middle mountain blood all over the house there's going to be blood all
 over your house it's just going to happen he's like oh no that blood came from when he was clipping
 his finger and he got too close to the skin that was when he stepped on that nail and you can kind
 of explain a bunch of stuff his there's such an interesting trial because it does make sense
 that a kid running out into the wilderness could die of natural causes and the evidence against
 mark red wine was there was blood of the boy in his house a house that he lived in
 that he drove his atv down a road where they eventually found the body it was an av it was
 an atv road it wasn't just some random road it was like where you'd go atv and the family saying he
 didn't seem too concerned about finding dylan and he was the only one with the motive he's found
 guilty based on that's so circumstantial now I think he was guilty I do think he was guilty but I
 don't think there would be enough evidence there to prosecute him for that he was just found guilty
 in July 2021 and I missed it because I was on vacation I wasn't reading anything I've been
 waiting to cover this story but I wanted to wait till the end of the trial I wanted to wait until
 it was done before I shared it with you I wanted to find out what the conclusion was but he's going
 to be sentenced on october 8th I mean obviously the sentence is either life in prison without parole
 or death fascinating story though I love it because it's a mystery it lasted for years
 it's actually a pretty good alibi that's really good defense I didn't do it the bears did and it
 would make in that area it's not gonna work in downtown Sacramento it's a good defense it is a
 good defense and the weird fetish angle to it as well if it was a guy just killing his kid you
 it happens every single day but oh man those photos so a true mystery it was he really the guy I
 think so but who knows the truth of the story could still be out there on middle mountain somewhere
 evidence that would show that mark red wine is not a murderer but just a totally disgusting dude
 he's gonna get into prison he's like all this prison food reminds me of home everyone's like
 dude this stuff's super disgusting he's like yum yum yum yummy in my tummy can I have some of your
 foods sir wobble let's go I swear I'm shocked I still get paid to get some orders because it is so
 so random what episode you end up on wobble is already sent it off they're like nah I'm good
 I'm totally good well let's toss you the keys of the carpenter we're gonna leave behind Durango
 Colorado and we are headed on out to the very edge of space
 carpenter copter is taking us off to where the blue meets the black where the atmosphere slowly
 gives away to the icy grip of the abyss I could be a prosecutor I would much rather be a defense
 lawyer I think it's way more fun but I can say snazzy stuff too it we're in zero gravity so
 we're kind of floating around and wob is slowly I don't think we've ever taken the carpenter
 this high up we're floating into space we're just kind of floating around it's a having a good time
 right throwing a beach ball we're throwing the slowest thing we can't even tell it's in zero
 gravity you're like Jason why aren't we throwing like anvils or something if you threw an ant if
 you're in space and I threw an anvil to you would it kill you like in real life if I dropped an
 anvil on your head you die but if I dropped an anvil your space suit gets all shattered I was
 like I'm just testing it bro you can't breathe I mean but think about it if you dropped it in
 space it would just kind of float there right there is no dropping it I wonder if you could
 play baseball on the space station this is why this is why they'll never allow me anywhere near
 any technology I'm like oh what does this button do it's CERN I bring Nelson Mandela back to life
 all this craziness so anyways we'll we'll let the space nerds I'm sure I'll get a ton of emails
 explaining stuff to me and I do love those emails I often get them usually from English majors
 and people who are correcting my grammar this is one of those fascinating stories that is packaged
 in such a bizarre way I just don't understand it we recently talked about it on yesterday's episode
 about how journalists are supposed to write their articles in an inverted pyramid and you put the
 best information the most important information at the top and it gets less informative as you go
 down so the editors can edit it or the reader can stop reading it and they get the gist of the
 information at the top the problem is is that paranormal in particular paranormal writers
 are not journalists but they churn out articles constantly now they may be good paranormal researchers
 but they're not they're not journalists they don't know how to structure an article in a classic
 journalist way drives me up the wall drives me up the wall and I don't want to call out certain
 web I'm going on a website now but a lot of the paranormal websites they're just a mess their
 articles are just really really poorly written no and I'm not in a informational way they're just
 formatted they're not even written like in a magazine format they're just written as if someone
 was I don't I don't even know how to describe it they're headache inducing for me and I have to
 read them to get stories for this show but it's fascinating you guys if you're a paranormal
 researcher just take a journalism class or buy a journalism book for crying out loud but anyway so
 here's a website that I go to all the time it's a great website called howanwise.com they have a
 lot of really good information on here I found a lot of cool stuff and this is an article called
 well I won't tell you the title right now it's written by a journalist named Vicky Verma
 again I'm not calling you out for being a bad researcher but it's just such a bizarre it's not
 a very well-structured article I'm reading it and it starts off with quoting a Gaia article with
 Gaia if you don't know is middle-aged mom metaphysics it's a website that specializes in just the
 hokeyest of the hokey so unless they're sponsoring this unless they're sponsoring my podcast where
 I'm on their channel one of these days then it's the best source of information around but as of now
 when they're not paying me just a bland repackaging of paranormal and consciousness and stuff like
 that at best then they have stuff then they have stuff that's just straight up fictional but passes
 as reality like the guy who says that he was an Alantean warlord and this article that they're
 referencing Vicky Verma talks about a transcript between Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong as a
 young as they're exiting the lunar module on Apollo 11 and it's like here's a dramatic
 reenactment of what Gaia no recording of this by the way I looked I looked Gaia I tried verifying
 it future future bosses I tried find verifying it Apollo 11 those are giant things no no no this
 is not an optical illusion no one is gonna believe this this is NASA command what what what the
 hell is happening what's wrong with you they're here under the surface who's there calling Apollo 11
 we saw some visitors they were here for a while observing the instruments repeat your last information
 from it repeat your last information I say there were other spaceships they're lined up in the other
 side of the crater and then it just kind of goes on from there right you're like Jason that sounds
 super interesting keep reading me that what are they're nonsense what are they're nonsense are you
 possibly trying to speed towards you gave that half-assed reading I know I know you can do a
 better dramatic reading than that you're an actor for crying out loud what could what could be more
 interesting than that well that is not true and the truth is always more interesting than fiction
 if I could have found a recording of that oh that would have been awesome I would have done
 what is this quit the show and started a new show where I analyze that recording every day
 so in this article I'm reading I was like here's the thing I'm open to it and I tried finding this
 I went to the Gaia website I went to the Gaia website subscribed I joined I joined I'm now an
 Atlantean warrior but I try looking for the recording of this I tried looking for anything
 that backs this up and there's nothing to back it up it's a transcript if this was true
 it doesn't exist it doesn't exist but in this that's how the article starts off and I'm my eyes
 are rolling to my eyes are rolling so hard they've basically achieved a zero gravity
 but in this article after you read about that you get to doctor story you must grave and because
 I'm already primed not to believe what's coming up next because I'm already like that isn't real
 and I've checked it out it wasn't that I just read that I'm like what aliens those don't exist
 I stopped I go wait that's weird and I started looking for other versions of the transcript or
 an audio version or any proof that this existed and it doesn't and then I go back to the article
 and I'm already primed to be like this is made up I almost didn't finish reading the article
 then we get to doctor story must grave
 this guy goes on the record there is a voice recording of him talking about what he saw
 doctor story must grave you may not know who is maybe you do he helped design
 essential space shuttle equipment like spacesuits and life support he's been to space six
 different times he's been on six different space missions he is the only astronaut the only us
 astronaut to fly in all five shuttles including challenger before blue not afterwards that would
 be the feet you flying in a go shuttle ma and if none of that impresses you he was also a guest star
 on home improvement the headline of this article retired NASA astronaut claimed to have seen snake
 shaped UFOs during two missions in space starts off with this bizarre fictional account of this
 UFO float what was it I don't remember how they were on the lunar crater and some alien showed up
 totally fictional so when I get to this transcript of what doctor story must grave said I was like
 what that's not true but but how's and why is includes a link a video link to an episode of
 a old show called sightings and let me read you this transcript this really should have been
 all the only thing the article was about let me read you this transcript on two of my missions
 and I still don't have an answer I have seen a snake out there six seven eight feet long
 it is rubbery because it has internal waves in it and it follows you for a rather long period
 of time the more you fly in space the more you see an incredible amount of things out there and that
 sort of brings to you really a certainty that other living creatures are out there some incredibly
 primitive more primitive some just just proteins coming together amino acids and and some just
 single cell organisms and other civilizations that have been around for a million years that
 are doing unimaginable kinds of things unquote and while he's doing this while he's speaking about
 this on the sightings video they show what appears to be real footage from a shuttle in space and you
 see this weird snake like object floating far far far above the earth next to the shuttle
 it's fascinating sorry and I've seen footage like that before and I've seen the weird orbs and all
 this stuff that seemed to be outside of the earth's atmosphere absolutely fascinating stuff and here
 we have one of the most highly decorated astronauts ever coming forward in a non-faked transcript on
 audio saying this is what I saw there's snakes in space he also does an interview with forbs later on
 and he at that point he's talking more about traditional aliens what we think of as like
 graves and reptilians and stuff like that he is he finds it odd that they would come to earth
 not because of any sort of technological limitations he just thinks that they're out there but why would
 they come to earth like what would make us so special for them to come here in the first place
 which is a very scientific way to look at it it's special to us just like when we're flying in a
 plane or driving down the road and we we drive past Patawah Idaho but you would drive past you
 wouldn't think anything of it you only stop there if you needed to but you're probably going to stop
 by a bigger city but to the people of Patawah Idaho it's their town it's their home the fighting
 huskies is their local football team and they got all this pride there and blah blah blah blah
 to that we're basically Patawah Idaho in the galactic scheme of things but we do sure love our
 huskies there is a reason think think about this story for a second there is a reason why one of
 these is more popular than the other right there is one of these why we know all about the bases
 on the moon or ancient aliens or crop circles this is all alien lore 101 this is something you
 learn when you first start researching aliens you learn these conspiracy theories but organic
 aliens in space floating around like that single cell organisms kind of clumping together and and
 evolving in the atmosphere that's a more of a high-level conspiracy theory and it shouldn't be
 because people are willing to go people who have been to space are willing to go on the record
 and say this is what we saw this should be well known knowledge this should be conspiracy theory
 UFO lore 101 it should be one of the first things you see when they talk about it before we get to
 Betty and Barney hill before we get to cattle mutilations before we get to a entire series
 based on ancient aliens this should be ground zero the building blocks for life have been seen
 in outer space right next to our planet by people who are trained observers and seen on two different
 missions so you can't say oh it was just uh he had some he had a worm in his eye he's like ah
 I shouldn't have been swimming in that swamp right before takeoff I find it interesting I don't know
 if it's by design that the the true stuff is pushed aside by the nobly false stuff even in
 this article itself by vicki verma that is apparent this should have been the top
 we didn't need the people on the moon the the base whatever was the aliens on the crater I've
 literally already I literally already have a hard time remembering what that was because it's just
 fake and this is so fascinating this was real so why are we as a UFO community as UFOologists why
 do we do it as well continually push away the stuff that is real for the stuff that isn't
 I mean there have been massive massive flaws pointed in the ancient aliens theorem and I'll
 put this link on the show notes again there's a guy he did a three hour long video breaking it down
 almost episode by episode showing how this stuff is not aliens over and over and over again no one's
 watching that people just want to hear about ancient aliens and I have no problem I love aliens I have
 no problem discussing it but we should be discussing the stuff from first-hand observers in space
 it's sure it's not laser beams sure they're not building pyramids or creating crap circles or
 mutilating cattle it's a just a lie we don't even know if there's any consciousness in it
 it's just a snake floating around in space but it's real may not be flashy may not be dancing
 with a little top hat it may not be plotting to take over the world but it is life outside of the
 planet earth and even in a website even in an article named after it the headline is on it it's
 buried in that article itself is this just because we don't have a big attention span is this just
 because we want the flashy stuff or is it more sinister than that is someone trying to hide
 the real stuff from us to sell us the independence day alien invasion or the space brothers coming
 to cure all of our diseases or the sinister men in black it's all well and good it's very entertaining
 but the reality of just miles above us right now there are proto life forms slowly evolving
 at the edge of space may not be enough for a whole series on history channel
 or to sell a book but dr story must grave solve these things with his own eyes and put his
 reputation on the line to talk about them that shouldn't just be an episode of an obscure
 television show from the 1990s that should be something that all UFOologists know it should
 be common knowledge among the UFO community but it's not and the mystery is why
