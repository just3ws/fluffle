1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
 A classified ad in Florida promises men a "discreet encounter" with an unfaithful wife.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,960
 Then we travel to Ireland to take a look at the story of a man who's on trial for domestic

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,480
 violence.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,280
 His excuse?

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,880
 The devil made her do it.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,360
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:29,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back!

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,080
 To another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,640
 I hope you guys had an awesome Thanksgiving for those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,480
 This is a global podcast so much people are like, "It was just Thursday, bro.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,640
 It was just Thursday."

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,760
 But still, hope you guys had an awesome Thursday.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,840
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started by giving a shout out to our newest

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,640
 Patreon supporter, Golo Mieheck.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,920
 Golo Mieheck, everyone give a round of applause to Golo Mieheck.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,600
 Golo Mieheck was the one who recommended me tell the witch fighting story.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
 So tip of the hat to you for that.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,200
 Golo Mieheck is running and doing, where's Golo Mieheck from?

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,320
 Let me check actually here before I start making a bunch of jokes about a country they're

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
 not from.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,040
 He has a sticker going out so I have his address.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,440
 Let me take a look here real quick.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
 Serbia.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 Serbia.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,720
 So how do they dance in Serbia?

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,000
 Whatever dance they do in Serbia?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,440
 Golo Mieheck's doing that right now as he's walking into Dead Rabbit Radio headquarters.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,560
 Golo Mieheck, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,440
 You can stop doing that dance now.

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,160
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,040
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,080
 Just help get the word out about the show.

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,320
 Really, really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,840
 And again, dude, I'm so behind on sending out stickers but last week I said I'm sending

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
 them out tomorrow.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,040
 I'm sending them out tomorrow.

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,160
 I'm just really, really behind.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,600
 I apologize.

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,320
 All that being said, Golo Mieheck, I'm gonna give you the keys to the hair hovercraft or

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,920
 a vehicle specifically designed to take us to Florida.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 Everyone hop inside.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
 It's not made out of hair.

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,200
 It's not made out of human hair.

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,520
 Although that might be a component.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,800
 It's hair hovercraft because you know the rabbit motif.

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
 So everyone hop inside the hair hovercraft.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,240
 Golo Mieheck gets in the control panels and we're going apparently there's vacuum cleaner

50
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,600
 or an engine.

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,580
 We're flying out to Florida.

52
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,720
 Not flying, it's hovercraft.

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,840
 We hover a few feet off the ground out to Florida and we are soon in Miami, Florida.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,240
 Now it's a Jetson car.

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,160
 So Golo Mieheck, go ahead park right here.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,600
 We're sitting outside of a little house out in Miami, Florida.

57
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 And while we're there, I pull out my phone and I start scrolling through Craigslist.

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,640
 I'm looking for, looking for love is what I'm doing.

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,920
 I'm looking for a sweet, sweet woman to show me a good old time.

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,000
 And that's when I show you this ad that's been going around Miami, Florida and it promises

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,080
 sex with a quote, "Real heterosexual woman."

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,560
 Which is implied, right?

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,280
 The picture is of a woman.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
 It's a woman named Susan.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
 You would assume, you would assume that it's a real heterosexual woman.

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,720
 Otherwise she wouldn't be trolling the men's board on Craigslist which they don't exist

67
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
 anymore.

68
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,280
 I would have never thought this wasn't a real heterosexual woman.

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,680
 Had it not said in the comments, I am a real heterosexual woman.

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,880
 That'd be like someone going, "Would you like to buy this car?"

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
 It's not a hologram.

72
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,480
 And you're like, "I never once thought it might be."

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,160
 I never thought hologram technology was that advanced.

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,280
 I never thought I could be standing in front of a car and think it was a hologram.

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,880
 But since you said that, it's obviously a hologram.

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,760
 Like it's obviously a hologram.

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,400
 And in this case, it's obviously not a real heterosexual woman.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,720
 It's a hologram of a real heterosexual woman.

79
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,000
 So alarm bells should be going off in the male population of Miami.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But men have disassembled that alarm a long time ago.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,640
 Way back in history, a caveman saw like a cactus that had like a hole in it and goes,

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
 "It's probably super dangerous to do what I'm about to do."

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,920
 But men have removed that warning system really, really early on in our human development.

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,920
 So men were flocking to Susan Leon's house.

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
 Not a real name, by the way.

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,200
 There's a Susan Leon who lives in Miami, Florida.

87
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,480
 Do not go to her house.

88
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 This is not the same person.

89
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,320
 So you show up at Susan's house and she'd be like, "Hey guys, come on into my non-holographic

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
 house."

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,440
 Again, your alarm bells should be going off.

92
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,760
 You show up at this real heterosexual woman's house.

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,520
 And then the first thing she has you do is put on blackout goggles.

94
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,080
 So guys, like at this point, most men should be like, "You know what?

95
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
 I'm out.

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,440
 I was already a little suspicious in the beginning."

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,160
 But the fact that now you're making it so I can't see what happens next, but again,

98
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,500
 the warning system has been disabled.

99
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,280
 These dudes come over to the house, they get put in these blackout goggles, they put a

100
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,560
 sensory deprivation chamber, they're just flowing in water.

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,000
 And while they're banging this girl, they ask, or maybe before, maybe this is preamble,

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,280
 I don't know, I've never asked this question when I've gone over to a girl's house.

103
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,840
 Am I being videotaped?

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
 I've never asked that before.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,840
 I always assume yes.

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,280
 I always put on my best performance and wear stage makeup.

107
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,840
 They go over there wearing blackout goggles, they're at Susan Leon's house and they ask,

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
 "Are we being videotaped?"

109
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,200
 And Susan goes, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

110
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 You need..."

111
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
 No, no, not at all.

112
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,320
 She's her eyeshipped from side to side but she can't see through the blackout goggles.

113
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 She goes, "No, I'm actually cheating on my husband.

114
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
 He's in the military.

115
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,760
 He's overseas fighting for our freedoms.

116
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,360
 But trust me, even though the man who married me, the man who is sacrificing his life, even

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
 though I'm lying to him, you can trust me, good sir.

118
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 Good stranger I've been on Craigslist, I will not videotape you."

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,160
 So guys are like, "Okay, sounds legit, right?

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,440
 Sounds totally legit."

121
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,200
 So they'd have sex and then the dudes would leave.

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,960
 So this is going on for a while and people really aren't super suspicious of it because

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,680
 they're having sex.

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,840
 So they're like, "Okay, you know, there was a little weird but I did have sex and that's

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,760
 what I came there for.

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,040
 No harm, no foul."

127
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,360
 What unscrews this whole mystery, if that's a term, is that a boy goes missing in the area

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 and the cops are looking for him.

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
 The cops are looking for the 16-year-old kid parents reported missing.

130
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,880
 They track him to a hotel and there they find this 16-year-old boy with Susan Leon.

131
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,880
 It was a multi-day sexual abuse fest, cause it's 16 years old, you can't do that.

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
 It's not sex anymore, it's actually abuse at that point.

133
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,520
 But anyway, so Susan Leon gets arrested and that's when we find out Susan Leon is actually

134
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:55,760
 Brian Dunamoistor, probably mispronouncing that but I'm not going to correct it, 33-year-old

135
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
 man.

136
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,400
 Not transgender woman, it was a gay man who was messing around with this kid.

137
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,920
 So the cops bring Brian downtown and question him and the whole story comes out.

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,320
 It turns out that Brian was having men come to his house dressing up like a woman, having

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,040
 sex with them and then them leaving and the cops are super suspicious.

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,760
 They're like, "I did go over to that girl's house recently.

141
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,120
 She had me wearing blackout goggles.

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
 I'd say you looked familiar.

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
 I can't pick you up.

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
 I have a police lineup.

145
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,640
 You have to put on the goggles and you go, "Number three."

146
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,600
 Not only was it rape by deception, which is an actual crime, so he got that charge because

147
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,120
 he basically, that was him lying saying, "You're going to have sex with a real heterosexual

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,760
 woman blinding you and then having sex with that's rape by deception."

149
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,400
 But it wasn't just rape by deception, it wasn't just the abuse with the 16-year-old.

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,160
 Brian was videotaping all of this stuff.

151
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
 And this is the crux of the story.

152
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,200
 Brian's doing three years in prison right now for all of this, but this is so bizarre

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
 to me.

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:06,400
 He was videotaping it for a website that he had called Straight Boys with the Z. Straight

155
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
 Boys.

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,140
 And the website was specific, this was the specific fetish, tricking straight men into

157
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,960
 having gay sex.

158
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
 And I didn't go to the website.

159
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
 I didn't go to the website.

160
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,360
 When I read the article and I think, "What a convoluted and complicated fetish to have."

161
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,120
 How do you develop a fetish that's that specific?

162
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
 Tricky.

163
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,240
 It's not just straight guys being gay.

164
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,640
 It's not just straight guys having gay sex.

165
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 They have to be tricked.

166
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,000
 They have to be fooled into it.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 They have to be hoodwinked.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,280
 I don't get that.

169
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,440
 How much, do you watch a bunch of porn and then you go, "You know, I really like these

170
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,320
 guys exploring their sexuality, but it would be so much more if they didn't know they were

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,920
 exploring their sexuality."

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,800
 I can understand it existing on some level because everything's a fetish to someone,

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,320
 but the fact that you could run a whole website and need so much content for it that you're

174
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
 doing this on a regular basis.

175
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,920
 And who's watching this?

176
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 It's just so bizarre.

177
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,200
 And it's such a convoluted fetish.

178
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
 It's so hard to pull off.

179
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,200
 Think about all the hoops that Brian had to jump through to get this.

180
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,120
 First off, he had to buy a bunch of goggles.

181
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,320
 That's always, you know, you have to lay in that investment for your fetish.

182
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,840
 But then he had like post the ad and then actually have the tricks work and all that

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,680
 stuff hitting cameras and everything like that.

184
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,720
 That'd be like setting up a fetish.

185
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,800
 That'd be like being like, you know what, you know what really turns me on?

186
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,440
 People being lost in caves and then banging them.

187
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
 You're like, "What?"

188
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
 You're like, "No, no, no, hear me out."

189
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
 First off, we start an amateur spelunking camp.

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,080
 So you get a bunch of people who like to go in caves that don't know anything about them.

191
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
 Then we take them out into the woods and we get them lost in a cave.

192
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,880
 Then after about three or four days, after they've been down there for a while, we go

193
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,200
 down there and comfort them and then bang them.

194
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
 You're like, "What?"

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,400
 That sounds like the most convoluted, the most convoluted because I just made it up.

196
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
 But you know what?

197
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,440
 I'm sure there is someone out there.

198
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,400
 I'm sure there is at least one person out there who has a fetish for banging people

199
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,480
 who have been lost in caves for more than three days.

200
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
 Not none of those two days.

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,240
 You've only been lost in a cave for two days.

202
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
 Gaaack.

203
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
 Gross.

204
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,400
 Days or more.

205
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,960
 Someone has that fetish.

206
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,840
 Is there enough people who have that fetish to start their own website?

207
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,320
 I'm never going to check.

208
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,080
 I'm never going to do that research.

209
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,840
 So Brian, yes, horrible criminal.

210
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
 Great by deception.

211
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 You can't do it.

212
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
 It's still rape.

213
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,120
 You're getting a bunch of trouble for it and it's super immoral and gross.

214
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,920
 Those videos are still out there, I'm sure, too, floating around.

215
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,160
 So people are still indulging in this fetish that involves, a crime has to take place for

216
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
 this fetish to exist.

217
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,200
 It's not enough if they're just like pretending.

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,880
 The crime has to take place and that's kind of the most disturbing part of it.

219
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,160
 So bizarre true crime story, bizarre subculture.

220
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,440
 Golo Mihak, are you ready to take us out of here?

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,160
 He's enthusiastically nodding.

222
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,720
 I think we're all ready to go from this sicko's house.

223
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,520
 Golo Mihak, call in that carpenter copter.

224
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,920
 We are headed out to Ireland.

225
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:20,520
 The helicopter is leaving behind Florida and we're cutting across the Atlantic Ocean.

226
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,040
 We're headed out to that beautiful green isle.

227
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,840
 The little land everyone knows is Ireland.

228
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,320
 Golo Mihak's doing his best to land on a couple of leprechauns.

229
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
 Golo Mihak sees a four leaf clover patch he's landing on it.

230
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,280
 He's hoping to kill a couple of leprechauns.

231
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,880
 Luckily for him, they were just holding a wedding.

232
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,520
 So he killed an entire generation of leprechauns.

233
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,360
 We all jump out of the carpenter copter.

234
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,480
 We're walking around Ireland.

235
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,720
 It's August 17th, 2019 and we're in Balli Nalarg.

236
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 That's in Ogilney, Lowy.

237
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,920
 I'm not a bad, that's how it's spelled.

238
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,240
 I'm not making a joke.

239
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,760
 And inside those places is a place called East Clair.

240
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,080
 This story is so interesting.

241
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 I read it the other day.

242
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,320
 I had to read it two or three times.

243
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
 I go, this just doesn't make sense.

244
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,680
 I can't wait to share it with you guys.

245
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,040
 This story is so bizarre.

246
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,720
 In East Clair, there's a man named Shane Givens.

247
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
 He's 48 years old.

248
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,240
 We show up at his house on August 17th, 2019 as he is being led out of the house in handcuffs.

249
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,000
 He's being arrested for domestic violence.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,320
 His girlfriend, we don't have her name.

251
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,600
 They haven't released her age.

252
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,040
 These are all privacy laws over there.

253
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,920
 His girlfriend, she's in her 30s.

254
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,440
 They'd been dating for three years.

255
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,840
 But this night, she called the police on him.

256
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:46,040
 What she said happened was he picked her up and flipped her over onto her back and pinned

257
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,720
 her down and then began shaking her.

258
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,640
 Shaking her so hard she said it lasted forever.

259
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,200
 When the police get there they see visible bruises on her face, her neck, her thighs, her wrists.

260
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,760
 She's pretty roughed up.

261
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,520
 So the cops take him downtown and they're questioning him and they go, so tell us what

262
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,960
 happened and he goes, guys listen, I knew this was going to be an issue.

263
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,800
 Like my family was warning me this was going to be an issue.

264
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,120
 We've been dating for three years.

265
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
 This has been going on for a long time.

266
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
 I'm actually kind of glad you guys got involved.

267
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,440
 And the cops are like, so is this like an ongoing thing?

268
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,040
 Like do you constantly beat her?

269
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,960
 Like are you straight up confessing to us right now?

270
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,680
 And he goes, no, no, no, no, no.

271
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,840
 It is a constant thing, but I'm not laying a hand on her.

272
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,200
 I will admit, I will admit that tonight I grabbed her by her shoulder to restrain her.

273
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,880
 But other than that, I left no bruise on her body.

274
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,880
 I didn't shake her.

275
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
 I didn't pin her down.

276
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,680
 None of that stuff is real.

277
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,240
 What happened was she's possessed by a demon.

278
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,840
 She's beating her shelf up.

279
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,600
 He said for the past three years when they'd been dating, they'd be sitting over at his

280
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,560
 house just trying to enjoy it a nice quiet evening and something would go flying off of

281
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,080
 his shelf.

282
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,600
 Shatter on the ground.

283
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 Leprechaun?

284
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,400
 Your first thing is going to be rational explanations.

285
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,960
 Stiff wind, other stuff that could cause things to fly across the room.

286
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,160
 But as these things continue to happen, obviously they're starting to think there's some sort

287
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,840
 of paranormal activity.

288
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,320
 The lights in his house would shut off and on.

289
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Pulled her guys to activity.

290
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,240
 It's not the most comfortable place to be, but you're not going to think it's the person

291
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
 sitting next to you.

292
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,960
 But when his girlfriend, let's call her Rebecca, and I'm just guessing, sometimes Rebecca would

293
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,120
 be sitting there next to him and she'd go into a trance.

294
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
 Just stare off into space.

295
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,920
 That's unsettling enough, but then when she begins speaking Latin and he knows she doesn't

296
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,800
 know Latin, he realizes she's possessed.

297
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,320
 He's telling the cops this stuff.

298
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,400
 The devil's making her do it.

299
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,800
 I've actually seen her punch herself to the point where she's bruising herself.

300
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
 She's committing all this self-harm, officers.

301
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
 Because the demon inside of her, she's a good person, but she has something inside of her

302
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,840
 that's making her do all this violence of "I didn't do it.

303
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,520
 In fact, I've been trying to help her these past couple years."

304
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,720
 And my family warned me.

305
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,320
 My family warned me, because I reached out to them.

306
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,800
 I've been telling them about all this stuff, that she's going to end up dead and you're

307
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,920
 going to be blamed for it.

308
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
 She's going to end up killing herself and you're going to be blamed for it.

309
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
 And he thought, "I am."

310
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,640
 It could happen, but I'm willing to stay with this woman.

311
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,080
 But here he is, sitting in a police station, being charged with domestic violence.

312
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,600
 So the cops are super suspicious about all of this stuff, obviously.

313
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,000
 I'm sure they have never heard this excuse before, but they look into it.

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,920
 Now, they know that he attacked her.

315
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,840
 That's the most obvious answer.

316
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,240
 Like something falling off of your shelf.

317
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,120
 The most obvious answer is generally the right answer.

318
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,520
 What comes out of all this, through the course of this investigation?

319
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,680
 Shane is able to show photos of bruises she had gotten before.

320
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,640
 And he's like, "You see these photos of these bruises on her thighs?

321
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,080
 Don't those look like the bruises she had from the photos you took that night?"

322
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,240
 The police are like, "Yeah, but you could easily have just been abusing her this whole

323
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
 time."

324
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,520
 When they asked Rebecca, "How'd you get those bruises in that earlier picture?"

325
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,440
 He's showing me pictures of you having bruises before.

326
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,400
 Rebecca goes, "I don't know how I got those bruises."

327
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
 The cops are like, "Oh, she's just covering for her boyfriend.

328
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,440
 This happens in domestic violence cases a lot."

329
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,800
 They make a report and then they want to retract it.

330
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,880
 Weird, though.

331
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,600
 The police are put in touch with a local priest, Father Donog O'Mara.

332
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,520
 Father O'Mara says, "Shane and Rebecca had approached me about getting an exorcism.

333
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,760
 I talked to him.

334
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,840
 I didn't do an exorcism."

335
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,120
 The cops go, "This has been going on for a while."

336
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,320
 And Father O'Mara is like, "Yeah, it has been going on for a while.

337
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,040
 They talked to me back then."

338
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,000
 And they go, "Well, you didn't do an exorcism, but do you think she was possessed?"

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,080
 And Father O'Mara goes, "I'm kind of reluctant to say whether or not she was possessed."

340
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,560
 However, I do believe Shane is telling the truth of these events, i.e. he didn't do

341
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,840
 it.

342
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,080
 The police also tracked down a faith healer that Shane was like.

343
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,400
 I had also taken her to this faith healer, this local woman named Jane Donnelly.

344
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,480
 They talked to the faith healer and they go, "So we're investigating this domestic violence

345
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 case.

346
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,800
 Shane and Rebecca, they said they came to you and they said they had ongoing problems."

347
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,560
 And Jane's like, "Oh yeah, I totally remember that couple."

348
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,760
 They came in and I was trying to do this healing ritual and just BAM right in front of me,

349
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,760
 Rebecca goes into a catatonic state.

350
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,720
 When they talk to Shane about the healer, about her going catatonic in front of another

351
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,680
 witness, Shane goes, "Ah, that's really only half the story.

352
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,640
 The healer doesn't even know this part of the story."

353
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,360
 We were driving home from visiting the healer, driving the car Rebecca's sitting in the passenger

354
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,720
 seat next to me and she goes back into one of her trances.

355
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:09,520
 As we were driving back to my house, she turns to me and she goes, "I hide in the shadows."

356
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,040
 Things are going to get way worse from here on out.

357
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,760
 It's funny because now that I think about it, earlier in the episode I said about, you

358
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,720
 know, the little warning lights, the little warning light people have, but men have disassembled,

359
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,400
 that would be the point where you'd be like, "We're breaking up."

360
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
 Like, that's just super spooky, right?

361
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,240
 We're breaking up, we're done, but he continued to be with her.

362
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:39,040
 There's actually video footage back from 2016, so very early on in their relationship, where

363
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,800
 he tried doing an exorcism himself on her.

364
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,440
 In that video, she began scraping her own skin.

365
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,960
 And Shane's like, "See, look at that.

366
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,200
 That's one of the injuries she had when you saw her.

367
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,360
 She had that scraped up skin.

368
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,480
 She's doing the same thing in this video."

369
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,080
 The cops are like, "Oh my God, how weird is this case going to get?

370
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,240
 I didn't think when I showed up to work today I was going to be watching a video of an exorcism."

371
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,560
 Some guy performing an exorcism on his girlfriend.

372
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,640
 He even shows the cops a text message from her later on that said, "I'm so glad I knew

373
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
 I needed an exorcism."

374
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,920
 So even she is believing this.

375
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,880
 So the cops are like, "Okay, so it's not just a video that he shot without her knowledge

376
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,680
 or he was pretending to do something.

377
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,440
 It's like, hey, let's make a horror movie or something to prepare my defense three years

378
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,720
 from now when I'm on trial for domestic violence."

379
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,440
 She seemed to go along with the idea, "Oh, well, she's seeing the faith healers.

380
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,720
 She's seeing the priests."

381
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,320
 At one point they even went to America.

382
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,520
 He traveled, he paid for her to go out to America to go to this religious, he was really

383
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,720
 cagey on the details.

384
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,200
 He goes, "They don't want any publicity.

385
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,800
 They're probably going to be mad that I even give this much information."

386
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,480
 But me and her went to America to go talk to this religious organization that was going

387
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,960
 to help exorcise her.

388
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
 It didn't work.

389
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,280
 None of this stuff was working.

390
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,680
 I tried exorcising her.

391
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,480
 The priest was being reluctant about it.

392
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,440
 The faith healer actually seemed to make things worse.

393
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,840
 He's on trial and Judge Durkin is ruling the proceedings.

394
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
 He's listened to all the evidence.

395
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
 He's watching the videos.

396
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
 He's seeing the photos.

397
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,040
 Judge Durkin is equally puzzled as anybody else.

398
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,400
 This just doesn't make sense.

399
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,480
 This is a standard domestic violence case.

400
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,040
 This is 100% a guy roughed up a woman.

401
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,120
 They see it all the time.

402
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,920
 But then the judge is looking at the stuff about the exorcism and her saying, "Thanks,

403
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 I needed an exorcism.

404
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,440
 You have this faith healer and this minister come forward."

405
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,280
 And they're like, "Could be something super weird."

406
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:41,560
 Judge Durkin asks the lead investigative officer, Garda Darren McLaughlin, places on the stand

407
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,760
 and he goes, "Listen, I don't believe in ghosts.

408
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
 I don't believe in demons.

409
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,760
 I don't believe in any of that stuff."

410
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,960
 But this is a really weird case, your honor.

411
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
 This is some spooky stuff.

412
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,680
 The judge dismisses the case against Shane.

413
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,720
 So he's not necessarily saying Shane is not guilty.

414
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,320
 But he had an interesting note for the investigators.

415
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,200
 He goes, "This comes across as a standard domestic violence case, but I think you should

416
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,600
 have investigated the demonic angle a little more."

417
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,640
 Cops are like, "Dude, we're not the watcher counsel.

418
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
 We're actually just police officers."

419
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,760
 The judge is like, "I really think that the argument..."

420
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,080
 I'm putting words in his mouth because I don't have the actual...

421
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,160
 I don't want to get sued by a judge.

422
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,680
 But basically, yes, it looks like a standard domestic violence case.

423
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,600
 It may be a standard domestic violence case, but we have all these...

424
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,160
 Usually it's a he said, she said.

425
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,760
 Or unfortunately, sometimes it's a he said, she said, and then the kids watch, too.

426
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,360
 But this time, it's going on for years.

427
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,400
 They're traveling around the world to try to cure her supposed exorcism.

428
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,080
 The judge is like, "I don't think you looked on the demonic angle enough.

429
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,000
 I think that there's more to this than meets the eye."

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,840
 Case dismissed.

431
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,320
 After everything was said and done, Shane felt comfortable giving an interview about

432
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,160
 this story.

433
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,040
 The case just ended very, very recently.

434
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,320
 They ask him and he goes, "Listen, I'm glad no one knows Rebecca's real name.

435
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
 I wish you the best.

436
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
 We broke up that night.

437
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,840
 I really haven't seen her since we broke up other than the trial.

438
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,160
 But I wish you the best.

439
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,880
 I hope her identity doesn't get leaked.

440
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
 I'm not going to do it.

441
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,720
 I think she's a good person, but she has this darkness inside of her.

442
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,080
 He talks about how he could see her slowly shifting, that darkness taking her over.

443
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,040
 He has this interesting quote, which should be uplifting for everyone in Ireland.

444
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,520
 "You can meet her at work and you wouldn't know.

445
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,240
 You might just think she's a bit quiet or something.

446
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,480
 This totally unassuming young woman living and working and walking among you in Ireland,

447
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,880
 not us, not the rest of the world.

448
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,960
 Sorry, guys.

449
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,080
 She's a normal looking, but has this darkness inside of her to the point that she's actually

450
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,880
 damaging her own body."

451
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
 Or you go, "Jason, maybe this was not true justice.

452
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,720
 He absolutely committed domestic violence against her."

453
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,080
 That's obviously possible.

454
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,280
 That's obviously possible.

455
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,680
 But I thought it was an interesting footnote to wrap this story up.

456
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,560
 After the trial, so the case has been dismissed, they've separated.

457
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,080
 He wishes her the best, says, "I hope she's able to retain her privacy.

458
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,120
 I hope she's just able to get the help that she needs.

459
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,200
 I'm not the one to provide it.

460
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
 I'm out."

461
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,440
 As he's trying to put his life back together, he starts to get text messages on his phone.

462
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
 "Doo-doo-doo."

463
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
 He looks at it.

464
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,840
 It's a text from Rebecca.

465
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,040
 "Doo-doo-doo."

466
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,800
 Another text from Rebecca.

467
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,160
 "Doo-doo-doo."

468
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,040
 For a few days, his phone keeps getting texts from Rebecca's number.

469
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,200
 They're all written in Latin.

470
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,600
 Eventually, he just blocks her number and tries to move on with his life.

471
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,520
 So that's the tale of Shane Gibbons, a man who narrowly avoided going to prison for domestic

472
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
 violence.

473
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,280
 It's a terrifying tale of that intersection between paranormal and true crime.

474
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,600
 It makes you wonder how many other crimes are perpetrated by people who are demonically

475
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 possessed.

476
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,920
 Or how many people are innocently put into jail because of demonic factors.

477
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,360
 I was watching videos the other day.

478
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,520
 It was one of those internet rabbit holes I went down.

479
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:32,920
 It was videos of women bashing their heads into walls and then calling cops for domestic

480
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
 violence.

481
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,680
 Now, that's an outlier.

482
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,400
 Most domestic violence horrifically is real.

483
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,360
 Most domestic violence actually is partner on partner violence.

484
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,760
 But when you watch a video of a young woman smashing her head into the wall and luckily

485
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
 someone else was videotaping it.

486
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,000
 They had someone on a balcony looking down and this girl was yelling at her boyfriend

487
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,080
 for cheating.

488
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,480
 She cheated on her boyfriend.

489
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,820
 He went to get back together with her.

490
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,760
 She walked over and she started pounding her head into a pillar and then was going to call

491
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,640
 the cops and then she realized she was on video.

492
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 There was no video there.

493
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,760
 Obviously, it would be his word against hers.

494
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,240
 It would be an awful mess.

495
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,640
 And you would think as a normal human, what lunatic would smash their own head into a

496
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,320
 pillar?

497
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,040
 So when you look at video like that, you have to wonder like is she mentally disturbed?

498
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,920
 Or is she demonically possessed?

499
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,080
 Someone willing to do that much damage to their body for something so petty?

500
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
 It's bizarre.

501
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 It's bizarre.

502
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,960
 It's inhuman behavior to injure yourself like that.

503
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,560
 It's funny though because really Shane got off easy.

504
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,360
 This story could have ended much, much darker.

505
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,600
 Not with a young woman punching herself in the thighs, but while Shane was sleeping one

506
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,120
 night, she lies awake.

507
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,640
 But she's not awake.

508
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,880
 The thing inside of her is awake.

509
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,360
 Looking through her eyes.

510
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:04,320
 She finds herself walking through the house, opening a kitchen drawer, pulling out a knife,

511
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,900
 stabbing Shane to death.

512
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,220
 That's what we would expect for a demonically possessed person to do.

513
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,640
 But I don't think the demon wanted to kill.

514
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,600
 I think the demon was feeding off of Shane Gibbons psychological torment.

515
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
 He loved this woman.

516
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,800
 I wouldn't fly a girl to another country to get her help.

517
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 You go.

518
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 I'll pick up with you.

519
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 I'm not going to do that.

520
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,600
 He obviously loved this woman.

521
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,200
 And that love is what kept him there, even though everyone else was warning him to leave.

522
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,600
 And whatever was inside of her was feeding off of that torment.

523
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
 So they didn't want to kill him.

524
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 They could have easily killed him.

525
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,660
 They could have easily killed her.

526
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:50,400
 They wanted to savor that delicacy of Shane's love and fear.

527
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,420
 All the way up to the point where he was even able to get a taste of him during the trial,

528
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,840
 feeding off of his uncertainty.

529
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,480
 So she's still out there.

530
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,020
 And like Shane, I do wish her the best, but she is still out there.

531
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,040
 And if she doesn't get treated, that darkness inside of her is still out there as well.

532
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,000
 Even for another victim.

533
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,960
 Looking for someone else to feed off of.

534
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,760
 I hope that she's able to get this darkness out of her and move on with her life.

535
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,320
 But if she doesn't, she is a ticking time bomb that darkness needs to feed again.

536
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,000
 It will find somebody else to fall in love and then slowly torment them.

537
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,360
 Although this time it may be a little more careful, a little more practiced, a little

538
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,520
 more sinister.

539
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:51,200
 It now knows that a trail of evidence can quickly destroy its final greatest meal, watching

540
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,680
 an innocent man be thrown into prison.

541
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:02,640
 Next time the demon will know exactly what and what not to do to ensure success.

542
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,400
 And if the demon doesn't get it right the next time, he can try again and again and

543
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,160
 again.

544
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,960
 And when this darkness is done with Rebecca, it will move on to the next young woman and

545
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,720
 the next one and the next one and the next one.

546
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,880
 It has all the time in the world to perfect this scheme and along the way it will feed

547
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,680
 off the energy of young men thrown in prison, their lives ruined, their souls destroyed.

548
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,400
 The demon knows the truth.

549
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,160
 There is no shortage of young women who are missing something in their lives.

550
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:42,920
 They are lonely and they are sad and they can invite a dark presence into their life without

551
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,280
 even being aware of that.

552
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:52,200
 And there is no shortage of men out there who will do anything, even ignore every possible

553
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,520
 red flag in the book to be next to a woman.

554
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,840
 The demon doesn't have to use a ton of tricks to ruin people's lives.

555
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:11,360
 He just uses human nature to create paranormal chaos.

556
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,880
