1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 What happens when the secrets of the universe fall into the hands of the uninitiated?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,440
 And then we meet two buddies who are camping in the middle of an Arizona desert.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,520
 They thought they were just gonna roast marshmallows and look up at the night sky.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,240
 Instead they found themselves walking into an abandoned mine

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,720
 trying to save

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,000
 human women. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,600
 *Music*

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,880
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,600
 Whatever you guys are doing. Let's go ahead and get started here.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
 We got a lot of stuff to cover. So first off come in into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,040
 It's fully air conditioned in Dead Rabbit Command. One of our longtime Patreon supporters.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,120
 It's Ellie Rack. Everyone give a round of applause to Ellie Rack.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,280
 Come in into Dead Rack. Shut the door. Shut the door. Don't let the air out.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,640
 Ellie Rack, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,400
 If you guys can't spread the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,040
 Really, really helps out a lot. Really, really means a lot when I see you guys talk about it online.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,440
 Ellie Rack, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,960
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
 San Diego, California.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 *Dun dun dun dun dun*

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,160
 Ellie Rack is piloting this Dune Buggy all the way down to San Diego, California.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,360
 And the reason why we're headed down there is we're gonna meet a woman named Sharon Lee Giganti.

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,840
 She's- she's- she's- her namesake is not- she's a giant. That would be awesome.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,560
 Sharon Lee Giganti. I'm probably not pronouncing that right, but Sharon Lee G-

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,400
 I don't care. Sharon Lee- because she's- she's not-

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,040
 You're in for one heck of a story, guys. Sharon Lee Giganti is a-

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 a-

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
 new-age-

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
 Warner. Is that a thing? Is that a thing when he tells someone not to do something? Don't do that.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,000
 Are you like, instead of being anti-drug, are you a drug-warner? I don't think that's a thing. She is- she is anti-new-age.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,080
 That's what I was looking for. Sharon Lee Giganti. She doesn't like new-age stuff. And she's doing this interview.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,160
 She's being interviewed by Cheryl Dickow for the Catholic Exchange. It's this website. So they're asking Sharon.

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,520
 They're like, "So why don't you like new-age stuff?"

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,800
 Which is an old old conspiracy theory. Nowadays, like yoga- I was talking to someone recently-

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,960
 I forgot who it was and they said, "Did you- did you know there are some people who think yoga?

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,560
 St. Tannock?" And I go, "Yeah, totally." That's like-

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,240
 That was real popular when I was a kid. They were like, "What?" I said, "Yeah, when I was a kid,

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,440
 we were told that yoga was a pathway to Satan in- Satan worshipping."

41
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,840
 Because it wasn't about moving your body. It was about the "Om-

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,560
 Om." It was about like, centering yourself and being one with the universe.

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,920
 And that was a pathway to the dark principalities. That's what we were told as kids.

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,240
 And then they invented yoga pants and people stopped complaining about it.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,560
 Yoga being a pathway to the dark forces. When I was a kid, new-age was considered

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,240
 not necessarily Satan worshipping, but Satan worshipping adjacent. The theory was always this.

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,960
 The people at the bottom were just dupes. They were being led in to believe that this crystal can heal their arthritis and that

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,480
 they do this yoga, if they meditate, all this stuff that was kind of being packaged in the 70s and the 80s.

49
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,800
 Reincarnation through Shirley MacLean, astrology. These are all

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,680
 really old Satanic practices that were being repackaged for the 70s and the 80s. So stay away from them.

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,680
 There's a lot of books. You can go to used bookstores and find a ton of books on this subject.

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,480
 And then you figured that the people at the bottom were dupes and the people at the top were Satan worshippers.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,320
 And they were the ones who were pulling the strings and they were the ones who were misleading this entire generation of people.

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,920
 Now that conspiracy theory has fallen to the wayside. What we know pretty much now that

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:08,760
 the people at the bottom are still dupes and the people at the top are grifters. Now, not 100% of the time, yoga is now considered more of an exercise.

56
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,000
 But it had its roots in like yogi, yogi stuff. Not yogi bear.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,920
 "Aye boo boo, let me center yourself and become one with the universe."

58
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,440
 Nowadays, though, there's a lot of grifters in the New Age movement. So when you have Sharon Lee

59
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,240
 Gigante show up, you think is she coming at it from that angle just saying like, listen,

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:38,120
 they're ripping you off. This crystal's not doing this. If it was doing this, then the poor slaves who were reminding the crystal out of the ground would have

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,520
 really centered hearts and their bones would be super healthy and they'd have the best love life.

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:52,120
 But no, they're just mining these gems out of the earth as slave labor and then you can buy them at some jewelry shop for 100, 200% markup.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,400
 So they can't be doing that much good because people are trapped in slavery to get you that little quartz piece.

64
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,000
 So she's not running on the don't be a sucker angle.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,880
 She's running on the angle as Satan worshippers are running the New Age movement still.

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,800
 And she actually has a in depth look at this whole thing. She tells this story

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:21,400
 that she was just a young woman. She used former Miss San Diego. She puts that in her bio,

68
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,240
 which is weird, right? She was running her up to Miss California.

69
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,000
 It doesn't have anything to do with what you're talking about. All it did was make me want to find out what you look like. You're a very attractive woman.

70
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,840
 But it has nothing to do with anything else that doesn't make me take you anymore or less seriously.

71
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,680
 It's just a weird part of the bio, right? That'd be like me saying, yeah, I research paranormal conspiracy and true crime

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,480
 and I always voted prettiest eyes in the eighth grade for the boys in my class. It's true.

73
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,920
 But it doesn't change anything, right? It doesn't change anything. You're not going to be like, whoa, prettiest eyes in eighth grade.

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,880
 You must really know what he's talking about. So Sharon Lee Giganti is trying to expose the truth.

75
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,400
 She found out about the law of attraction, the secret, this idea that, which I believe in actually,

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,880
 that if you, I believe in a different version of it, but this is kind of how,

77
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,600
 this is kind of the version she's looking at, is that the thoughts you put out into the universe is what the universe gives to you.

78
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,360
 So if you put out that I want a brand new car, eventually you're going to get a brand new car.

79
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,240
 Now that's the law of attraction. That's a very bastardized version of the law of attraction.

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,680
 The law of attraction is, talk about lost media. I've talked about this book so many times on this show,

81
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,400
 the science of getting rich by Wallace Waddles.

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,280
 Everyone who talks about the law of attraction rips this guy off and they totally miss the point.

83
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,320
 If you want to know about the law of attraction, you have to read, it's becoming harder and harder to find.

84
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's actually a copyright free book. Anyone can publish it and people are not publishing it because

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,800
 anyone can publish it. They'd rather publish these other books that are being written, but the law of attraction,

86
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,200
 the science of getting rich is, you have to visualize it. You have to already be thankful that you already have it.

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,520
 You have to believe you already have it and you have to work extremely hard every single day.

88
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,400
 The law of attraction leaves out that last part. You just go, "Ahh, sitting in the back of my new jag."

89
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,520
 The science of getting rich goes, you want to be in that new jaguar, which didn't exist?

90
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,120
 If you said that back then, Wallace would think you were actually riding a jaguar.

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 His book was written in the late 1800s.

92
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,440
 If you wanted that house, you have to visualize the house, you have to believe you're already living in that house.

93
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,240
 If you live in poverty, you have to live in

94
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,600
 the riches of the world. He goes, "If you can look at your environment and it is squalor,

95
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,320
 but you see wealth, if you can actually see something that is not yet true, you have mastered your mind.

96
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,720
 You have become a mastermind and the universe will reward you for that.

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,640
 The universe wants to give you excess. That is what the universe is designed to do.

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,800
 And there's enough for everyone.

99
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,040
 A very, very interesting way of looking at the world,

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,000
 but you also have to work very, very hard.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,280
 And I use the, I've used, I haven't been shy on the show, I've used the law of attraction for this show.

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,840
 And if I just sat back, if I released an episode a month and go, "Ah, this show's going to be a huge hit.

103
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,720
 It wouldn't work out." I bust my butt. I spend four or five hours a day putting out every single episode.

104
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,480
 I bust my butt and the, and the growth of the show goes for it.

105
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,840
 But if I just do the show and don't do the law of attraction, I notice downloads fall off.

106
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,200
 It's very, very interesting. You have to do both.

107
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,320
 But Sharon has a, Sharon, the way she looks at the law of attraction is the way that modern people look at the law of attraction.

108
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,120
 That

109
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,000
 the universe will also punish you for negative thoughts.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,760
 Which is a really, really harsh and I think self-destructive way to look at the world.

111
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,320
 And that you blame people who get cancer. You're thinking about negative, you're thinking about cancer.

112
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,640
 You're thinking about negative thoughts. Well, I wasn't thinking about cancer.

113
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,720
 Well, you were thinking about your husband leaving you and over, like, now that you brought that up, I am worried about that.

114
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,280
 You bring on the sickness, you bring on the disasters. That's not, that's really not what the science of getting riches about.

115
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,000
 You can stop your progress from going forward, sure.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,880
 But if you start thinking bad things, that's not like all of a sudden everything's going to collapse.

117
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,440
 The new way of looking at the law of attraction is this

118
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,560
 feast or famine type of thing.

119
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,520
 And it blames you for when something goes wrong. Which of course when people talk about the law of attraction,

120
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,840
 they always go, "What about these kids in the Sudan who have these raiders come into their town and slaughter all the adult males

121
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,480
 and everyone else is running out of the village?" And did they

122
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,200
 wish that upon themselves?

123
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,800
 Wallace Waddles would say no. That's just they're in a place, a geographical place where that's going to happen.

124
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,400
 The law of attraction will get them out of there, will help get them out of there.

125
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,440
 But it's not, they're not dreaming about being mutilated and then that happens. The new law of attraction says it's their fault.

126
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,040
 So it's a very easy way to

127
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:11,000
 divorce yourself from reality, this new law of attraction. And that's what's interesting about this story of Sharon.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,720
 She specifically starts following the teachings of Abraham. Abraham?

129
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,920
 You know, I don't want to spend the whole episode talking about the law of attraction, but this is such an interesting,

130
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,200
 I don't think I've ever really gotten this deep into it. There's a woman named Esther Hicks, and then there's the woman who wrote

131
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 the secret. Her name, I think her name was Shandra. I didn't

132
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,360
 think I was going to go this into depth to this, but this is really interesting. So you have

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,560
 Esther Hicks, she believes there's a coalition of aliens or interdimensional beings or angels or something like that.

134
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,600
 And they channel voices into her head and they're called Abraham. And they have given her all this knowledge and basically

135
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:57,000
 the interdimensional alien people gave her the knowledge that some dude wrote about in the late 1800s. That's free to publish.

136
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,960
 What a coincidence, right? What a coincidence.

137
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,640
 But now she can package as something copyrightable because it's hers or from

138
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,640
 Abraham. And then you have Shonda, damn it, I don't remember her last name, but you have the woman who wrote the secret, which is also

139
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,680
 a repackaged version of a book that anyone can publish, but you, the secret's copyrighted.

140
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,920
 So she gets money if you buy the secret, Esther Hicks gets money if you buy the Abraham stuff.

141
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,840
 They originally worked together on the original version of the movie, The Secret, which was kind of like a

142
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,920
 not really a documentary, it was kind of like just a video version of the book.

143
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,200
 And then they did a second version of the movie and they completely removed Esther Hicks from it.

144
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,000
 And nobody really knows why. Apparently there was some sort of

145
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,600
 business falling out. We don't know why, financial or personality wise.

146
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,720
 And I always find that's, when you're, this is what I find so interesting, when you're talking about unlocking the secrets in the

147
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,400
 universe and unlimited wealth, does it really matter if you're getting 20% on this deal or 30% on this deal or 5% on the deal?

148
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,160
 Because guess what? Unlimited wealth, if what you're saying is true,

149
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,360
 it shouldn't matter what this particular deal is. And if you do this movie and they end up

150
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,680
 arguing and taking, just be like fine, yeah, whatever. You can take 50% of this because guess what? Unlimited wealth is coming upon me.

151
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,760
 I don't, I always think it's really interesting when spiritual people fight over something so banal as money.

152
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,080
 But that's, we don't know if it was a vicious fight, if it was just an economic falling out,

153
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,920
 but they did part ways. The video was re-edited, lost media once again.

154
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,640
 I don't even know if you can find the original version.

155
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,320
 But Esther Hicks believes that these messages are being beamed in her head.

156
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,920
 The person who wrote the secret is just saying, I stumbled across this secret that'll give you riches.

157
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,880
 Now they've both become pretty wealthy off repackaging Wallace Waddle's free book.

158
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:55,080
 But you know, that is the way that culture works. But if you really want to know the secret,

159
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,480
 it's free. You can find the science of getting rich anywhere online, or you can buy a published copy,

160
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,760
 you can publish it yourself if you wanted to. But if you go like the Abraham route, if you go with Esther Hicks,

161
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,720
 she's selling the whole kit and caboodles. You can actually go to Abrahamic training sessions

162
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,520
 and become an Abraham ambassador. You notice how all this stuff is trademarked, right?

163
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,760
 So you become an Abraham ambassador and then that allows you to go forth and speak the truth.

164
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,760
 And we talked about it yesterday on the conspiracy theory iceberg episode where I said,

165
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,080
 there is a specialness to having knowledge no one else has. That's what the word a cult means.

166
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,280
 It means hidden knowledge. And it makes you feel special. So if someone designates you as an Abraham

167
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,160
 ambassador, you can go out and you can spread the word of the secret knowledge. That's what Sharon

168
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,720
 does. Sharon is now an Abraham ambassador and she begins telling people about the secret.

169
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,600
 Because she begins telling people about the law of attraction. She begins

170
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,800
 proselyt. She begins spreading this throughout the world.

171
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,720
 Recently I did an episode about hypnotism, a man who killed another man via hypnotism. And I never

172
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,600
 really thought twice about hypnotism before that episode. It's a very, very interesting thing on

173
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,120
 that episode. We learned that you cannot treat this is so interesting. I think you can, I think

174
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,480
 you can spread this across religious teachings. Obviously a law of attraction. That's why we're

175
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,200
 doing this segue. You cannot treat someone using hypnosis for a problem you cannot treat without

176
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,080
 hypnosis. I know when my dad, he was a minister growing up, a Southern Baptist minister when I

177
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,400
 was growing up. Part of his training was they had to do marriage counseling. They had to do

178
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,200
 suicide intervention. They had to do, like to be a minister, you had to train yourself and to be a

179
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,680
 counselor of all these different issues as well. Because people are going to come to you. If you're

180
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,640
 not a trained marriage counselor and they come to you and you're like, just live life. Find what you

181
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,160
 enjoy most and try to make it better to get there. You're just going to have divorce after

182
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,880
 divorce after divorce. To be a trained marriage counselor. And I'm sure that religions of other

183
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,440
 faiths do the same thing. I'm sure Amon's get trained in counseling and Rabbi's get trained in

184
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,120
 counseling. But do Abraham ambassadors get trained in suicide counseling? Do they get trained in

185
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,760
 hardcore depression counseling? Or do they just get trained to spread the word? Now I'm not holding

186
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,800
 Esther Hicks responsible for anything that happens here because she has her organization. She can't

187
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,840
 be responsible for everyone. And I'm sure she would be horrified to hear this story as well. But

188
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:35,080
 what happened with Sharon Lee was that she began preaching the word of Abraham and

189
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,000
 this quote leads us into where we're going. She says, "I was not prepared for the devastating

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,880
 effects of this false worldview." Her brother was having a really hard time in life.

191
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,680
 She said he was suffering from mental issues. She doesn't define what they are,

192
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:02,520
 but they seem to be pretty serious. But whatever it was, his friends and family wanted to stage an

193
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,720
 intervention for him. They wanted to corner him. Not literally, they don't want to back him into a

194
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,480
 corner, but they want to confront him in a friendly way and say, "You need to go get treated for your

195
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,880
 mental illness. It's affecting everyone's life. We're watching you. We're just watching you degrade

196
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,520
 in front of us. We're just watching you fall apart in front of us. You need to do it. If not for

197
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,120
 yourself, you need to do it for your son." He has a four-month-old son and his family is like,

198
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,520
 "Listen, you need to take care of yourself." But Sharon Lee believes in the law of attraction.

199
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,200
 Sharon Lee says, "I've reached out to these people because we're a family. We're talking to each

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:52,440
 other. I said you don't. You just need to believe that he's not sick. He's sick because not only he

201
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,080
 believes it, but we believe that he's sick. All of our mental energy is going and if we say he's sick,

202
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,480
 he's sick." She's convincing them not to hold this intervention. This is going to prove the power of

203
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,400
 the law of attraction. These are high stakes. These are high stakes, but she's going to prove

204
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,120
 the law of attraction. This story really pisses me off, honestly. This story really pisses me off.

205
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:24,520
 She's going to prove that the law of attraction works. She convinces her family and his friends

206
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,680
 to not stage this intervention. The universe will correct it if they believe that he's healthy.

207
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:39,240
 Her brother ended up killing his four-month-old son because of untreated mental illness.

208
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:49,080
 She got life in prison without parole. Imagine this is you. Imagine you have that belief.

209
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,240
 And as much as I do believe in the law of attraction, I still go to the doctor. I still go to the

210
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:01,160
 doctor. I still don't spend my money willy-nilly. I still wake up every day and work on this podcast

211
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,400
 because I know that that's a huge component of it. I go to the doctor and I get treated for

212
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,600
 stuff. I just don't sit there and think I'm healthy. I'm healthy. I'm healthy. I'm healthy as my heart stops.

213
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:19,480
 Imagine that's you. Imagine you convince people you just have to manifest into the universe and

214
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:27,480
 your brother kills your nephew. That would devastate me. Right? It would devastate you.

215
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:43,640
 I think it would devastate anyone who was aware of their duty as a human. We got to take care of

216
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,680
 each other, right? At the very, very least, you would go, "You know what? This stuff doesn't work.

217
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:55,480
 Like, we tried so hard and I tried so hard. It didn't work." At the very, very least, you may give up

218
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:05,800
 on the law of attraction. But nope. That's not where Sharon's story ends. We know now that she's

219
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:14,840
 anti-law of attraction, but is that what turned her away from it? No. It had to happen again.

220
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:24,840
 Sharon had a friend who came to her and confessed to her that she was

221
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:37,880
 suicidal. But Abraham has an answer for that as well. This is what Sharon told a suicidal friend.

222
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:49,800
 "In truth, every death is a suicide, since we are in charge of when we reemerge into the non-physical

223
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:59,640
 dimension." Basically saying the reason that I'm stricken with cancer, the reason why I'm hit with

224
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,320
 a car, the reason why I'm killed fighting 18 ninjas and take out 17 of them is because I believed

225
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:16,200
 I was going to die. I believed I was going to die then and the universe gave it to me.

226
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,680
 So what's the difference between me worrying about cancer, getting cancer, dying of cancer,

227
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:30,600
 and you drinking poison? Tell a suicidal person that. It might as well cock the gun.

228
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:39,640
 Her friend asks, "This is so irresponsible." The reason why this pisses me off is because,

229
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,760
 like I said, I know, I feel that this works. But when it's bastardized like this,

230
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,480
 and you should be doing it, even as I believe in the law of attraction, if someone came to me with

231
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,320
 suicidal thoughts, I would not sit there and tell them to believe those thoughts don't exist and

232
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 they will go away. A lot of this stuff really pisses me off and it's not the New Age movement's

233
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,640
 fault. Again, like I was saying earlier, grifters and stuff like that, there's stuff that's legit

234
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,960
 in there. I'm totally fine with that. But this type of stuff gives a bad name to all of it.

235
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,360
 Even the grifters, this type of stuff gives a bad name to even people who are just trying to rip

236
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,120
 people off of money. Because I gotta say, I'd have more respect for someone who's trying to stick

237
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:42,840
 their hand in my wallet than try to do this. Listen to this. The woman asks Sharon, "Won't my

238
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,160
 family be devastated?" This may be the only thing that's keeping this woman from killing herself

239
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:57,400
 is the guilt. She needs help is what she needs, right? She needs help. And she's thinking,

240
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,760
 "This is when you know you're deep in that suicidal pathway, when you're thinking about

241
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,840
 the aftermath of it." She goes, "Won't my family be devastated?" She's thinking,

242
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,440
 "I want to kill myself, but I'm so afraid my family, they love me so much they'll be so hurt if I die."

243
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:22,040
 That's keeping her here, right? That's keeping her here. The love of her family is keeping her here.

244
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,120
 Listen to what Sharon Lee Giganti says to this suicidal woman who's asking, "Won't my family

245
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:38,280
 be devastated if I kill myself?" This is Sharon's answer. "Only they'll be devastated,

246
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,640
 quote, only if you envision them that way. You can create the scenario if you want,

247
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,800
 but you can also create a better scenario with the power of your thought and feeling vibrations.

248
00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:02,760
 God is nothing more or less than the law of attraction, and you are free to attract anything

249
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:14,600
 you want, even death." That woman left Sharon's house that night,

250
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,840
 she checked into a hotel room and drank poison, killing herself.

251
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:29,320
 Sharon now runs a website where she sells CDs against the New Age and talks about

252
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,240
 how it's a horrible thing and the same worshiping thing, all this stuff we were talking about in

253
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,960
 the beginning, and then she has workshops and stuff like that. It seems like a lot of the

254
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,680
 CDs, it seems like some of the CDs are out of order, out of stock, so I don't know if she's

255
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:51,160
 still producing stuff, but listen, there's two ways to look at this story. One, she's making it up.

256
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:57,480
 I actually tried looking for a guy, I mean, of course there have been men who have killed

257
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,280
 four month old sons, it's a horrible, horrible thing. I tried looking for people with her last

258
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,200
 name, I couldn't figure out maybe if she was married, I actually looked in to see if I could find

259
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,680
 man in Santa Monica who killed, there's no time given, man in Santa Monica murders a four month

260
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:18,760
 old, his son, I couldn't find anything, it doesn't mean it didn't happen, but there's a possibility

261
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:24,120
 that she made these up and she made these up to show how evil the law of attraction is, which if

262
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,440
 that's the case, I think Esther Hicks has a pretty good lawsuit against her, if she made it up because

263
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,640
 she's definitely trashing these people. And I may call people grifters and stuff like that,

264
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,960
 I may call people grifters and say, oh, you know, they trademarking this, they're trademarking that,

265
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:47,080
 I will take a grifter every single day of the week over someone who's, this is malpractice,

266
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:54,440
 this is manslaughter, but it could be made up, it could totally be made up, right? And she just,

267
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,400
 to make new age stuff look so bad and the reporters who are covering this aren't actually going to go,

268
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,320
 are, are, is that true? Are you telling the truth because they want to report the story that it's

269
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,800
 bad? They're in this website. What was it again, the Catholic, Catholic exchange website? And I'm,

270
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:14,840
 I'm not blaming Cheryl Dickow either for writing the article, but if this story is true, that's

271
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:23,000
 manslaughter. Listen, I was, I was just thinking today, I was just thinking today about my friend

272
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,040
 who killed himself a couple years ago. His name, I was just taking a shower and I was thinking about

273
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,520
 my friend Nate Chavez, very gifted artist who took his own life, he's married, he had two kids,

274
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,360
 sisters, family and friends that loved him and took his life.

275
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,200
 And I think about him.

276
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,040
 It's been like what, four years?

277
00:25:52,040 --> 00:26:03,960
 It pisses me off.

278
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:11,960
 Not that he did that. I'm not mad at him. It pisses, when I'm saying that I'm talking about her.

279
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:25,640
 Talking about Sharon, you can't be irresponsible. That's irresponsible to tell someone who is having

280
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,800
 those thoughts. You know, one thing that'll stop me almost dead in my tracks when I'm on the export,

281
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,360
 even when I'm on Reddit, when people start talking about suicide and cell farm on Reddit,

282
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,160
 I report it every single time, every single time. And it's not a report to ban the account.

283
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,360
 They have a care team that reaches out to them. On the export, they do the same thing.

284
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,360
 You got to stop and you got to engage with these people. It could be bait. People could just want

285
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:57,560
 some use. Take the time out of your day to tell them that you care, even if you don't even know

286
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:07,800
 who they are. That's the least we can do. Because you imagine doing the opposite. We've talked about

287
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,360
 stuff like the Blue Whale game and these internet things that cause people to kill themselves.

288
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,720
 But this is you're looking the person in the face. This is your friend who's coming to you the

289
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,040
 night before they're going to kill themselves. And you are so wrapped up in your new age nonsense.

290
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:31,560
 You think you have all the answers and you don't. You have zero answers. You have less than the

291
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:37,720
 answers. You have confusion. I don't think Esther, I don't see that's the thing. I don't, I'm not

292
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,440
 coming after Esther Hicks. I don't think, I think Esther Hicks would have said, let's go talk to somebody

293
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,880
 who can help you with this. I don't want this to sound like, and you guys know me. I have no problem

294
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,480
 going hard against people. But I don't think I, I'm not blaming the whole belief. I'm not blaming

295
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,240
 every other Abraham ambassador. Sharon's actually done the opposite for me. She doesn't make me

296
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,280
 hate the new age movement. She makes me very afraid that there are people like her out there.

297
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:13,240
 The only thing I can hope, the only thing I can hope, is that she's learned from this.

298
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,440
 I don't think it's the new age movement that caused the death of her nephew and her brother to be

299
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,560
 imprisoned for life and her friend to have killed herself. I don't blame the new age movement at

300
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:36,120
 all. I blame you. And I don't want to blame you. I don't even know you. I don't want to hate you.

301
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,120
 The only thing I can hope is that this story is made up. That she was an Abraham ambassador for a

302
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,520
 couple months and she didn't pay her dues or whatever. She just got bored of it and decided to hop on

303
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,960
 the next trend. And then she made this story up to say, these are the evils of the new age movement

304
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,320
 because this is her new grift. That's what I hope. Right? That's what we all hope.

305
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,120
 But if this story is true, it doesn't highlight the dangers of the new age movement.

306
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:16,440
 It just highlights the dangers of being around people who are so blind, they can't see through

307
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:25,880
 their own bullshit. We'll save the other story for tomorrow. We've run out of time.
