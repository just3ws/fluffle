1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 Mysterious letters terrorize a small town.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:10,080
 And are we the first advanced intelligent species to evolve on this planet today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:20,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,520
 Hope you're having a great day. I'm having a great day. Let me tell you a story.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,880
 My apartment might be haunted. There's always that saying that when you start looking into the

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,000
 paranormal, the paranormal starts looking into you. I have some stories about that in my past,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,280
 but for right now, what's happened the past couple weeks? I would come home, you know,

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,520
 I'd go out, hang out, go work, whatever I was doing. I'd come home and for just a brief moment,

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,640
 I'd get a, I'd smell like a scent, like a perfume in my apartment. And the first couple of times,

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,960
 I just kind of brushed it off. I was like, well, okay, that's weird. But it kept happening. And,

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
 you know, the thing is, is a lot of times they talk about ghosts, how you may not see them,

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,400
 and you may not feel them, but, or hear them either. But sometimes you'll smell them and people

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,480
 will say things like, you know, my grandpa always smoked a particular brand of cigars. And then

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,280
 sometimes when I go over to his house, I can smell the cigar in the chair that he always sat in,

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
 and all of that. Well, so I was coming home and like I said, the first couple of times I dismissed

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
 it. But it kept happening. It kept happening when I come home and I would smell perfume in my house.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,040
 Now I don't wear perfume. I haven't had anyone over who wears perfume lately. I couldn't figure it out.

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,080
 And I wasn't paying it too much mind. I was kind of like, okay, that's weird. But again, I'm,

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,920
 the, I wasn't like, oh my God, my house is haunted. I need to have a seance. But what happened was,

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,720
 just probably about 20 minutes prior to sitting, well, 10 minutes really, before sitting down to

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,040
 record this episode, I was doing something in my apartment, picking up, cleaning up. And I smelled

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,080
 that smell really strong. It was like right in front of me. And I got a little nervous. I'm like,

23
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,720
 there's that smell again. Like this time it's not happening when I come home. It's happening like

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,240
 right now. It's like right in front of me. And I'm like, maybe I do have a ghost. And then I realized

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,320
 what I was doing is I was taking my recyclable cans and I was putting into a garbage bag

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,760
 a lavender scented glad bag. So what was happening was when I was coming home from work or wherever,

27
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,480
 the first thing I was smelling when I walked in was the lavender scented glad bag. Here,

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,560
 this is the thing about looking into ghosts. Do anything paranormal is 99.9% of the time. It is

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,440
 the most mundane explanation possible. The reason why I was smelling it stronger was because I

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
 was picking cans up and dropping them into the bag. And so it was knocking the fresh particles

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,800
 into my nose. That was it. And when I was coming home, I was just smelling the glad bag and then

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,200
 my nose would get used to the smell and I wouldn't smell it any other time. That's it. 99% of the time,

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,720
 99.9% of the time technically, but it's mundane. It's nothing. It's a garbage bag.

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,360
 It's important to know when you're doing this stuff because it's really easy

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,520
 to believe every conspiracy theory. It's really easy to believe every

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,280
 bump in the night is a ghost. Oh, and I never had sex with a succubus after my succubus episode and

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
 talking about that and doing those rituals. So podcasts do not work. Apparently you do have

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,480
 to write a letter, but that's okay. I'm good. I don't need to bang a succubus. We're going to go

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,920
 ahead and get started with tonight's episode. So came across an interesting story and it actually

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,240
 plays into something that I've talked about before on this show. I do not believe that we're the first

41
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,560
 intelligent species on this planet. Now, I'm not saying that I believe in Lemuria or Atlantis. I'm

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
 not saying I don't really believe in that stuff either, but I don't believe in like super advanced

43
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,720
 civilizations with like UFOs and laser guns and ancient nuclear wars and all that stuff.

44
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,600
 But the scale of the planet and the timeline of the planet is so vast. It is so vast. I don't believe

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,400
 that we're the first intelligent species on this planet. I think that when we're talking about scales

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,360
 of four billion years, other species had evolved to a level where they could start working with tools,

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,960
 maybe building little towns, maybe even getting to an industrialized size as us, and then getting

48
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,000
 wiped out. And here's the thing. You go, well, Jason, when do we find buildings? If right now we

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,560
 disappeared and we jump ahead a million years, five million years, there will not be one trace of us

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,640
 on this planet at all. There will be no buildings. There would be no nothing. You may find a leg bone

51
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,800
 deep in a tar pit somewhere. The thing with fossils, they're extremely rare. They're extremely rare.

52
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,040
 You need to have it in the exact right conditions and the exact right time period for you to be able

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,840
 to find a fossil. And that's why they'll they'll they have to make assumptions. If you find a leg

54
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,200
 bone in a field, because that's so rare, you go, well, there's probably like 5000 people here to

55
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,960
 find this one bone. It's not like one guy was walking across a field, died and became a fossil.

56
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,320
 They can say they can extrapolate. They have to go with if there's one fossil here, there must have

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,920
 been 10,000 people here. So I'm not saying that they were all humanoid, and I'm not saying they all

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,120
 advanced to our level. There could have been a species of reptilians or a species of muskrat or

59
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,680
 species of bird or whatever that got to the point where they're building tools, maybe building little

60
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,640
 houses, maybe like having little crow courts, and they're like, no, you are going to hang for taking

61
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,400
 all that bird seed and all that stuff. And then they just get wiped out. And new species have to

62
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,480
 evolve to fill in that void, whether it is some sort of natural catastrophe, whether it's some

63
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,800
 sort of meteorite strike, maybe it's some sort of war or disease, I don't know, could be all of them.

64
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,600
 But I don't think we're the only intelligent species that have existed on this planet. So I

65
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,400
 kind of found an article, a reputable article that kind of backs my argument up. However, to be fair,

66
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,120
 the article says, I don't believe anyone was here before we were. The article is very clear on that.

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,080
 The article is a thought experiment. It's a fascinating one. And the article does state that

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,000
 if a civilization existed in the past 100,000 years, we would see proof of it. But if we go back

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,680
 hundreds of thousands or millions of years, there wouldn't be any proof of it, which was always my

70
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,560
 assertion. What's interesting is, so their article, they're talking about climate change and aliens,

71
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,200
 which is funny because that's something we covered early on in the show. And I think we kind of have

72
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,080
 a tendency to take human follies and put them on other races and other species. But what's

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,000
 interesting is they are stating that if there was an industrialized society to the human level

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,200
 a million years ago, there would be no structures, no books, no bones, nothing, proving that they

75
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,200
 were here except for one thing. We would be able to tell if there was a industrialized society on

76
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,520
 our level a million years ago. And it's interesting, it would be in the soil, not the bones, but we

77
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,200
 could tell that the soil was treated for massive farming. There would be like nitrates in the soil

78
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,920
 that don't occur naturally. That's the article stance is basically if they had massive farming,

79
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,560
 because we right now we're in the Anthropocene, which is the age of man. And we're so, we're so

80
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,760
 rapidly changing the landscape. We're having such a massive effect on our landscape. Like, you know,

81
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,160
 you have the Jurassic era and the Triassic era, this is the Anthropocene era, this because we

82
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
 were actually being able to modify the earth to fit our needs. And they're saying there was a species

83
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,040
 at our level, they would have also have done that. And I think that's a really interesting point. And

84
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,560
 I totally get where they're coming from. And I'm not going to argue with that. Well, actually,

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,120
 I'm going to kind of argue with that. Because one, it assumes that what we see in the soil, what we

86
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,400
 consider natural, isn't what they did in the past. Two, it would also assume that they would

87
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:17,120
 farm in the same way or even farm the same things. If a carnivorous species evolved to our level,

88
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,000
 would they have needs for crops at all? I guess to feed animals to eat them. But I also will argue

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,520
 down maybe they wouldn't be at our level, like industrialized wise, but they could have been

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,360
 at a Bronze Age level, or an Iron Age level and got wiped out. And again, we're talking about such

91
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,280
 long time spans, billions of years that you could have had, you could have a species evolve and

92
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,800
 disappear every million years, and you would never know it, ever know it. I find that fascinating.

93
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,640
 People talk about the seas are completely unexplored. We know more about space than seas.

94
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,120
 We know more about the oceans than we know about the history of life before us. We can find bones

95
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
 and we can say, well, the environment was probably like this based on this type of animal.

96
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,240
 But our records only go back so far. We don't even know about what's under the water. We don't

97
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
 even know what's going on on the land. And here's an interesting article that plays into this whole

98
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
 thing. So back in May, there was this article, National Geographic. The first article was from

99
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,360
 the Atlantic. So these aren't fringe websites, which I always find, I always enjoy that because I

100
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,440
 like to talk about this stuff and have mainstream, here I'm talking about mainstream media again,

101
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,040
 but I like to have reputable sources. I can go to Creepy Weird Daily and find this article,

102
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,040
 but you get a different level of satisfaction, I'd say, by finding this in thought-provoking

103
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,040
 mainstream magazines. So National Geographic recently had this article. So in the Philippines,

104
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,640
 they found a leg bone recently that was 67,000 years old. And they're like, okay, again, with

105
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,800
 the fossils, they can go, well, this, it wasn't just one guy in the Philippines, it wasn't cast away

106
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,480
 or anything. There's obviously a bunch of people here to get this one leg bone. You would need to have

107
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,040
 a big population, a thousand people or whatever, over a period of time. So they're like, okay,

108
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,000
 so we can say that in about 67,000 years ago, either people came from the mainland to the

109
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
 Philippines and settled here, or there was some sort of hominid offshoot. And even they were like,

110
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,040
 man, we didn't think there was anyone here 67,000 years ago. That's quite a ways back. You know,

111
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,400
 these little set of islands and all this choppy water, it's crazy people got here. Well, recently,

112
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,720
 they found a, the bones of an extinct rhinoceros. And they're like, and they dated these bones at

113
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:50,560
 between 650,000 and 650,000, yeah, and 700,000 years old. So completely predates the leg bone.

114
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,360
 They find this extinct rhinoceros in the Philippines. And they're like, oh, these bones

115
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,160
 are like 700,000 years old. This is like super cool that we found these little bones. They started

116
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,880
 looking at them and they, the ribs were broken. And they're like, well, that's kind of interesting.

117
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,840
 Kind of looks like they're broken on purpose wasn't it? Someone trying to get the marrow out. And

118
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,120
 no, people weren't around back then, but maybe it was an animal. Then they were looking more at the

119
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,800
 bones. And they saw where somebody or something, somebody took a stone and was sawing at the rib

120
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,560
 cage to get the meat off. And the rib cage and the leg bone, someone was sawing at it to get the

121
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,080
 meat off. So at this point, the scientists are saying that is completely unexpected. That means

122
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,920
 that 600,000 years before this leg bone existed, there was someone here with the tool cutting

123
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,040
 meat off a rhinoceros that's extinct. And the article just kind of ends with, I don't know,

124
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,800
 you can almost see the scientists shrugging at the end of the article. There should just be

125
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,120
 like an artist rendition of three scientists shrugging their shoulders because they don't know.

126
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,320
 We, we don't know about our own history. There was all sorts of offshoots, you know, they found

127
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,040
 those like hobbits in the Philippines as well. I don't know if they got permission from Tolkien to

128
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,800
 use the word hobbits, but you know, we have like Neanderthals and all this stuff. It's just amazing

129
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,120
 to think that we don't know our own history. We don't have the answers to those mysteries.

130
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,520
 So the idea that something existed before us and before them and before them and before them,

131
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:32,080
 why not? It's definitely possible. The only reason why scientists don't believe that is because they

132
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,840
 don't have proof and fair enough because then they would just be going, oh yeah, lizard people

133
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:41,280
 rule the world and then along came the giant kangaroo people. And I get it, that's all speculative.

134
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,680
 So they're not going to say that, but we don't know. We don't know. We are our knowledge of this

135
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,680
 planet and the knowledge of our race and the history of living things on this planet is so small.

136
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:01,440
 It's fantastic. And I love that. I love mysteries. That's knowing everything I think would be boring.

137
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,400
 I want to learn the stuff. I want to watch these mysteries progress. If I had a book and I could

138
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,200
 just flip open and find the answer to every single question ever, that'd be so boring. Give me the

139
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:18,480
 mystery. Give me the puzzle. Give me the clues and I'll learn it with you. Fascinating stuff.

140
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,200
 Fascinating stuff. I'm sure we're going to talk about this more because I find these ideas very,

141
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,720
 very fascinating. I will say a quick note too. I talk about reptilians. I don't believe in

142
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,840
 reptilian aliens and stuff like that. I do think it's interesting though that almost every major

143
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:44,320
 religion, every really religion in general across the globe, they have snakes in their mythology.

144
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,520
 They're either good or bad. And I did read and I tried to figure that out and I read something

145
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,320
 saying that in ancient times the way the snake eyes look looked like they knew everything.

146
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,920
 They were considered wise. So that may be why, but I also think it's interesting that that always

147
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
 plays in. But we have another episode to talk about that. Spoiler alert. I do not believe in

148
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,800
 shapeshifting reptilian aliens. I've talked about that a hundred times, but we'll get into the

149
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,760
 reptile stuff later. I do want to go on to this next story here. Speaking about mysteries, not

150
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,520
 reptiles. Speaking about not knowing the answers to mysteries. This one's fascinating. This is a story,

151
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:28,560
 this is a true story, called the Circleville Writer. This happened back in the 70s. So what

152
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480
 happened was back in the 70s there was a bus driver named Mary and she had a husband named Ron,

153
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,920
 you know, just typical old family in Ohio. And one day she gets a letter and it says,

154
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,680
 "I know you're sleeping with the school superintendent." She's a bus driver for the school,

155
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,840
 not for like the city. She's, you know, more like an auto bus driver and less of a Sandra

156
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,880
 Bullock bus driver. But anyway, she gets a letter saying, "I know you're sleeping with the school

157
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,560
 superintendent." And she's like, freaks out because she wasn't. And she hides the letter.

158
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,640
 She gets another letter later on and they're like, "I know you're sleeping with the school

159
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,360
 superintendent." And she's like, "I'm not." She doesn't know what to do. Her husband gets a letter

160
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,680
 too now. So what happens is so now she's getting letters, her husband's getting letters, they're

161
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,080
 vaguely threatening. They start to reveal the letters to their friends. They're like, "Hey,

162
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,200
 do you know who's writing this?" And their friends are like, "No, I don't know who's writing that."

163
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,920
 The letter writer starts to say, "I'm going to put billboards up around town. I'm going to like

164
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,200
 hijack television stations and I'm going to broadcast it. You're sleeping with the school

165
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,680
 superintendent." They start to get a list of suspects of who they think it can be.

166
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:38,080
 One night they get a phone call and Ron, the husband, picks up the phone and the writer is on

167
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,800
 the phone and says, "Hey, you know, you need to have your wife stop sleeping with the school

168
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:51,680
 superintendent." Ron recognizes the voice, grabs his gun, hops in his car. A few minutes later,

169
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:00,400
 he's dead. He's dead. Okay, so I'm reading this and I'm like, "This is crazy." So Ron's dead now.

170
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,800
 The cops are like, "We can tell he fired a bullet out of his gun."

171
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,640
 And he crashed because he was really drunk. So it was an accident. Originally they listed it as

172
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,800
 foul play. The sheriff was like, "It's foul play." But then they listed it as an accident or a

173
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,040
 syring in a driving. So now the woman's by herself, Mary, she's continuing to get these letters saying

174
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,160
 that she needs to stop sleeping with the superintendent. Eventually someone starts putting

175
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,760
 up signs along her bus route in public saying, "I know you're sleeping with the school superintendent."

176
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,520
 They're taunting her at this point. She's driving down the road. She gets out of her car. She gets

177
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:47,440
 out of the bus one day. She goes to pull the sign down. It's booby-trapped. There's a gun built into

178
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:56,240
 the sign. If she had pulled it down the wrong way, it would have shot and killed her. So now the police

179
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,560
 are heavily involved in this. They're trying to figure out who it is. They zero in on a suspect.

180
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,320
 They arrest him. It was his gun. Like you could see the serial number. It's kind of removed from

181
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,560
 the gun, but not completely. He says the gun was stolen. Cops don't believe him. They feel like he

182
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,440
 has a motive. He goes to trial. He's convicted. He goes to solitary confinement. He starts getting

183
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,000
 letters from the Circleville writer. He's getting letters. Other people are getting letters. He's

184
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,200
 in solitary confinement. He can't be writing these letters. The letters are going to him.

185
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,840
 Letters are coming out. Finally, after I think it's like five or six years, seven years or whatever,

186
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,800
 he gets paroled. So he gets out. The letters never stopped though. He kept saying that I didn't

187
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,480
 write him. I didn't write him. There's other suspects of who it could be. At one point they're

188
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,440
 thinking it may be three different people who are writing these letters. Mary is having an affair

189
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,200
 with the school superintendent, but they don't start having an affair until after she gets the

190
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,400
 letters. So they never had a relationship at all, but the the distress of the letters brought them

191
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,400
 together. She's single now too because her husband's dead. Unsolved Mysteries covers this case.

192
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,120
 Unsolved Mysteries, if this is right up their alley, Unsolved Mysteries was that great old

193
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,320
 television show where they basically profile unsolved mysteries. They begin investigating the case.

194
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,120
 They get a letter from the Circleville writer. The letter says, "Forget Circleville, Ohio.

195
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,680
 Do nothing to hurt Sheriff Radcliffe. If you come to Ohio, you El Sickos will pay the Circleville

196
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:44,880
 writer." Never caught. Never caught who was doing it. Is it creepy? Creepy. They don't know if he

197
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:52,560
 killed the Ron, the husband. They tried to kill her. The letters came. We're talking about,

198
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,800
 by the way, the Unsolved Mysteries episode was like in the 90s. So we're talking about

199
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 something that's going on for 20-plus years. These letters have been circulating in this town.

200
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:10,560
 Nobody knows who it was. No one knows who set the booby trap. You know, you could say it was that guy,

201
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,360
 but yeah, the only thing, it was his gun and they did like a handwriting analysis and the Sheriff

202
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,440
 goes, "That's his handwriting." But the problem was is that people thought the Sheriff was in on it.

203
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,240
 Crazy. This is one, I mean, this truly is the definition of an Unsolved Mystery.

204
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,680
 Everyone in this story is just going to disappear. They're either going to pass away or they're

205
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,680
 going to move on with their lives. And no one's ever going to know who wrote these letters.

206
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:44,800
 That's creepy to me. Someday someone might find something in their aunt's attic pointing to this.

207
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,400
 And you know, maybe Ron really did get drunk driving. I mean, they did say that he fired his

208
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,360
 bullet at something, but man, that's creepy. And think about the amount of powerlessness you would

209
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,280
 feel from that, because you're getting these letters and you can't stop it and the cops

210
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,120
 aren't going to take it seriously at first until there's a booby trap on your bus route.

211
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,720
 That's creepy. You know, I like to cover true crime on this show. I don't do a lot of it,

212
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:24,000
 because a lot of it is either really, really dark and not in an interesting way. Like I think

213
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,560
 true crime, I think there's a lot of crossover between true crime, conspiracy, and the paranormal.

214
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,760
 I think there is a bit of crossover there. I don't do a lot of stuff where it's just people

215
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,480
 getting killed. I don't necessarily find that interesting. But I do love reading about true

216
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,760
 crime. I read about it more than I talk about it on the show. My true crime library is actually

217
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,840
 bigger than my paranormal and conspiracy. My conspiracy library is very small. I just have

218
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,200
 a few books now. I used to have a ton of them, but as you get out of a certain conspiracy,

219
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,160
 you just kind of throw those books away, give them to Goodwill, whatever. My true crime library is

220
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,640
 pretty big. But yeah, so I'm always looking for stuff like this. And every show often will come

221
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,960
 across a story that I think really fits the show. And this one fits the cake. Who wrote those letters?

222
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,560
 And more importantly, why? You know, that's really the main thing. Why do they have such a

223
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,040
 beef with this woman having an affair when she didn't have an affair and then she ended up having

224
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,560
 an affair? Mysteries upon mysteries upon mysteries. That's what the world's made of. And that's what

225
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:30,480
 makes, I think, life so interesting is not knowing everything. I think we want to know the answers

226
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,480
 eventually. But the puzzle, putting the puzzle together, I think is more satisfying than sitting

227
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,400
 back and looking at the finished image. Because what do you generally do with the puzzle when

228
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,720
 you put it back together? You look at it for a couple minutes, put it back in the box. That's

229
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,440
 what I do at least. And then when I'm bored, break the puzzle out, start all over again.

230
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:01,200

231
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
 You know, I wonder, I have a question. I wonder how many people shut the podcast off right when

232
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,280
 I start talking about the email address. Because that could be like a, ah, he's finished. Sometimes

233
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,840
 there's extra stuff in here. You don't know. Maybe there's something extra in here today. I don't know

234
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,240
 either. You can hit me up at Twitter @jasonocarpenter. You can hit me up there as well. I don't think

235
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
 there's going to be anything extra here today. Is there anything extra to talk about that I haven't

236
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:33,680
 talked about yet? Nah, I got nothing. DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true

237
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,720
 crime podcast. You don't have to listen to it every day. I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
