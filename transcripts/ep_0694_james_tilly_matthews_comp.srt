1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 A young man is visited by aliens and promised an amazing future.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,000
 But what happens if it doesn't come true?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we meet a man who believes that the government is out to get him.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,320
 That he's being gang-stalked.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,400
 That people in the highest levels of government are using secret technology to try to kill him.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,280
 What makes him different than any of the other lunatics we've covered with this delusion?

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,360
 He was the very first one to have them.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,840
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:42,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,160
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
 We got a lot of cool stuff to cover today.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,560
 So first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,880
 Rolling into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,480
 A little blanket rolling around.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,240
 It's Colin A. Raymond.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,800
 Everyone give a round of applause to Colin A. Raymond.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,240
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,840
 You can go ahead and stand up now.

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,720
 You can stand up.

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,960
 Colin, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
 Just helps spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,160
 Colin, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
 We're going to take a nice aerial journey from DRC.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,080
 You didn't know?

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
 You didn't know there was an acronym for it?

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
 We are headed out to Cook Inlet, Alaska.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
 Colin is flying us through the friendly skies towards the north.

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,040
 Unless you live in Alaska, then it's already around the corner and you're going to meet us there.

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,520
 In September of 1976 in Cook Inlet, Alaska, there was a young boy sitting at home.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,240
 He's whistling to himself.

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,760
 Wait, never mind.

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,440
 I looked a sentence down on my notes.

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,200
 In Cook Inlet, in September 1976 in Cook Inlet, Alaska, there's a young boy

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,080
 who's totally different than him sitting in his room whistling.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,840
 He was walking out of a semi-solid bog.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,040
 I don't know what that is.

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,800
 It does not explain why he's there.

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,000
 It would have made far more sense if he was whistling in his bedroom.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
 I don't know what a semi-solid bog is.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,880
 I'm assuming it's just a swamp that you don't immediately sink in.

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,120
 Anyways, that exists in Alaska.

46
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,640
 If you guys don't buy the fact that that's a real thing, the rest of the story is even more

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,520
 fantabulous.

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,720
 Walking out of a semi-solid bog is David E. K. Wood.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,920
 He's a 13 year old boy.

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,200
 He's walking out of this thing that may or may not exist in Alaska.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,920
 Anyways, or what he was doing there, I don't know.

52
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
 He was burying a couple bodies.

53
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,960
 He's like, not only will no one find you for 500 years, but when they do, you'll be perfectly preserved.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,760
 I love my evidence to be long lasting and never decaying.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,000
 David E. K. Wood is walking out of the semi-solid bog and he sees two UFOs hovering over the area.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,240
 He thought the whole story was just going to be about how weird bogs are.

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,480
 No.

58
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,160
 He sees two UFOs hovering over the area and he's like, golly, look at them UFOs.

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,480
 I wonder if they saw me murder those people.

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,880
 And then a blue beam of light flashes down from one of the UFOs.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,960
 And then a man walks out of the beam.

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,200
 And David is looking at this man and the man's walking out of the beam.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
 It's David as an adult.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,040
 David sees himself as an adult walking out of the beam.

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,400
 A much older, much more muscular David.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,120
 This dude's been hitting the gym, been in the space gym.

67
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
 He knows anti-gravity weights are all the rage in space.

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,600
 Even though they're anti-gravity, they're super easy to lift up.

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
 Aliens are like, look at how strong I am.

70
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,920
 Adult David walks up to little David and he's like, he looks over the bog

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
 and he's like, they'll never find those bodies.

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
 I'm from the future to let you know.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,360
 Your crimes will be undiscovered.

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,640
 And then actually what he actually said was, don't be afraid little David.

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,960
 And he began to talk to little David.

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,160
 He started to tell him a little bit about the future because this is, it's not a clone.

77
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,520
 This is David E. K. Wood from the future.

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,080
 He tells little David that soon he will quote,

79
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,320
 be involved in the greatest adventure of his life.

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
 He says, someday you're going to help many, many people.

81
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,800
 One day when the time is right, you will wake up little David.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
 You will see the world clearly for the first time.

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,120
 I just want you to know that you are loved.

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,080
 You are loved by many, many people.

85
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,760
 And with that big David turns around, walks back out of the beam of light.

86
00:04:45,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
 Because he sees it as totally consensual that he's getting kidnapped by these aliens.

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
 So he writes his book called Alien Alley about his experiences.

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
 And like I said, it's the normal stuff.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,120
 He's meeting Gray's.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
 He has a hybrid child named Shannon.

92
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,240
 This little girl Shannon somewhere up in the space.

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
 That's a dead, that's a dead meat dad for you, right?

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
 You have a baby and you're like, I'll take custody of it every, every ninth lifetime.

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
 You just fly around in space for a while.

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
 This is an interesting story.

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
 It's super run of the mill, right?

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,960
 Nothing.

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
 I mean, I guess he did meet a future version of himself that we don't normally see that

100
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,360
 in abductee or experiencer stories.

101
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,200
 When overall it's just kind of he's visiting gray aliens, have the hybrid child stuff.

102
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,840
 That's pretty basic.

103
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
 The reason why I wanted to cover this was for a couple of reasons.

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
 One, there's this weird thing.

105
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
 We see people who have abduction experiences do this.

106
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
 A lot of times they'll draw pictures of themselves in the UFO.

107
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,720
 If David E. K. was listening to this, he knows exactly what I'm getting to.

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,360
 He's like, really?

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,040
 That's what you're going to focus in on?

110
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,920
 He draws pictures of himself aboard these UFOs.

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,040
 There's a lot of these pictures and they're like drawn with crowns.

112
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,960
 Apparently I can't say that word correctly because the other day I told someone there was

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
 a box of crowns in the corner and they're like, what are you talking about?

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,240
 Crowns.

115
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
 They're color, they're like a little kid coloring.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,400
 Now I'm a terrible artist.

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,640
 So I'm not going to, I'm not going to art shame anyone.

118
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
 I can't draw nothing.

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,120
 But even though I can't draw anything, I will not use crowns to draw.

120
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
 Because it makes it look like a kid's drawing.

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
 So if I'm going to be like officer, you won't believe what happened.

122
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
 And I got abducted by aliens and here's a drawing.

123
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,040
 It's like a picture.

124
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,480
 It's like a picture of a couple stick people, but it's done with like crowns.

125
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,120
 It automatically makes it look childlike.

126
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
 I'd get a pencil or something like that.

127
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
 So I will, I will art shame you for that.

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,680
 Secondly, the drawings are hilarious because it's always like a picture of a great

129
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,520
 alien. How you would imagine a great alien would be like skinny little arms, big head.

130
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,480
 He draws a picture of his daughter with a kind of a busted up looking head because she has

131
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,920
 had, she is half alien.

132
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,080
 She's not going to win any beauty passions, right?

133
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
 And then she's got like little alien arms.

134
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,400
 He draws himself.

135
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
 He draws himself super detailed.

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,200
 He draws himself super detailed, huge muscular body.

137
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,080
 There's one drawing where he's naked and it's just his bubble butt.

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,360
 Like there's a bunch of great aliens standing around naked.

139
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,080
 David E.K. would have like this perfectly sculpted giant bubble butt on him.

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,120
 Like everything like there's alien control panels in the background

141
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,920
 out of this world technology that scientists would love to see.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,000
 He's like just drawing little dots.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,640
 Dude, dude, dude.

144
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,960
 I don't know.

145
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
 I don't know what that looked like, but check out my abs.

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,200
 Check out my calves.

147
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,640
 It's hilarious.

148
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,120
 I love it.

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,600
 Thank you.

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,000
 Thank you.

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,800
 David E.K.

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,040
 What?

153
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
 That was so great.

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
 He draws himself in such great detail.

155
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
 The other reason why I wanted to cover this story,

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
 because I can't really just keep talking about drawings on podcasts.

157
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
 The other reason why I wanted to cover this story is you don't know who David E.K.

158
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,600
 would have.

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,680
 Some of you guys may know who he is.

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,880
 I had no idea who he was until I saw this story.

161
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,200
 And I found this story on ThinkAbout@Docs.com,

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,880
 which catalogs every UFO sighting.

163
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 I mean, it is a great resource.

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,440
 Think about it.

165
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,040
 Docs.com is one of the best ongoing resources we found on the show.

166
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,400
 If you're a fan of UFOs, check out that website.

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,760
 It's phenomenal.

168
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
 But that's where I found this on,

169
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,040
 and it was catalogued with every single thing else.

170
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,800
 I never heard of this guy.

171
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 And I'm not saying that I'm the end-all-be-all of all paranormal UFO knowledge,

172
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,360
 because I'm not.

173
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,520
 I'm learning stuff, the stuff I cover on the show,

174
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,760
 I'm really hearing most of it for the first time.

175
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,240
 But not everyone gets a message that they're going to be great.

176
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,400
 That they're going to change the world, that he's going to help all of these people.

177
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
 In the end of the day, I'm sure he's a lovely dude, right?

178
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,800
 I'm sure, according to his drawings, he's quite handsome.

179
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,080
 But I'm sure personality-wise, I'm sure he's a pretty nice guy,

180
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
 I'm sure he's pretty chill.

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,840
 But what if a future you showed up and told you

182
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,440
 you're going to go on this greatest adventure,

183
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
 and you, I don't want to feel like I'm knocking on the guy,

184
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
 because I'm not, but the future you comes back

185
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
 and tells you you're going to go on the greatest adventure,

186
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,240
 and you publish a book, which anyone can do that.

187
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,400
 Amazon self-publishing, I actually recommend

188
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
 if you're a writer, just publish your own book.

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
 It's very, very easy.

190
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
 You can do that.

191
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,400
 And that's cool.

192
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 I'm not knocking, being a published author,

193
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,040
 but is that really the greatest adventure of your life?

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
 I don't know, man.

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
 Like, and being told your,

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,800
 think about the disappointment you would have.

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,920
 If the future you told you you're going to do all this great stuff,

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,200
 and in the end, you publish a book, it sells a couple copies,

199
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
 gets covered on a podcast.

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,760
 And that's kind of it.

201
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,600
 Like, that's what I think is interesting.

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,520
 Maybe the greatest adventure is still ahead of him.

203
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
 He's, I think he's around my age, honestly.

204
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,760
 This story took place, well, he was 13,

205
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
 I can figure this out, he was 13 in 1976,

206
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
 so he's 13 years older than me.

207
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
 He would be 57.

208
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
 So he still has a long life ahead of him, but

209
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
 he's still waiting to wake up.

210
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
 He's still waiting for everything to make sense,

211
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,280
 or has that already happened?

212
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,200
 Like, if the future me came to me tomorrow,

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
 and said, "Dude, things are going to be so amazing for you,

214
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,480
 you're going to go on this greatest adventure,

215
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
 you're going to like help all these people,"

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,840
 and then 10 years from now,

217
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,920
 and do any of that stuff, I'm still just kind of sitting here,

218
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
 waiting for that to happen.

219
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
 Like, did he lie to him?

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
 Was he like hyping it up?

221
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,760
 Was he really not, was it not the greatest adventure?

222
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,520
 It was just an okay adventure?

223
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,280
 Like, how would that affect your psyche?

224
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,120
 It would be one thing.

225
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
 See, here's the thing, it would be one thing.

226
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,080
 If Shirley MacLean was a little girl,

227
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
 walking around a semi-solid bog,

228
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,080
 and an adult Shirley MacLean showed up and goes,

229
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,840
 "You're going to revolutionize reincarnation beliefs

230
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,360
 for Americans for the 80s,"

231
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
 because she's a huge figure in that.

232
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,480
 You're going to have this huge career,

233
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,160
 like someone that we can look back on and go,

234
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,640
 "Whoa, that was transformative for her."

235
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,080
 So that would make sense.

236
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
 We would see that transformative journey.

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
 With David E. K. Wood, I'm sure he's a great dude,

238
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,840
 but has that, will it happen?

239
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
 Has it already happened?

240
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,720
 And it wasn't as big as he thought.

241
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,320
 Like, how disappointing it would have been

242
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
 to have your future self come out of a UFO,

243
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
 tell you something great was going to happen,

244
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,280
 and in the end, it was just okay.

245
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,440
 Or does it mean that, again,

246
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,000
 like, maybe something great wasn't going to happen,

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,960
 but he took a misstep?

248
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,920
 I don't know.

249
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
 Because publishing a book, that's cool.

250
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
 I'm not trying, I don't want this to come across

251
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,400
 that I'm not going to do.

252
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,600
 Like, publishing a book is good,

253
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,160
 but that's not the greatest adventure of your life.

254
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
 So I don't know.

255
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,320
 It's weird.

256
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,080
 Like, Jason, I think you're focused.

257
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,880
 I think you're focused more on what the guy said

258
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,080
 versus the fact that you said he met his future self.

259
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,560
 He's friends with a bunch of aliens.

260
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
 He has a hybrid daughter.

261
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
 Like, all this other stuff.

262
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,320
 It's because I research that stuff all the time.

263
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,520
 I come across, that seems,

264
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,560
 that might be it actually,

265
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
 not a thing about it.

266
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
 Like, to me, that seems very banal,

267
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,960
 which should show that I'm getting a little jaded

268
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
 that someone's going to be like,

269
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,720
 "Dude, I have a hybrid child in Alpha Centauri,"

270
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,000
 and I'm like, whoop-de-doo, who cares about that?

271
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,320
 David E. K. Wood has a hybrid child.

272
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,120
 I'm all walking away.

273
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
 They're like, "Don't you want to hear more?"

274
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,040
 I'm like, "No!

275
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
 No, I won't hear anything.

276
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
 Maybe I'm just getting jaded."

277
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
 David E. K. Wood, I hope,

278
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,080
 I hope you never skip a leg day.

279
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,280
 I hope you're still working out.

280
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,320
 And if you haven't had the greatest adventure of your life yet,

281
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,400
 I hope it is coming soon.

282
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,360
 That sounds a little menacing.

283
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
 Colin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

284
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
 to the Carbindercopter.

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,880
 We are leaving behind Cook Inlet Alaska.

286
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,760
 We are headed out to London.

287
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
 (imitates car engine)

288
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
 And Colin, go ahead and hit that time travel button.

289
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,600
 We're headed back to the early 1790s.

290
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,520
 (imitates car engine)

291
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,840
 Colin is flying us through the time vortex.

292
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,280
 It's London.

293
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,640
 It's the early 1790s.

294
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,960
 We're wearing our top hats and our nice little outfits.

295
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,760
 We're walking around.

296
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
 We're dressed to the nines.

297
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,280
 In London, in the 1790s,

298
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,400
 there was a dude named James Tilly Matthews.

299
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
 He was a London tea broker.

300
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,280
 So he would buy tea and sell tea, apparently.

301
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,000
 (laughs)

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 All the stuff, all the research I do on UFOs,

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I wouldn't bother to look at what that is.

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
 I think it's like a stockbroker, but he just does tea.

305
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
 So he's like, sell that tea.

306
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,960
 I'm buying tea.

307
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,320
 And he has a bunch of tea.

308
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,680
 But he also wants to do something else.

309
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,200
 You can only have so much tea.

310
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,080
 He's trying to make sure that France and England

311
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,360
 don't go to war.

312
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,800
 Because there was a period of time,

313
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
 there's basically like a thousand years of world history

314
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,520
 where that was constantly happening.

315
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,560
 And it wasn't just him.

316
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,240
 There was a bunch of other people who didn't want to do it.

317
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
 But he didn't want them to go to war.

318
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,160
 So he goes to France.

319
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
 This guy, I'm making it sound like this guy

320
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
 just walking down the street, yelling at people,

321
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,960
 sell tea, buy tea.

322
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,240
 He had money.

323
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
 Like he was influential.

324
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,160
 He's able to go to France and talk to people over there.

325
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
 He goes to France and he's trying to talk

326
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,280
 to the leaders over there.

327
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
 I mean, like, let's not have any more wars with England.

328
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
 We're doing this all the time.

329
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,960
 And while he's over there, he's making moves.

330
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,400
 He's having these meetings.

331
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,000
 It's a bad time to be in France

332
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,720
 because people's heads are starting to get chopped off.

333
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,560
 They're pulling leaders out of their residences,

334
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,600
 chopping their heads off.

335
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,440
 And James is visiting these people.

336
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
 James is going, "Oh, I'm going to go talk

337
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,000
 to this dude over here."

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,920
 And he sees a bunch of guys rushed in,

339
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,280
 pull that dude out and chop his head off.

340
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,760
 He's like, "Oh, I think that meeting's been postponed.

341
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,040
 I'll go talk to someone else."

342
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,280
 But he's a guy from England.

343
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,000
 In France, meeting with all these famous people,

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
 he's considered a double agent.

345
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,080
 So they arrest him and they're going to chop his head off.

346
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,520
 And he's absolutely terrified of getting his head chopped off.

347
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
 He's going crazy in his cell.

348
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,200
 Even back then, it's 1796 and the French government's

349
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,760
 looking at this guy and he's obviously insane.

350
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,800
 So they go, "We're not going to chop his head off."

351
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,240
 Like, he's probably too insane to be a double agent.

352
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,720
 He's probably too insane to have been sent here by England

353
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,080
 to rile us up.

354
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,920
 They ship him back to London.

355
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,600
 Now, a normal person would have just disappeared

356
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
 in the history books at this point.

357
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
 They escaped getting their head chopped off in France.

358
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,600
 I'm going to keep a low profile and just kind of go on with my life.

359
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,400
 But James Telling Matthews, after he's returned to London,

360
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,640
 begins to publicly accuse British government officials

361
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,680
 of trying to kill him.

362
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,760
 He is saying that there's this conspiracy against him.

363
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
 They're all after him.

364
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,560
 He would go and interrupt political events.

365
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
 There was a debate at the House of Commons.

366
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,520
 He busts through the doors and starts accusing everyone

367
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,960
 of trying to murder him.

368
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,800
 Nobody knows who this dude is.

369
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,680
 And he begins saying, "You guys are trying to kill me."

370
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,480
 He gets arrested.

371
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,400
 Throwing into British jail.

372
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,760
 But he's nuts.

373
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,840
 They're talking to him and they go, "Listen, this guy is absolutely loony.

374
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,000
 How humane is it to have him in this jail cell?"

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
 They look at his arrest record and they go,

376
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,760
 "He just got shipped out of France for being insane.

377
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,960
 Now he's here."

378
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,440
 But they just can't keep playing volleyball with this dude

379
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
 and sending him back to France.

380
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,560
 On January 28th, 1797, James Telling Matthews

381
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
 is sent to Bedlam Hospital,

382
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,720
 a notorious mental institution in London.

383
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,360
 It's funny.

384
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
 This is where he should be.

385
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,000
 Is it?

386
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,920
 He needed to be in a mental hospital,

387
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,640
 but this hospital has a horrible reputation for being quite brutal.

388
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,600
 But at the time, you're thinking,

389
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,200
 he doesn't belong in jail with the criminals.

390
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,160
 He doesn't deserve getting his head chopped off, either.

391
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
 So let's put him in this mental hospital.

392
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
 It's not our problem, but it's such a bad place to be as well.

393
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
 But out of all those places,

394
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
 it's where he needed to be,

395
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,200
 where there are doctors who could treat him.

396
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,680
 But the problem is, nobody knows what's wrong.

397
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,840
 He's in there from 1797 till 1810,

398
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,960
 and nobody can tell what's wrong with this guy.

399
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,120
 They can tell that something's not right,

400
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,360
 but they can't figure out exactly what it is.

401
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,640
 And you have a medical writer who worked at Bedlam Hospital.

402
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
 He's writing a book about James.

403
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,920
 The author's name is John Hoslem.

404
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,520
 He's writing this book.

405
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,480
 He's interviewing James.

406
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,960
 He's taking in everything this guy is spinning out.

407
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,520
 He writes a book called Illustrations of Madness.

408
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,600
 And the point of the book is to say,

409
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,320
 is James Tilling Matthews actually insane?

410
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,680
 Because you have different levels of insanity.

411
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,400
 We keep using that word.

412
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,520
 It's kind of a catchall thing.

413
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,480
 You have people with dementia, with delirium,

414
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,520
 who you can't even make sense of what they're talking about.

415
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,440
 That is like old-timey insane-ness.

416
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
 Frogging out the mouth.

417
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,560
 You have rabies.

418
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,360
 You have syphilis.

419
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,680
 You have some sort of disease that's rotted holes

420
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,200
 through your brain madness.

421
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,160
 You're catatonic.

422
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,880
 You're a stark, raving lunatic.

423
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
 James Tilling Matthews was not that.

424
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,840
 He would burst out in public and accuse people

425
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
 of trying to murder him.

426
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
 But then he could go about his business.

427
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,640
 He could make tea deals.

428
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
 He could live among the population.

429
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,880
 He could travel to France and try to negotiate with people.

430
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,240
 But he was saying things that people knew were not true.

431
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
 He was an alunatic.

432
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,960
 So what is he?

433
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
 They keep saying he's insane, he's insane,

434
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
 because they can figure out something's wrong with him.

435
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
 But what is he?

436
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,240
 Illustrations of Madness is a book written in 1810

437
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,600
 to determine, is James Tilling Matthews actually insane?

438
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
 What is going on here?

439
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,560
 This book goes over all of the beliefs

440
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,000
 that James Tilling Matthews had.

441
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,360
 To this day, illustrations of madness.

442
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,880
 Not only is it a classic medical text,

443
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,120
 not only is it the very first full study

444
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
 of a single psychiatric patient,

445
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,160
 it is considered the very first description

446
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
 of paranoid schizophrenia.

447
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,480
 Nobody knew what paranoid schizophrenia was until 1810,

448
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,560
 and James Tilling Matthews was the first person

449
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,000
 to be identified to have paranoid schizophrenia.

450
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,200
 This is fascinating because we've covered stories like this today.

451
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
 When we're talking about gang stalking,

452
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
 when we're talking about these paranoid beliefs,

453
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,920
 imagine being the first person to believe in these things.

454
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,400
 This is so interesting.

455
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,120
 James Tilling Matthews would be lucid most of the time.

456
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
 Like a lot of people who believe in gang stalking,

457
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,840
 they're not just speaking gibberish,

458
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,240
 but their beliefs are untrue.

459
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,600
 He believed there was a thing called the heirloom gang.

460
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,040
 Not like heirloom, like your grandma's giving you something.

461
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,800
 Air as in the sky, loom as something to weave with.

462
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,200
 And they used the heirloom to shoot rays out.

463
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
 Invisible beams that would attack people.

464
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,200
 Now we have that, dude, that is so,

465
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,600
 because people talk about that today with 5G.

466
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,320
 People talk about that now with shedding stuff

467
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,160
 from the COVID vaccine, like invisible things floating around you.

468
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,680
 It used to be the Cold War weapons,

469
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,080
 it used to be the Russians were beaming stuff into your teeth,

470
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,000
 or US satellites, but none of that existed back then.

471
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
 I don't even think vaccines existed back then.

472
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,600
 Taking no one technology, the loom, very, very common thing,

473
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,680
 and associating a sci-fi element to it.

474
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,080
 It's not just a loom, it's an heirloom

475
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,440
 that's shooting beams out, that's giving you buzzes and pulses in your skin.

476
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,800
 Fascinating, because today when you talk to gang stalkers,

477
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
 we've covered tons of stories like this.

478
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
 They feel the beams and pulses and things behind their eyes,

479
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,560
 and they have to associate it with something.

480
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,120
 The man walking down the street with a dog,

481
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
 and when it barks, it's releasing some sort of infrared beam into his skull.

482
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,840
 The heirloom gang, it was a group of commoners,

483
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,600
 criminals, gang members, spies is what they were.

484
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,920
 When he was walking down the street,

485
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,360
 they would give each other signals,

486
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,920
 and he would realize they were gang stalking him.

487
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,440
 He said the heirloom had this thing it would quote "lopster crack" him.

488
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
 It's a term he came up with.

489
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,800
 The feeling under his skin he called the "lopster crack."

490
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,960
 And they would use, the heirloom gang would use this heirloom to make his blood stop flowing.

491
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,840
 It would also give him stomach issues,

492
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,840
 and could inject fluids directly into his brain.

493
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,560
 So he's having these physiological,

494
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,360
 or maybe he's not,

495
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,320
 maybe the physiological things are made up as well,

496
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,440
 but he could simply be having a buzz, a pulse in him,

497
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,080
 and he creates this story behind it.

498
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,080
 He believed that there were heirlooms stationed all over London.

499
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,720
 And not only was he under attack,

500
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
 but government figures were also under attack.

501
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
 It's interesting when you look at the story of Kyle Odom,

502
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,040
 which most famously believed that he was,

503
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,000
 if I remember correctly,

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,680
 it's been a while since I read his manifesto,

505
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,800
 but he had been raped by reptilian aliens.

506
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,560
 And so he confronted one of the people who he thought was a reptilian alien.

507
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,440
 It was a local minister,

508
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,680
 and he shot him several times in the head with a handgun.

509
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,040
 The minister survived.

510
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,120
 He's actually a member of a Senate now,

511
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
 or something like that,

512
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,800
 a state Senate I think.

513
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,600
 But what gets lost in that story?

514
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,400
 That one's real,

515
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,240
 I haven't covered that on the show because it's so popular,

516
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,800
 but a detail that gets lost on that story

517
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,960
 was that Kyle Odom also believed President Obama was raped by reptilians.

518
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,160
 And he tried getting word to President Obama

519
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,480
 that we're in on this together,

520
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
 like you and me, bro, we can take down these reptilians.

521
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,200
 Same thing going here.

522
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,360
 James Tilly Matthew believes not only is he being targeted by the heirloom gang,

523
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,200
 but other politicians are as well.

524
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,840
 So it's not just him.

525
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,800
 He's part of a broader group of resistance fighters against this heirloom gang.

526
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,160
 So that is why he's trying to meet with politicians.

527
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,080
 He knows the truth.

528
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
 He can help them overcome the bad guys.

529
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,480
 Again, when someone's saying this,

530
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,840
 like nowadays when someone says,

531
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,080
 like when I can immediately read this and go,

532
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,680
 "Oh, that's just like Kyle Odom believing that with President Obama."

533
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,760
 Back then people are like, "What are you talking about?"

534
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,840
 None of this is making any sense.

535
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
 This guy would easily be diagnosed today for having paranoid schizophrenia,

536
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
 but back then it had never been discovered yet.

537
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,840
 The heirloom gang was trying to take over the country,

538
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,960
 possibly the world.

539
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
 They had people all the way up the chain.

540
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
 They were attacking members of the military.

541
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,640
 They had already taken over parts of the military.

542
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
 This was a existential threat to the government, if not the world.

543
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,000
 He was locked in Bedelam until he died in 1815.

544
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
 So the book came out in 1810.

545
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
 He was there for another five years.

546
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,840
 But in 1814, one year before he died,

547
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,920
 all of the delusions went away.

548
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,960
 Stopped believing in the heirloom gang,

549
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,360
 stopped believing all of this nonsense.

550
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,920
 He just decided to stay in Bedelam.

551
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,240
 He really had nowhere else to go at that point.

552
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
 Remember, he'd been locked up.

553
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,040
 He would been in and out of jail in France and in England,

554
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,640
 and then he'd been locked in Bedelam at this point for about 17 years.

555
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,360
 So he's like, "I'm just gonna stay here."

556
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,120
 I mean, he's just like, "What? I'm done.

557
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
 I'll probably end up dying next year."

558
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,200
 They're like, "How do you know that?"

559
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
 He's like, "It's just a hunch."

560
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,560
 He just stayed there.

561
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,880
 And around the same time, they were doing a competition.

562
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,920
 The government knew that Bedelam wasn't working out.

563
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,560
 They knew it was a really, really physically poorly designed mental institution.

564
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,200
 It looked super scary.

565
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
 It was super scary.

566
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,800
 They actually had a public competition to try to redesign Bedelam.

567
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,720
 And James Tilly Matthews won.

568
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,200
 I mean, he kind of knew the place inside and out.

569
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,560
 He'd been there for 17 years.

570
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,480
 He submitted a 46-page booklet of designs.

571
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,000
 And he won the contest, and they actually took some of those designs

572
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
 and used them to improve Bedelam.

573
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,400
 And while Hoslom was writing his book about James Tilly Matthews,

574
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
 James Tilly Matthews was writing a book about Hoslom

575
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,480
 and how Bedelam should be reformed.

576
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,720
 And after James Tilly Matthews died,

577
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,600
 because this book was a huge hit in the medical community,

578
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
 they'd never seen anything like it.

579
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,760
 So he had become a known figure out this time.

580
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,800
 And after he passed away, his book on how to reform Bedelam,

581
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,000
 along with his physical designs to improve Bedelam,

582
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
 were both put into effect.

583
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
 And Hoslom lost his job, actually, after it,

584
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,880
 because they've read all this stuff that was going wrong with Bedelam

585
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
 from James Tilly Matthews.

586
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,160
 And since Hoslom had kind of made him popular,

587
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,960
 they read all this other stuff, and he was let go,

588
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
 along with other people as well.

589
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,600
 It wasn't all Hoslom's fault, but...

590
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,560
 It's a terrifying story to me.

591
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,360
 I mean, it ended up good for James Tilly Matthews.

592
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
 Like, I mean, he did do 17 years in Bedelam,

593
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,920
 but in the end, you know, he was cured.

594
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,560
 They went away.

595
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,520
 He became lucid again.

596
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,600
 He realized what he thought was wrong.

597
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,560
 But imagine being the first person to suffer from a mental illness.

598
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,760
 How terrifying that must be.

599
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,000
 There's already such issues with chaos, mental chaos,

600
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,280
 and stuff not making sense, and your loved one's not believing you.

601
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,560
 Why aren't they believing me?

602
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,400
 Why can't they see the truth?

603
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,920
 But that person can then be put in front of a couple doctors,

604
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,800
 and they can observe them and take notes and say,

605
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,480
 "This is what they have.

606
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,000
 This is the mental illness they have.

607
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
 These are the treatments available."

608
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,560
 But what if you're the first one to have that mental illness?

609
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,040
 Now, James Tilly Matthews in history probably wasn't the first person

610
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,880
 to have paranoid schizophrenia, but he was the first one identified.

611
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,280
 You had probably people in farm towns and villages come down with this,

612
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,240
 accuse the local mayor of trying to poison the water supply,

613
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,160
 thinking that the cows are following them and they have the evil eye installed,

614
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
 and a witch is trying to take over the town.

615
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,560
 And those people were probably considered cursed,

616
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,840
 probably killed, or just locked up, or exiled out of the village.

617
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,680
 But James Tilly Matthews was the first person in modern society

618
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,080
 that they could identify who had this.

619
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,000
 Who knows how many other, this is going to sound weird,

620
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,720
 but who knows how many other extremely rare mental illnesses are out there in the world?

621
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,080
 They pop up once every 100 years, once every thousand years, they're so rare.

622
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,120
 But you get stricken with one of these things, and you can't be treated for it.

623
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,240
 Your delusions are unrecognizable to any medical professional.

624
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,400
 They can't figure out what causes them, they can't figure out where they're coming from,

625
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,000
 they can't figure out how to treat it.

626
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,640
 All they can do is lock you up, keep you under observation,

627
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,400
 because they don't know how it progresses,

628
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
 they don't know if you're going to get violent,

629
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,000
 they don't know if you're going to hurt yourself or other people.

630
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,800
 You become a medical freak to be studied, examined,

631
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,160
 and even then they can't figure out what's wrong with you.

632
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,120
 Somebody always has to be the unfortunate first.

633
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
 Whether it's a physical illness like AIDS,

634
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,320
 doctors just stood around and they go, "I don't know what's killing this young man,"

635
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,200
 or it's a mental disease like paranoid schizophrenia.

636
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,640
 But who knows what else is out there?

637
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,760
 Who knows what other diseases are just waiting to be unlocked and unleashed on humanity?

638
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,840
 The world is resilient, and eventually they'll find a cure.

639
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,920
 But what happens if you're the first person to get it?

640
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,360
 You're the first person to be locked in an isolation ward,

641
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,400
 as doctors stand around you furiously writing notes.

642
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,160
 We all think our lives will end up great.

643
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,120
 We all think we are important people.

644
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:30,080
 But what if your mark on world history is to be the first human struck down

645
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,720
 with a terrible, unknown disease?
