 Just when you thought eggs couldn't get any more disgusting
 They did like Jason. I love eggs. I don't know why you ate eggs so much. Anyways, they're disgusting
 And that's not the whole story. I'm gonna talk about other stuff and then a man has a close encounter of the tea time
 You know Jason these are making less and less sense. Hold on and
 then and
 Then we cover a true crime story
 That should strike fear into the heart of any
 Well-meaning citizen when a young woman is stumbling home from a bar many good Samaritans reach out to help her home
 But she ends up falling into the arms of a killer today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Garvin
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having a lot of fun
 I'm still doing my breakneck recording to try to get as many episodes out before this heatwave hits
 But let's go ahead and introduce one of our legacy patreon's coming into that
 I'm hurry up hurry up coming to Dead Rabbit Command, bro
 I gotta get this episode recorded coming into Dead Rabbit Command is user profile name everyone give a round of applause
 Give a round of applause to this Tron character who has a default name. What happened? I actually reached out to you
 I try to figure out what was going on user profile name
 I remember they set up an account the name had a profanity in it
 I saw it pop up in a notification, but by the time I went to look at it
 It came to user profile name. So you are now one of the users you are now one of the gods of the Tron world
 User you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon
 That's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot user
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command
 We are headed out to Dong Yang China
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is taking us high above the heat up in the stratosphere where it's super cold
 We don't have oxygen. We're slowly nine, but it's nice and cool user take us on out to China
 Specifically we're going to Dong Yang that's in the Zee's Yang province
 I was recommended the story by Mason one of my longtime patreon supporters longtime supporter of the show
 He sent this over to me on the patreon discord. So he sent me this over. This is a delicacy in Dong Yang
 You get an egg you get one egg fresh from the chicken has to be steaming right out of the chicken's vagina
 You look at you're holding it. You're like yes
 Perfect chicken body temperature and then you've got to soak the egg and water you cook it right?
 That's how you would normally boil an egg
 Fresh out of the chickens vagina, but are they vaginas or is that what they're called on a chicken? Jamie?
 Look that up. Look me look that up and then don't tell me because it's super disgusting
 That's how you normally boil an egg you take the chicken egg or duck egg or goose egg or whatever
 Put it in water and boil it but dong yang man. They're like that's lame
 We got to do stuff differently step one you want to boil an egg
 You want to boil an egg in dong yang dude step one?
 Go to a local elementary school and you're like is that where the chicken coops are it is like dong yang have this farm
 Built into the school. No you're driving by you see all the chicken farms you pass those you see fresh egg stores
 It's just the shape of a giant chicken vagina. That's what you walk into to get your eggs
 It's not many people shop there. No you go to the local elementary school
 And you're walking in with the dude and you're like dude. I'm so hungry all I do
 I need to cure my hunger is one hard boiled egg
 I don't know why my body's built like that, but that's what I need you're walking into this elementary school with this dude
 And he's like oh don't worry man
 You're gonna get your one hard boiled egg, but first we got to go to the elementary school
 Then you go into the boys restroom. You're like wait what what is there chicken in here? There's a basin
 There's a giant trough and you see the your friend from dong yang going
 And he picks the basin up and then he's like help me carry this basin of children's urine
 To my car and they're like what man you have this basin of boys urine has to be urine from ten-year-olds your friend tells you
 You're wondering why this guy is your friend
 He's like what we do is we get urine from boys who are under ten years old and he begins to scoop out this urine
 I'm sure he has some sort of funnel or something like that
 I'm sure it doesn't spin all day doing this
 But he takes the urine from the trough in the boys restroom and puts it in buckets and takes it to his car
 And you're like okay. This must just be a side quest or something like that
 Right this must be collect five barrels of boy urine and then you'll get some experience points and then we'll just cook an egg
 So he drives you back to his kitchen your little word because he's bringing the urine into his kitchen with you and he explains to you
 Okay, so this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna take this egg this egg. You need so much. We're gonna boil it and you're like finally
 Let me finish we're gonna boil it and boys urine
 Like what so many questions have popped up in your head none of them are answerable
 Some of the questions are is this healthy? Probably not right is this clean? Probably not
 So in schools in these elementary schools in dong yang, this is a this is so real
 There's like infrastructure built into this when a boy needs to go to the bathroom
 The teacher reminds them remember to use the basin. I don't know where else they're going, right?
 I don't know if they're just going on the floor and they're also told if you're sick
 Don't pee in the basin
 Because we want to soak our eggs in boy urine, but we don't want to soak our eggs in boy urine if they have the flu
 You know, you got to think safe. So I don't know if they just go behind a tree or something like that
 I guess there's like a normal toilet to poop in too. There's not the poop basin next to it. There's some chef there
 He's like, mm-hmm. This is all for me girls just use normal toilets. They don't want to use girl urine
 They're like that's cooties in it. We tried that everyone got cooties
 You bring this boy urine out of this basin
 Some people are lucky enough like if you have a boy if you have a son in your house, you just have them
 P you're like, oh, yes, my own eggs. I don't need to buy those store bought eggs anymore. Honey, we're off the grid
 We're gonna live in the middle of nowhere and I'm gonna eat all the virgin boy eggs myself. That's what they're called
 I should have I should have announced that earlier. These are called virgin boy eggs and what they do is they take a an egg
 All over the place. They take an egg. They boil it not in water. They boil it in boy urine
 You're like, okay, you know, that's fine
 You would never say that I'm totally putting words in your mouth
 But let's say for let's say for a second. You think that's fine
 You take the egg you boil it in boys urine and you pull it out
 Then you're like, I'm just gonna wash it off. Right? Like maybe the boys urine
 You can't even think of any rational reason of why you would do this
 But let's say you do let's say you do and you go maybe the boys urine whatever
 I'm gonna take it out. I'm gonna wash it off. Anyways, a boiled egg is a boiled egg
 It doesn't matter if I'm boiling it in water or in hydrogen peroxide
 Probably does don't try that. Don't even try boiling hydrogen peroxide that might explode or kill you
 But this is what they do. They boil it. They get it nice and a hard boiled egg, right? Which are disgusting
 I hate hard boiled eggs. I don't even want to look at them. I deviled eggs. They're all disgusting
 I can only eat scrambled eggs
 kind of but
 You you take a regular egg you turn in a hard boiled egg
 You pull it out of the urine
 Then you crack the shell and now you have a hard boiled egg and that would be bad enough
 But then they take this
 Unshelled egg and you go you know what this recipe is missing?
 More boy urine
 So then they put the unshell the only thing that was protecting it from this disgustingness
 They put this unshell egg back in the urine and you boil it until it soaks up all the boy urine
 Which is not which is not anything you want to see in any recipe ever
 It's like you know, it's done when there's no more boy urine available
 It actually turns golden. You're like, oh, that's a nice color and the yolk turns green
 Like moldy green and then you eat it and then you then you do your best to try to enjoy a virgin boy egg
 These are very popular in dong yang
 It's a cultural dish like i'm sure you know, what's funny because when you read articles about this
 It's it goes back centuries
 People say it redo it's one of those things like it does everything which should tell you that it does nothing
 Like a like I take Tylenol and it helps pain. It also doesn't improve my eyesight and make me faster
 Like any food or drug that claims too many different things does none of them
 So if you eat virgin boy eggs you reduce inflammation it promotes blood circulation
 It gets rid of fungal infections of the mouth
 Which i'm sure also costs by eating boy urine. It has all these
 Homeopathic traits, but most likely none of them exist. The residents of dong yang are actually
 There's a 50/50 split people are really divided over this because some people say it's delicious
 And it's totally cured my inflammation and I can run fast mom look at how fast I can run after I ate an egg
 And then the other people go I think they're disgusting and that would be fine
 Not everyone in town is going to eat mcdonald's right, but the problem is
 Is that
 Whether or not you eat a mcdonald's
 You don't smell boiling boy urine all day long the people in town who hate the eggs
 Hate the town because they constantly smell like at certain times of the day when everyone's making these eggs
 You just smell boiling boy urine
 Wafed through the town so the people who hate the eggs they go I don't eat them
 But I can't avoid them. They're everywhere and walking on the street. There's like a stink cloud following me around
 So that's the story of virgin boy eggs. It's bizarre. It's disgusting
 It's like my best combination of things that I love mason. Thanks for bringing this to my attention
 User i'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the jason jelapi. We're gonna leave behind dong yang china trying to
 Outrun this stink cloud. We are headed out to a small town in america
 Old timey jason jelapi is being driven by user. We're headed out to an unnamed city
 Somewhere in the heartland. There's a young man
 He's at his house
 He's sleeping. Let's call him
 Jeremy let's call him a name. Let's call him a name. I can pronounce. Let's call him
 michael
 michael is sleeping in his bed one night and he wakes up
 Can't really figure out why you know just one of those things he kind of wakes up and he's sitting there in the darkness of his room and
 He sees that there's a light on downstairs
 It's like what it's weird. I'm sure that I shut that off. So he gets up out of his bed
 He's still kind of unsteady, you know, right when you wake up. He walks out of his bedroom
 He walks downstairs to go shut off
 the light
 And he sees something in his kitchen
 He sees what he calls a little green man
 Which is an interesting description of an alien that is an old term usually that was like almost a mocking term
 Nowadays they're usually classified as greys or reptilians or humanoids if you don't really know how to place it
 But he actually uses the words a little green man in the kitchen
 He says it was about the size of an eight-year-old
 just standing there
 And he goes he didn't get any sort of sense of terror from this thing
 He wasn't scared of it and it wasn't scared of him. It just turned to him and smiled
 He doesn't get any he doesn't give any other descriptors of how this alien being looks
 Just that it has green skin
 And it's quite small
 Andy
 He doesn't know what to do he this normally when you would find an intruder in your house
 You would have a fight or flight response will fight response. There's nowhere to go. You're in your house, but
 He looks at this bean and says
 Uh, hello, would you like a drink?
 And he got a telepathic message in his head. Yes
 I would like a drink
 Michael asks
 What do you want? Do you want some coffee? Do you want some water and he gets another telepathic message?
 I would prefer tea, please
 So Michael Michael looks in his cupboards and finds some tea that he has
 Which is interesting because
 This alien probably knew that he did have tea if he can read his mind
 He may have seen that he bought tea
 So many months ago, but he does make this tea and the humanoid is just standing in the kitchen just observing him
 When he's done making the tea he puts it on the table and the alien just stands there and looks at the tea
 Michael goes aren't you going to drink the tea?
 And the alien smiles and says
 Oh, I don't drink tea
 Well, why did you want me to make it then?
 Michael asks
 The alien goes
 I appreciate the form of the tea
 And the effort that went into making it
 Michael asks why are you here? What's the cause of this visit?
 He doesn't get a vocal answer. He doesn't get a telepathic answer
 Instead
 He sees in an instant
 A million images blast through his head
 He sees people enjoying themselves
 At home
 On the beach
 Walking through the woods
 He sees world peace
 He sees a world of no pollution
 He sees a world of
 World of pure abundance
 All of these images in his head
 And he's overwhelmed
 By this
 He says they're coming so fast
 And they don't stop
 He's seen all of this joy
 But it's too much for him to comprehend
 And he passes out
 He wakes up in his bed
 And he thinks this must be a dream right?
 It must have been dreaming. There's such a bizarre encounter
 And he's like
 I'm not sure if he's gonna make it
 And there's such a bizarre encounter
 He goes downstairs and he notices
 There's no tea left out
 So was I dreaming?
 Did my wife
 Who Jason didn't mention was in the story earlier
 Next to him in bed?
 Did my wife wake up earlier and clean all the tea stuff that I leave?
 I don't know what happened
 I might have just been a dream
 So he tells his wife because
 I had the weirdest experience last night
 And he tells her this story
 And she sits there and she goes
 "Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night
 And there was a little man
 At the foot of our bed
 He was just standing there
 But I figured I was dreaming
 I figured that couldn't be
 So I just went back to sleep
 Michael said shortly after this
 Event they ended up leaving the house
 They ended up selling the house
 And moving to the countryside shortly after
 I found the story on the X-board
 Probably earlier this year
 I didn't archive the link
 I feel bad about that
 But lately I've been doing that more
 With Reddit and X-board posts
 But I just thought it was such an interesting story
 It's very
 The thing that I love the most about it
 Let's assume that it's true
 It could be fake like everything we cover on the show
 It's just one person's same thing
 We don't know, but the thing I love about this
 Story is the tea moment
 I love that little piece of information
 Where you have this alien
 Who can travel the cosmos
 Who has these telepathic powers
 Who did he come from a world
 Of pure abundance and joy
 Or was he showing what humanity could do
 We have all of this high level stuff
 We have a man meeting an alien
 We have telepathic communication
 A vision of a possible future
 A vision of an alien world we don't know
 But to me the reason why I saved this story
 For so long was the tea part
 I just love that moment
 Because yeah, you can forget
 To take the little things into account
 And you have this alien
 Who has all of these powers
 And the ability to transcend space and time
 But there's just something very special
 About boiling water
 Boiling non-urinated water
 Boiling water and taking a little bag
 And putting it and
 Steeping it and then
 Having this refreshing drink
 That's made of water
 And plant
 It's a very, very basic drink
 It goes back thousands of years
 And there is kind of a
 Calmness
 To the creation of tea
 Unless you have one of those whistling teapots
 And then it's not, but I just love that story
 I kind of love that small moment between this alien
 And this human, and I keep saying alien
 We don't know what this thing was
 The term little green man could have been
 A slang term
 Forgery, it could have been that this person was actually green
 You know, because it's just this
 Thing on export
 It's just these few words that you didn't really
 Follow anything up, but I love the story
 Whether or not you picture it as a little green human being
 Or a gray alien, I just think it's a very, very
 Fascinating insight
 To that human alien relation
 User, let's go ahead and talk to the keys of the
 Carbonary Cofter. We've had our fill of tea
 We're waving goodbye to the alien
 The families paralyze now
 And more of the aliens are showing up
 They're like, it's probe time. We're like, oh, they're just
 Going to have so much fun making tea together
 Let's leave behind this town
 And we are headed out
 To whole
 England
 I want to tell you guys something before we get started
 On this next story. This next story is real dark
 This next story is real dark
 It's a true crime story. It's something that I've wanted
 To talk about for a while
 It bugs me. This story really, really bugs me
 And I'm including at the end of the episode
 So if you want to bounce out now
 And I'll see you tomorrow, that's so
 Go enjoy your urine boy eggs
 And I'll see you tomorrow
 But if you want to stick around for a darker true crime
 Story, we're going to go with this one
 It's not incredibly dark. It just really bugs me
 It really makes me mad
 It really, really makes me mad
 So it's not like it doesn't involve kids or anything like that
 But it's true crime story and it...
 Okay, so, we're in whole
 H-U-L-L
 That's in East Yorkshire in England
 It's January 31st, 2019
 If you live over there, I'm sure you already know
 Where this is going. It's fairly big
 True crime case that just
 Ended. The trial just ended
 There was a young woman named Libby
 Squire. She's 21 years old
 And her and her friends are out clubbing
 They're enjoying life. They're getting drunk
 They're partying. You know, I used to do all that stuff
 As well. You can't judge them for that
 They're out just doing their thing
 What happened though is that
 They're going from club to club
 They're getting drunker and drunker
 And they go to this club and Libby is
 Visibly drunk
 There's a difference between being
 Buzzed, being drunk and being so drunk
 That you legally can't be allowed
 To buy more liquor
 Which that happens
 That happens with a lot of alcohol
 I'm not saying Libby Squire was an alcoholic
 But that's the point where
 Bouncers at clubs, they have to look at liability
 They're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, she's too drunk
 She can't come in here. Sure
 She's probably going to spend money, but
 We have an obligation. We can't do that
 A lot of times it's a legal obligation
 In the United States, I know for sure
 You cannot serve someone alcohol if they're legally drunk
 So the friends want to continue
 There are poor friends
 The poor friends in this story
 There's a lot of people who suffer in this story
 But can you imagine if you were one of these
 Young woman's friends
 They say
 "Listen, we still want to continue to party
 Like, you need to hold your liquor"
 I'm putting words in their mouth. I don't know if they said any of this stuff
 These are real people
 But they do say, "Libby, we want to continue our party
 We will pay for a taxi to take you home
 You're too drunk to get in, you can't wait outside
 So they call a taxi, they pay the taxi
 They put her in and they give taxi driver the address
 And they go into the club
 Taxi cab driver
 Upstanding citizen
 Drives this horribly drunk young woman home
 Safe and sound
 And there's a lot of people like that in this story
 Libby gets out of the taxi cab
 She's right in front of her house
 I think it's like a dorm type of thing
 I think it was like an apartment complex
 But she's right outside of her building
 And the taxi cab drives away
 This is England, there's cameras everywhere
 We have a lot of video footage of this woman
 Apparently the taxi cab drives away
 And Libby is just kind of standing out there
 And she falls face first on the ground
 She's so drunk she just gets up
 Brushes herself off and walks away from her house
 It's January 31st in England
 It's freezing cold
 And she's dressed to go to the club
 She's dressed in club clothes
 Which don't include parkas, they don't include ski pants
 She's walking around the town of Hull
 Some of her fellow students
 Yeah, I think they dropped her outside of a dorm
 I know she was going to college
 Some other students are walking down the street
 And they see this young, obviously drunk woman
 Walking down the street
 And they come up to her and they...
 Do you need any help? What's going on?
 Do you need to find a way home?
 Should we call you a taxi cab? What's going on?
 And she refuses their help
 And you can't force somebody to be helped
 So these students go, "Well, I hope she makes it home okay"
 They don't know that she's walking away from her house
 Hope she makes it home okay
 Upstanding citizens, these young people
 See one of their fellow students in trouble
 They want to help her out
 And we have CCTV video of Libby walking down the street
 And this... I love this part of the story
 It's probably the only part of the story that I do love
 Stranger after stranger after stranger
 Stopping and asking, "Do you need help, young lady?"
 "Can I get you home?"
 And she refuses
 Over and over and over again
 People see her stumbling on the street
 They're leaning out of their car
 "Hey you! Hey you mate! What's going on lady?"
 "You look like you're not feeling good"
 She walks away
 Couples are walking on the street
 They see her, "Hey honey, do you need help?"
 She walks away
 She's refusing all this help
 And we have this footage of her walking down the street
 When her friends get home, she's not there
 The next day, they can't find Libby
 That feeling
 As a kid, you know, you're babysitting
 You're sibling and they go missing
 That's happened to me a couple times
 You're like Jason, you're a terrible babysitter
 You know what I mean?
 Like they go running off or do something stupid
 And you're like, "Dude, where are you man?
 I'm trying to find you"
 And you're mad
 Because you know that they're just kind of messing around
 But at the same time you get that pit in your stomach
 But I've only had that happen for maybe like 20-30 minutes
 You're like 20-30 minutes Jason, you are a bad babysitter
 Can you imagine that happening for 24 hours?
 48 hours
 We put Libby in the cab
 The cab took her back home
 We don't know what happened
 Authorities are called to police
 Start reviewing this video
 And they see this young woman walking down the street
 And they see person after person
 Reaching out to her
 Trying to help her
 She's freezing cold and clubbing clothes
 She's horribly, horribly drunk
 One thing the police notice in these videos
 Is cars pulling up
 And people leaning out or getting out of the car
 And asking if she needs help
 And her refusing to help
 And then the car continue on
 But a couple times
 They see the same car
 Following her down the street
 Seems to be stalking her
 They start to try to identify this vehicle
 The police continue to view video
 To try to find all the different angles
 Of what could have happened to Libby
 And they do find that at one point
 This car stops
 A man gets out of the car
 Begins talking to Libby
 They'd seen this happen before
 But then he puts his arm around Libby
 And leads her to the passenger seat
 She gets in the car
 And the car drives away
 March 20th, 2019
 Seven weeks after Libby's squire has vanished
 They find her body
 Floating in the Humber Estuary
 She'd been in the water for so long
 They don't know how she died
 But they do notice some bruises on her
 That could be signs of strangulation
 And there also appears to be
 It's hard to tell because
 The body had been in the water for seven weeks
 They're assuming
 Signs of rape
 So they think it wasn't an accident
 They don't think she just stumbled off into the darkness
 So an estuary
 I had to look this up
 An estuary is where a large river
 Meets a stream basically
 So they believe at some point
 She had fell into the water
 Or had been pushed into the water
 Or disposed of if she was already dead
 And she'd been floating around this entire time
 Until her body was finally recovered
 But they believe they have a murder investigation
 On their hands
 It does happen
 We covered that a long time ago
 When we talked about all those people
 I think we were talking about the happy face killers
 That whole theory about all the people who are found
 Drowned in the rivers and the waterways in America
 I'll post links in the show notes
 But we see the same thing happened in
 Holland, I believe it is
 Where they have a thing where young men
 Just a weird thing that young men do
 They leave bars, they have to urinate
 They're super drunk
 And in Holland
 They do it a lot, they pee into the canals
 That's where the Holland is
 One of the canals in the water, right?
 And they fall in
 And in America, the happy face killer
 Conspiracy theory is that there's a gang of people
 Who are pushing young college aged men
 Into the rivers and the streams of America
 And it's counting for all these deaths
 There's two homicide detectives that have been investigating it
 For decades
 I did an episode on it a long time ago
 And in Holland, they have the same thing
 They don't think it's a serial killer
 They know that this is a common occurrence
 It's tragic every single time
 It's called death by misadventure
 I believe is what it's classified as
 But they think someone who's drunk
 They're walking around in the dark, it's easy to fall in a river
 And they're drunk, they can barely walk
 They're not going to be able to swim
 So they're looking at that, but they're also looking at this car
 And they do identify the driver of it
 His name is Paul Well-Reloids
 26-year-old husband of two children
 Now he denies it
 Right
 They're talking to him and he goes, "I don't know what you're talking about"
 Like, I didn't kill anybody
 Everyone knows the story of Libby Squire
 It's a big missing persons case in England
 But I didn't do anything
 I'm married, I have two kids
 I don't need to be out on the street murdering people
 And they go, "But here's the thing, Paul Well
 We have you on video, we have you on video
 Following her in the car
 We have you on video getting out
 And leading her to the passenger seat
 And Paul Well goes, "Okay, well here's the thing
 I did that
 But I didn't murder her
 And I didn't murder anybody"
 And they go, "Well, then what happened?"
 This might be the worst alibi
 Ever
 And we just recently called, covered story
 But a guy says he was possessed by a ghost
 He's using that as his defense
 He says, "Okay, here's the thing, you're right
 You do have me on video doing this stuff"
 Let me tell you the whole story
 I was at McDonald's, I was eating some McDonald's
 Late at night
 And I said, "Oh, I'm done with this
 Normally people don't live in McDonald's
 I'm done eating my McDonald's, it's time to leave
 And he goes, "I'm driving around the city
 And I'll be honest with you guys
 I was looking for
 Some strange
 I was looking to bang a girl
 Because I do like having sex with women
 Even though I have a wife
 I wanted a little something on the side
 He's totally up front about that
 And he goes, "So I'm driving on the road
 And I see this fairly attractive young woman
 And she's dressed like she's at the club
 And she must have been so cold outside
 So I actually got out
 And invited her into the car
 And I'm like, "Okay"
 He says, "We had come to the conclusion
 That we were gonna have sex
 She wanted to have sex with me, I'm a very attractive man"
 He says, "This is the two cops looking at each other
 I'm a very attractive man
 And we needed a place to go
 Obviously we can't take her back to my place
 Because of my wife and two children
 So we drove out to this field
 We drove out to this field
 And the police are like, "You mean the field?"
 The field by the stream
 Yeah, yeah, the field that has easy access
 To the waterways, yeah, we went out to that field
 And we had sex
 We had 100% consensual sex
 Now you see these scratches on my face
 You see these scratches on my face here
 And the police are like, "We didn't see those scratches
 Until you pointed them out"
 And he's like, "Oh great"
 Well these scratches on here are on my face
 Because after we had sex
 I realized that I'm a married man
 And I had to go home
 And she was so mad I wouldn't have more sex with her
 Because I'm such a sex machine
 That she scratched me
 Because I said, "No more sex"
 The cops are like, the cops are taking notes
 They're like, "This guy is moron"
 And he goes, "I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what
 She scratched me
 And I got off of her because
 I didn't want to have sex with her anymore
 Because she scratched me"
 It's like this Schrodinger scratch
 Which happened first
 And the cops go, "Why didn't you just take her home
 At that point?" And he goes, "Well the problem is
 Is she was so drunk"
 And really at this point he's admitted to raping her
 Because she's so drunk
 And he said that she was so drunk
 But he goes, "She was so drunk
 So I may sexually assault a drunk woman
 But there is no way I would let her
 Vomit in my car
 What type of monster do you think I am, officers?"
 So I left her
 In the park
 And she was totally alive when I left, officers
 She was totally alive when I left
 And they're like, "Well, she was freezing cold"
 "Yeah, I was kind of cold down, I probably"
 "You know you're right, I probably should have done something"
 "She might have stumbled into the waterway"
 Apparently she did, officers
 But I don't know what happened
 Or after she left, I actually
 Left her in that field, totally alive
 And I went to go eat some McDonald's
 The police are like, "That's suspicious"
 "No one eats McDonald's twice in one day"
 And he's like, "Dang it, my alibi has been blown"
 They do have him on video at McDonald's
 Twice in one day, that actually did not
 That actually did not have anything to do
 That is true, but it is not what caused the
 Break in the case
 So all of this stuff comes out in trial, right?
 His alibi that he does, they're showing this
 In real footage, and
 A bunch of other stuff came out as well
 Because you could argue that
 Like, that is a, you've just admitted to rape
 You're gonna do some time for that
 But a good defense lawyer could probably argue that
 Yes, he did all that stuff
 Why a client is a total disgusting human being
 But he didn't murder her
 Someone else may have come along and murdered her
 After the fact
 Or, that's where the bruises came from
 That it was rough sex and she walked into the river afterwards
 So like, a good defense lawyer could argue that stuff
 But
 Here's some other factors that happened
 They go and get into his car
 They find a bag of sex toys
 He's like, "Eh, everyone has sex toys"
 He used underwear
 Not his
 And not his wife's
 It was stolen underwear
 From other women's houses
 And he says, "No, no, no, I don't know why you're getting this whole
 Stealing from women's houses thing"
 "I don't know where those came from"
 "When I bought the car, it had a complimentary bag of sex toys
 And used women's underwear"
 They also found in the trunk of his car
 A scream mask
 You know, ghost face
 And a clown mask as well
 The police begin to investigate him
 And they realize that Paul Well
 Has been convicted several times
 Of sex crimes
 Now they're really on to the sky
 They're reviewing footage, they're looking at all this stuff
 It turns out that not
 This information is not
 That not, this information did not come out during the trial
 He was found guilty
 Of the murder of Libby Squire
 Because they have the video footage
 He basically placed himself at the scene
 His defense lawyer really had no argument
 He definitely raped the woman
 She was too drunk
 Too drunk, she was so drunk she was about to throw up
 He was found guilty
 So now we're in the sentencing phase
 And that's when even more information came out
 Because you can't always reveal this information when you're trying
 It's such a weird thing, like you're being tried for that crime
 So that you usually can't bring other crimes in
 Oh, it turns out he's a sex pest
 He's been committing sex crimes for years
 Earlier that night
 Before he killed Libby Squire
 He was masturbating outside of a woman's house
 While watching her
 He had done that earlier that night
 And there were other instances of him
 Masturbating, breaking into women's houses
 Stealing their underwear, masturbating into the underwear
 And creepy of all
 I find this deep in the dark
 And I find this deep in the dark
 And creepy of all
 I mean, we're talking about a young murdered woman
 And all of the lie
 I mean, can you imagine being one of her friends?
 It's hard to place ourselves in the position of the murder victim
 Right?
 But can you imagine being one of those friends
 Like we've all been in those situations
 Where we've been like, "Hey dude, you're not good to drive"
 "Oh no, I can totally drive bro"
 We've all been in situations like that
 And most of the time they work out
 But it only takes one time for it not to work out
 And the friends who just go, "Well, we're gonna go club"
 "And we'll send you home the cab driver"
 Every single person who stopped
 Those are us, those people are us
 We can't, it's hard for us to sympathize with Libby
 I mean, we can definitely
 And we don't want to empathize
 Or sympathize or care anything about Paul Well
 But we can all
 We've all been that person on the road
 And seen something weird
 Seen it and been like, "Hey, are you okay?"
 So yeah, I mean imagine being those people
 We can imagine that
 And trying to help
 I almost feel like so many guardian angels
 Were sent down that night
 I know that sounds really highfalutin
 Maybe to, you know, New Agey
 But I think everyone had
 A message in their heart that night
 "Hey, try to help this woman"
 "Try to help this woman"
 It's several times they have on CCTV
 But it didn't help, she was killed
 And so that's all creepy in and of itself
 But after he murdered her
 He went home and he watched porn
 He was watching porn after he had just raped
 And murdered this woman and earlier in the night
 He was masturbating, staring in women's windows
 Watching them
 It's still not enough
 He goes home and he watches porn
 And he's masturbating again
 And then
 They have video of him in the middle of the night
 Walking out into the field
 Where he says this was the last
 What they imagine is he took her out to the field
 He had sex with her, she fought back
 He murdered her, and that's probably
 How it was
 Probably wasn't consensual at all
 He murdered her, he got off on it
 But he goes back to the
 And then disposed of her body in the river
 Because they didn't find her out in the field
 She was just floating in the water for so long
 He goes back to the field where he had
 Murdered her
 And there's video of him
 This is so creepy because I can just imagine it
 They showed this video during the sentencing
 Apparently I don't think they showed it during the trial
 Oddly enough
 But I could be wrong in that detail
 Because information came out in different phases
 And different articles and stuff like that
 But this would have been the end of the trial
 It would have been a one day trial
 Had this video been released
 There's video footage of Paweł
 Walking into the field
 And he's masturbating in the darkness
 That's terrifying
 That
 That image to me
 Is so terrifying
 That is a man whose blood lust
 Cannot be satiated
 He just raped and murdered a woman
 Went home, watched porn
 Went back to the spot where he
 Raped and murdered the woman
 After the body had been disposed of
 He didn't go back to clean up evidence
 He didn't go back to tie any loose ends
 He went back
 And just jacked off
 And he just took off his clothes
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What the hell is this?"
 And he was like
 "What I wanted to cover it was that final image
 that really creepy
 image of that man just masturbating in the darkness
 He's celebrating
 his crime
 He's celebrating and who knows if he's done this before
 right?
 But the other reason I wanted to cover it was because of all the people
 helping out. I think that's a
 interesting part of the story
 in an alternate universe, damn it
 in an alternate universe
 I don't mean to be make light of it
 but one of those people were able to get her home
 but she kept on walking into the darkness
 until the darkness
 finally took her away
