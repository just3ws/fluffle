1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 All I wanted to do was talk about Pokemon.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 But as I begin to investigate these pocket monsters as I tried to collect them all,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I found myself falling deeper down a dugget hole.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Is that a Pokemon? Is that what this little guy right? I'm sure it's one of them.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 There's like thousands of them.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But you know those duggets? Those famous duggets?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 As I was trying to investigate Pokemons, I kept sliding deeper and deeper down this dugget hole.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Until I didn't know what was true, what was false, what was fictional, and what was reality.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 From a local ban and retail stores, which makes no sense at all,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 all the way to standing outside of an elementary school waiting for a Poke Van to show up,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Pokemon, Navy Seals, Secret Bases on the Moon.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 This episode has it all. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 [Music]

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. This one is a wild ride.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 This is the episode that as I was researching it, I go, I gotta do a whole,

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I gotta do a whole theme week of crazy stuff.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Every story I was researching was crazy for whatever reason last week.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 But this story, the rabbit holes, or the dugget holes, or whatever I was going through on this thing,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 were so deep I started to lose a sense of reality.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So join me on this insane journey. Let's see what we can get through.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But first off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Pull that Pokeball out of your pocket. You choose Charizard. I choose Kyle Hughes.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Kyle Hughes. Kyle Hughes is a water Pokemon. He's spraying water everywhere out of his mouth.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Kyle, you're going to be our captain, our pilot, and he's so adorable.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Look at him. Look at him. He's so adorable. You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode if you don't flood the place.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Kyle, I'm going to give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 We are headed out to Wisconsin.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Jason Jalopy's taking us on this nice, long journey.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So guys, let's talk about Pokemon. Let's talk about Pokemon.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I remember, I have fond memories of Pokemon. I never played the games, I never played the card games or anything like that,

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 but I used to have this ritual. I used to kick it with this chick named Liz way back in the day,

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 and we would both get super stoned and watch Pokemon. Not just Pokemon, we didn't just get stoned for half an hour.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 This was a long time ago, but we used to sit there, and we'd watch Recess, we'd watch all the cartoons,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 all the hits, all the hits of the early 2000s, late 90s.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Get stoned, and I remembered in my marijuana infused state, I remember thinking Pokemon would be the perfect place to live.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Not like inside a Pokemon, not like they're a tauntaun from Star Wars, but that world.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And I didn't love it so much that I went out and bought the cards or played the games or anything like that,

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 but I remember thinking, wouldn't it be awesome taking another hit?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Wouldn't it be awesome to have a wild animal that's your buddy? Jason, you can do that today, that's called a pet.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You also got to just wander through the world. That's something that we can't really do in the modern age,

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 at least in the Western world. At least not in cities. I'm a city boy.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 So to watch this show, I mean, maybe you grew up on a farm, maybe you had a pig that ever so often you and the pig would just wander through the woods

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 and you'd have it attack squirrels or weaker animals. Who knows?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 So for me to watch Pokemon and to think it was always so green and lush and everything was fairly basic,

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 to think I could get a Squirtle and just walk around, because I love walking anyways.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I can just walk around and beat stuff up, right? Those are the two things I love the most.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Walking and conflict. So I remember sitting there, I'd always go over to Liz's house and we'd smoke weed.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 We'd eat macaroni and cheese. I had a special recipe for macaroni and cheese.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I would get Kraft, I'd get the instant macaroni and cheese. You get like the Kraft macaroni and cheese,

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 but you don't use butter or milk. You'd use the...

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Don't rush out, everyone. I know you're going to rush out and buy this today, because you want to test this out.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 With instant macaroni and cheese, all you need is the noodles and the cheese powder.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I never put milk or butter in it and it actually tasted just okay. It just tasted okay.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And I microwaved it as well. And Liz was always like, "What are you talking about? This is so disgusting!"

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Sure enough, she started doing it too, because it was a lot cheaper and a lot quicker.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Well, it wasn't any quicker, but it was a lot cheaper than having to buy butter and milk.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 So we eat macaroni and cheese, get blazed 420, watch Pokemon as it was airing.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 We didn't have Netflix back then. You had to wait until 3pm, you'd smoke, watch Pokemon.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I thought it was the most beautiful world possible that I could live in.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So Pokemon has always had a place in my heart. Not so much that I actually care to collect the cards or anything like that.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 If you do, that's fine, but it's always had a place in my heart. It's always been this idealistic world for me.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Walking and conflict put together.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So anyways, that's where I'm coming from with the Pokemon thing.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So when I was investigating this Pokemon stuff, I kept running into these bizarre rabbit holes when I was looking into this.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Right now, Kyle Hughes pull us into this parking lot here in Wyoming.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's the poor man's Walmart. It's the Arby's of retailers. It's a target.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 The reason why we're at Target stores to start off our Pokemon story is a recent news event happened.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And I actually got this recommendation from my good friend Sabine, May 14th, 2021.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 A fight broke out in Wyoming over trading cards.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Guy had bought in some packs of upper decks. One pack actually, I have to say, but we'll get into that in a second.

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Guy buys one pack of upper deck trading cards and he's walking down his car and he's like, "Oh, Johnny Slugger. He's the best player."

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And Jerry First Basement. Oh yeah, he's my favorite. Oddly enough, he's an outfielder and he's going through these cards and four dudes run up on him and they try taking these cards and a fight breaks out.

75
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So our hero, the guy who'd bought the cards, has a concealed weapons permit. He pulls a gun out, "Get back, robbers!"

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And they ran away, which is the best thing to do when someone pulls a gun on you, especially if you're the bad guy.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 The police show up, the four wannabe thieves were arrested. Local crime story over some baseball cards.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 But it turns out this was the needle that broke the camel's back because Target goes, "Nope, we are banning the sale of all trading cards in our stores, including Pokemon."

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So you can't buy football cards, baseball cards, Pokemon cards. I'm assuming magic cards either, they're banned from the stores.

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And I was like, "What? That doesn't make any sense." I've been trying to wrap my head around this. I did a little bit of research on it and previously, Target was having such a problem with people fighting over trading cards, not to this extent, but people arguing over trading cards.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 They limited them to one pack a day. How am I supposed to catch them all if I can only buy one pack a day that doesn't make any sense?

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So now they've banned them in the stores and it's, I heard that story, I didn't believe it. I checked it out. It's true.

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 They're banning the sales of these cards. It doesn't make sense. So my conspiracy part of my brain is working because Target sells hard liquor.

84
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You're telling me that a pack of Pokemon cards causes more real-world violence than Jack Daniels?

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It didn't wash. It didn't make sense. There has to be another reason. But I couldn't figure it out. I couldn't figure it out.

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And as I was looking into it, another Pokemon story popped up.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And this is where I'm talking about. We're going down these rabbit holes. Kyle Hughes, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys of the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 We're leaving behind this dude getting mugged in the Target parking lot. That's what you get for shopping at Target.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 We're leaving behind Target. We are headed out to Canada, I think.

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Kyle Hughes is like striking his shoulders. I'm like, it's really hard for me to determine where this story starts.

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 We're going to be going to some wacky places, not necessarily country-wise, but mentally.

92
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Because I've been through this website quite a lot. I think they talk a lot about American politics. They talk a lot about American conspiracy theories.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 But I think the person is from Canada. I'm not for sure. I don't even know. I'm really trying to figure out how to prepare this story for you guys.

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So, Sabine told me about that Pokemon story. I was on the X-board. There was a Pokemon post. I was like, "Don't. Maybe I can tie it in.

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Maybe I'll have a little local news story and then something else Pokemon related." There's no way I'm going to make a whole episode about it, right?

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Little Jason, if I could have held you a couple days ago and said, "Stop researching. Stop researching."

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Things would have been so much better. There's a website called RumorMill News, which has the best slogan I've ever heard for a news organization.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Washington Post, Democracy Dies in Darkness, The New York Times, all the news that's fit to print.

99
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 RumorMill News, politically incorrect news, stranger than fiction, usually true.

100
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I've never heard of a news organization, even a conspiracy website, go, "Listen, it's a great website, but some of this stuff's fake."

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It's usually true, but some of it's fake. And in this website, we meet Rogue Butterfly, aka Janna.

102
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 This is a bizarre website. It is a news website, "conspirational news." But people can also submit...

103
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Imagine a news website that is also a forum. I cannot wrap my head around how this works, but people will write articles,

104
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and then when you respond to it, that becomes its own article.

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So anyway, I'm not going to worry about how it's HTML-programmed, and trust me, it's HTML-programmed.

106
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 This is a basic website. I was looking at articles back from 2001. It's still in operation today.

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You can donate money to keep their operation going through check or money orders.

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 That's how old this whole site was set up. But anyways, there's this discussion going on.

109
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 We're back in the year 2001, April of 2001. People have no idea what's coming a couple months from now.

110
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 The biggest worry they have is Pokemon. There's this discussion going on about Pokemon, whether or not it's Satanic and it's bad for children.

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And I wanted to start off with this portion of it. Sane Grow writes this article, and he says, "I used to have this short MPEG of part of the introduction of an episode."

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And this is how he described it. He said it reminded him of Child Malestation, and I was like, "What?

113
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I don't remember that. I don't remember that even being hinted at in any episode of Pokemon, let alone the intro."

114
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 But this is what he says. He goes, "I used to have this short little MPEG video. It had a little girl standing there, and she's running towards the viewer."

115
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And then you see a chipmunk type character, and I was like, "What?"

116
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Chipmunk type character run between her legs, and its tail brushes her crotch, and she closes her legs, and she kind of blushes and turns away.

117
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And then it cuts to four adults staring at the camera. There's a nurse, there's a policeman, there's a doctor, and there's a housewife, and they all look at the camera and they kind of nod at the same time.

118
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And I go, "What is this dude smoking?" And I was like, "There's no way. This guy must have made this movie on Digimon.

119
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 This type of perversion may be on Digimon, but Pokemon no way." As I was describing that, I'm sure a lot of you were like, "Oh dude, yeah, he's totally talking about that part. It is real."

120
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 There is a part of the original Pokemon opening where that happens, and it cuts to the four adults kind of doing this weird nod right after it hits exactly like he described it.

121
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Now do I think that Pokemon was encouraging girls to have squirrels run-- It was Pokemon, by the way, a chipmunk type character's Pikachu.

122
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 I don't think the Pokemon show was being subversive. I don't think-- It does happen, but I don't believe it's intentionally supposed to be perverted.

123
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 I don't think it's supposed to have any hidden meaning. On the other hand, it-- I mean, it is what he described, right? It is what he described. It's exactly how he described it, so--

124
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 But I just don't think so. I think if anything, it was an error. It could have been some weird perverted thing that the animator snuck in. It is a very frantic opening. I never noticed it before.

125
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But when you're going to crucify something, you tend to want more information from it. And I will say so myself as well. Before I wanted to really go off on these wingnuts,

126
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 we're talking about Pokemon, I wanted to do more research as well. Now again, if I had a time machine, if I had an alcohol-powered time machine,

127
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 like yesterday's episode, I would have gone back in time and been like, "Just do that story, bro. Stop researching."

128
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Kyle Hughes, let's go ahead and hop on the hair hang glider. We're leaving behind where we just were somewhere in Canada, and we're flying further into Canada.

129
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 This time I do specifically know where we're going. We're going to British Columbia. And this is where we're going to meet Rogue Butterfly, but signs their post, "Johnna?" or "Jaina?"

130
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So let's look at one of Rogue Butterfly's posts, and this is really what kicked off the whole anti-Pokemon thing on the Rumour Mill News website.

131
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 It starts off insane, and I'm going to need your guys' help in the YouTube comments. Help me figure this out. She says she has a relative.

132
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 I know what relatives are. I know what relatives are. She says she has a relative. It's an eight-year-old boy. His uncle is her son.

133
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So that would make him the grandson, correct? His uncle, the boy's uncle, is Rogue Butterfly's son.

134
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 But she either refers to him as a relative or grandson in quotes. She's constantly calling, "Imagine that. Imagine that. Grandma comes. Come here, grandson."

135
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 She always refers to him in quotes, so I can't figure that out. His uncle is her son, so I literally, like, it's like a brain teaser.

136
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I don't get it, but anyways, we'll assume it's her grandson in air quotes, because that's how she'll call him.

137
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Eight-year-old boy. Rogue Butterfly gets a call from this eight-year-old boy. Well, we're going to call him Barry.

138
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Gets a call from Barry's mom and says, "I have to go take care of some stuff. Will you watch my kids?"

139
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Now, Rogue Butterfly has no problem putting people on blast. In this article that she's about to talk about, Barry and his love for Pokemon,

140
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 she mentions that the mother is a chronic alcoholic. She goes, "Yeah, she had to go to an AA meeting, so she called me to watch her kids."

141
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 That's what we call superfluous details. It has nothing to do with the story. We get it. You hate Barry's mom.

142
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 You don't have to out her. It's alcoholic's anonymous, dude. You don't have to put her on blast. At least she's trying.

143
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 But anyways, Rogue Butterfly, who's a grandmother who should be taking care of these kids, goes to visit Barry and his little sister.

144
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Now, anyone who's been around kids knows that they love to share stuff. These things are so important in their lives.

145
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 They want to show you their Star Wars collection or their Ninja Turtle collection or whatever kids are collecting today.

146
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 COVID variants. They want to show this stuff to you. He's super excited. This is back in 2001.

147
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He's super excited about his Pokemon cards. He brings out his whole collection and he's showing grandma the cards.

148
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I can imagine. He's rolling her eyes the whole time. This is her first exposure to Pokemon.

149
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 He's like, "Yeah, and this guy and this guy, and this guy's Needle Point and this guy's Pokebot and this guy and that."

150
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And she's just like, "Just taking it in. You just engage the kid, right? The kid just wants attention. They want to show how excited this stuff."

151
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 They want you to be excited about this stuff. That's all it is.

152
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 She is so put off by this, but she is also very curious because he's so into Pokemon.

153
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 She thinks there might be something more to it. Something satanic.

154
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So when he says the show comes on, you can watch it at 3.30pm tomorrow.

155
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 She actually goes back to visit him at that time. She wants to see what this Pokemon is all about.

156
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And she is immediately disturbed by the show. First off, she doesn't like the fact that things are evolving.

157
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 That's her first big takeaway. Stuff evolves? I don't know about that.

158
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Secondly, they talk about trainers, these people training animals. You know what else is trained? The Illuminati trains humans.

159
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 They talk about owners. People own these things. You know what else owns stuff? The Illuminati owning humans.

160
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And worst of all, they teach these kids that things procreate because they have Pokemon breeders.

161
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And that worries her as well. Her little 8 year old grandson, who she can barely stand his mother,

162
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 is learning about breeding and evolution and stuff being owned and stuff being trained.

163
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And she said the show was so fast paced. This is a quote from it.

164
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 "The pace is supersonic. The dialogue at times sounds exactly like Japanese."

165
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And when the young boy talked about it at times, I thought he was speaking Japanese.

166
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 She despises this show. She's afraid that this show is warping the mind of her young 8 year old grandson

167
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 who she just refers to as a relative. She's afraid he's going to lose his mind to the dark one.

168
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 She warns us about this quote. "Your television set is your own private satanic altar right in your own home.

169
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 You allow your children to be psychically molested right there in your own living room with your blessing."

170
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And I bet you even lock your doors at night. Fools!

171
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You're letting the fox guard the hen house. I'm sorry. She actually didn't say that.

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 She said you're letting the fox guard the chicken house. I've never heard that phrase before.

173
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's the same thing. It just doesn't roll off the tongue. Wake up, wake up, wake up.

174
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You're living on the mean planet and you best not forget it."

175
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 So that's her mindset. That's her mindset.

176
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Pokemon is wrong. It's a satanic altar. If you're going to watch Pokemon, you should leave your front door unlocked, apparently.

177
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And chicken house. Chicken house is a thing. A weird but not unusual take on Pokemon.

178
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 I think everyone has a story. They've either read about something like this, they've read about people who believe this,

179
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 or experienced it for themselves back in the day.

180
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now we're going to fast forward in time.

181
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And Rogue Butterfly. She lives in this little trailer by the lake. She's very off the grid.

182
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And the mother is raging alcoholic. She goes in this article as well. This is a separate article.

183
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 She once again goes into this woman who's an alcoholic and she's a no good welfare recipient and all this stuff.

184
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And the mother's out doing the drinking and the being poor. The little sister is visiting the dad.

185
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And so the boy has nowhere to go. So she says, "Let the boy, let's Barry hang out with me for a while."

186
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 So Barry goes out to stay with her and there's no television. There's no Pokemon cards.

187
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 They have a great vacation. They go hiking. They go boating. They walk along the lakeside beach.

188
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 But a few days into the vacation, Barry's sitting there and he tells his grandmother this story.

189
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That once him and his buddies called a 1-800-Pokemon number.

190
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And when they called this number, someone answered and said, "You've been selected to be tested by the Pokemon crew."

191
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I don't know if they actually called themselves a Pokemon crew. The Poke crew.

192
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 But what you have to do is you have to go to your local elementary school at 6pm and wait on the steps.

193
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 We'll know it's you. The grandma's sitting there and she's hearing her 8-year-old son tell this story.

194
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 She's concerned. Barry continues as the arrived date approached.

195
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 6pm for an 8-year-old kid. You're not supposed to be out that late. They all sneak out of their respective houses.

196
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Make their way down to the local elementary school. We waited there for a while until a van approached.

197
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It truly was a Poke van.

198
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 All of the windows were covered up with Pokemon posters. I tried looking inside but I couldn't.

199
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 The entire car was covered in Pokemon posters. Two adult men got out.

200
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 They began testing the boys. They didn't know what the testing entails.

201
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Then one of the men keeps talking on a walkie-talkie. Someone is in the van the whole time.

202
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Eventually they decide that Barry has passed the test and he's won the best prize of all.

203
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 The back of the van opens up and outsteps Professor Oak.

204
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 If you don't know anything about Pokemon, Professor Oak is one of the characters from Pokemon.

205
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He's a fictional cartoon character in the show. Rogue Butterfly doesn't know who Professor Oak is.

206
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Who's Professor Oak? Barry goes he's one of the characters from Pokemon.

207
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 The van opened up and outsteps Professor Oak. He's the guy who does the Poke decks and helps Ash on all of his adventures.

208
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 He was in the van, Grandma. Professor Oak was in the van and he gave me Pokemon posters.

209
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Then we won these prizes and we walked home.

210
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Now remember, kids love to talk and we should listen to them because it helps build their little brain cells.

211
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 They also love to lie. I don't know if it's that they so much have a need to lie or they're lying on accident.

212
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 I think there's different age ranges but sometimes I think they don't know that they're lying, that they're actually getting facts mixed up.

213
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 But there is nothing about this story that rings true. A van covered in posters. No windshield at all.

214
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Just driving down the road covered in Pokemon posters. Paper flapping in the wind.

215
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Scotch tape barely holding them on when you're going 60 miles an hour down the road.

216
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make any sense that they called this 1-800 Pokemon number that they'd want to meet them at a school.

217
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Now as a conspiracy theorist, you can go maybe it's some sort of government conspiracy.

218
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Sure, Professor Oak, Professor Oak, a cartoon character is in the back of a van.

219
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 It doesn't make any sense at all and that is where you would say to this kid, you go, "That's a really interesting story."

220
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And you might keep it in the back of your head. You honestly might in the back of your head go, "Hmm, my grandson may have interacted with some adults he shouldn't have interacted with."

221
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 That would be my take away from that. I wouldn't believe that there was actual fictional character in the back of this van or the van was covered in Pokemon stuff.

222
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Or really much, I would be very concerned that my grandson, air quotes or not, may be talking to adults that he shouldn't be talking to.

223
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And I would follow up on that.

224
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 What was the number you called? Well, my friend called it, "Oh, well then can we talk to your friend and then be like, "Hey, do you know anything about these kids sneaking out?"

225
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And if they're like, "What? No, no, Billy, he never snuck out that night. Is there a shift from side to side to have a ton of Pokemon memorabilia?"

226
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 They're like, "No, so then you would know he was lying."

227
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 That would be my take away. This is Rogue Butterfly's take away.

228
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Quote, "Needless to say I was alarmed. Men meeting with little boys at 6pm and at abandoned school.

229
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Strange men testing children without their parents' knowledge or permission."

230
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Both of those things is what I would think too. I'd be like, "What's going on?"

231
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And then she moves on to, and finally, a character from the cartoon series appearing in reality inside the van.

232
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 What is going on? That didn't happen. That's what's going on. He made that part up.

233
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But she honestly believes, because this 8-year-old boy said that Professor Oak was in the back of a van, that it happened.

234
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He's lying about that. But because her mentality, because Rogue Butterfly can't...

235
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 She herself is having a hard time determining what's real and what's fake, that when somebody else says that, she believes it.

236
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 She believes that there was a cartoon character in our world in the back of a van.

237
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Now you could say that about us. We talk about ghosts, we talk about aliens, we talk about sightings, monsters under the bed.

238
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 We talk about stuff that verges on childhood fears and then adult analytical thinking.

239
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 You'd be totally valid to say that. You'd go, "Why are you saying that she can't tell what's real and what's not?"

240
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 You're always talking about shadow people, you're always talking about punching grays in the stomach.

241
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 You and all this stuff. Guilty as charged. However, this is where the rabbit hole really begins.

242
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Professor Oak, a fictional character jumping out of the back of a van. That's just another day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

243
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Kyle Hughes, go ahead and call in that carpenter copter. We're leaving behind this little lake in British Columbia.

244
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 We are flying out to the deepest rabbit hole we've covered on this show.

245
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 [imitates rabbit hole]

246
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I don't know if I already thanked the Anon for posting the rumor mill news on the X-Board. Really appreciate it.

247
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I would have not come across this story otherwise.

248
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 On the website Rumour Mill News, it's a standard website. It's super old. They have a thing, our founders. Meet the founders.

249
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 When you look at the founders, it shows that the website was founded by Gunther and Raelyn Rusbacher.

250
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And originally it wasn't a website. It was a magazine. It was a magazine that covered the same stories.

251
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 However, they stopped publishing when Gunther went missing. I was like, "What?"

252
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I'm continuing to read this bio and it says, "Gunther went missing because he had to disappear. The government was trying to kill him.

253
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 The government arrested him and tried murdering him. Murdered his lawyer. The government had his kids arrested and threatened with gang rape and prison.

254
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And Raelyn, his wife, was arrested.

255
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And all these people were going to be murdered in prison unless Gunther pled guilty to some trumped up charges.

256
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 This is about the founders' base, right? I imagine some puff piece or a nice photo of them. There is a nice photo of them.

257
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 There's also a photo of a bloody set of hands with no fingernails.

258
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And they said, "This happened to Gunther in prison. Apparently he was cooking something in the chef area.

259
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 So what's it called? A kitchen?" And boiling water fell all over his hands and there's this disgusting photo.

260
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 This is the "about the founders" section. There's a photo. I don't know whose hands they are. They're probably Gunther's.

261
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 There's a photo of these red, swollen, disgusting Hepatitis A infested hands.

262
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 It says they have hepatitis C. And there's no fingernails. It was so hot.

263
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 It melted off his fingernails, which means somebody probably ate fingernails in their soup that day.

264
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 What in the world is this about?

265
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Gang... this guy's sons are in prison about to get gang raped unless he confesses? To what? Why is he... why is any of this stuff going on?

266
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I just wanted to read a Pokemon, dude.

267
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I'm reading this thing and I'm thinking, "Okay, this is nuts. This is absolutely nuts."

268
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Like, "Professor O'Coppin out of the back of a van?" I'm like, "Dude, whatever. Like, you could have the whole crew back there. Team Rocket could be hanging out."

269
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I'm not... you guys are not interesting. You guys are not as interesting as bloody hands with no fingertips in the "Learn More About Us" page.

270
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 The reason why all this stuff was happening... I mean, we know why his hands were melted, because he was messing around with pot soup.

271
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But the reason why his family was being threatened, the reason why he was in prison, was because he was a CIA operative.

272
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 This Gunther Rossbacher guy was a CIA operative.

273
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 CIA, if you're listening to this episode, let me finish. Let me finish before you kick down my door. Let me finish.

274
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 He was a CIA operative and he actually was a pilot who flew George H.W. Bush to and from Iran during the October surprise.

275
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 This is a hardcore boomer conspiracy theory that turned out to be correct. I think.

276
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I'm pretty sure this was one of the conspiracy theories that was proven.

277
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 What happened was Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were running for office back in the 1979-1980 election.

278
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And the country of Iran had some American hostages. And the conspiracy theory, and I'm pretty sure that this is true,

279
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 the conspiracy theory is that George H.W. Bush, or just elements of the U.S. government, asked Iran to hold the hostages until after the election.

280
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Because if they were released early, then it would give Jimmy Carter a boost.

281
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 What happened was Reagan won the election, the hostages were released shortly afterwards, and that's where the conspiracy theory came from.

282
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 But I'm pretty sure that it turned out that... I could be wrong, maybe that is still a conspiracy theory.

283
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 That is a bit before my time. I was four years old when all that happened.

284
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 But he says that he actually flew George H.W. Bush out there. He was the personal pilot.

285
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 So the reason why they were going to throw him in prison was because now we're in the year 1990s when that still would have been a topic of discussion nowadays.

286
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 It's a quaint conspiracy theory. We're talking about 9/11 was an inside job.

287
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Stuff like that. October surprise is barely memorable at this point.

288
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 But they were going to throw him in prison unless he kept his mouth shut.

289
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 See, he was telling people about this. They were running this magazine, Rumour Mill News, doing all this conspiracy stuff, and CIS said, "Shut your trap!"

290
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Or...

291
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 That's his story. That's Raylan's story of why he was in prison.

292
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Or, here's the story of every other law enforcement agency in the United States.

293
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 He was a massive con man.

294
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Gunther was a huge con man. When I saw that he disappeared and Raylan was making these accusations, I just put his name in a Google.

295
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And I expected to find nothing. I honestly expected for it to just be a couple of links back to the website and figured this was just some mythology she had crafted.

296
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 No. Several articles popped up about this guy.

297
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 In actual newspapers, Chicago Tribune did a huge write up on him. The St. Louis reporter did a huge write up on him.

298
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 He is a very, very well known figure, not necessarily in the conspiracy community, but in law enforcement.

299
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And they say he's just a con man. That's almost an understatement. This guy, he was an immigrant from Austria.

300
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 He came over to the United States, he signed up for the military, started wearing Captain clothes and giving people orders, and they're like, "Dude, you can't do that."

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And they would either catch him or they wouldn't. But he learned really quick, like he would just go away wall and they'd go arrest him.

302
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 He'd turn around and he'd be wearing a Captain's uniform. They're like, "Ah."

303
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 He learned really quickly about social engineering. You just hack people by appearing as a superior.

304
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And so for almost his entire adult life, he would show up in military bases, wearing military uniforms he bought at surplus stores, and just go onto the base.

305
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 The odd thing is, that was his end game. At one base, he just went there and slept.

306
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 He goes, "Oh, can I have a key to the VIP quarters? I'm obviously a major general."

307
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And they're like, "Oh, you are, sir." So they gave him a key and he spent the night there. That was it.

308
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 He wasn't stealing secrets for the Austrian government. He wasn't even stealing donuts for himself. It was like a power trip for him.

309
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 He went to an airport and said he was an ambassador or he said he was on some sort of secret mission, CIA, whatever it was.

310
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 They gave him a Learjet and he flew it to another airport and they just like drove away.

311
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 So he was doing it for the kicks and he was married to Ray Lin.

312
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And he was telling her these lies constantly. "I'm in the CIA. I was part of this October surprise thing."

313
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And he would show up at a military base with her. He goes, "I'm going to be undercover. I'm going to be using a different name and I'm going to say I'm a general."

314
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 But this is part of my CIA training. So even she had visited bases.

315
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 So of course that would make her think he was telling the truth.

316
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 But when he's arrested and the cops are saying, "No, ma'am, he's not a CIA agent. He's actually a con man.

317
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 He's been doing this for years. He actually has a rap sheet. We can show that he has been caught doing this thing and that thing."

318
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 The reason why he got caught was actually his dumbest fraud. It was money.

319
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 He pretended he was a stockbroker and was stealing people's money.

320
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Now you can pretend you're in the military. Actually, you can't. That's a crime. It's called stolen valor.

321
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 But those were all kind of just harmless power trips and it would make the military look really dumb.

322
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And actually that was one of the reasons why they weren't really investigating it.

323
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Because they'd have to admit that a civilian was just walking on and off bases and flying planes around.

324
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 So they were investigating it but they weren't making it to the Republic.

325
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 But when you're ripping people off, those people are going to complain.

326
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 So he actually got charged and sentenced to 21 years in prison for impersonating a stockbroker and stealing their money and all that stuff.

327
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And you go, "Well Jason, that seems pretty harsh for that. I actually don't know what the crime..."

328
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I can't imagine the crime, whatever he committed financially, would add up to 21 years.

329
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 So then you start to think, "Is there something else going on here? Was he a CIA agent?"

330
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Well apparently, they will not confirm or deny that this guy was ever an agent.

331
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 And I think that's a CIA thing in general.

332
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 So you could start telling people you're a C-

333
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Don't, don't, because technically the crime is impersonating a federal officer.

334
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 But I think if you told people you were in the CIA, they won't confirm or deny it.

335
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I could be wrong on that. Do not take legal advice from this show.

336
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 But the CIA would not answer whether or not this guy was actually an agent of theirs.

337
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And what's interesting is that in this article for the Chicago Tribune,

338
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 the reporter asked, "How old is he? What's his birthday?"

339
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 The FBI and NIS, which is the immigration law enforcement wing, they said he has several.

340
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 We don't know what his birthday is. We have no idea how old this guy is.

341
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 The reporter also asked to interview him in prison and the prison official said, "Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

342
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 You cannot talk to this guy." Why not?

343
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Because he will tell you...

344
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 They basically said he'll tell you whatever you want to hear, but between the lines it was basically like,

345
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 "If you listen to this guy, you will help him break out of prison."

346
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 He is such an amazing liar that we can't even let him talk to you.

347
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 When he's in prison, Ray Lin is still trying to spread the word about her husband's plight.

348
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Yeah, they say that he was a stockbroker, imitating a stockbroker.

349
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 She's actually a CIA agent trying to shut him up. So what does she do? She actually goes to the media.

350
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 She is...she already has her own website, the rumor mill news. That's usually true.

351
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But she does a radio interview at 2 AM.

352
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 So we know it's like some late night conspiracy radio show, right? Who else is broadcasting at 2 AM?

353
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 She does this radio interview.

354
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 And she's leaving the parking lot that night. It's just her car.

355
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 [imitates car engine]

356
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Apparently it sounds like a dirt bike. She's driving her car down the road.

357
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 And she's thinking about what she just said on national radio.

358
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 She charged the president of the United States with treason.

359
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Because this was a man who actually was trying to help society, expose the October surprise.

360
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Which all of you guys are just kind of shrugging your shoulders.

361
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 You're like, "Really? People were killed and imprisoned over this conspiracy theory? I didn't know anything about?"

362
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Yes. According to Raylin and Gunther.

363
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 She's driving away from the radio station and a car starts driving behind her.

364
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 [imitates car engine]

365
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Pokemon poster's all over it. No. This is the place way before that.

366
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 This car is driving behind her and she's scared.

367
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 She's afraid she's going to get run off the road because she just publicly stated the truth.

368
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 The car catches up to her and is trying to run her off the road.

369
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Oh no! She hears a voice in her head.

370
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 She hears the voice of her beloved Gunther say, "Don't be afraid. My seals will be with you."

371
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Here's a quote from our article.

372
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 "A burst of automatic weapons fire interrupted her concentration.

373
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 In the rear view mirror, she saw the van stopped in the middle of the empty freeway.

374
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Before she had time to think, an explosion rocked her car.

375
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 She looked again. The van was in flames.

376
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 [sounds of car engine]

377
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 That didn't happen. That didn't happen, right?

378
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 So this is what's interesting about this story is that we have this guy.

379
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 He says he's in the CIA.

380
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Then it turns out that he's most likely this con man. He's been doing it for 30, 40.

381
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Who knows how many years we don't know how old this guy is.

382
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And then we have Raylin tell him the story that she's at 2 a.m. at some local radio station

383
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 saying the president's a bad person. People say that today on Twitter.

384
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 People say that all the time.

385
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 People have publicly been accusing presidents of sins real and imagined since the office of president existed.

386
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 But no, these people are going to show up in a car, try to run her off the road,

387
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and at the same time the Navy SEAL, they're a little late by the way.

388
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 They let her car get rammed three or four times.

389
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 If she was not as good as a driver, she could have been ran off the road in the first bump.

390
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 The Navy SEALs blow up a van.

391
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And my question is, and then what? Did she park and she get out and she think the Navy SEALs

392
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 and say, "Hey, can you guys help me get home?"

393
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 You know, there's other cars on the road. If I get in traffic jam, will you just blow them all up?

394
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Then what? If these Navy SEALs are sent here to protect her, shouldn't she at least introduce herself,

395
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 invite them in for coffee? No, the story just ends.

396
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Is this a hallucination? Is she lying herself?

397
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Has she been so wrapped up in the webs of Gunther that she can't determine the truth either?

398
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 That did not happen.

399
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Because here's the thing. If someone was after you enough to have a car try to run you off the road

400
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 as you were leaving a radio station, they're not going to let your website stay up all this time.

401
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 They're not going to let you collect checks and money orders to keep rumor mill news.

402
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 It would be down. It would be gone. Just like yesterday's episode about the guy who says he's abducted by reptilians,

403
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 and then he blasted all over the internet. These secrets would not get out.

404
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 If rumor mill news disappeared tomorrow, if Dead Rabbit Radio disappeared tomorrow,

405
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 there would be 20,000 people who would notice it was gone.

406
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Those are the people who listen to the show on a regular basis.

407
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And then, within months, it would be over. There might be some trickle out being like, "Dude, that was super weird,"

408
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 but the cover story would be Jason was out walking and car hit him, or Jason was out walking and Pokemon got him,

409
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 a dugger, dug a hole, and he fell into it.

410
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 And then a year from now, two years from now, no one would even remember it.

411
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 And if you wanted to make a concentrated effort, you could take me out and shut down the YouTube channel,

412
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 shut down the podcast, unless you had downloaded the files, unless they were on your hard drive, they're gone.

413
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 That's how easy it would be to cover this stuff up.

414
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 So I find it hard to believe that the government would have gone to phone call and been like, "Sir, plan A didn't work.

415
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 We tried running her off the road in a Toyota. Ah, well, just forget it.

416
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 We tried. We sent our best men in our best vehicle. Just forget it. Just let her do what she wants."

417
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 It doesn't make any sense. But here's another thing that doesn't make any sense.

418
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Gunther was sentenced to 21 years in prison for financial crimes, very well documented in mainstream news.

419
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 He serves three years and gets out.

420
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 What in the world is up with this story? Did he actually know something?

421
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 It's funny. I didn't know this was a thing. At one point, he called up the FBI and said, "I can help you get information about drug cartels,"

422
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 and then started lying to them, and the FBI was paying him money for quite a while.

423
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And then the FBI goes, "Wait a second. This information isn't real."

424
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 They stopped paying him. They didn't charge him with fraud. They didn't go after him.

425
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 He got paid by the FBI for lying to them by reading stuff out of books.

426
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Did he talk his way out of prison?

427
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Was he really connected?

428
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 He was sentenced to 21 years doing 10.

429
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Sentenced to 21 years and doing three? And he's out.

430
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 He's out. He's reunited with Raylin. They go to Austria. They go to his homeland of Austria.

431
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 It turns out that he's descended from Austrian royalty, of course.

432
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 He's descended from Austrian royalty.

433
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And this episode's going along, but I never want to talk about these people again.

434
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 I never want to go back to this website. I never want to even think about this episode again.

435
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 There's so many rabbit holes.

436
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Not only is he descended from the royal bloodline of Austria,

437
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 but the royal bloodline of Austria is from outer space.

438
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Okay?

439
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 So he tells Raylin this, and Raylin tells us this story, about there's another planet

440
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 where the, where it's all Austrians. It's a planet full of Austrian spirits.

441
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 And what happens is they want to come to Earth and learn how to be good souls.

442
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 But you can't come directly to Earth because there's a planetary...

443
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Remember this all started off with Pokemon? Just remember that. This is where we're at now.

444
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Raylin said that there's a planetary federation that actually blocks new souls from coming into Earth,

445
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 and Austrians really want to experience life in Austria.

446
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Outer space Austrians want to be Earth Austrians.

447
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 They have to go to the moon in what's known as a soul collector.

448
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 This soul collector is on the far side of the moon,

449
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 and it sucks up the Austrians from outer space and then shoots them into Austria.

450
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 And then when you die, well, let me back up here.

451
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Technically, before you die, so Gunther at some point is going to have to do this.

452
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 I told Raylin this with a straight face. I can barely talk about it on this podcast.

453
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 Gunther tells Raylin that before I die, this is what's going to happen.

454
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 I'm going to travel to the Great Pyramids of Egypt.

455
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Inside the Great Pyramids, there is a brine.

456
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 There is a mineral brine that I have to lay inside.

457
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 There's like a sarcophagi full of juice, and I'm going to lay inside of it.

458
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Why isn't she not asking questions? Why isn't she asking basic questions?

459
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Like, take me there? Can I at least see this place?

460
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 She believes him so wholeheartedly.

461
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 There's a brine in ancient Egypt. It's here today.

462
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 That Austrians sleep in. It's very multicultural at least.

463
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 This mythology crosses all generations and all cultures.

464
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You sleep in this mineral brine that's inside of the pyramids.

465
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Those pyramids were built so Austrians, you didn't know this, you learned a bunch about history,

466
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 the pyramids were built by Egyptians so Austrians could fly back and forth to the moon.

467
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 When you lay in the brine, then you die.

468
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Your soul then goes into a reverse soul collector to the moon,

469
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 and then you go back to your Austrian home planet and outer space.

470
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 And the reason why we know about this story is there's a photo of a space shuttle taking off,

471
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 and there's this weird cone silhouette coming from the moon.

472
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 All this stuff's going to be in the show notes. God help you if you guys actually start looking into this.

473
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 And she writes this huge thing and she goes, "That's what a soul collector looks like."

474
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Fine, fair enough.

475
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 Right underneath that, though, she posts an article about what actually caused the optical illusion.

476
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 I go, "That is, it's obviously not a soul collector."

477
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 And you posted the reason why it's not a soul collector.

478
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 You posted a very detailed article from a mainstream news source underneath your article explaining what caused it.

479
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 Don't do that. If you are putting out usually true stuff,

480
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 don't immediately put stuff underneath it that makes it not true at all.

481
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 We knew it wasn't true. We knew it wasn't true, but don't put that in there.

482
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 She goes to Austria with Gunther after he's been released from prison.

483
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 They go to Austria. Let me read you this quote.

484
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 "They stated a Templar law." Of course, right? They just can't say it all the way in.

485
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 They actually have to go to the home of the Knights Templar.

486
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 "They stated a Templar lodge in Salzburg where she was tutored by members of the Habsburg royal family who were Templars."

487
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 She learned the truth about her lineage.

488
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 She was told why the Knights Templars went to the Holy Lands,

489
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 what they found, and why they have remained hidden for 800 years.

490
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 She doesn't share that information with us. By the way, she does not share that information.

491
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Okay, what is it? She just moves on to the next topic.

492
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 The same thing when she can just casually say, "I watched a van explode behind me."

493
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 She doesn't even say she went home and she was shook up and she had to take a shower or drink some coffee or something like that.

494
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Just the story ends, but that's not how stories happen in real life.

495
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 You find out what's your lineage? What were they doing in the Holy Land? Tell us!

496
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 You're rumor news! You're a conspiracy website.

497
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 That'd be the same thing with me going, "Dude, you guys won't believe it. The other day a ghost broke into my room and he told me the ultimate secret."

498
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Next up, a man eats his poop on meth. You're like, "Dude, the point of your show, the point of this website is to expose the truth."

499
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 She's exposing the truth on radio and people are trying to kill her. Tell us what? Tell us this stuff!

500
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 [sigh]

501
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 If it couldn't get any more insane, I want to share two more facts with you and then I'm never going back to this website.

502
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 They have a list of advertisers on the side, right? They have a list of advertisers.

503
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 At this point in the research, I'm clicking on almost every single link. I hate it when I do because then I find out about soul collectors.

504
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 I find out about exploding vans. I just wanted to read about Pokemon.

505
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 I'm clicking on all these links and I'm looking at these ads and a lot of the ads, they sell these necklaces that apparently give you special powers or cure you

506
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 or make sure your soul goes to Planet Austria. I'm not for sure.

507
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 But because it's flimflam stuff. It's flimflam. It's just these necklaces that they make, that they say heal you, give you energy, what have you.

508
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 They have a bunch of ads for that stuff. And then there's an ad that is either a placeholder ad, a money laundering scheme, a legitimate ad, which might actually be the most bizarre of them.

509
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 There's an ad for something called the African Family Film Company.

510
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 And I saw that. My first instinct, I'd spent a long time on this website. My first instinct was...

511
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 I actually don't think I had a first instinct. I think my brain shut up.

512
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 But then I thought, is this some sort of charity they're running? Is this some sort of thing where they're like, sure, we like to raise money for our website,

513
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 but we also like to help people in other countries. And that's 100% noble goal.

514
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 And I think they're gonna make fun of that. It seemed out of place after all of their fake crystals, stones, pendants, stuff like that.

515
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 Maybe they feel guilty for selling rocks for 25 bucks or 30 bucks or whatever they were. They want to help out.

516
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 The African Family Film Company is a real group. So this is the weirdest thing.

517
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 The African Family Film Company is what it's... I mean, at this point in my research, my mind was so boggled that it is exactly what it sounds like,

518
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 and it is not what I expected. It is a African Family Film Company is a company that sells African movies.

519
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 But not like End of the Wicked, not like narrative movies. There are 20-minute long documentaries about life in Africa.

520
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 And there's one of them called The Man Who Made a Bow. And it's a 27... It's a real movie. I looked up the trailer on YouTube.

521
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 It does not look interesting, even though it's real. I'm not saying... It's not Dead Ravre recommends.

522
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 It's about a guy who makes a talking bow, and it's all...

523
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 $27. 27... I saw the trailer. I saw everything I needed.

524
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 It's a real film company that sells movies about life in Africa, and I might add...

525
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 They're all from 1972. It's not like... I can watch a modern documentary or a modern movie about Africa,

526
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 but I don't want to watch it with that grainy old footage.

527
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 Why are they advertising on rumor mill news?

528
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 I don't think they have... I don't think you have a good Venn diagram between people who think Pokemon is Satanic,

529
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 and people who want to know about how to make an African bow. I could be wrong.

530
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 As I was researching the story, they were posting new articles. It's not all about Pokemon. They cover current conspiracy news.

531
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 I'm never going back. I'm never going back to this website.

532
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 But it's still in operation. Why are they advertising on this? I think it's a placeholder.

533
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 I can't imagine the African family film company spending more than 5 minutes on rumor mill news,

534
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 and wanting to... You know, this would be great. I think we'd sell a lot of talking bow videos to these people.

535
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 But it's on there. I don't get it. I don't get why African family film company...

536
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 I feel like it's a placeholder, but then why?

537
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
 Why is it a placeholder? Why the African family film company? I don't understand.

538
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 And we gotta wrap this up. I don't care how long this episode was, because I am never going back.

539
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Gunther and Raelyn are back together. He gets out of prison somehow.

540
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 Shocking. They go to Austria. I don't even know if that details true.

541
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 But he leaves her. After all she's been through, all the threats she's been having, all the hallucinators,

542
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 I'm sorry, all the real events of cars blowing up behind her, he leaves her.

543
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 He disappears. Once again, he disappears.

544
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Then he pops back up a couple years later. This Gunther character pops back up.

545
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 Remarried. Brand new life. And when Raelyn asks, "Hey, where have you been?" he looks at her and goes, "Huh? I don't remember you."

546
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 "We were married." I don't remember we were married.

547
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 And Raelyn just kind of walks away. I don't know, she could have stood there for a while and tried to convince him even more.

548
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 But so at this point, I don't even know if Gunther's still alive, but he lied to her so convincingly.

549
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 He convinced her that he doesn't remember they were never married. And she accepted that and moved on.

550
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 And apparently she's remarried. Her name is different than it used to be.

551
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 So even in the end, the lies continued.

552
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
 And now, rumor mill news is still around, but without Gunther's support, he's just a memory now.

553
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,000
 He's posted all over the R Founders page. His bloody swollen fingernailless hands right there and meet R Founders.

554
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 But it's run by Raelyn herself now. What a bizarre story. All I wanted to do was talk about Pokemon.

555
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:46,000
 I heard that they were banning Pokemon cards at Target and I find the story of a man who's such a convincing liar.

556
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 He could convince his own wife he didn't remember her. As well as, I guess that's the easiest thing to do.

557
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 Soul collectors and CIA operatives. Austrians are from another planet. Presidential hitman teams only consist of one vehicle and then that's it.

558
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 I just wanted to research Pokemon. Instead, we went down a rabbit hole and came face to face with the world's greatest liar.

559
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 Or is he? Because in a world where Professor Oak can exist in the back of a van, maybe all of his stories are true.

560
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,000
 Maybe all of us non-Austrians are doomed to just die in non-pyramids. We're just gonna die on the ground like poor slobs.

561
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 But those Austrians, man, they got it made. And sure, listen, I know some of you guys are probably jealous of Austrians right now, but you shouldn't be.

562
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
 Because they're boring. Think about these royal Austrians. They gotta be on their best behavior because their soul's eventually gonna be floating around space.

563
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 No one wants to hang around with a rude ghost. And you go to those big royal Habsburg parties with their nice velvet drapes and their goblets, their drinking stuff, but they're being polite.

564
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:04,000
 You can't actually fart on other people's food or give them wedgies. No, it's all proper stuff. It's all like proper pride and prejudice nonsense.

565
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
 Nobody wants that. That's lame. And can you imagine doing that for the rest of your life?

566
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 So I say Austria, Austria, you suck. You suck. No one wants to be like you guys, whether or not you guys are in another dimension floating around, hanging out on the moon, or even here on Earth.

567
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 Because of your fancy-dancy parties, that's boring. You know what I want to do? What I did. Sit on a couch, smoke weed, watch Pokemon, and eat Kraft macaroni and cheese with no butter or milk.

568
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 That's better than any immortal life. I had more fun in those few years than any Austrian ghost will have on some other planet.

569
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 Unless we're talking about Honor Schwarzenegger, he's also pretty cool as well. But other than that, Austria, you can suck it.

570
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 Dead Rabbit Radio- there's one weird dude. I went from Pokemon to exposing this guy who might be a liar. To all of a sudden, I'm racist. I'm not racist towards Austrians, by the way.

571
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:12,000
 It's the Habsburgs. It's like the popular Austrians. If you're like some poor Austrian dude, we can break bread. We can break macaroni and cheese all day long.

572
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 But if you're one of those rich, wealthy Austrians, say it with me now. Suck it.

573
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
