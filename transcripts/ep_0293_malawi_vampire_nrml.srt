1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
 A real life outbreak of werewolves in modern-day South America.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:13,320
 And then we travel to Malawat, a small country in Africa, where a spate of vampire attacks

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,920
 forces the citizens to take the law into their own hands today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:29,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,680
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,920
 Day 5 of Vampire Week, fifth episode recorded in one day.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
 I've never done this before.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,720
 I'm feeling it a bit.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,080
 I'm feeling it a bit.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,120
 I still have to go back and edit Monday's episode, so I'm not done yet.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,640
 But the sooner I can get all these episodes over, the sooner I can get back to my true

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
 passion, Minecraft.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,680
 Avoiding creepers deep under the earth.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,160
 You know, I've thought about this.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,200
 Get back to me and tell me if you guys think this is a good idea.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,480
 For the Patreon supporters, and I talked to Dan, Ash, and Carson about this last night.

19
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,280
 Again, this is a week for you guys.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,600
 But Patreon supporters, or people thinking about becoming Patreon supporters, would you

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,520
 be interested in having a private Minecraft server where we can all play Minecraft together?

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
 Let me know through email or comments or whatever.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But I think it'd be fun.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,920
 I'm just looking for an excuse to play more Minecraft.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,480
 I'm getting, I think I'm getting to the point where it's getting a little too boring, but

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,960
 um, yeah, I'm still playing it.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,840
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode here, so I can get to editing the first episode.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,040
 Now Mason Norbeck is the guy who sent me all these vampire links.

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,200
 And it's funny now that I've recorded the week's worth episode.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
 I think I only used like two of his ideas.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
 I saved the rest.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,960
 We may use those in the future, but I really appreciate the suggestions, Mason.

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
 Today's episode includes two of his suggestions, actually.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 And the first one, he declared as gross.

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
 Sent it to me anyways.

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,120
 Sent it to me anyways, but said it was gross.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,880
 I had actually read the article before he sent it to me.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,880
 So I had all my research done and I just plugged his little name into it.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
 And it was very, very easy to do.

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,920
 So this is a request by Mason.

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 That actually happens a lot.

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,480
 I'll have a story ready to go and someone will be like, "Hey, have you thought about

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 doing this?"

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,680
 Just throw them in there.

45
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,080
 So because I always appreciate hearing recommendations from you guys.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,960
 So we are going to Spain.

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,280
 We were just there earlier in the week for the Running of the Balls.

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
 And now we're back.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,760
 We were in Costa del Sol.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
 Actually, damn it.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,000
 I realized in the introduction I said, "This story took place in South America."

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
 It actually takes place in Spain.

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,160
 And I'm not going to edit that.

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,360
 So just retroactively think, "Well, technically Spain colonized South America."

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 So never mind.

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 There's no working around that.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
 Anyway, so Spain, Costa del Sol.

58
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,680
 So kids were having tummy aches.

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,880
 It's a totally true story, by the way.

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
 Tons of photos about this.

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,480
 Kids are like, "Oh, mommy, my tummy hurts.

62
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,640
 I was eating too much spicy food."

63
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,480
 And they're like, "I told you not to eat all those jalapenos."

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,560
 And he's like, "I know, but it's a stereotype.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,000
 I have to fulfill my stereotype."

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 She's like, "Drink some milk."

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,520
 And they're like, "Uh, maybe."

68
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
 But they're tummy hurts.

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
 So they're moms.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
 They're collective moms.

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
 Go get them.

72
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 Antacid.

73
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,640
 Specifically, home prosal.

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
 Home prosal.

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,160
 And I think that's either prilosec or one of the main ones is that's the ingredient.

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
 Home prosal.

77
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,560
 Kids are like, "Mmm, take the pill."

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
 They're like, "Mmm."

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,480
 Oh, they're starting jalapenos again.

80
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,080
 The mom's like, "No, stop eating it.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
 You're more than just the stereotype."

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,440
 They're like, "But am I mom?

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 Am I?"

84
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,800
 They're having existential crisis.

85
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,240
 They're eyeing that bowl of jalapeno.

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
 She's like, "Eat a peach."

87
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,120
 They're like, "Okay, I'll eat a peach."

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,240
 Kids are eating peaches now.

89
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
 Their stomach feels better.

90
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
 And then they wake up the next morning.

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,280
 I don't know if it's the next morning, but just for the sake of the story, they wake

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,720
 up the next morning and they're rubbing their eyes.

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,320
 They're like, "Mmm.

94
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
 So tired.

95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
 I don't know why I'm yawning.

96
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
 Say I'm tired."

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 It's morning.

98
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
 They're like, "Huey Lewis and the new songs play in.

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
 They're getting ready.

100
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
 They go to brush their teeth.

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,840
 They're doing everything they can possibly do without looking in the mirror."

102
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,160
 And then they look in the mirror and they're covered in hair.

103
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 They're like, "No."

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,760
 And they call their mom.

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,960
 They all have one mom.

106
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,160
 Again, it's the mom of the village.

107
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,760
 They're like, "Mom, mom, I think I'm turning into a dog."

108
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,880
 And she's like, "Yeah, it doesn't appear that way, son and/or daughter."

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,200
 So what happened was there was a tainted batch of this antacid medicine.

110
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,280
 It was mixed with monoxidil.

111
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,800
 So all the parietal is for its tummy aches.

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,400
 And monoxidil is for people with alopecia, so hair loss.

113
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,440
 So these kids were getting this rapid hair growth all over their body.

114
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,800
 16 kids in Spain basically became werewolves because they had a tummy ache.

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
 And it was kind of unclear.

116
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,800
 They said if they stopped taking the medicine, which I'm sure they would, they're not gonna

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,720
 be like, "Mmm, furry or stomach ache?"

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,640
 Just stop eating spicy food for a day, guys.

119
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,360
 If they stopped taking the medicine, they'd stop growing the hair.

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
 But it was unclear.

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,400
 I don't think their hair just would fall off.

122
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,600
 I think they would still have to shave their face and their entire body because they would

123
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,240
 look like little puppy people.

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
 They looked like dogs.

125
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,840
 Now I know what you guys are thinking.

126
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,120
 You're like, "Hey, where can I get myself some of this tainted stuff?"

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,000
 I want to be furry too.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,040
 Unfortunately, it only works on children.

129
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,320
 So if you have a desire to become a werewolf or just look like one or have a great Halloween

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,840
 costume, that'd be dope.

131
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,800
 You walk into the party and you're like, "Hey guys, what's up?"

132
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,840
 You're like, "Dude, that's a great Teen Wolf costume."

133
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,640
 You're like, "Yeah, it's pretty good."

134
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,840
 You have any spicy food I can eat because trust me, I can eat anything now.

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
 It doesn't work on adults though.

136
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 It only works on kids.

137
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,040
 However, you can make your kids take it and they become all furry.

138
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
 You're like, "Look at me.

139
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,680
 I got Ewoks for Halloween."

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,400
 They're like, "Dad, please.

141
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
 I want to go back to school.

142
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
 I'm tired of looking like this."

143
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
 Shut up.

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,480
 You stopped taking it November 1st.

145
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,840
 So yeah, werewolf story.

146
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
 Thank you, Mason.

147
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,560
 The little kids turned into werewolves.

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
 That's hilarious.

149
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,000
 It's adorable too.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 You should see the photos.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,640
 I mean, yeah, they're probably quite miserable, but they're little puppy people.

152
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,920
 Little puppy people.

153
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
 Here's a new segment.

154
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
 I'm never going to do this again.

155
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,120
 I'm just doing it because it's Friday and this is my fifth episode recorded in a row.

156
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,000
 Today's segment, and feel free to skip ahead five minutes.

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,360
 Today's segment is Jason pitches a movie to an audience who has no power to make said

158
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
 movie.

159
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760
 It's a great segment, but it'll only be done once.

160
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,880
 The year is 2080.

161
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,640
 Long time in the future, right?

162
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,920
 And all the cars are self-driving.

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,560
 It's a beautiful, shining city.

164
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,280
 Like these cars are like, it's like a row of cars perfectly ordered coming through town.

165
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,520
 The roads are all like robotic censored and stuff.

166
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,760
 C3PO Street.

167
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,040
 All the automated cars are coming down the road.

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,320
 Perfect orderly society.

169
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 Everyone's just waking up to go to work.

170
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,360
 Everyone's wearing like shiny, shiny clothes.

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,680
 They look like the future from Minority Report mixed with the future from Demolition Man.

172
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,280
 They're just a really like bright future.

173
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,160
 You're like, didn't a bunch of people die in those movies?

174
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 I'm just talking about the Asiatic.

176
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 Asiatic?

177
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
 Whatever.

178
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
 It looks nice.

179
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,720
 And as these cars are doing their commute down this automated road, you're like, Jason,

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
 just tell a goat story.

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,160
 As these cars are doing their commute down an automated road.

182
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,640
 A monster truck.

183
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,600
 Flattens a bunch of cars.

184
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,440
 Just running off the roads.

185
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,320
 Now the police cars are also like self-driving.

186
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,920
 The cops are just sitting in the back seat and they're like, go, car, go.

187
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,240
 But then the road like shifts so the cop car can get to where it's going.

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,920
 But it's still like on an automated road.

189
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,680
 It has no off-road capability.

190
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,520
 While they're watching this big, big monster truck with these giant wheels, just jump over

191
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,480
 the roads and smash cars.

192
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
 He gets in front of a bank.

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,800
 A bunch of people come out with guns, kick in the door, steal the money.

194
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,640
 And while the cops are still trying to get their automated car there, big truck goes

195
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
 off.

196
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,040
 And then they're back in the police precinct and the sheriff.

197
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
 Not the sheriff.

198
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,840
 The police chief is like, this is the third big wheel monster truck robbery this week.

199
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,480
 They've got to stop these guys and they're like, but sir, all the roads are automated.

200
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,440
 Like we don't know how to make our cars.

201
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 Do that.

202
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,000
 That's like old technology.

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,840
 That technology was made illegal like 50 years ago when they had all these greenhouse emission

204
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,960
 gas policies passed.

205
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,440
 You put a little political thing in there.

206
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,120
 They're like, yeah, I remember when that president took over and he made us get rid

207
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
 of like cow farts or whatever.

208
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,480
 And they're like, yeah, yeah, I know.

209
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,800
 So they had to get rid of all the vehicles.

210
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,920
 So that's why it's this beautiful, like green, everything's solar powered, right?

211
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,360
 You get a little bit of political subtext in there.

212
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,960
 So anyways, you know, or, or not, I don't care, whatever backstory, cars are illegal.

213
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,880
 Everything is solar powered, little eight pod cars that are self controlled.

214
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,440
 Maybe people were getting too many traffic tickets, whatever.

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
 It doesn't matter.

216
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
 It doesn't matter.

217
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
 That's, that's for you guys to figure out.

218
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
 You're the producer.

219
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,120
 So anyways, they're like, we have to stop this monster truck.

220
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,840
 We can't, none of our cars can catch it.

221
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,040
 And then one of the young officers goes, wait a second, I think I have a plan.

222
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
 And then he's like walking through the streets because he doesn't want to drive a car because

223
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
 they suck.

224
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
 He knows they suck.

225
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,240
 And you hear like limp biscuits start playing over the soundtrack, roll and roll and roll

226
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,520
 and roll and what?

227
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
 Keep roll and roll.

228
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:30,560
 And the guy's walking and he goes into this museum, like this deserted automobile museum

229
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,440
 and he's walking through, of course it's deserted.

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,200
 Otherwise he would have come up with this plan earlier.

231
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,960
 He's walking through the museum and he finds what he's looking for.

232
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,040
 And then we see that officer's name tag.

233
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
 It's Lieutenant Toretto.

234
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,540
 And he's looking at his great, great grandfather's Dodge Charger.

235
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,440
 This movie is the fastest and the furiest, but it takes place in the future.

236
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,960
 It's called The Last of the Furious.

237
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,000
 And it's Dom Toretto's great grandson driving around this car and the whole movie is just

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,960
 smashing over nerds and they're like efficient, fuel efficient vehicles.

239
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,560
 And you're like, Jason, that's cool.

240
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
 I know, thank you.

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
 And here's the end of the trailer.

242
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,020
 You see the big rig driving through like this high tech building and Lieutenant Toretto's

243
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,820
 driving and he's like has some hot chick who just magically appears in the passenger seat.

244
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,260
 She was in the museum.

245
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,220
 She was in the museum the whole time.

246
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,380
 She got locked in.

247
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,780
 So she's dressed like a hot chick from 2013 and there was enough food for her for six

248
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,060
 years and she hasn't aged.

249
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,700
 But anyways, the car.

250
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,760
 So the monster truck is driving through this high tech building.

251
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,680
 The charger is right behind it and you see the monster truck like smash through the wall

252
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,480
 and Dom Toretto Jr. is driving the car and he goes, turns to the hot chick and he's like

253
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,080
 hold on and then he goes through the window.

254
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,600
 They're on the moon.

255
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 They're on the moon.

256
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:15,580
 So they've left this domed city on the moon and we just see the vehicles flying, flying

257
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,580
 up into the night sky.

258
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
 They're going too fast.

259
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,900
 They can't even be held on the moon with a gravitational pull.

260
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,860
 So the last shot you see the trailer is just this big rig.

261
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,660
 This monster truck flying through space and this charger flying after it.

262
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,880
 Dude, tell me you wouldn't watch that movie.

263
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 James Wan.

264
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,000
 I know you listen to this podcast, make it happen.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,360
 The last, the last of the furious.

266
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
 Okay, there we go.

267
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,080
 Let's go ahead and get back to the actual topic of this podcast.

268
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,520
 Don't worry guys, I won't do that again.

269
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,760
 Okay, let me drink some of this Jason juice.

270
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 What is it?

271
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 J juice?

272
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
 It's the same cup.

273
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
 Anyways, here we go.

274
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,980
 Let's go to Malawi.

275
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
 Mason Norbeck also recommended this story.

276
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,780
 This is the last story of Empire Week.

277
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,300
 It's been a fun week.

278
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,780
 It's been a fun week.

279
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
 So let's go to Malawi.

280
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,020
 We're going to take Dom Toretto's charger.

281
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,740
 We're going to drive from the moon.

282
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,860
 We're going to crash land in Malawi.

283
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,540
 We're going back to 2017.

284
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,580
 Very, very recent story.

285
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,660
 Very recent story.

286
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,740
 And I tried to see if it's happening nowadays and I'm pretty sure it is, but you'll understand

287
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,720
 why we're not getting any reporters over there.

288
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,760
 Malawi is the country.

289
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,400
 This mostly affected regions in the south, but again, it's pretty widespread.

290
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,560
 It's actually gone over into other countries as well.

291
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
 There's a Belgian couple driving through Malawi.

292
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,160
 And as they're driving down the road, a mob just kind of appears out of nowhere and begins

293
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,000
 attacking the vehicle, begins dragging them out.

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,960
 And obviously you're going to be petrified.

295
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,440
 You're driving down the road, your car gets surrounded by 20 people.

296
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,900
 They are armed with machetes, they're armed with rocks, they're banging on your car.

297
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,260
 They're able to get through the windows.

298
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,700
 They start punching through the windows if you're lucky.

299
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,300
 They're dragging you out of the car.

300
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,740
 But what they're calling you, sends shivers up your spine.

301
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,900
 They're calling you bloodsuckers.

302
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,740
 They're kicking you in the face.

303
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,300
 Vampires beating you up.

304
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,740
 Cops show up, disperse the mob.

305
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,060
 There was this entrepreneur, this business owner named Orlando Champanda.

306
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,600
 So in the same area, he's at his house enjoying just like reading the newspaper.

307
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,160
 He says there's just nothing printed because all the reporters have left.

308
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
 They're like, screw this.

309
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,160
 I'm not going to be here.

310
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,680
 It's the Daily Malawi and it's just, it's just they give you a notepad and they're

311
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,760
 like, make your own news up.

312
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 We're out.

313
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,360
 He's sitting at home.

314
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,360
 2,000 people show up at his house.

315
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,040
 You're like, party?

316
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 No.

317
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
 Mob.

318
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,200
 You should have guessed it from the first part.

319
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
 Mob shows up.

320
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,660
 Calling him a vampire, calling him a drinker of human blood.

321
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,020
 They lay siege to his house.

322
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,100
 They're also armed with machetes and stones and he's hiding in his house.

323
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,580
 They're laying siege to his house.

324
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,660
 The police show up and it takes the police five out.

325
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,020
 2,000 people surrounding a house.

326
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,540
 Like he had to, I'm sure it was probably like a home alone type thing.

327
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,540
 He was like heating up irons and they're like hitting people on heads and like taking ladders

328
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,140
 and putting tax in them and whatever.

329
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,760
 He's able to evade the attackers for five hours which is quite the feat.

330
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,880
 The police show up and it takes them five hours to disperse this crowd.

331
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,520
 2,000 people is a lot of people.

332
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,160
 Police finally start shooting tear gas into the crowd which really that should be happening

333
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,280
 in the first five minutes but they get the crowd dispersed.

334
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,600
 Now this was reported in 2017.

335
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,100
 It happened earlier that year.

336
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,320
 What had happened where you have in these mobs of people, surround dudes, chicks it doesn't

337
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,360
 matter, killing them.

338
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,980
 They had nine people killed over the past previous months.

339
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
 A lot of people just attacked but nine people killed.

340
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,300
 One of them was a dude with epilepsy and they're like, "Ah, the vampire, look at that weirdo

341
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,580
 vampire over there."

342
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,460
 Stoned them and then set them on fire while they were still alive.

343
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,060
 So basically they were just attacking these people.

344
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,820
 They believed that vampires had invaded their country.

345
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,740
 August 2018.

346
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,100
 It's funny because we talked about, I talked about the daycare center on yesterday's episode

347
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,300
 and I was like it's nothing.

348
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,060
 Like that story, it's just a daycare center that's gross looking.

349
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,840
 People have created this whole myth about it.

350
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,180
 And then you have this here.

351
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,360
 You have this little story I'm about to tell you.

352
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,620
 Completely under the rug, never heard about it before.

353
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,620
 Should be fodder for conspiracy theorists.

354
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,200
 I don't know why it's not.

355
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,640
 In 2018 the BBC sent a television crew, sent a film crew out to go document a string of

356
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,000
 murders in Malawi.

357
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,540
 They find the killer.

358
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,920
 They go undercover.

359
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,520
 They meet up with the killer and the killer is killing children and selling the blood and

360
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,020
 body parts of the children to wealthy people.

361
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,520
 So all of that stuff you want to pretend happens in Salt Lake City, I'm not going to preach

362
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,860
 about that again, but all the stuff you want to pretend about happens in Salt Lake City,

363
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,300
 what's happening here?

364
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,180
 The point where an investigative film crew was able to track him down and get him to

365
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,300
 talk about oh yeah I know I kill kids and I sell the body parts to all these wealthy

366
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
 people.

367
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,100
 It's a conspiracy theorist's wet dream really.

368
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,260
 As they're doing this undercover sting on this guy, much of Empire Hunters show up.

369
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,080
 A mob shows up and lays siege to these guys and the killer gets away.

370
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,760
 They never found him again.

371
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,040
 And the BBC crew they were like we thought we were going to die.

372
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,280
 We didn't know what was happening.

373
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,880
 We just got surrounded by a mob, people are calling us vampires attacking us.

374
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,040
 Now, Malawi is the sixth poorest nation in the world.

375
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,360
 And the reaction to all of this is so bizarre.

376
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,000
 So here's where, let's go ahead and go back to where these stories came from.

377
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,180
 You started getting people in towns saying "I woke up in the middle of the night and

378
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,820
 there was a light like fire in my room and I felt like the blood was getting sucked out

379
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,820
 of me."

380
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,420
 Here's a quote from one of the people who said they were attacked by a vampire.

381
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,820
 This is not hearsay.

382
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,140
 I know my blood was sucked.

383
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,300
 I saw light on the corner of my roof.

384
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,700
 I failed to stand up from my bed and felt something piercing my left arm.

385
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,260
 The other person who said they saw the light like fire in the room, they also felt a piercing

386
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,740
 in their finger.

387
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,120
 Now those aren't the only two people.

388
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,760
 Other people have reported these things, but those two quotes were used over and over again

389
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,800
 because the problem is, is like, humanitarian groups were pulling their people out.

390
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,360
 They're like, "We cannot guarantee your safety."

391
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,920
 There was like some U.N. outreach group pulled their people out.

392
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,280
 They're like, "We can't guarantee your safety.

393
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,920
 These mobs are just thanking everyone's a vampire."

394
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,120
 So there aren't a lot of reporters on the ground to get more quotes, but this surge

395
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,240
 of attacks getting your blood sucked out.

396
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,140
 So what's weird though is that the accounts we do have from, or the articles we do have

397
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,580
 regarding this, everyone seems to go, "Oh, they don't really believe in vampires.

398
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,820
 They believe in this."

399
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,380
 Let me read you two of these headlines here.

400
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,260
 I think they're interesting way, the way that Western journalists are looking at this story.

401
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:07,460
 One of the headlines is, "How colonialism fueled deadly anti-vampire hysteria in Malawi."

402
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,080
 Another headline, "Climate change is creating vampires in Malawi."

403
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,400
 Fairly click baity.

404
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,800
 But what these articles, almost every article I read on this set, listen, these people

405
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,440
 don't actually believe in physical vampires.

406
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,840
 What they believe in is the inequality between the rich and the poor.

407
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,760
 They see themselves as very poor and they see other people with money and it's a metaphorical

408
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,040
 vampire, you see.

409
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
 It's not a real vampire.

410
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,200
 And that's when they say, "Oh, the climate change is destroying the farmland.

411
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,300
 They smoke mostly agricultural and they're upset at what's going on so they've created

412
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,820
 the rumor of the vampire to focus their anger on the people who are more wealthy than them."

413
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,380
 Now even some people who do believe it's a physical vampire say, "Listen, I'll be

414
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,780
 honest with you, there's a bunch of crooks, a bunch of thieves and thugs that are using

415
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,780
 the cover of the vampire story to go around and beat people up and steal stuff.

416
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,300
 I'll be honest with you."

417
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,740
 However, I do believe vampires are sucking people's blood.

418
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,040
 The president of Malawi said in a statement, "If people are using witchcraft to suck

419
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,840
 people's blood, I will deal with them."

420
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,000
 That was president Peter Mathurica.

421
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,760
 But later, he said, "There is no evidence of bloodsuckers.

422
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,240
 It is a lie meant to destabilize the region.

423
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,120
 Those spreading rumors will face the law."

424
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,860
 Why are they pushing the idea so hard that these are metaphorical vampires?

425
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,340
 I find that really weird.

426
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,740
 I don't really subscribe to the fake news thing a lot, but I find that really weird when

427
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,420
 in the same articles people are like, "Yeah, I was sleeping in bed and something came into

428
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,980
 my room and started sucking my blood."

429
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,860
 In those same articles, they'll say, "Really, people don't believe in vampires, it's just

430
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,140
 a way for them to focus their anger at the rich."

431
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,100
 But I'm like, "You just included two accounts of people who said they were physically attacked

432
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
 by vampires."

433
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,800
 They didn't say Bill Gates and Donald Trump came into their room and took their money.

434
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,840
 They said, "I saw a light and something pricked my finger and the blood got sucked out."

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,760
 In Mozambique, neighboring country, which is where this really started, the vampire paranoia

436
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,880
 spread from Mozambique, the people started saying, "There was this town and these people

437
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,480
 said, 'Vampires are attacking us and you're not doing anything about it.'"

438
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,880
 And the police are like, "Well, there's no vampires."

439
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,180
 And then the people go, "You're protecting the vampires.

440
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,740
 The police is actively protecting the vampires that are attacking us."

441
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,460
 And it got so bad, the town's administrator, which is like the top dog, had to leave the

442
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,340
 city because the people were convinced that the police and the local government were aiding

443
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,580
 vampires and attacking the populace.

444
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,580
 Let's look at a couple of the theories here.

445
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,860
 One is that the media is correct and this is all just a big misunderstanding.

446
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,920
 When they say bloodsuckers and vampires, what they really mean is income inequality.

447
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,160
 So that's why they're attacking people.

448
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,080
 Not because they actually believe in witchcraft and vampires, it's that they are trying to

449
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,440
 economic revolution.

450
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,080
 Forget that the president said anything about going after people who suck people's blood.

451
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,240
 Remember his second statement saying, "No, no, no, no.

452
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,520
 It's to destabilize the regions."

453
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
 Just a rumor.

454
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,620
 When I was reading the story, it reminded me of the Chupa Chupa.

455
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,860
 That was, I think that was episode 70, something, where I covered Operation Plate.

456
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,420
 It was Brazil's biggest, Brazil's Roswell is what I called it, one of the biggest UFO

457
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,380
 sightings in Brazil.

458
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,780
 And it went on for months and people would say they'd wake them in the middle of the

459
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,640
 night, there'd be a bright light in their room and they would have piercing pains in

460
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,020
 parts of their body.

461
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,380
 They felt that the blood was being sucked out of them, so they called them Chupa Chupas

462
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
 or Sucksucks.

463
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,280
 And when I was reading this story, that's really what it reminded me of, honestly.

464
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,880
 I was thinking maybe there's more of like an alien belief here, more of an alien connection.

465
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
 People weren't safe in their houses, it was happening all the time.

466
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,800
 Now in Brazil, it was in one particular region and they're just like, "Well, this sucks."

467
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,860
 And they didn't really know what to do and they got some outside help and then the Air

468
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,240
 Force ended up showing up, the Brazilian Air Force, investigating it and it went away

469
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
 after a couple months.

470
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,440
 This one, these dudes aren't messing around.

471
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,800
 One, I don't think Malawai has an Air Force.

472
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,900
 And two, they're like, "Oh no, I got bit by a vampire.

473
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,500
 I'm going to smash your house to pieces."

474
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,100
 Now people have said in Malawai, because you go, "Well, how come it's only like the Belgian

475
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,940
 couple or other than the epileptic guy, the other entrepreneur, stuff like that, the BBC

476
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,980
 film crew?"

477
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,180
 People have said in Malawai, kind of, there's nothing for free.

478
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,100
 If you have nice things, it means you did something bad to get them.

479
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,780
 So that's a real conspiratorial belief.

480
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,460
 Someone's doing better than you, they must be a vampire.

481
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,480
 But that doesn't mean that I think they're hunting metaphorical vampires and that seems

482
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,080
 to be, you see someone who's doing something nice, you go, "Oh, they must be a physical

483
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,920
 vampire, so let's go attack them."

484
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,440
 Because if I don't, then they're going to kill me.

485
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,520
 These type of rumors aren't new in 1930s in Zambia, which I don't think is around anymore,

486
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,400
 but colonial Zambia.

487
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,440
 There was a rumor that Europeans were taking the blood out of Native African people and

488
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
 turning them into cough drops.

489
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,620
 So again, I think there is kind of, you can kind of draw a connection between colonialism

490
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:20,500
 people coming into your country and you thinking of them as being blood suckers.

491
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,060
 But it's one thing for me to go, "My boss really abuses me versus my boss sneaks into

492
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,060
 my room at night, pricks my finger and drinks my blood."

493
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,980
 I think that that is what they feel is actually happening.

494
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,700
 They're under physical assault and that's why they're physically assaulting other people

495
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,220
 and killing other people.

496
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
 But here's the thing.

497
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:44,580
 Now, of course, I don't expect Vice Magazine or wherever I got these articles from.

498
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,280
 And thanks for this too, Mason.

499
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,280
 Mason, I don't know if I said this earlier, this is one of the topics Mason sent me, but

500
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,740
 British newspapers, BBC.com, Vice.com, I don't expect them to say vampires are real, but

501
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,340
 let's look at this logically for a second.

502
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,920
 If you were a vampire, where would you go?

503
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,120
 Like really.

504
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,580
 If you were a vampire and you wanted to feed indiscriminately, people have always said,

505
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,700
 "Oh, you know, you go to like war."

506
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,420
 I think I said that on an early episode too.

507
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
 Go to war.

508
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,140
 Go to a war-torn area.

509
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,020
 You feed off all sorts of people, but you'd also have a higher chance of getting blown

510
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,580
 up by a mortar shell.

511
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,740
 It's not like a vampire from the 17th century is like, "Oh, I got bayoneted, big deal."

512
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,740
 Pulls it out, stabs a guy.

513
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,100
 I mean, you're walking through a battlefield, a moab falls on top of you.

514
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,500
 I don't think Dracula can tink a bomb that's built to wipe out battalions of troops.

515
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,020
 I don't think Dracula can even walk away from that.

516
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,180
 So you could go to a battlefield, but you know, then some Nazi may break out a flamethrower

517
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,540
 and set you on fire.

518
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:47,420
 If you were a vampire and you wanted to hunt indiscriminately, if you can find one of the

519
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,300
 top 10 poorest countries on the planet, that's a place to go.

520
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,580
 You wouldn't be a vampire in Beverly Hills.

521
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,700
 You would be a vampire in Malawi.

522
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,820
 I don't even think you'd be like a vampire in a bad neighborhood in LA, because again,

523
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,220
 there's just too much stuff going on.

524
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,380
 But if you just wanted to eat, that's where you would go.

525
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,660
 It'd be the perfect cover for you.

526
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,660
 And if you were one of those highfalutin vampires who took all of his money from the 16th century

527
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,540
 and like invested it, you would totally be connected to everything and be like, "I just

528
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,500
 told people, it's funny because they go out of their way to say, 'No, no, these vampires

529
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 aren't real.'

530
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,820
 But the average person who reads it, including me, goes, 'No, duh, of course they're not.

531
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,660
 Like you don't have to tell me that vampires aren't real.'

532
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,380
 Vampires are one of the things that I would like to be real.

533
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,100
 Like Bigfoot, I could take them or leave them.

534
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,820
 But I would love if vampires really existed.

535
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,940
 But they don't have to say, 'I know vampires aren't really attacking.'

536
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,660
 I don't know what is going on down there.

537
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,020
 Maybe some weird superstition.

538
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
 Maybe UFO.

539
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
 Could be a vampire.

540
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
 I don't know.

541
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,580
 But then the fact that the thing is, they try so hard to prove to me that it's not a vampire

542
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,900
 by making all of these cultural or colonial or environmental ones the weirdest thing, but

543
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,820
 environmental connections to it, that that makes me more suspicious.

544
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,940
 I was just like, "What?"

545
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,460
 Like just say, "Oh, it's an old folklore tale.

546
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,980
 Of course there's not vampires there.

547
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,380
 I don't know why they have to keep doing these write-ups saying, 'No, no, vampires over there.

548
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,380
 It's this.'

549
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,500
 It's the fact that there hasn't been any rain that's making the vampires attack people."

550
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,740
 And the weirdest thing of all was the serial killer who was killing kids.

551
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,980
 You didn't think I was going to get back to that.

552
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,060
 I wouldn't tantalize you with that horrible detail.

553
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,900
 The serial killer, who as a business is killing kids and selling their blood and body parts

554
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:44,020
 to wealthy people, was only in one article, the BBC article.

555
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:52,260
 And that is the most important detail because that is proof of not necessarily vampires,

556
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,220
 but a vampiric activity.

557
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:04,060
 As a legend, he was a man under investigation who got away.

558
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,620
 Something is haunting the people of Malawi.

559
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,220
 They could simply be haunted by their fears of a paranormal creature and whenever they

560
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:20,900
 wake up with an unusual pain or see something odd at night, they attribute it to a vampire.

561
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:27,780
 They may be haunted by the ghosts of the past still affecting them economically and culturally.

562
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:34,460
 They could be haunted by thieves using the guise of supernatural enemies to lay siege

563
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,940
 to people's personal belongings.

564
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:44,500
 They may be haunted by all those things, but we know for sure that they are haunted by

565
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,100
 a man who kills and sells kids' body parts.

566
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,060
 We know that for a fact.

567
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,460
 Who is that dude selling blood and body parts to?

568
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:05,020
 There is no reason why you would need blood and body parts from children unless you were

569
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,420
 a vampire.

570
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,020
 There's no other reason.

571
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,420
 Someone's not running a cloning workshop over there.

572
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,420
 The only reason you would need to buy that stuff is if you were a vampire.

573
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,620
 In Malawi, I don't understand that.

574
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,620
 And the fact that this guy can make a living doing it means that either he's getting

575
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:32,380
 a lot of money for what he does or he has multiple clients or both.

576
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,100
 If there are vampires anywhere in the world, they're in Malawi.

577
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,860
 I find it convenient that we have all these other explanations for why people say there's

578
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,860
 vampires.

579
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,900
 It's incredibly convenient that the President changed what he said.

580
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:54,420
 I also find it convenient that every news story regarding these incidents ended in 2018.

581
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,180
 We haven't heard anything since.

582
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:03,580
 Secrecy, confusion, chaos, paranoia.

583
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:11,180
 The perfect place for a vampire to hunt is Malawi.

584
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:20,420
 And it's even better if you have that blood and gore delivered right to your doorstep.

585
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,220
 When the President of the country changes what he said to say vampires don't exist even

586
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,620
 though he previously said that they did, he's protecting somebody more powerful than he

587
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,860
 is.

588
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,980
 And how can a mob try to fight something that powerful?

589
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,620
 They can't.

590
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,220
 They can just constantly be redirected to attack the wrong targets.

591
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:54,660
 And all the while it is the perfect cover for a creature that feeds on human blood.

592
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,420
