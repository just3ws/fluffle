1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What would you do if you thought one of your siblings was possessed?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we meet a group of convicts who have broken out of a penal colony in Tasmania

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 and are trying to make their way to freedom.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 They're on the run, they're running out of food, and it's an interactive adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys have weekends coming up,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hope you guys have some cool stuff coming, Thanksgiving's coming up pretty soon too.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 You know, normally I do a Thanksgiving special, huh? I don't even think about it.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Am I doing a Thanksgiving special this year? Maybe.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Like that? You like that commitment to the show? But you know who's always committed to the show

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 is one of our newest Patreons coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Give it up for 580VDC. Everyone give a big round of applause.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Three numbers, three letters. That's all you need. 580VDC. Thank you so much for supporting the show.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Really, really, really, really helps out a lot. I always love seeing you guys talk about the show online

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 and I'm seeing it more and more often. So thank you so much for that.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 580. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the Hair Hang Glider.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Let's go ahead and leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna take a nice leisurely journey all the way out

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 to Grandma's house.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We're just flying the breeze all the way out and there we're gonna meet a 5 year old boy

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 standing in his grandma's house. We're looking through the windows.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We're all being super creepy. We're hiding in the bushes.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 This 5 year old boy is walking around his grandma's house and the rest of the family is in the kitchen

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 kind of talking. This little boy is walking through the house and he's looking at all of these pictures of the family.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 This little boy, did we give him a name yet? We're gonna call him Timothy is walking through this house

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 and he's looking at all of these photos and he says there had been like 30 or 40 pictures honestly. Just tons.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Now at that point your grandma is less of a loving matriarch. We're kind of like a creepy stalker.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 They're like, "That's weird grandma. Why don't you take this picture? It's from outside in the bushes."

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 There's a bunch of leaves in front of the camera and it's this little boy trying to sleep.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Anyways, so we may have stumbled across another conspiracy theory here, but Timothy's walking through this house

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 and he's looking at all these pictures and when he's walking down the hallway, he sees a photograph of his older brother

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 but in this photograph he was much younger, even younger than Timothy was.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And he's looking at this photo of his brother and his brother is just standing there

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 and he sees something begin to move in the photograph.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 A tall blackish figure, a shadow man, begins to walk across the picture.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 This figure is just casually moving across the background of this picture.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 The other people in it are frozen in time, but this shadow man is moving.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Timothy's watching this and he says, "The shadow man gets to where my brother is and then sits down."

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Timothy freaks out. He has no way to really comprehend what he just saw.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 It doesn't make sense. It goes against anything you would think of a photo could do.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Move, right? That's one thing photos famously are. Not moving.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 He begins running through the house, screaming at the top of his lungs

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 and when he gets to the kitchen, everyone's like, "Dude, what is the matter? Why?"

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But he was so terrified. He was sobbing. He actually couldn't even explain what he saw.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 They're trying to get him to calm down and he can't.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 He just saw something that his little brain could not comprehend.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Even an adult would have a hard time dealing with that.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I think as an adult you would look around and assume, was that a reflection of something behind?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 There's a giant shadow man behind you. You're like, "Woo! That was close.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I thought you were only in the picture."

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And then once you kind of took it in, you would probably just like back away from the photo.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 You might also go screaming down the hallway, but to a kid that can't comprehend it,

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 they see this thing and at a certain point they realize,

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 "I can't get the words out to describe this and even if I could, no one is going to believe me."

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 So this was posted online by someone known as Lil Corn and Beans

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 and this is basically the first time apparently.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 They feel comfortable telling this story. It's through an anonymous account.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Right? No one's going to be able to trace it back to this person

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 who saw a shadow man walk through a photograph.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It's an interesting story and it opens up a whole lot of pathways to explore.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 My thing would be if the shadow man was in the photo, does that,

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 as I said in the intro, does that mean that the shadow man is next to his brother in real life?

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Like, was the shadow man trapped in the photo and just walking behind me

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 like all my legs are so tired of me walking through eternity through this background?

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Or did it symbolize that the shadow man is behind the brother in real life?

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Maybe even possessing the brother.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Maybe this photo showed the truth.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Is the photo haunted? Is the brother haunted? Is the house haunted?

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And then we have to look at is this just a we've been covering stories recently about children.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 What was the one we did not too long ago?

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 It was about the young kids seeing something weird.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 It's basically the entire premise of this podcast.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't remember what it was.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Thing was last week, but I came across another story just recently about a young girl.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I think this story took place in Argentina. I'll put it in the show notes.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 This young girl is over at her friend's house and her friend's grandpa's there

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 and he's going to take the dogs for a walk and the girl goes,

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 "Oh, can I go with you?" and his nighttime and the grandpa goes, "Yeah, sure. You can go with me."

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And the young girl runs the door and opens it and the moon is like sitting three feet from the door.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 She said it was small. It was obviously much smaller than the moon really is,

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 but she goes, "I opened the door and I looked and there was the moon about three to six feet away from the front door just sitting there."

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And I turned back to the grandpa and I said, "The moon's here. I really want to...

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Can I go out and play?" and the grandpa just goes, "No. I don't think we're going to go out tonight."

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And he walked and he shut the door.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So is that a kid misremembering something?

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Or is that a paranormal event like the photo that actually happened?

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Do these things happen more often, but kids see them and they can't process them?

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They don't really know how to communicate that?

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Because an adult's sire, if an adult opened their door and they saw a moon,

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 that is a reality breaking thing because we know that's impossible.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 But I remember a long time ago I was watching this documentary about martial arts.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I think it was the art of Bushido or something like that or Bushido, the art of killing.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I think that was the documentary. And the person said, "Marshall arts should be taught to children

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 because children still believe in magic. They still believe that anything's possible.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And martial arts is making the impossible possible?"

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I'm paraphrasing obviously. You said it more eloquently.

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But as an adult, we know you can't shoot fireballs out of your hands,

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 but a child, they just think that's maybe three or four lessons away.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And they're putting so much focus into it.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I know that I can't do a spinning jump kick and knock out five goons,

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 but a kid thinks they can, right?

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 And so they approach martial arts differently.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And so is it something like that? Like, you, as a child, you believe magic is more real.

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 You believe that all this stuff is literally just maybe a day or two away.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Your life may become some fantastical adventure.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 You open the door, you see a moon. That's just part of the magic of being a child.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Is that what this is? And that's why these children are seeing things like this?

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Do more people have these experiences of kids?

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 But then when they grow up, they go, "Oh, that was impossible. I must have misremembered it."

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I remember very, very clearly at one point walking into my backyard when we lived in Alameda.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I walked in my backyard and it looked up and there was a 747 flying so low.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 If I had a basketball, I could have hit it.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And that's impossible. I would have been like 10, 11 years old, maybe like 11, 12 when I saw that.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 That's impossible. I mean, if the plane was that low, I obviously would have,

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 you never would have heard from me. The podcast never would have been made.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I would have been swept up into a jet engine, but I clearly remember that.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Now, as an adult, I know it's impossible. I know it's impossible. But what did I see?

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So who knows? It's very, very interesting. But it could be a childhood memory thing.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 It could be that children are more open to the paranormal, which that isn't a obscure belief.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 People are, that's pretty fairly well known in the paranormal world.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But like this, was this kid actually seeing a shadow man next to the photograph?

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And does that mean in real life, his brother has a shadow man next to him?

125
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Just bringing it back to that. That's the creepy part.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 If the photograph had moved in some weird way and they seemed to interact with each other for a moment,

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 that would be weird and definitely notable.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 The fact that an alien entity, something not in the photograph,

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 walked into the photograph and sat down next to his brother.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 What does that mean? Truly a terrifying story.

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And one that may be more common, just we've seen stuff like that when we were kids

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and when we grew up, we'd go, "That's impossible." We kind of locked that away.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 580 VDC. I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys of the carboner copter.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We are leaving behind Grandma's house. We got all the snickered noodles we can carry,

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 all of Grandma's great food. We're leaving behind Grandma's house.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 We are headed all the way out to Australia.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So I want you guys to pick a number between one and ten.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And you guys got to remember that number because that will be your fate during this next story.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And as you're picking that number, as we're flying out there, I do want to do a special shout out for this.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 There's a YouTube channel called Corridor Crew. I watch them all the time.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 It's a bunch of special effects artists.

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And a lot of times they do like good and bad CGI from X type of movies or good and bad CGI from, you know,

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 and because they're special effects artists, they can kind of analyze stuff

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and they do stuff with stuntmen and fight choreography. It's a really cool channel.

145
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 What they've started doing recently though has been really cool. I talked about them a while back.

146
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 They did one where they debunked, or, you know, attempted to, you know, your mileage may vary,

147
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 but they debunked the Pentagon UFO videos, like all that stuff that was coming out about the tic-tac.

148
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 They were showing how that could be done.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 What visual tricks or what CGI or whatever. And that was really cool.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I recently did one just before Halloween, ghost videos.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 They watched a bunch of ghost videos on YouTube and they were trying to determine, "Is this fake? Is this real?"

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And what I really like about, there's different types of debunking.

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 There's the debunking, the people go, "That's not real. Shadowmen in pictures, that's not real."

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 That's not fun to me. It's super boring.

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 The cool thing about Corridor Crew is because they're watching these videos, there's one where a ghost flies by a car.

156
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And they're looking at it and they go, "Well, you know what's weird is that if I had to build that effect, I wouldn't have done this.

157
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I wouldn't have thought about doing this." So it is weird.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Maybe someone was smoking and the smoke came by.

159
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 And they were watching this video over and over again and they figured it out what it was.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And to the homeowner, they probably never even thought this.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Well, they're kind of working it out and they go, "I bet you anything, there is a balcony above the camera

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 and someone stepped down on it where someone dropped something hard and dust fell through the slates.

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The slates of the balcony and the dust came down in front of the camera."

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And once they explained that and they re-show the video, that's exactly what it looks like.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And they go, "Yeah, look, there's more dust. Someone walked out there."

166
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So it wasn't faked to get attention, but they were able to break it down.

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That's the type of debunking I like because it's easy for them to just go, "Ghost don't exist. Come back next week."

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And they also had an interesting point that I don't think I'd thought of if I had really sat down.

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Maybe I would have come up with it, but they go, "It's weird that when ghosts move things like open drawers or doors,

170
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 they do it with the exact same physics as if you had a fishing line tied to something."

171
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And I go, "You're right. Like, whenever you see a stool move, a ghost would pick up a stool like a human would,

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 because they were formerly human. Would they simply grab one of the legs at the very bottom and pull it?

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Would they grab it? Would they pinch their fingers around it and yank it a bit?

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Or if you had to move a stool, how would you do it?"

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Now, do I think it disproves all ghosts? Absolutely not.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Do I think it disproves all the even the videos that they looked at? Absolutely not.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 There may be one or two in there, but I love that type of debunking, and I think it's really, really cool.

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 So you guys should check out those videos as well. They'll be in the show notes.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 580 VDC is taking us to Tasmania. Tasmania is part of Australia.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We're specifically headed to the McCorry Harbor Penal Station. It's September 20th, 1822.

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So this is still when you're going to Australia. It wasn't for a vacation.

182
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 You were headed to this area because you were being transported for crimes you committed in the British Empire.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 September 20th, 1822. You picked a number between 1 and 10. Remember that number.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 We're at the McCorry Harbor Penal Station. This is a prison island within prison territory.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Like, the entire place is basically the real life no escape, starring Ray Liotta.

186
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 But even though there was no escape, you still tried. The human spirit persevered.

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I'd rather die in the wilderness than spend another day in this penal colony.

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 So on September 20th, I don't know if they had alarms back then.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I think they just pulled on a calisthenic tail really loud and that alerted the guards.

190
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Escape, escape, escape. 9 dudes all team up to break out of this penal colony.

191
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 They weren't all friends. We're just acquaintances as we will learn very quickly.

192
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 They weren't all friends, but when you heard that there was a possible chance of getting out of this madness, you took it.

193
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Robert Greenhill quickly appointed himself leader of this band of fugitives.

194
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And what made him the leader wasn't his eloquence or charisma. He may have had those things. We don't know.

195
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 History has not recorded that. They did record that he was the only one with an axe.

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 So if you're escaping prison with a bunch of prisoners, yes, the guy who's in charge is the guy with the axe.

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And they make their way out of prison and they're now wandering the wilderness of Tasmania, trying to find civilization.

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It's out there somewhere. They just got to find it. They don't have a map. They don't know where they're going.

199
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 They do have an axe though, and that will come in quite handy.

200
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Now Robert Greenhill did have an ally. He was the only person who really started this off with someone watching his back.

201
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And that was Matthew's Travers. They were friends in the joint. I actually think they were friends even before they both got sent here.

202
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But they were on the move for 15 days.

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And the authorities are looking for him. It wasn't just like, "Oh darn it, they got away. Ah, they'll get arrested by someone else."

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 They're being hunted. And they're on the move for 15 days in the Australian wilderness.

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 They have an axe, but no food.

206
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 That's not magical, right? It's not Minecraft. You just can't walk up an axe to chicken.

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 They probably would have if there were chickens, but there's nothing at all for them.

208
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 For 15 days, these nine men marched through the wilderness with nothing to eat.

209
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 So it's time to draw lots.

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 This is called the custom of the sea. And apparently it also works on land. What it is, is you draw lots.

211
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So you have all these sticks of different sizes, and whoever gets the shortest stick gets eaten.

212
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 You're completely out of food. You need something to eat.

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So they take a bundle of nine sticks. Could you imagine the stress of this, right?

214
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 You're already starving. It's already been days since you ate, so you're not already in the best mood.

215
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 I'm a little angry. You're like ribcage is showing you're like, "You're more than a little angry. You're about to die."

216
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 There's nine sticks being held in a hand, and one of them means you're not only going to get killed,

217
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 but you're going to get eaten reaching into that bundle of sticks.

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Thomas Boddenham pulls one out, looks at it.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 If you picked the number two, you just have a second to glance at that stick,

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and you realize you've drawn the short straw.

221
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 It's just a minute. You comprehend that. You are now about to be murdered and then devoured.

222
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 You're going to be set upon by your fellow convicts and be digested.

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And before you can really comprehend that, Robert Greenhill splits the back of your skull open with an axe,

224
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and the men start a fire to cook your meat.

225
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Yeah, this is what I guess I kind of came out of nowhere. Did I mention that there's any sort of cannibalism in the intro?

226
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 You're like, "Ah, this is horrible." You just sat down with a big rotisserie chicken.

227
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You're like, "Yummy, yummy, yummy. Eating lunch and listening to Dead River Radio is my favorite thing."

228
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Why didn't you get meat right off the bone? This is delicious.

229
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Now, there were three people who-- there's nine people in total.

230
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 One of them is currently being spit roasted, and that is not the sport-- that is not the porn version.

231
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 That is the original version of spit roasting. They're turning them over with a stick.

232
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I don't think they had an apple in its mouth. I don't think they were cooking them.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Like, they just slaughtered a hog. They're probably just cooking, like, thighs and arms and things like that.

234
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 One rump roast, please. You'll have a slow cooker. Everyone's all eating. They're all starving.

235
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 You're like, "No, I'd rather have eight hours. I want this meat to get nice and juicy."

236
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Put thrown carrots in it. Three dudes saw this, and they're like, "We're not going to--

237
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Okay, we're not going to be part of this, right? We're super, super hungry, but we're not going to eat this guy."

238
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And here's the thing. We're 15 days into this.

239
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 We may not find civilization for quite a long time. Who's to say we're not next?

240
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So three dudes bounce.

241
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Alexander Dalton, William Kennerly, and Edward Brown run away.

242
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So if you picked four, five, or six, you don't even get to taste sweet, sweet human flesh.

243
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 You run away. You cowards, what? You're not that you were a foodie, that you love new experiences.

244
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 You guys are running into the bushes. So if you picked four, five, or six, you're safe.

245
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 However, I will say this. If you picked four, you die of exhaustion.

246
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 The other two guys eventually get re-arrested.

247
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 So you can take this as a true show of an adventure. You can take that as a win, right?

248
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You can be like, "Well, I didn't get to eat delicious convict, but I also didn't get cooked."

249
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And you get re-arrested. And that is actually the best ending you could possibly get if you picked five or six, because it's all downhill from here.

250
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 So now we have Robert Greenhill and his buddy Matthew Travers, and two more.

251
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 John Mather and Alexander Pierce.

252
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Oh man, that was so delicious. Oh, Tommy. Tommy, I'll always remember how delicious you were.

253
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 There still are eating the meat right off the bone.

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 The guy's juggling his testicles. He's wearing the penis like a fake nose.

255
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 He's like, "Look at me. I'm a big old clown." I don't know. Here's the thing. Here's the thing.

256
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I really something read in this story. I don't think that happened, but I really something read in this story.

257
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Being killed, knowing you're about to be eaten, right?

258
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 If I was killed and then afterwards someone ate me, I probably wouldn't care, because I'm dead.

259
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But if I knew before I died I'm gonna get eaten, that would kind of concern me a bit, right?

260
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 That would make me be like, "Oh man, I'm gonna become poop."

261
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 But I'll tell you this right now. The only thing worse than being killed and eaten

262
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 is being killed and eaten the second-- the second guy to have that happen to you.

263
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Because the first guy, it's an abstract thought. We've never really put much thought into being killed and eaten by another human.

264
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Maybe so often you imagine someone being like, "Eating your eyeballs" and be like, "Hmm, I'm sorry. This episode's super disgusting."

265
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 But you know, it's like a gusher. Someone's eating your eyeballs like gushers and maybe they're like,

266
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 "But they have your legs like stilts. They're like walking on your legs. Look at me, Ma. Look how tall I am."

267
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Everyone's laughing because you don't really think about that stuff, right?

268
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Normal human never should. But if you're the second-- so you have now killed Tommy and you've eaten him

269
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 and you're sitting there with a belly full of your fellow human and you're sitting there and you're thinking,

270
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 "Oh my God, if I die they're gonna be doing all these eye jinks with my body."

271
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Like, when they're eating you, when you're eating someone else, you're just eating meat off of a bone

272
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 but imagine them doing that to you. You're like, "No, I really like my legs attached to me."

273
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 You know what I mean? You had no context. When you have to go to bathroom later that night, you're pooping out Tommy.

274
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And now you're realizing, "Oh my God, when I die someone's gonna poop me out too."

275
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 So the only thing worse than-- to my remaining listeners who are probably completely aroused by this story now,

276
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 everyone's quit the podcast except for my two listeners who are really into VOR.

277
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So you freaks out there. After a certain point, I would rather die first and be eaten first than die second

278
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 and be eaten because I'd be like, "Because they're gonna play jump rope with my intestines and stuff like that."

279
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I'm assuming, again, in most of the trouble situations, they don't play with your corpse, but they might.

280
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And being turned into poop, you turning someone into poop, you know that's gonna happen to you.

281
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And it's not an abstract thing. So remember, Green Hill and Travers are friends.

282
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And there's only two other dudes. Now are you gonna draw lots? Probably not. It's two on two.

283
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Green Hill and Travers are not gonna say, "Let's draw lots. We'll give an equal--"

284
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 "Mathor and Pierce know one of them are on the chopping block."

285
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But they still got a lot of flesh of Tommy. They're turning in a beef jerky. They're like, "No, no, no."

286
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 They're still eating some of Tommy. They have this meat on the go, but that meat is also running low,

287
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and there is no safety in sight. Pierce and Mathor know that one of them is next.

288
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And John Mathor realizes that the power dynamic has changed.

289
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 If you picked number one, you realize at the very last second that it wasn't two on two. It was three against one.

290
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 If you picked number one, Alexander Pierce went behind your back because your back looked so delicious

291
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and formed an alliance with Travers and Green Hill.

292
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And Mathor feels that axe chop into his body, hacking away at him.

293
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 His last thoughts are of him turning into poop.

294
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 I don't actually know. He might have been thinking of his mom or his long-lost wife, but also poop,

295
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 because he just ate a guy a couple days ago, and now that same thing is gonna happen to him.

296
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 The very last thing? He's like, "Oh man, I really shouldn't have juggled that guy's testicles

297
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 and worn his penis like a fake nose."

298
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 If you picked number one, you are roasted over the fire that night.

299
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Mmm, John is tastier than Tommy.

300
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 John really worked out. John really worked out his glutes.

301
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 He was eating you up, and later that night, under a sea of stars, all three of the men start pooping you.

302
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I don't know why I'm so obsessed. That would be so horrifying.

303
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I mean, I know we get turned into poop anyways, like I get eaten by worms, and then I turn into worm poop,

304
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 but that's totally different, because I think about all the times that I've pooped, and there's never been people,

305
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 who never eat a person, but what if it was?

306
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Right, that would suck, right? I'd be like, "Johnny, no, you were my best friend, why did I eat you?"

307
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 But I have to go to the bathroom. I probably shouldn't have eaten you and taken all that X-Lax. It's making it even worse.

308
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 People are not eating me. I apologize. Even the four people have left at this point.

309
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Now, Alexander Pierce knows that he sure he was able to last to the next round, but Travers and Greenhill are ride or die.

310
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 They're ride or eat. They're gonna eat Pierce at some point.

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But here's the thing. They can't kill him right now, because they're gonna be able to preserve all that meat,

312
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 so they're gonna keep going as far as they can, and they might not have to eat him, right?

313
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 If they were able to find civilization, that would be ideal. They don't want to eat this dude,

314
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 but he can stay alive until they run out of food, and then they'll kill him, because they'll need fresh food.

315
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 But what happens before any of that? If you pick number three, you or Matthew Travers, and you get bit by a snake,

316
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 [makes snake noises]

317
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 the fangs go deep inside your flesh, poison, injecting into your skin.

318
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 I have to poop. I have to poop. You say you run into the bushes. They're like, "No, don't poop. You still need to digest some more of Johnny."

319
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 At this point, Alexander Pierce realizes that the game board is set. Travers is not gonna be able to make it.

320
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Greenhill, though, because this is his buddy, says we're not leaving him behind, and they carry him,

321
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 or more specifically, Greenhill carries him for five days, hoping to find civilization, get his buddy some treatment.

322
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 But by the fifth day, they knew that they couldn't save him.

323
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So they kill him, and they eat him.

324
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I'd assume they didn't eat where the snake bite was. They ate around that part.

325
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And now it's one on one.

326
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Well, it's one on one with an axe, because Greenhill never gave up possession of that axe, but they have no alliances now.

327
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 They're walking through the wilderness together. Maybe we'll get somewhere. Maybe they won't have to eat each other.

328
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 That's the goal! It's to get free. This wasn't a cannibal expedition.

329
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 You have to sleep, but can you, with the person next to you wanting to kill you?

330
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 You run out of food again. You're weak. You're moving through the wilderness. You're starving. You can't sleep.

331
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You can't think. You're running out of energy.

332
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 If you pick number seven, you're Robert Greenhill. If you pick number nine, you're Alexander Pierce.

333
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And at one point during this cat and mouse game, which takes over the course of days, Alexander Pierce gets that axe and splits Robert Greenhill's head wide open.

334
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 If you picked number seven, you're laying on the ground, gasping for air.

335
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And Alexander Pierce is standing over you with that axe, and he goes, "What are you doing? You're gonna think of anything clever to say?"

336
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I could have had a hundred different, I don't know, bone appetites. He maybe said that.

337
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Maybe he said, "You know what's happening to you, bro? I'm gonna eat you and I'm gonna poop you out."

338
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And Robert Greenhill's like, "Ugh." And dies.

339
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Alexander Pierce goes to work. I mean, think about it. All these other bodies he had to share, now he gets a hundred and what?

340
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Sixty-hundred and eighty pounds of just meat, just human flesh for Alexander Pierce.

341
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But you know, he doesn't want to be eating this stuff. This is a survival thing. But he doesn't. He's making skewers.

342
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He has a little barbecue going on. He's eating this meat. He's preserving this meat as best as he can.

343
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And he continues through the wilderness, and then he sees some sheep.

344
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And he knows now, civilization is nearby. There must be a farm nearby if he's seeing these sheep.

345
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And not only does he stumble across this sheep ranch in the middle of nowhere, he knows the guy who runs the sheep ranch.

346
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 This dude is also a criminal who runs a sheep-russling scheme. They're stealing sheep.

347
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 So Alexander Pierce comes out of the wilderness. Full belly. He actually weighs more than when he broke out of jail.

348
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 How'd you escape? Oh, it was just me. I just ran away and I survived.

349
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 He becomes part of the sheep-russling scheme, and then they get arrested, and then he gets re-arrested for a total of 113 days.

350
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 All of that stuff happened in 113 days. They broke out of prison through the time he got re-arrested as being a sheep-russler.

351
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Now, when his friend met him, he's probably just like, "Yeah, I just broke out of jail. It was just me. You know how awesome I am."

352
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 But authorities know for sure there was a lot more people who escaped.

353
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 At this point, they already arrested, Kennerley and Brown. Remember, they came out of the wilderness, they got re-arrested, and they said, "Well, Dalton passed out, died of exhaustion."

354
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And the reason why we left is because those other two had killed a guy and we were about to eat him.

355
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 So when Alexander Pierce gets re-arrested, they go, "Hey, we know that this guy was murdered and you guys planned on eating him. Did you guys do that?"

356
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And Alexander Pierce is like, "Yeah, yeah, we ate him." And he goes, "Okay, well, where's everyone else at?" And he goes, "Well, we ate them too. Everyone got eaten but me."

357
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And he admitted to it, but the authorities didn't believe him. They thought he was covering for his buddies.

358
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 They actually didn't believe him. They thought they were still out there somewhere in the bush, so they continued looking for him.

359
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 He's like, "Guys, listen, if you direct me to a toilet, trust me, you will see the remains of these people come out of my butthole."

360
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 I don't know why that would be evidence and not like an eyeball would come out and wink. They're like, "Robert Greenhill's eye."

361
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 So Alexander Pierce is locked back in prison, but he's not being charged with this stuff right now because as far as they know, these guys are still alive.

362
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Like, sure, they have witnesses that they killed this one guy to eat him, but he didn't do it. Alexander Pierce didn't do it.

363
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Remember, Robert Greenhill clubbed him with the ax.

364
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 And while Alexander Pierce is back in this prison that he escaped from, he comes across an inmate, a young man known as...

365
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Thomas Cox.

366
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 If you pick number 10, you're good old Thomas Cox, who decides to team up with Alexander Pierce for a prison escape.

367
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Yeah, man, I totally want to blow this joint. This place sucks.

368
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Well, I did escape from it once, young man, and with your help, we can escape again.

369
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And they do. They break out of this prison colony once again.

370
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 But this time, they're only on the run for 10 days before they're re-caught.

371
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And when Alexander Pierce is caught, he's alone.

372
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 They go, "What happened to Thomas Cox?" And he goes, "Well, we got to the river and he couldn't swim. And I realized he was a liability, so I killed him."

373
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 But when they were searching him, when they were searching Alexander Pierce, he had only been gone for 10 days.

374
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 They found him in possession of meat torn from Thomas Cox's body.

375
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Just pockets full of Tommy.

376
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And he had food on him as well.

377
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 He had murdered Thomas and was eating him, even though they weren't starving, even though they still had provisions.

378
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He is quickly charged with murder and cannibalism.

379
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 He was sentenced to be executed for his crimes.

380
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And on July 19th, 1824, Alexander Pierce is headed towards the gallows, his last words before that noose was slipped over his neck, his last words, "Man's flesh is delicious."

381
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 It tastes far better than fish or pork.

382
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 [Sounds of cutting]

383
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Really, really creepy story. It's funny when I was reading it.

384
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 The initial, and this is really, this is actually a really popular story, like a true crime story in Australia, but I hadn't heard of it before.

385
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And it's creepy because when you're reading it, you're like, "Oh, this is just kind of like a group of men pushed to the limits. They're slowly starving. What would you do?"

386
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Would you rather be the pooper or the poopy?

387
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But then the story, the guy's a monster at the end. Like, I can understand you're in that survival situation, but then he becomes a monster.

388
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 He didn't need to kill that kid, but he wanted to taste that human flesh again.

389
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 He wanted to taste that meat so badly, he broke out of prison just to eat that guy.

390
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I do like Chipotle, but I won't even drive an hour to get it.

391
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 He broke out of prison and within a matter of days, that was the reason why he broke out, because he wanted to eat that guy.

392
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Insane story, and you have to wonder, was he always a monster?

393
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Or was he just a low-level criminal, a thief, a scoundrel, who one day ate human flesh and became a creature?

394
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I mean, that's the origin story of the windigo, is you devour human flesh, you become a monster.

395
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 He became so addicted to the taste of human meat, his last words were about how delicious it was.

396
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 His last words were a yelp review for human meat.

397
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And was it the taste, was it the texture, or was it the power he derived from digesting another human, or all of it combined?

398
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Truly a terrifying story and a true story about a man who became a flesh-eating monster.

399
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 But in his view, he's basically saying, "Don't knock it till you try it."

400
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And that's the scary thought. What if the most powerful drug in the world isn't heroin or fentanyl, but human flesh?

401
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 You just can't stop it, one. Gotta eat 'em all. I'm lovin' it, whichever catchphrase you wanna use.

402
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 What if human flesh is the greatest delicacy that you could possibly imagine?

403
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Now, I don't think that's true. I've never eaten it, but I don't think that's true.

404
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 But to Alexander Pierce, the taste of human meat was so intoxicating.

405
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 He sacrificed his life for just one more meal.
