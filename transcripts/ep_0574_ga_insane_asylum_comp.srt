00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
 Central State Hospital in Millageville, Georgia. A spooky structure that holds thousands of

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,880
 terrible secrets. This insane asylum has been closed for a while now, but its terrors continue

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:25,600
 to haunt the community. So much so that it's possible that a small artifact from this asylum

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,600
 may have caused the murder today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,960
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,120
 of stuff to cover today, so we're gonna hop right into this thing. First off, let's give

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,120
 a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, Nicole Gerrand. Nicole Gerrand, thank you so

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,640
 much for supporting the show. Nicole's doing a little pirouette, so she's getting dizzy,

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,960
 probably shouldn't have driven a vehicle when you're that dizzy, but you're gonna be our

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,320
 captain or pilot this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,360
 help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. Nicole, I'm gonna

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:15,800
 toss you the reins to our newest vehicle, the Carpenter Cart. It's not super impressive,

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,920
 it's just a big old wooden cart. You get to ride a beautiful stallion or giant rabbit.

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,760
 We'll attach it to a giant rabbit. You're riding a saddle. Hope you brought a rabbit

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,320
 saddle. You're riding the rabbit. The rest of us are sitting in a big old wooden cart.

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,000
 And the Carpenter Cart is gonna take us all the way out to Millageville, Georgia. So hop

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,320
 to it, rabbit. It's a super slow journey. We have to buy a bunch of carrots and let

19
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,760
 us along the way. We get there. We're gonna spend the whole episode at Millageville, Georgia

20
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,640
 because there's a lot of craziness that's come out of this asylum. All of a sudden, we travel

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,800
 back in time to the year 1842. So we're all dressed up in old-timey clothes. The rabbits

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,520
 dressed up in an old-timey dress and a little bonnet. Super cute. But Nicole is continuing

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,280
 to lead this way with the Carpenter Cart. Back in 1842 in Georgia, they go, "You know what?

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,120
 We need to put all these people to work building something. What do we build?" And then someone

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,280
 else goes, "You know what? I've noticed we have a huge problem with lunatics in the state. Why

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,680
 don't we build an asylum?" So they do. It's like peanut butter and jelly. They both come together

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,600
 to create the Georgia State-- this is the name of it. This isn't just me listing insulting words.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:30,040
 Georgia State Lunatic Idiot and Epileptic Asylum. And I just imagine underneath it, it says,

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,840
 "And they're stinky, too." Like, how-- I mean, I get it that idiot used to mean, like,

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,400
 not that you're just dumb or that you don't know how to do something. It actually meant that you

31
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,280
 had some sort of medical problem. But, I mean, you could be still a little more sensitive than--

32
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,680
 and again, I mentioned this in another episode. The same thing. I feel bad for the epileptics,

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,920
 because they're just like, "Oh, yeah, you know, I have epilepsy. This sucks." And then they're just

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,760
 housed with much idiots. That's horrible. I mean, because I have a friend who's epileptic,

35
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,360
 and he's totally fine. I mean, other than the epilepsy, but he's like-- he's totally like sane.

36
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,080
 He's not crazy. He's not an idiot. Definitely not a lunatic. So I feel bad for them. I wonder if

37
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,000
 they have their own wing to the hospital, where they could just kind of like hang out by themselves,

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,080
 play Parcheasy, invent Parcheasy, and then play it back in 1842. But you had the Georgia State

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,400
 lunatic idiot and epileptic asylum. So it opened in 1842, so you can just imagine it probably wasn't

40
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,760
 the best place to be. I don't think any place was the best place to be in 1842. But by the 1960s,

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,320
 things were even worse. It was completely overcrowded. The only thing worse than being stuck in a

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,880
 lunatic asylum is too many lunatics. Now, when I say overpopulated, it's not like you-- it was

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,200
 built for 400 people, and there were 600 people. It was basically built for 400 people. I think it

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,840
 was built for about 1,000 people. There were 12,000 lunatics and idiots running around in there.

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,840
 You had a doctor-patient ratio of one doctor for every 100 patients. So let me do my math. What is

46
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,000
 that? 120 doctors? That sounds like a lot, actually. I don't think I've ever been in a play-- I don't

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,560
 even think hospitals have 120 doctors. Actually, it's funny that I say that because it turns out

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,960
 that a bunch of them weren't doctors. The state kept having to go in. There's so many complaints

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,600
 coming about this place. First off, number one complaint was, "Can you guys change the name?"

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,320
 So they did. They eventually changed it to just Central State Hospital. State regulators had to

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,960
 keep going to check this place out, and it turns out at one point, they were like walking down the

52
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,000
 halls, and there were all these doctors hanging out. Plain parts easy. Did you know that? A bunch

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,480
 of idiots invented parts easy. The state regulators were walking through the hospital, and on their

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,800
 count as they were going through, they found 48 doctors working the halls. They weren't even doctors.

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,400
 There were just people walking through, like, "Hey, I'm a janitor. I came in for a janitor job," and

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,080
 then they said, "Hey, do you want to be a doctor?" There was 48 people working there, and one visit

57
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,280
 who weren't actually doctors. And it's not like they were nurse practitioners. They weren't anything.

58
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,600
 They weren't anything. They were just people claiming to be doctors. Not escaped lunatics,

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,520
 by the way. People who would come there to get a job who were getting paid to be doctors who had no

60
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,280
 degrees of any kind. And then, of course, you had the rumors. So those are real. Those weren't rumors.

61
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,880
 Those are actual little things that happen. You had the rumors that kids who were put in the asylum

62
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,840
 were locked up in little cages. And then there are other stories of just inhumane treatment. You'd

63
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,120
 have people who were in straight jackets all the time. They basically lived in the straight jacket,

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,280
 which seems incredibly uncomfortable. I think that's kind of the point. Now, this place,

65
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:42,120
 open in 1846, it didn't close until 2010. Now, I'm not saying it was as bad as 1846. I'm not

66
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,520
 saying the Confederacy was running the place, but when I was reading about it, I was like, "Oh,

67
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,120
 they probably shut it down in the 60s. You know, after they found out there were a bunch of people

68
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,480
 there pretending to be doctors?" No. It was in operation up until 2010. And you can still visit

69
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,560
 it. I don't think you can, like, run around it and play laser tag or anything like that. There are

70
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:08,120
 still a bunch of graves in the area. Now, when I say a few graves, we're talking 25,000 unmarked

71
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,560
 graves. Those don't even include the graves that have a little nice little headstones and stuff

72
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,360
 like that. So this place is ripe for urban legends, right? You have the mass graves. You have the

73
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,120
 verified history of this place. And looking into this, I found a Reddit post from someone who really,

74
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,360
 really, really loves this asylum. I don't think I've ever met such a fan of mental asylums as I've

75
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:42,680
 found in username SixWeird6America6. So that's our source for the rest of this stuff. SixWeird6America6.

76
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,320
 They write out this giant block of text. People are just going, "Hey, do you guys know anything

77
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,680
 wacky haunted places in Georgia?" And someone goes, "Yeah, someone appeared. Someone appeared out of

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,160
 the mist." I know. Thanks for asking, my fellow friend. They're like, "Not your friend, you weirdo.

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,840
 You just magically appeared in my room." SixWeird6America6 has this huge block of text about

80
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,120
 Millageville, Georgia's number one insane asylum. This list includes a bunch of weird details. One

81
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,760
 of them, it keeps going on about this guy named Jim Bonner. He keeps calling him a child murderer.

82
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,760
 And I was like, "Well, I was able to verify that when a lot of them were just like an inmate took

83
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,400
 a hacksaw and chopped off a doctor's neck." And I was like, "I'm sure that happened over the course

84
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,240
 of 100 years. I mean, it's horrific. I'm not being like, 'Yah, no. That's lame. Give me some more.'

85
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,040
 I mean, I'm sure that happened, but I can't verify it." Jim Bonner keeps getting called a child

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,200
 murderer. This is kind of a little, I don't know if I technically call him a child murderer.

87
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,960
 Jim Bonner apparently was a voodoo king, is what SixWeird America told us. And that what happened

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,920
 in real life, I don't know if he was a voodoo king, but he maybe he's just a voodoo prince or a voodoo

89
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:09,000
 duke, but he poisoned a family and it killed the wife and four of nine children. And the

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,640
 dad ended up going crazy and had to be put into the insane asylum where he died shortly later,

91
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,960
 of stomach problems, which is what killed the family. My question is, are you a child murderer

92
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,840
 if some of your victims are kids? Like, is that a rule? I'm not, I don't mean FBI's like, "Oh,

93
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,800
 here, let's listen in on this podcast." But you know what I mean? Like, at what point, like,

94
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,640
 if you went into a town and you shot nine people and four of them happened to be, I don't know,

95
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,240
 Irish, are you then the Irish killer? Like, would that actually be your designation? I'm not saying

96
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,280
 it's okay to kill kids under any circumstances. I'm just questioning him being labeled. I feel

97
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,560
 like I'm a defense lawyer. I'm like, "Sir, listen, yes, my man did slaughter an entire family,

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,240
 but let's not refer to him as a child killer. Just a couple kids died."

99
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:04,600
 Anyway, so child killer voodoo king Jim Bonner, he's included in this list. Apparently, there's

100
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,200
 been a bunch of UFO sightings at one point. Weird America said that there was a, again,

101
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 I would love to verify this. I would love to verify this, but I couldn't. I tried, I tried really

102
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,360
 hard. Apparently, on August 25th, 1887, this saucer-shaped dent in the ground appeared,

103
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,560
 which I think there's a most commonly known as holes. I think there's most commonly known as a

104
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,320
 hole, but anyways, a saucer-shaped dent appeared in the ground. And okay, that's notable, I guess.

105
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:45,160
 But then millions, millions, not 25,000, which is already a huge number, millions of grasshopper,

106
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,720
 not grasshoppers, because again, that would be notable enough. Millions of grasshopper-sized

107
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,200
 frogs jumped out of a hole. I mean, that's the end of the world, right? I mean, that would

108
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,720
 have 100% be in the newspaper. I should have been able to verify that. Millions of grasshopper-sized

109
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:12,120
 frogs jumped out of this hole and they covered 600 feet of ground, which is the least, I don't even

110
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,440
 know why that's in there. That's the least remarkable part of the story. Someone's going to be like,

111
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,200
 millions of grasshopper-sized frogs, but how much ground do they cover? And you're like 600 feet.

112
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,880
 Wow! It doesn't sound like a lot, you can't fit a million of anything in 600 feet. Maybe a million

113
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,920
 needles. I don't even know about that. Anyways, I wish I could have verified that. I wasn't able to.

114
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,360
 So we have UFO sightings, apparently, because there's security around the place. Laser tag

115
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,920
 or not, there's security around the place. You can't get into it because it's an old crumbly,

116
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,600
 most likely haunted and cursed insane asylum. Weird America says that there's security there,

117
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,400
 which is obvious, but they said the security there is actually from the Department of Defense.

118
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,960
 It's a subsidiary of the Department of Defense. This is a high-level government area, most likely,

119
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,240
 because you know, the end of the world started here with the million grasshopper-sized frogs.

120
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,840
 Apparently nearby there's a place called Buzzard Island that has a bunch of buzzards on it.

121
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,120
 Again, not super notable. When we're talking about millions of grasshopper-sized frogs and

122
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,600
 just being a haunted asylum, I don't care how many buzzards are nearby. I've never looked

123
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,800
 into Amityville Horror and go, "But what is their foul population? How many chickens live nearby?

124
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,240
 That'll seal the deal." Apparently there's been stories of cursed devil dolls, human trafficking,

125
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,920
 because you know if you're moving people from one state to another, you know, stop off at the

126
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,600
 haunted asylum, that's a good place to, you know, get your refreshments going. I love this. We have

127
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:50,280
 this great quote, "The asylum and even cemeteries are littered with tons of suicides." Scientific.

128
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,920
 How many people committed suicide last year? Scientists goes, "Tons, tons of people." They're

129
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,520
 like, "Okay, let's put it on a chart. We're done. Tons of suicides." And we have tiny frogs,

130
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,800
 we have Buzzard Island if you're into that thing, you have tons of suicides, you have UFO

131
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:13,720
 sightings, devil dolls, and again, I don't know why they included this, the world's largest kitchen.

132
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,600
 Why? You're trying to wow me, weird America. You're trying to make me go, "Whoa, spooky,

133
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,760
 I don't want to go there." Now I know, first off, I don't think this place has the worlds,

134
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:34,280
 the worlds, the biggest on the planet's kitchen. I'm, I'll believe in grasshopper sized frogs,

135
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:41,400
 a million of them, before I believe that this insane asylum has the biggest kitchen on the entire

136
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,560
 planet. But if it does, if you're really into kitchens and you can get past Department of Defense

137
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,760
 security, here's the place to go, just watch out for the Buzzard Island on the way. There's just,

138
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,560
 and it's a list and list and list of all of these murders. And when I talk about, you know, I can't

139
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,920
 source this, I can't source that, I mean, again, when you're like, Jason, how are you going to find a

140
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,960
 news article from 1887 about millions of grass? First off, that should have been the only news

141
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:13,640
 reported that day in every newspaper ever. Millions of grasshopper sized frogs, that should

142
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,160
 have just been the headline everywhere. I don't know what else was happening in 1887 that would

143
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,920
 beat that out of the news. But then we have this, which again sounds, I wish I could verify this,

144
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,280
 I 100% wish that I could tell you guys that this story was true. I looked really hard,

145
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,040
 it gave me some ideas for future episodes because I have some really cool stuff coming up.

146
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,840
 So in 1975, according to Weird America, a patient escapes from the Allen building.

147
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,800
 He's running away, he's like, oh, how am I going to get away? He sees a buzzard, he grabs onto

148
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,680
 its legs and he flies away on the buzzard. Ha ha, freedom! But he doesn't have a good,

149
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,800
 fun-filled adventure. What he does is he goes to a school, the buzzard's like flying over school,

150
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,760
 and he lets go. See you later, buzzard. He takes the school hostage, he takes 70 children hostage

151
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,680
 and five school staff with an assault rifle. And then we have this, let me read you this exact line

152
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,880
 that was written here. "Teacher, put first off before he does lie to you." Because it doesn't

153
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,160
 make any sense. A guy has a gun, he's taken control of a school, that's obviously tragic, right?

154
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,760
 And everyone's sitting around and they go, well, what do we do now? What do we do now? And then

155
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:29,080
 this happens, this sentence happens. "Teacher puts bullet in backwards, saving everyone.

156
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,760
 Kids grab gun from teenage patient." So I mean, I get what they're trying to say that somehow a

157
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,200
 teacher put a bullet in backwards, but I don't know how or when or why. If you could remove the

158
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 gun, it's not like you remove the gun, put a bullet in backwards and they go, here you go,

159
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,600
 just keep the gun and don't put the bullet in backwards. You have the gun. I mean, they should

160
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,160
 have just said he stuck his finger into the barrel of the gun, the guy pulled the trigger,

161
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,960
 the teacher's hand inflated like a Looney Tune character and smoke appeared and he goes,

162
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,480
 ow, my finger, and then the kids took the gun. Why would you go, just take the gun.

163
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,000
 Did the teacher have bullets on them and they're just like throwing them into the barrel backwards?

164
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,720
 A lot of this stuff you can't verify, but I was able to find a interesting story I was able to

165
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,120
 verify. Nicole, call in that carboner copter. We're going to fly just a short while and we're

166
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,560
 going to use our time travel technology to take us to the year 2019. Very, very recent story.

167
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:38,280
 We're still in Millageville, but we're farther away from the asylum now. Nicole's going to land

168
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,120
 this helicopter in this residential neighborhood. We're just kind of hanging out. It's May 12th,

169
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:52,360
 2019. It's 1 a.m. We're the house of Clark Heindel. He's a 69 year old yoga shop owner, not

170
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,960
 yogurt shop. That would be awesome. And then there's a woman there named Mariana Shockley.

171
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,840
 She's a 43 year old professor at University of Georgia. We were there last week. Also,

172
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,640
 there was Morris Lillard, 41 years old. He's actually Mariana's boyfriend. He's a car salesman

173
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,400
 and I almost will 100% start calling him Matthew Lillard at some point during this story, but

174
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,360
 Matthew Lillard, the actor, had nothing to do with any of this. They're all hanging out at Clark's

175
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,360
 house. They're all hanging out at Clark's house. Clark has a hot tub and a pool. That yogurt money,

176
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,240
 man. Yogurt money can buy you a lot of stuff. He has a pool. He has a hot tub. They're all

177
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 hanging out. And at a certain point, Clark goes, "I'm going to go swim in the pool." And Mariana

178
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,240
 says, "I'm going to sit in the hot tub." And Morris says, "I'm going to go out and chop some wood.

179
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,360
 I'm going to go out into the woods. I'm going to go out into the spooky, spooky forest

180
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,640
 and get some wood." I'm assuming they had some sort of fire there. I don't think that was just

181
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,520
 his fetish. He's like, "Oh, now that I have time alone, I'm going to chop down trees." He goes off

182
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,120
 to chop down wood. He eventually comes back and he sees Mariana just sitting in the hot tub

183
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,240
 and Clark is still doing laps in his pool. His pool shaped like sprinkle toppings.

184
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,000
 And Morris comes back and he realizes Mariana's not moving. She's just kind of sitting in the

185
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,640
 hot tub. And it starts to alarm him. He goes, "Yo, Clark, what's going on, dude? How come Mariana's

186
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,920
 just like not moving? She's an animate. She's human. She should be animate in some form or

187
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,960
 fashion." So he runs over there and he notices that she's not breathing. She's just sitting in

188
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,040
 the water. So he pulls her out of the hot tub and while he's doing it, he says that he bangs her head.

189
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,160
 So save your questions till the end. He's pulling her out of the hot tub and he bangs her head up

190
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,600
 and they begin to do CPR on her. And after about a period of time, some articles say 45 minutes of

191
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,720
 CPR and other articles said for two hours they were trying to do CPR. At a certain point they're

192
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,080
 like, "We got to call authorities. Get some trained people down here." Because I'm pretty sure CPR is

193
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,800
 not supposed to take 45 minutes. So they call ambulance, police, everyone shows up. The cops

194
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:04,760
 say when they walk in, the two guys were super cagey. They weren't really giving direct answers.

195
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,200
 And they also, they could tell they were doing CPR, but again, depending on what article you

196
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:17,160
 read, it was the cops, the cops were suspicious to say the least. They wasn't what you would think

197
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,920
 someone would do if someone had died of their house. So they separated the two people. They

198
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,000
 separated Clark and they separated Morris. They put them in different rooms. They began asking

199
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,120
 them questions. And Morris was like, "Dude, I went out to the woods, shopped out some trees."

200
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,240
 They were all naked too, if that means anything. I don't know if it does, but they're all naked.

201
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,080
 So he's out in the chopping wood naked. The cops thought that was kind of weird. Everyone was

202
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,960
 naked, but maybe some weird sex thing. They don't know. They just want to figure out what happened

203
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,880
 to this woman. At this point, she's picked up. She's taken to the hospital. She doesn't make it.

204
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,480
 She's actually dead. The cops are talking to Maris about what's going on. Clark's sitting in another

205
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,360
 room. He had been interviewed already as the group. I don't think they'd interviewed him as a

206
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:07,800
 individual yet. And then they hear a BAM! They're like, "Oh, great." They go into

207
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,080
 one of Clark's room and he had shot himself. Killed himself on the scene and left a note

208
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,960
 explaining what had happened. He said he was killing himself because he was so embarrassed

209
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,640
 that this woman died at his house. Now, as outside observers, obviously the note said more,

210
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,800
 but that's all we know. The note said that he was embarrassed that this woman died at his house.

211
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,760
 So he shot himself. That doesn't make sense at all. But what's super weird about this is that the

212
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:44,920
 cops are now charging Maris for the murder of Mariana. And this is their story. Something went wrong,

213
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:51,400
 obviously. And he beat her up. And that was why her head had injuries to it. He goes, "No, no, no,

214
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,640
 it's pulling her out of the hot tub." I don't know what to think about this side of the story

215
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,200
 as far as whether or not he did this. I don't know how you would pull someone out of a hot tub

216
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,520
 and it would bash their head up. I mean, I don't... She wasn't like clobbered,

217
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,280
 but she had injuries to her head. I don't understand how you could do that physically.

218
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,240
 What's so weird about this is that Clark and his letter wasn't like, "I did it." It wasn't like,

219
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,880
 as far as we know, the letter hasn't really been brought into evidence. But it's not like Clark's

220
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,720
 letter said, "Maris did it and I'm so embarrassed that I brought Mariana." It's just like, "Oh,

221
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,480
 I feel embarrassed. I can't believe someone died at my house. So I'm going to kill myself."

222
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,320
 Maris is on trial for murder. Maris is saying, "I was out in the woods. The guy that should be

223
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,760
 the suspect is the guy who shot himself the night of the murder. Why am I even being charged with

224
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,880
 this? I wasn't even around when it happened. I showed up. He's swimming. She's dead. And I'm

225
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,400
 shocked that they're actually charging Mar... Again, we don't have all the information, but I would

226
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,640
 be super... I would either say both of them did it or Clark did it. But I don't think... What did

227
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,720
 he do? Like walk off into the woods, sneak back, kill her? And because Clark's letter didn't say,

228
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,400
 "Oh, I know this guy did it." It's super weird. But anyway, so Maris is on trial for this murder.

229
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,800
 And this is currently going on. This trial is currently going on. I just can't imagine...

230
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,000
 First off, I can't imagine killing yourself. Secondly, I can't imagine killing yourself

231
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,560
 because you're embarrassed because someone got murdered at your house or just died at your house.

232
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,400
 And then third, how is he not the big suspect? I would have thought the cops would have been like,

233
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,080
 "Well, he's probably that guy. That guy who's dead the night this other woman got murdered."

234
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,760
 But anyway, so Maris is on trial. The reason why this is tied back into Millageville is

235
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,040
 Weird America. Weird America actually in this giant list of stuff that I kept trying to verify.

236
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,320
 I wasn't able to verify tiny frogs, but I was able to verify this story. I went and I looked

237
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,680
 into this because it said, "A guy did this, killed this woman," and stuff like that. But Weird America

238
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,280
 has a little paranormal spin to this one. I don't know if any of this stuff is true. I don't know.

239
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,040
 Literally any of this stuff is true. But according to Weird America, according to our source,

240
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:17,400
 Weird America, Clark had a six-year-old son who had died of cancer. And Clark was so...

241
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,480
 I'll say this, if this story is made up, Weird America has some serious issues. This story is

242
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,680
 true. That is just really creepy. Clark had a six-year-old son who had passed away and Clark

243
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,960
 began to wander the halls of the asylum to get his mind off of his son, get his mind off of his

244
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,400
 loss. He's like, "I'm gonna go to this spooky, spooky place to not think about my son." While he

245
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,120
 was doing that, while I was taking his daily walks to the spookiest place on earth, he was also like

246
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,600
 trying to research root work, which is an offshoot. It's like a magic branch. So it's basically,

247
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,880
 it's magical stuff, but it's all based around roots and herbs and 11 herbs and spices and all

248
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,760
 this stuff. He was also doing that stuff on May 2019. So earlier that month, before all this stuff

249
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:12,120
 happened, when he was walking around the lunatic asylum, he sees a doll. He sees a doll laying

250
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,280
 there in the dirt. And apparently, I mean, Weird America could be making all this up.

251
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,160
 I don't know if he's like Clark's personal buddy, but apparently Clark's son, Clark's son who had

252
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,480
 passed away, loved to pick up toys and bring him home. Who doesn't? Who doesn't love to do that?

253
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,960
 And so when he's found this doll, he goes, "Oh, this is just kind of what my son would do. I don't

254
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,440
 think I'm gonna let him walk around this spooky asylum with all these frogs and buzzards everywhere."

255
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,520
 But he takes the doll home and this doll is supposedly one of the cursed devil dolls that

256
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,640
 is known to haunt the asylum grounds. And then later that same month, because it was May 12th

257
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,640
 and that happened, he invites those friends over and that happened. Now, there was also another

258
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,160
 detail here, because when the cops came in, they're like, "What is going on here?" They said,

259
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,880
 it really wasn't consistent with CPR. Some stories say they were doing this for 45 minutes.

260
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,080
 Other stories say they were doing it for two hours. What Weird America says was, when they

261
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,680
 brought the body out of the hot tub, the reason why it took so long was because Clark was trying

262
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:19,400
 to bring her back to life, not with proven life-saving techniques, but with root work. He began grinding

263
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:29,960
 up stuff and pouring it into her mouth to cure her of being dead. Apparently, he was also pouring

264
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:37,400
 ayahuasca into her mouth as the cops were coming in the door. Ayahuasca is that super potent hallucinogen.

265
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,920
 I can only imagine what it would do to someone who was brain dead. Like, that would just be insane,

266
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,360
 literally. But he was apparently giving her ayahuasca as the cops were coming in and covering her in

267
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,800
 leaves and things like that. And Marcus, I think it was calling him Morris, it's one of the two.

268
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,240
 It's Marcus. I don't have to worry about calling him Matthew Lillard. It's Marcus

269
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,440
 was thanking the whole time. This looks like some sort of ritual to bring back the dead.

270
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:14,760
 He was very, which is what CPR is, but you know, it works. Pouring ayahuasca into someone's mouth,

271
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:23,480
 who drowned, is not advisable. And then he shot himself. So the story then has another

272
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,240
 paranormal element to it. Again, what's interesting, I always find interesting about people who,

273
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,720
 I don't want to say make stuff up, but people who say stuff that's unverifiable,

274
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,840
 is they have the option of answering all the questions. If you are descended from the Atlanteans,

275
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,280
 you can just make up whatever, because no one can ever prove you wrong, because you're totally

276
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,920
 making it up. I always find it intriguing when people, if they're making it up, get stymied,

277
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,800
 because if I was making the story up, I would say the letter actually said that he was killing

278
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,920
 himself because if this cure didn't work, then he could never bring his son back and da da da da

279
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,920
 and then it fills in the gaps. Weird America doesn't really talk about the letter, doesn't answer all

280
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,320
 the questions, just answer some of them. And I always find that intriguing, because if you were

281
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,640
 100% making it up, you would answer everything. But in this case, Weird America doesn't do that,

282
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:25,080
 so I found that an intriguing footnote. So is it possible that this is just a bizarre,

283
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,440
 true crime story? People were out naked, drinking, having fun, something went wrong, a woman got

284
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:41,720
 murdered? Happens all the time. Happens all the time. Or is it the story of a woman who accidentally

285
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,040
 died and a man who had spent years trying to figure out a way to contact the other side,

286
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,880
 trying to figure out a way to bring the dead back to life? When he is given the opportunity,

287
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,680
 he tries out his root work and it doesn't work. And that's what he's embarrassed about,

288
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,040
 that he could have actually called the cops earlier, but he had spent so much time investing

289
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,440
 his energy into this foolish notion that he can bring back the dead, that when it didn't work,

290
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,960
 he realized he was responsible for this woman's death. Or, let's put on our conspiracy caps to

291
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,840
 wrap this up. Is it possible that all of these events would have never happened if he had not

292
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:32,760
 picked up a cursed doll at a long-closed insane asylum? With him swimming and Marcus out chopping

293
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:41,080
 wood, what killed Mariana? Is it possible it was some darker force at play that was invited into

294
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,280
 Clark's home when he brought in the dusty and muddy doll that he'd found on his journeys?

295
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:55,640
 And if so, where is that doll now? It was once the treasured toy of a child trapped with thousands

296
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:04,840
 of maniacs until it eventually became discarded, another piece of debris littering a cursed hospital.

297
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,000
 Someone brought it home and unleashed that curse, and now that doll is still out there

298
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:18,200
 waiting to be brought into someone else's home. If that part of the story is true, it's still

299
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,800
 out there, it's not like the police would gather it for evidence, so they don't just go around pick

300
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,120
 every spooky thing in a house and go let's take this back to the station. Like, it would have

301
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,040
 still been in his house, they would have had an estate sale, some would have been sold off,

302
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,240
 it could have been packed up in storage and put in some sort of locker. Is that doll still out there?

303
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,560
 Did it somehow find its way back to the asylum? Not like it walked, not like it got a cab,

304
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,920
 I'm talking like it magically disappeared, okay? I'm like what can Spursy Caps on and fade it away

305
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:52,520
 when the cops aren't looking. Where is this doll now? Is there really a cursed doll out there

306
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:59,560
 that if you bring it home within a few weeks, people just die? Obviously that sounds ridiculous,

307
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,680
 but when we explore the world of the paranormal, this stuff is possible, it's definitely more

308
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:10,520
 possible than putting a bullet in a gun backwards without someone seeing. So where is this doll now?

309
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,600
 We may never know the truth of what happened that night at that house, but that doesn't mean

310
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,720
 we shouldn't be safe. It is tempting to take those little trinkets you find out on your walk,

311
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:31,560
 the shiny rock, the discarded toy, the baseball hat covered in leaves, it's very

312
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:40,040
 enticing to bring those things home. A trophy of a fun day out. But be careful the next time you do.

313
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,760
 You may not be bringing home just a trinket, you may be bringing home a curse

314
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,760
 that could kill you and your loved ones. You may be bringing home something much more sinister,

315
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:03,000
 you may be bringing home a vessel that contains the dark energy of 25,000 maniacs.

316
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,480
 Assuming you live by that, assuming you live over there, you're in Alaska maybe like three or four
