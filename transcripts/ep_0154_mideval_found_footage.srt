1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 Was the UN General Assembly recently briefed on alien contact?

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,360
 And then we kick off Request Week with something from the conspiracy iceberg, and personally

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,200
 one of my favorite conspiracies on there.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,640
 Medieval found footage, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:32,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode, and not just any episodes, it's the premiere

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,600
 of season 4, episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you're having a great

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
 day too.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,680
 Now, I think I actually, while cooking dinner, disproved evolution.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,800
 How long have humans been cooking food?

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
 100,000 years?

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
 Probably.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
 50,000 years, most likely.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,120
 Yet I still need a pot holder to pick up a hot bowl.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,360
 If evolution was true, my hands should be able to withstand the hottest food.

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
 Possible.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,320
 Now obviously, there's a limit if the food is too hot, like the hot is the sun, or hot

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,440
 is hot lava, I couldn't eat it.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,200
 So there is a ceiling of how hot food can get while still remaining edible, and yet

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,040
 I had to spend 10 minutes looking for the single pot holder that I own so I could take

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,280
 a bowl out of the microwave.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,640
 Your move Charles Darwin.

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,000
 Now you could easily say, "Jason, why do you only own one oven mitt when you have two

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 hands?"

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,240
 And two, how do you lose a thing that's bigger than a human hand?

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,760
 And my response to that is, "Your move Charles Darwin, you can't judge me for my pot holder

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
 losing this?"

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,480
 Or the fact, well that should explain why I only have one pot holder, because I lost

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
 the other one.

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,880
 "Your move Charles Darwin."

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,680
 Okay, let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,280
 Actually, before I do that, my friend Mitchum sent me a trailer for a movie, the title sounds

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,960
 completely ridiculous, but the movie looks incredibly good.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,640
 I've seen movies like Helen Keller vs. the Night Wolves, which I couldn't finish it,

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
 it was so bad.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,640
 And I saw FDR American Badass, which was actually pretty good.

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,120
 So when Mitchum sent me a trailer for a movie called "The Man Who Killed Hitler" and then

38
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 "The Bigfoot", I had really low expectations, but the movie stars Sam Elliott, the trailer

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,400
 looks great, it looks like they took a ridiculous plot and are playing it as seriously as possible,

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
 it looks beautiful as well.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,680
 This man, you go back in time, not literally, but you see him kill Hitler and then the government

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,400
 enlists him to kill Bigfoot, who is spreading some sort of deadly pathogen across the wilderness.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,440
 Looks really good actually, so I'll put the trailer in the show notes, check it out.

44
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,840
 Now our first story, we had a couple big stories pop up while I was taking my vacation.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,280
 And this was one of the ones that popped up.

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,940
 And at first I was, a lot of people are going to go, "Oh, I already know how the story ends

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,360
 because you know you're following it on 4chan, but give me a second because I found a new

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
 piece of evidence."

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,960
 But for those who don't know anything about the story, what happened was on January 29th,

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,400
 the video was uploaded January 29th, 2019, I should say in case you're listening to this

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
 episode 10 years in the future.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,320
 This video was uploaded on January 29th, 2019.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,240
 And it is a video of the United Nations General Assembly and it starts off saying, "There's

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,160
 no videotaping allowed, this message cannot be reproduced anywhere, it's like a crime."

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,760
 You see a young woman walk up to the podium and get stuff ready.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,040
 You see an older gentleman off to the left standing there and as he moves backwards his

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,960
 hands kind of sway side to side.

58
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,560
 And you see a very attractive woman sitting in a chair waiting for her turn to speak.

59
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,520
 Now that woman's name is Alia Prokofyeva.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,880
 I bet you missed those mispronunciations for a week.

61
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,080
 Anyways, she describes herself that she is ahead of something called Galactica.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,520
 I went to her LinkedIn profile, she is trying to set up the first city in space.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,520
 So she's kind of like this expert, self-proclaimed expert, I'm not for sure.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,440
 So you do have experts go to the UN from time to time, not everyone who speaks there is

65
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 a world leader.

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,000
 She goes up to the podium and she says, she reveals this message and the video quality

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
 is really bad because it was supposedly recorded on a cell phone.

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,960
 Every so often you see a black image move in front of it and the idea is that the person

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,600
 who's recording it is trying to shield the cell phone camera from view and the audio

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,640
 quality is bad as well because it's not an official video.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,120
 So you're basically just getting the audio from the phone.

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,640
 She goes up to the podium and says, back in December a pyramid shaped UFO was sighted

73
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,760
 over the Pentagon in Washington DC and we don't know what it was.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
 It's possibly extraterrestrial.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,040
 What makes this visitation curious is that the pyramid began broadcasting a pattern that

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
 matches a pattern from a nearby star system.

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,600
 Now we do have things called pulsars.

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 We don't have them.

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 Nature has them.

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
 The universe owns them.

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,200
 But there are stars that rotate and they can let off these radio bursts.

82
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,920
 We pick up when we first discovered them, we thought it was alien life because of the

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
 pattern.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,080
 But it turns out it's just a pulsar spinning in space.

85
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,680
 But she says this pyramid shaped UFO matches that frequency.

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,640
 Now there were videos that came out in December of a pyramid shaped UFO hovering over Washington

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
 DC.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,800
 Those videos themselves are interesting because one, they look real-ish.

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,520
 Nowadays anything can easily be faked, especially because you're running on a cell phone camera.

90
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,460
 Any special effects you put in there, any irregularities in the special effects, a believer will just

91
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,500
 chalk it up to the bad quality of the video.

92
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:57,080
 When I saw the video over Washington DC, my first thing was that Washington DC is heavily

93
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,480
 populated so why am I only seeing a couple angles of this thing?

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,800
 There should be thousands of videos, even if the mainstream media didn't cover it.

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
 The thing was huge.

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,400
 So she says this is what happened.

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,920
 Now the video got uploaded to YouTube on January 29th and it set the UFO community

98
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
 abuzz.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,480
 They're like oh my god look at this leaked footage that came out of the UN.

100
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,000
 Now when I'm watching it I'm thinking if this video footage is real, YouTube would take

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 it down.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,700
 The governments of the world would immediately go whoa, whoa, whoa, that video is not supposed

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
 to be up.

104
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,860
 It wasn't even supposed to be videotaped.

105
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,800
 Can you please shut down this, take this channel offline?

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 And it's still there.

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,700
 It only has 60,000 views so it's not a ton of views but it's there.

108
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,140
 It was on 4chan.

109
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,920
 4chan is generally known to be monitored by at least the US government.

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,840
 So the fact that it's still up kind of takes away its credibility.

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,520
 If you go to that video and all the links are going to be in the show notes of course,

112
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,920
 but if you go to that video it links to an original video, that channel is taken down

113
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,200
 but that could be part of the LARP.

114
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,440
 I could easily set up a channel, delete it, and then link a video to it and be like oh

115
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,560
 the original channel was deleted but this is the video, so that's easy to fake too.

116
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,760
 But UFO people, especially on 4chan, were like oh my god what do we do with this, here's

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,280
 this woman talking about this thing.

118
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,880
 Now the debunking to it, and this is where people are like yeah I know this part but

119
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,480
 I have to go over this and don't just skip ahead because there's something, there's another

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,560
 additional detail to this.

121
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,200
 The debunking to it is earlier in the year I believe, it might have been the previous

122
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,920
 year, Erdogan, Erdogan I believe is the president of Turkey, if I'm pronouncing his name right,

123
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,120
 which I'm most likely, I'm not.

124
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,120
 He gives a presentation to the UN and when he is talking to the United Nations you see

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,360
 a young woman walk up to the podium, get everything ready.

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,200
 You see a man, an old gentleman kind of stand into the side and he steps back and his hands

127
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
 are kind of moving.

128
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,680
 It's the exact same video, except for a few key details.

129
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,120
 One, the young woman, uh, Aliyah, is not giving the speech, she's nowhere present in the video,

130
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
 instead it's Erdogan.

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,840
 The film quality is much better, it's digital video, it's basically high end digital video

132
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,120
 because it is the United Nations, it's not like they have money problems.

133
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,680
 The sound quality is much, much better, the cell phone video is really tinny because it's

134
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,560
 supposedly on a cell phone, and there's no hand ever kind of blocking the view.

135
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,760
 And so the debunkers go, "Lookit, this is the video that they took the president, Erdogan,

136
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,240
 out of, put Aliyah in as a deep fake.

137
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,320
 They digitally removed one person and put another person in, dropped the video quality, dropped

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,440
 the sound quality, and presented this as proof.

139
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,680
 You guys are idiots, you guys should never believe this."

140
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,120
 So when I was looking at, I saw the original video, I was like, it shouldn't be online

141
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
 if it's real.

142
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,440
 I think it's kind of suspicious that there's the black hand keeps moving in front of the

143
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,160
 camera, and I'm thinking that could be to clear up, like to kind of block any irregularities

144
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,440
 in the video that they're trying to put out as real.

145
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,000
 So, we talked about deep fakes before.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,480
 Now, it's funny because the first time I came across deep fakes, ICE was seeing pornographic

147
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,600
 images of Gal Gadot's face on a porn star's body.

148
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,760
 Natalie Portman's face on a porn star's body.

149
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,000
 Daisy Ridley's face on a porn star's body, and they were taking these huge celebrities

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,440
 and basically turning them into porn stars.

151
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,960
 And very, very convincing, very, very convincing technology.

152
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,680
 I had never seen a full body deep fake before, but it's the same idea.

153
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,960
 You take thousands of images, you have a source image, and then you have the image you want

154
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,240
 to insert, you remove one image in the porn videos, it would just be the original actress's

155
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,800
 face, put the new face on top of it.

156
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,320
 You could do the same thing here.

157
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,360
 The Alia speaker, she has a shadow, she looks, it looks convincing.

158
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,960
 Again, if she went up and talked about wheat products or the production of corn in Germany,

159
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,160
 I would have had no reason to disbelieve it.

160
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,520
 If the video hadn't started off saying "please don't record", I would have had less reason

161
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
 to doubt it.

162
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,640
 But the fact that they're like "we're going to prosecute anyone who puts this out", I

163
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,320
 was like "okay, they're kind of hyping it up a bit".

164
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
 But here's the interesting thing.

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,040
 So that's the story with that.

166
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 When I first saw the videos, I was like "oh, I'll cover that one, the break's over".

167
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,880
 It's pretty cut and dry.

168
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,280
 You have a, what looks like a fraud when you look at all the evidence.

169
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,840
 You have a video that seems suspicious, and then you find the exact same video at higher

170
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,920
 quality of a different person giving a boring speech.

171
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 Totally different speech.

172
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,560
 So I go "well, that's pretty cut and dry".

173
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,400
 But what happens next is what makes me suspicious about everything.

174
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,160
 January 29th is the you and video uploaded to YouTube.

175
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
 At least the one we can see.

176
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,480
 I don't know about the one that supposedly got the account terminated, but on January

177
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,440
 29th is the video you can watch.

178
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,920
 Video I have a link to.

179
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,800
 January 29th was the same time they're like "nope, this is fake, here's the Erdogan video

180
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 video".

181
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,400
 That whole story kind of happened relatively quickly.

182
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,200
 But also what makes me suspicious about the story is on January 30th, a viral news story

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
 goes up.

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,280
 Look at these wacky deepfakes.

185
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,320
 Look at Steve Buscemi's face on Jennifer Lawrence's body.

186
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 What?

187
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
 This is crazy.

188
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
 Look at this wacky technology.

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,040
 And it's weird because they could have had that same story.

190
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,520
 If you wanted to cover deepfakes that day, if you wanted to make that a viral story,

191
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,400
 the UFO video is a more convincing deepfake.

192
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,000
 Because when you see the Steve Buscemi/Jennifer Lawrence thing, it looks grotesque.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,520
 It looks really really weird.

194
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,040
 It's not convincing in any way, shape or form.

195
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,040
 And I thought why a day after the you and video comes out, which is most likely a fake,

196
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,960
 are they now pushing the story of deepfakes back into the media and showing us a ridiculous

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
 example?

198
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,560
 And they did the same thing over the summer.

199
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,360
 Over the summer is when the trend began of the famous actresses being put on porn stars

200
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
 bodies.

201
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,600
 But when the media covered it, when they showed examples of it, they'd say, "Look at Nicholas

202
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,760
 Cage's face on all of these movie stars?

203
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
 What?"

204
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,840
 And I'm thinking why don't- I'm not asking them to show porn on CNN, but why don't

205
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,640
 they show at least still clips and they could be like, "This is this actress's face."

206
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,640
 This is Gal Gadot's face on Biloxi Blue's body or something.

207
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 That's convincing.

208
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,920
 The skin tone's the same.

209
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
 You can't tell the difference.

210
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,440
 The only reason you know it's fake is because Gal Gadot has never done porn.

211
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,920
 That's the reason you factually know that video is not real.

212
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,120
 So why if they have that did they push the Nicholas Cage's face on in the middle of

213
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,000
 Game of Thrones or whatever it was?

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,080
 Why when they have a semi-convincing deepfake of someone giving a speech to the United Nations

215
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,240
 General Assembly about UFOs do you show how wacky deepfakes are because you have Jennifer

216
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,640
 Lawrence with this grotesque- sorry, Steve Bishammy, but like this weird looking face?

217
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,360
 I think because ultimately deepfake technology, they warn us about it.

218
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,920
 I think their concern is rogue actors using deepfake technology.

219
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,880
 I think the government, I think certain powerful people want to use it for their benefit, so

220
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,400
 they don't want to really show us how convincing it can actually be.

221
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,520
 Because this Ewan video, like I said, if she went up and talked about trade tariffs and

222
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,800
 someone showed me that video I'd be like "why are you showing me this?

223
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
 This is super boring."

224
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
 And then they go "that never happened.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 That's fake."

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,560
 I'd have been like "what?"

227
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
 It's very convincing.

228
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,240
 I think deepfake technology is being planned to be used and people go "oh it's going to

229
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,080
 be used for Pizzagate if Hillary Clinton never gets videotaped eating a baby.

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,480
 I don't think it's ever going to be anything like that."

231
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,960
 I think when deepfake technology actually is used it's going to be something super mundane

232
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,080
 that no one will really question.

233
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 When you talk about UFOs and satanic worship and all sorts of this crazy stuff it's easy

234
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,560
 for a skeptic to go "well that's obviously not true."

235
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,120
 But if they want to have a video of the president talking about a new trade plan with Italy where

236
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,920
 we're going to basically give them all of our money or that's kind of ridiculous too,

237
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,640
 but you know what I mean?

238
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,200
 Something relatively boring, people won't question that.

239
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,360
 And I think there's an actual effort to warn people about deepfakes but not warn them at

240
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
 how realistic they can be.

241
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,600
 Very odd timing.

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,120
 The Steve Buscemi video was uploaded the same day as the UN video.

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,480
 The story got reported the next morning.

244
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,600
 So while all the UFOologists were still debating over the authenticity of this UN General Assembly

245
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,760
 video all of these news websites were like "pfft look at this technology can you believe

246
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
 it?

247
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 It's 2019?"

248
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 Weird.

249
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,240
 Very, very convenient timing.

250
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
 Very convenient timing.

251
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,480
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

252
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,000
 Now our next story was actually a request from Joshua from YouTube and it is one of

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,240
 the ones that I have found the most intriguing on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

254
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,840
 Just the idea I've always found interesting.

255
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,520
 Medieval found footage.

256
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,320
 The phrase itself is very evocative because it makes you think of one of two things.

257
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
 Level 3.

258
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 One, it's fake.

259
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
 It's totally made up.

260
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,840
 It's just three words strung together.

261
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,240
 But that's boring.

262
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
 People always go "what?

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 That's just fake!"

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,160
 And I'm like "yeah probably!"

265
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,560
 But that's not a fun podcast.

266
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,080
 They'll just be like "ah it's fake."

267
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,000
 Like either it's fake for a reason or you go "it's fake" but let's pretend it's not

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 for a second.

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,080
 So it is possibly just three words strung together.

270
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,960
 However, this one has a bit of meat to it.

271
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,080
 So it's one of three things that's either fake.

272
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,840
 It involves time travel which is a nice theory.

273
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,320
 Which is nice, it's evocative.

274
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,040
 And then there's one that I think is more accurate.

275
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,360
 And it's pretty cool.

276
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,320
 So we've already addressed maybe it's fake, maybe it's something people put together,

277
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
 whatever.

278
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 I don't like it, maybe.

279
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 But that's boring.

280
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,820
 Time travel.

281
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,920
 The idea of time travel I think kind of touches people on a personal level because it is a

282
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,000
 it addresses two things.

283
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,720
 It addresses changing the past because everyone has regrets.

284
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,720
 Time travel touches on the idea that we can change our past.

285
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,640
 And two, I think a lot of people don't necessarily wish they could live forever.

286
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,840
 But for me, I want to see what comes next.

287
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,640
 I personally think it would be more fascinating to travel into the future to see what happens

288
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,000
 next.

289
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,680
 And time travel plays on both of those.

290
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,880
 I could fall asleep and wake up a thousand years from now and be like oh my god this

291
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,840
 is awesome there's robots or apocalyptic wasteland, everyone's dead and I'm just kind of stumbling

292
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,440
 around until I fall and my glasses break.

293
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,960
 And I go all the books in the world.

294
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,880
 That's what interesting thing about time travel.

295
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,680
 It kind of plays on both of those things.

296
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,760
 So let's address the time travel theory first.

297
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,840
 And that would be that some archaeologists are digging around in England.

298
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,200
 They got their shovels and the cops are like oh you don't have a permit and they're like

299
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,720
 ah whatever we're archaeology thrown dirt in the cops face.

300
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,920
 They keep digging, the cops are trying to arrest them.

301
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,200
 Not the hammer, the shovel goes ding ding.

302
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,280
 Hit something and the cops are like what's that?

303
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:36,800
 Archaeologist goes, it looks like some sort of film case.

304
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,600
 Test it off.

305
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,440
 Pull it out and it's a reel of film.

306
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,840
 And they're like hmm do you have a projector?

307
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,240
 The cops are like no we don't even have guns over here.

308
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
 Why would you think we'd have a projector?

309
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
 Eventually though the archaeologists pay their bail.

310
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,640
 They go to a local cinema, put the film on the projector and what they see is literal

311
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
 found footage.

312
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,840
 They see film of these medieval people kind of dancing around doing their stuff, making

313
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,520
 clay pots, looking miserable all the time.

314
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,640
 Knights are beating them up, they're all dying.

315
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,640
 Every movie ends with them dying of the bubonic plague.

316
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,040
 The end.

317
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,480
 And the archaeologists are like this is impossible.

318
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,600
 It's in case in this metal tin, it's shot on this camera that we were actually able

319
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,560
 to string up to a projector.

320
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,520
 Maybe it's on like super IMAX film.

321
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,320
 Maybe it's digital film from the future.

322
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,400
 But it's found footage and the idea would be that at some point somebody traveled back

323
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,360
 in time to the medieval period, filmed them doing their things.

324
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,880
 Maybe they were hamming it up for the camera, maybe it was a little Punch and Judy show.

325
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,880
 Maybe, maybe they were videotaping something and the time travelers dressed up as medieval

326
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,280
 people walking around their hidden camera.

327
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,280
 They're seeing this young boy writing stuff and they're like hey, what are you writing?

328
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,160
 He's like I'm a writing stuff.

329
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,480
 And they're like well that's obvious that you're writing stuff.

330
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
 What are you writing?

331
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 He's like oh nothing.

332
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,520
 I just have stories in my head sometime.

333
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,360
 I call this one Romeo and Juliet and they're like your hand name doesn't happen to be William

334
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
 Shakespeare.

335
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,840
 He's like they call me Billy.

336
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,400
 That's in the found footage and obviously apparently it has audio as well.

337
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,760
 But anyways they find this footage and for whatever reason they leave it behind.

338
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,440
 For us to find because if it was just time travelers going back in time filming a bunch

339
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,480
 of dudes dancing around and Billy Shakespeare and then went to the future we wouldn't know

340
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
 it was there.

341
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,920
 So that theory is completely ridiculous obviously and not because I don't believe in time travel

342
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,000
 because I do to a sense but this would require one time travelers to travel back to medieval

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 times.

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,040
 Two, to time travel back to medieval times and use technology that we would be able to

345
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
 view.

346
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,400
 We can't even view right if someone gave me a laser disk right now I'd be SOL.

347
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
 Like I'd be like hey, things.

348
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,280
 What am I going to do with this?

349
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,000
 It's a giant coaster.

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,520
 I can't even view laser disk technology.

351
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,280
 By the time we have time machines going back and forth in time they're not going to be

352
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
 using SD cards.

353
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,800
 They're not even going to be using film.

354
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
 What would they use?

355
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 It would be the same thing.

356
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,560
 Yeah, actually if I had a cell phone, if I went back in time and I left my cell phone

357
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,680
 in the 1980s and I pulled down my SD card they'd be like well okay your fingernail fell off

358
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
 robot man.

359
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,120
 Like they'd have no way of even knowing what was on it.

360
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,880
 So that theory while it is interesting because it's sci-fi-ish it's not very likely at all.

361
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,480
 And I don't think that's what medieval found footage refers to.

362
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,520
 I've seen that theory bandied around a couple times and they're like oh it's about time

363
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
 travelers going back and forth.

364
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,480
 I don't really think that it is what it refers to.

365
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,640
 But I do think the theory has some meat and I think this version is more interesting because

366
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
 it's quite possibly true.

367
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,040
 Let's say the year is 1568.

368
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,520
 Couple peasants running around in the field.

369
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,760
 I apparently in my version of medieval times they just dance and run and don't do any work

370
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,120
 but it was actually quite grueling.

371
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,680
 They worked from sundown to sun up or the other way around.

372
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
 That would be working to the night.

373
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,520
 They've worked from sun up to sun down and then they sit at home in front of the fireplace

374
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,560
 and try to forget their miserable existence.

375
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,440
 So but anyways in my version they're just running around through the fields.

376
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,040
 They're like Gerald Gerald get back to your chores and he's like no way I'm out of here.

377
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,920
 It's 15 whatever year I stand before I don't even remember at this point.

378
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,200
 And these peasants are playing in the woods and this night.

379
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,640
 I don't know what this effect was.

380
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,840
 This night rides up to the peasants and is like the king requires your service peasants

381
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,880
 and they're like oh yeah whatever you say night what are we supposed to do and the night's

382
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,280
 like the king is making a movie.

383
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 Peasants be like what?

384
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
 What's a movie?

385
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,000
 The night's like I don't know.

386
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,640
 You know how hard it is to shrug in armor but I'm gonna do it anyways.

387
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
 I don't know.

388
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,080
 The horse is like they all go back to the castle.

389
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
 Now we know the history of film.

390
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,920
 It's very very well documented partially because film is a document in and of itself.

391
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,520
 It's a chemical process and I'm not gonna bore you with the details of it because it's

392
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,200
 easily you can find on Wikipedia again all the links are below but we can trace it back

393
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,120
 quite a while and before we were capturing because really I say I'm not gonna bore you

394
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,120
 with the process but all film is is a series of pictures and there's it's weird on film

395
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
 I don't know if it's the same with digital but on film there's a black bar between each

396
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,920
 frame but our brain doesn't pick up the black bar because we have this thing called like

397
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,240
 continuity of image and it's weird now because think about it when you sit down and you watch

398
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,160
 a film you're actually seeing a black image what is it 32 frames per second so you're

399
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,240
 seeing a black image 32 times every second and your brain just doesn't process it and

400
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,680
 what's weird is I'm sure some people's brains do I'm sure there are some people whose brains

401
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,480
 don't work right and it must be maddening to have to watch a movie because they'd be

402
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,720
 like oh my god people like this like I'm just seeing a bunch of black every once in a while

403
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,480
 normal people don't see it but anyway so all it is is a series of photographs played very

404
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:20,240
 very rapidly same thing with like you guys know what film is so between film we can go

405
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,600
 all the way back thousands probably about a thousand years if not farther to something

406
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,720
 called the camera obscura and that was film without film it was only what was going on

407
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,600
 outside that was basically a black room with a people not like a pervert's people but a

408
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,720
 people that allowed sunlight to come in and the image was like reversal in the wall it

409
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,120
 got real complicated for me to follow on this stuff but that allowed you that if you sat

410
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,440
 in this dark room through this looking against the wall you could see what was going on outside

411
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,400
 now obviously you just leave the dark room and see what was going on outside but it was

412
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,040
 an early form of a projected image people say that cave paintings on walls could have been

413
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:13,080
 brought from some sort of camera obscura that religious practices could have involved the

414
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,880
 camera obscura thousands of years ago could have been the way to tell stories of myths

415
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,120
 and legends by basically creating this type of room and having people acting it out and

416
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,440
 then it's like appears on the wall so the camera obscura Leonardo da Vinci used one a bunch

417
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,280
 of other old people used one I think Leonardo da Vinci was the one who actually like made

418
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:41,360
 it popular he made it fetch like he created the mainstream version of it and then in

419
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,840
 1827 that's when some guy says you know I'm gonna use that same process but I'm gonna

420
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,400
 take a piece of polished pewter plate with Peter Peckle it's gonna help him with this

421
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,880
 a polished Peter plate and he covered it with something called bitman of Judea the sunlight

422
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,440
 hits the plate using the same thing as the camera obscura and after eight hours he's

423
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,920
 able to wipe off everything that the sun didn't burn in this is weird process and then he

424
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,320
 has an image on a plate of what was outside that is the first like here is a here's an

425
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,560
 image you didn't have to be here to see this here is this image now the limitation obviously

426
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,760
 was that it took eight hours so they didn't have any pictures of people back then so you

427
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,840
 go Jason you said you know camera obscuras existed for a long time and then in 1827 is

428
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,640
 the first time we have a photograph and a photograph is a stepping stone to a film so

429
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,480
 how do you equate that with the medieval times well to do that I'm actually going to talk

430
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,720
 about another recommendation I got a while back I got an email from a gentleman named

431
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,480
 Gary and we were talking about Terare the guy who could eat anything which I love that

432
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,200
 episode he ate a gold fork and the gold fork never came out and so the idea is is that

433
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,440
 he dissolved it and Gary emailed me and he sent me a link to something called aqua regia

434
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,520
 now aqua regia was a chemical it was a chemical combination that could be used to dissolve

435
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,880
 gold and platinum and completely dissolve it so aqua regia was this chemical that was

436
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,160
 made and you're like okay that's a cute story but what does that have to do with anything

437
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:29,400
 you're talking about it was first mentioned in 1300 AD and then in 1600 AD the next time

438
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,280
 we see a reference to this it was written out not as a chemical composition or how

439
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:43,240
 the chemicals work together it was instead a riddle it was a drawing that explained this

440
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:52,120
 advanced chemical process as an image and the process said the process showed a dragon

441
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,120
 and then a fox eating a rooster and the rooster eating the fox and then this is how they deciphered

442
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,760
 this it said the rooster symbolizes gold and the fox represents aqua regia obviously there

443
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,960
 was some sort of key code some guy just wasn't looking at it and going oh yeah that's what

444
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,400
 that means but the repetitive dissolving heating and re-dissolving the rooster eating the fox

445
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,320
 eating the rooster leads to the buildup of chlorine gas in the flask the golden crystallizes

446
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,840
 in the form of gold chloride whose red crystals were known as dragon's blood so you had the

447
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:30,200
 initial recipe of what it does in 1300 AD you then have this coded drawing in 1600 AD

448
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:39,520
 the reaction was not listed in chemical literature at all until 1890 so in that time period people

449
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,320
 had invented the process or discovered the process in 1300 it was referenced again 300

450
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,760
 years later and then it took another two what is that yeah it took almost another 300 years

451
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,120
 before anyone ever wrote it down again but it was still being practiced and in that time

452
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,200
 period if those original documents were destroyed for whatever reason it would have been lost

453
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:10,080
 until it was quote unquote discovered in 1890 so who's not to say that the film all film

454
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,920
 is is a chemical process involving light and material and a chemical dark rooms and stuff

455
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,680
 like that you're mixing these chemicals together you take an image onto a piece of there's not

456
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,520
 magic now I get it the magic of the cinema and all that stuff it's great it's silver

457
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,680
 screen all that nonsense but it's not actual magic it is a chemical process who's not to

458
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:38,640
 say that the chemical process wasn't discovered in 1827 but it was discovered before then

459
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,920
 the proof we have that it was discovered is gone is that a supposition absolutely do I

460
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:50,160
 have any proof of that no I can look at these other things that were lost and then rediscovered

461
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:56,520
 I can say well this stuff happened the biggest obstacle to the idea of medieval found footage

462
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,800
 is this that it took eight hours to produce an image back then I don't want to say well

463
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,640
 maybe they found a quicker way to do it because that's taking it more into the fantastical

464
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,320
 I want to stick with the technology we know they had they had a magic lantern not not

465
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,200
 the literal they had a thing called a magic lantern that you'd have a little image it's

466
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,800
 basically a side projector back then the magic lantern was like in the 1500s it was in the

467
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,680
 medieval times in the medieval times they have this thing called the magic lantern it was

468
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,840
 a projector it was the evolution of the camera obscura but instead of seeing what was outside

469
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,560
 you could have a little piece of glass that was hand painted and you'd put it in and you'd

470
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,000
 put a candle in it or sunlight or whatever and it would project the image on the wall

471
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,640
 just like a slide projector and then people said you know what let's put two slides in

472
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,560
 it and you could show like a little cartoon guy juggling so the basics of the technology

473
00:29:53,560 --> 00:30:00,840
 were there projection glass slides animation to a degree you would definitely see the black

474
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,160
 switch there is the machine slowly clicked over but this technology was in wide use so

475
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:14,120
 the only thing we have to add to have medieval found footage is the real people they have

476
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,280
 the slides of the two people juggling or whatever they want to do the two little cartoon people

477
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:26,400
 dancing but for found footage I want footage of people is it possible that there was film

478
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,600
 footage of people in the medieval times again the biggest obstacle to it is people having

479
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:39,200
 to stand still for eight hours but that's why I use the king example because you're a peasant

480
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,320
 you're going to get your head chopped off if you don't stand in the same spot for eight

481
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,040
 hours and then you just move slightly for the next one and move slightly for the next

482
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,560
 one and move slightly for the next one it would take you know a month to have a good

483
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,120
 five minutes of footage and you know you figure maybe they're sitting down in chairs but it's

484
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,160
 not an insurmountable hurdle to have someone sit in a chair for eight hours and then after

485
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,720
 that move their arms slightly and it would be a great would imagine going to a king's

486
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,480
 house and he's like you know you ever heard of a witch and his guests are like well of

487
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,600
 course which is a real thing we have to like kill twelve of them getting here and king

488
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,320
 goes have you ever heard of the Blair witch and then he has this found footage movie well

489
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,640
 it's not found to him he owns it he made it but imagine going to a royal court and people

490
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,240
 being like oh look at my magic lantern it's two images of this cartoon guy juggling the

491
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,920
 kings like that sucks here's transformers for it took me eight years to film but I did

492
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:52,320
 it it is possible even using the technology the only thing that's not possible is you

493
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,680
 have to go along with me on the journey that the technology got a little more advanced between

494
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,720
 fifteen hundred and eighteen twenty seven regarding that chemical process and the fact

495
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,400
 that we can I can say here's another chemical process that was not mentioned for two hundred

496
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,480
 years people were doing it in that time period but it wasn't mentioned for two hundred years

497
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,880
 I think there is medieval found footage I think that it is very likely that some archaeologists

498
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,480
 found this stuff why it wasn't released I don't know now I want to put my I think it's

499
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,800
 likely but I want to put money on it but it may be out there there may be footage of the

500
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,120
 real Blair Witch there it is a documentary it was an actual witch they were chasing around

501
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,040
 King standing in the corner of the castle at the end camera falls breaks it's over I

502
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,920
 think the idea of medieval found footage is very intriguing and I it's one of those conspiracy

503
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,520
 theories that I actually really like because it's a good one it's a happy conspiracy theory

504
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,920
 it's we are more advanced than we think we are we're more clever as a species than we

505
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:05,320
 think we are that 300 400 years before the official invention of something someone came

506
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:13,160
 up with it used it for entertainment for documentation whatever there's not a lot of positive conspiracy

507
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,400
 theories out there but one of them that we're actually smarter than we give ourselves credit

508
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:26,240
