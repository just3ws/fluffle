1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
 Put down that musket, stop bleeding out of your amputated wounds.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,820
 Is it possible that the Civil War never happened?

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,580
 We'll take a look at that conspiracy theory and then we travel into the world of the internet.

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:31,840
 To take a look at a very plausible theory, is it possible that YouTubers are possessed by demons?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,220
 [music]

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,580
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,160
 This is actually our first episode back in the haunted closet, so it's gonna sound a

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
 little bit different.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,800
 I've been doing a lot of episodes out in the living room, because I've been recording later

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 at night.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,840
 But I think we'll be back in the haunted closet.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,800
 I think it definitely sounds a little more professional in here, but you guys let me know.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,460
 Someone who always lets me know how good the podcast is walking into Dead Rabbit Command

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,000
 right now is one of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,820
 And give it up for Greg Gorley.

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
 Woohoo!

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,220
 Yeah, walk on in Greg, walk on into Dead Rabbit Command, longtime supporter of the show, Greg.

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,420
 Greg, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,780
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand, I really do.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,180
 Just help spread the word about the show, that helps out so much.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,740
 We are once again going to do our Christmas livestream episode on Christmas Day, December

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,580
 25th at 12pm Pacific Standard Time.

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,200
 If you want to join us for that livestream, head on over to YouTube.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,080
 I will be recording it for the podcast as well, and the audio quality will be better

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 for that as well.

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,520
 I'm gonna work it out, so I'm recording the livestream on this mic.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,840
 Last time it was pretty, pretty lame, pretty lame audio quality for the podcast people,

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,320
 so I apologize for that.

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,640
 But join us for Christmas if you can, if not, it will still be available for you.

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,280
 Greg, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,240
 Let's climb up to the highest point on Dead Rabbit Command and jump off.

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,940
 Just all the way out to Gettysburg.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,540
 We're at Gettysburg, we're walking around, we're like picking pellets out of the trees

37
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
 and putting them in our pocket.

38
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,100
 I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to do that.

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,260
 I was like, oh look at these human remains.

40
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,740
 I bring a duffel bag.

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,660
 I think Gettysburg is like a national park at this point, or a national historic area.

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,580
 I don't think you're allowed to, you're rolling cannonballs after people, you're like, hey

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,060
 I can do this, it's historical.

44
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,280
 I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to take anything from there.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,880
 Walking away with headstones.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,880
 Gettysburg, if you don't know, was site.

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,560
 This is where Jason, you don't know either.

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,440
 I know you didn't actually research Gettysburg.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
 Hold on, hold on.

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,200
 Gettysburg was the place of a three day battle.

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,480
 It was one of the, if not the deciding factor of the Civil War, where the north and the

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,560
 south clashed forces.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,520
 We've covered the Civil War a couple times on this show.

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,300
 A long time ago I made a reference.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,540
 I used to be like a big Civil War guy.

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,100
 Gettysburg, the site of this decisive battle.

57
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,380
 When we were walking around, I got out and sat in that little picnic.

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,980
 I got some sandwiches and I'm dropping down a little mat and I go, hey sit down, sit down

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
 next to me buddy.

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,540
 We're going to eat sandwiches and we're going to look over this vast battlefield.

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,100
 But I want you to imagine, as you're just seeing these rolling hills of green, I want

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,040
 you to imagine what it must have been like during the actual battle of Gettysburg.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,760
 People getting shot and rolling around and be like, ah, and then people faking it.

64
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,000
 They're like, I don't want to fight anymore.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
 I'm going to pretend I got shot.

66
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,720
 It must have been absolute chaos.

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:06,600
 But the other day I came across this post, someone posted on the X board.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,700
 This is a super interesting question and it should have a pretty basic answer.

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
 Maybe it does.

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,460
 Let's explore it together.

71
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,160
 Someone posted on the X board the other day, did the American Civil War really happen?

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,980
 And I go, oh, okay, interesting.

73
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
 Let's take a look.

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,620
 Let's take a look at this conspiracy theory.

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,180
 And it's pretty much summed up into just one argument.

76
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,680
 Why are there no photos of battles?

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,880
 There's not a single photo of troops fighting.

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,760
 That's an interesting question.

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 I mean, I believe that the Civil War happened.

80
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,240
 Let's take a look at what this guy has to say.

81
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,400
 He goes, there's no photos of combat.

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,760
 He goes, there's only photos of people camping.

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,060
 And he starts posting these photos and these are authentic photos from the Civil War.

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,340
 It would be like two or three tents and maybe 12 guys outside the tents camping.

85
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,820
 Now the photos will be labeled.

86
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,660
 These are Union troops the night before Gettysburg, the night before the most exciting battle of

87
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,660
 the war.

88
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,300
 But here's a photo of 12 people cooking beans.

89
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,600
 And he posted quite a few photos.

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,160
 This guy, I read a lot of nonsense online with zero backing, at least this kind of

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
 bunch of photos saved to his computer.

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,840
 He keeps posting photo after photo after photo of people camping.

93
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,240
 And I'm looking at these photos and I don't know much about it.

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,280
 I had to do some research for the history of the camera to present this.

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,160
 So as I'm reading these posts, I'm also googling like, how was camera technology during the

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
 Civil War?

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,500
 Why don't we have any photos of battles?

98
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,540
 That question is answered online.

99
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,060
 And I'm kind of looking between the two.

100
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,540
 I keep going back to the X page and I keep researching the history of the camera.

101
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,260
 Let's get into the camera thing first.

102
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,100
 There are articles, there's an article from Thought Catalog and it's entitled, Why Are

103
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,940
 There No Combat Photographs from the Civil War?

104
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,220
 So this is a question people have asked previously and they go, camera technology was pretty

105
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,940
 advanced at the time of the Civil War.

106
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,680
 It was no longer that you had to stay in one place for five minutes to get a photo.

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,680
 Photos could actually be taken in three to fifteen seconds.

108
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,840
 You could get a photo, almost an instant photo.

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,760
 If people were moving, the photo was a blurry.

110
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,640
 But if people were standing there for three seconds, you could get a very, very crisp

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
 photo.

112
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,880
 They said the thing is, is they use something called the wet plate technique and that required

113
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,060
 the photographer to mix the chemicals themselves to put everything together to insert the plate

114
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,020
 and to snap the photo.

115
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,820
 So one of the reasons why there are no photos of combat during the Civil War was because

116
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,380
 the chemicals are volatile.

117
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,780
 It's not the easiest thing to mix in a room, let alone on a field.

118
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,620
 Let alone when you are getting shot at.

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,980
 It's not super safe to be mixing chemicals too.

120
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,220
 They said the equipment was about fifty pounds.

121
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,360
 So even to lug the stuff around, it was quite hard for the photographer.

122
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
 And they said the chemicals, they're hard to mix.

123
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,160
 I mean, you could get pretty quick at mixing the chemicals, but they're also just hard

124
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,520
 to transport.

125
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,320
 They could go bad, all of this type of stuff.

126
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,760
 Plus the wet plate method was glass plates, so everything's pretty fragile.

127
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,000
 But what's interesting, so I'm reading now, I go, okay, that's interesting.

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,960
 And it's interesting that people have asked this question before.

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,420
 The thought catalog already had an answer ready to go.

130
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,820
 But they keep saying about the photographer getting shot at.

131
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,500
 Photographer trying to do this, cannonballs coming, photographer trying to do that, there's

132
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
 a cavalry charge.

133
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,660
 What's interesting was the person who was posting this on the X-Board was also getting

134
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,540
 these type of debunks.

135
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,060
 And they go, people would have picnics and watch Civil War battles.

136
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,780
 It was like the very first big battle of the Civil War.

137
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,960
 A bunch of people showed up to have a picnic and it was so bloody and horrible that the

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
 people who were having the picnic were like, let's get out of here.

139
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,480
 I mean, they were far enough away that they weren't, they weren't under fire, but it was

140
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,920
 far more horrendous than they had thought.

141
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,280
 So they packed up all their stuff and all the picnic goers started going home.

142
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,680
 And then when the losing army of that battle went to retreat, they were stuck behind all

143
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,380
 these picnickers and they were getting picked off.

144
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,500
 So you did have enough picnickers there that weren't in danger during the battle.

145
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,380
 It was only when they tried leaving when they started this whole clog.

146
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,220
 This was a thing that people were doing back then.

147
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,540
 He goes, why didn't the cameraman just set up there?

148
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,660
 I mean, obviously if you could have a picnic and you could see the battle, then you don't

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,540
 have to have the camera right behind the troops.

150
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,680
 Put it up on a hill with everyone else who's picnicking.

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,160
 50 pounds isn't a lot.

152
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,240
 50 pounds isn't a lot.

153
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
 People were carrying more than that.

154
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,280
 There were on-the-go sketch artists.

155
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,320
 I mean, they weren't carrying around 50 pounds of paper, but we did have artists embedded

156
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
 with the troops.

157
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,360
 They would draw sketches and then they would send it out to the newspapers and the newspapers

158
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,960
 would turn the sketch into an etching.

159
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,340
 So we had that going on. You did have people documenting it.

160
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,740
 You had medics out there with heavy equipment.

161
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,060
 You had obviously military personnel out there with heavy equipment.

162
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,940
 And there is not a single photo of a battle of the Civil War.

163
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,060
 I'll put a little asterisk there.

164
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,860
 This is what I love about the export, right?

165
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,820
 And we'll get into one more creepy component going on in the story.

166
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:05,360
 You did have someone else jump on the export and go, "There are two photos of battles

167
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
 during the Civil War too."

168
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,360
 And it was so funny because the thought catalog didn't have them.

169
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,720
 It was some guy just had them saved to his computer.

170
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,320
 They're naval battles.

171
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,160
 There's two photos of ships firing at other ships during the Civil War.

172
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,240
 And what's interesting is they're a little blurry because things are in motion, but you

173
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,620
 know, if someone tells you these are Civil War boats shooting at each other, you could

174
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,700
 tell what it was.

175
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,380
 One of the photos was clearly shot on a beach and you could see other people on the beach

176
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,780
 and they didn't look like soldiers.

177
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:46,060
 It looked like people showed up at the beach to watch these two ships fire at each other.

178
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,740
 So if we can have the photographs of the boats, why couldn't there be a camera set up on a

179
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,180
 hill?

180
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,320
 And since there were zero photographs of any battles during the Civil War, which took place

181
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,800
 over the course of years, you imagine a newspaper that could publish photos as blurry as they

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,320
 might be.

183
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,560
 They would just be running those constantly.

184
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
 Go get up on a hill.

185
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
 You can see where all those picnic people are.

186
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,400
 Get up there and take a picture.

187
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,560
 What's interesting to me, the conspiracy theory itself is pretty interesting.

188
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,020
 We've covered stuff like that before.

189
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,420
 Was World War II real?

190
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,860
 We did an episode on that.

191
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,940
 Do nuclear bombs actually exist?

192
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
 We did an episode on that.

193
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,420
 I'll put those in the show notes.

194
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,620
 The idea, I think we've talked briefly about the idea that Civil War, the Civil War was

195
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,460
 fake, but I think I just kind of glossed over it.

196
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,740
 This is something we can really jump into with both boots.

197
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,220
 But it's an interesting question.

198
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,220
 Has an interesting answer?

199
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,300
 It doesn't fully answer it.

200
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,360
 I think they still could have gotten photos of these mass battles.

201
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
 That was another thing.

202
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,760
 He goes, "We always hear about these battles taking place between 10,000 troops versus

203
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,000
 15,000 troops."

204
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,040
 He goes, "All the photos show 12 guys."

205
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,200
 Maybe there's another photo that shows 40 guys.

206
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,600
 Maybe you get the rare photo that shows a couple hundred guys.

207
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
 Where are these photos of 10,000 people marching onto this battlefield?

208
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,840
 They don't exist.

209
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,300
 There are photos of huge camps.

210
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,220
 Lots of photos of people camping.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,820
 This is another interesting way, the way Victor's write the history book.

212
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:32,380
 There's photos of Confederate dead bodies being loaded onto wagons by Union soldiers.

213
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,900
 There's photos of that because they go, the photographers were free to take pictures after

214
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
 the battle when they were safe.

215
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,740
 But you know, if they're up on a hill, they're safe too.

216
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,740
 There's photos of Union soldiers loading dead Confederates onto the back of wagons.

217
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,280
 And I was reading this article and they go, "See, the Union, they buried their dead, but

218
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,360
 the Confederates, they left their dead behind and it was up to the unions to clean up their

219
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
 mess."

220
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,920
 And I go, "That very well may be true."

221
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,840
 But just in that sentence, it puts a little mark on history.

222
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,320
 I mean, the Confederates were fighting to uphold slavery, right?

223
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,480
 They wanted to keep their economy going and their economy was slave-based.

224
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,660
 And it adds a level of extra barbarity when you go, "Oh, they can't even bury their

225
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
 dead.

226
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,660
 They don't even try to bury their dead.

227
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,340
 We have to bury their dead."

228
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
 So we have photographs.

229
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,060
 And what's interesting about those photos, they're not blurry.

230
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,700
 So it's like they're posed.

231
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,540
 What's interesting is that there's a photo, it'll be in the show notes.

232
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,340
 The horse's head is blurry because the horse was moving during that three to 15 seconds.

233
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,780
 But everyone else is crystal clear.

234
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,960
 It's like they're just posing.

235
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
 Like the photographer said, "Okay, everyone freeze.

236
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,520
 I mean, they're loading dead bodies up on a wagon."

237
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,240
 Everyone's perfectly still to take the photos.

238
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
 Super fascinating.

239
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,960
 Propaganda, again, in the South, there's so much stuff that I don't agree with.

240
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,760
 It's not just that they weren't burying their dead, but the way you can structure these

241
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,440
 sentences in these articles, that is propaganda.

242
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,160
 They didn't even bother to bury their dead.

243
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,960
 We had to do it.

244
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
 Interesting.

245
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,600
 It's also interesting, we hear a lot about nuclear bombs being fake.

246
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,860
 You really, Jason, actually never heard that until you mentioned it 10 minutes ago.

247
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:23,100
 Nuclear bombs being fake is a fairly fast growing conspiracy theory.

248
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,900
 There's that new Christopher Nolan movie coming out called Oppenheimer about the guy who spearheaded

249
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,060
 the invention of the nuclear bomb.

250
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:39,820
 Christopher Nolan is not a big CGI guy, so he recreated a nuclear explosion using conventional

251
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,080
 explosives.

252
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,640
 This is a big technological feat.

253
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,880
 You'll see articles on this, like, "Wow, he actually was able to perfectly recreate

254
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,880
 a nuclear explosion simply using conventional explosions, the way everything billows out,

255
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,120
 the shockwave, the mushroom cloud, all that stuff."

256
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,200
 You're gonna start seeing this nukes were fake again.

257
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 You're gonna see a lot more.

258
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,080
 I really think this movie's going to speed up that conspiracy theory, because the idea

259
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,820
 is not that Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren't bombed.

260
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,740
 The idea is they weren't bombed with nuclear weapons.

261
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,220
 Nuclear weapons don't exist.

262
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,660
 They just had a ton of conventional explosives dropped in those two cities.

263
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
 That's it.

264
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,660
 They're not saying that it never happened.

265
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,260
 They're just saying the nuclear bomb creates the same explosion as just a small, it's a

266
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,900
 smaller constructed bomb.

267
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,220
 If you wanted to do that level of damage, it would take far more munitions.

268
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,960
 And now that you have a filmmaker recreating a nuclear blast, which is a cool technical

269
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,680
 feat, you're gonna see that pop up.

270
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,760
 But yeah, it's very, very fascinating conspiracy theory.

271
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,120
 I'm sure the Civil War is real myself.

272
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,520
 A lot of people said you can go to Gettysburg and you can pour bullets.

273
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,560
 You can pull little BBs out of the trees and stuff like that.

274
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,080
 And it's interesting his counteraction was that like, "It's not what I'm asking.

275
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,160
 I'm not asking if you can find BBs in trees."

276
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,300
 Show me a photo.

277
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,580
 Show me a photo of a battle that was he came in laser focused.

278
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,860
 The more focused and most conspiracy theorists come in with.

279
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
 Fascinating.

280
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,840
 And what if that's the reason that's the real reason you can't pull BBs out of trees at

281
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 Gettysburg?

282
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,660
 Not because it's a national park, but you take it home.

283
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
 You're like, "What?

284
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,620
 This was fired by a red Ranger BB rifle in the 1950s.

285
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
 It's all fake."

286
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,380
 Then you get assassinated with a cannonball to the head.

287
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
 Great gorely.

288
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,000
 You get the keys to the carboner copter.

289
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
 We are leaving behind Gettysburg.

290
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:46,160
 Fly us all the way out to a Popeyes chicken.

291
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,840
 I listen.

292
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:57,080
 I'm probably going to regret doing this segment.

293
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
 Generally I have a rule.

294
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
 I don't tell people what I don't like.

295
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,660
 I tell people what I don't like in real life.

296
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,420
 The waiter's like, "Do you want onions on this hamburger?"

297
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,820
 I was like, "Oh no, I can't tell them onions suck."

298
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,620
 I was like, "Yes, extra onions please."

299
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,380
 It's not good form if you're putting out the content on the internet especially to say,

300
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,720
 "I hate my little pony."

301
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,940
 Because you know that for the next six months, if you're lucky, it could go on for the rest

302
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,060
 of your career, people are going to send you my little pony emails.

303
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,840
 It's lighthearted, it's someone just joshing you.

304
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,000
 Or it's someone who hates your guts and they're like, "I'm going to fill his mailbox with

305
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,120
 my little pony pictures."

306
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,560
 It's not a good idea to tell people what you hate.

307
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,280
 I can't say that I hate, I definitely don't hate this guy.

308
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
 I definitely do not hate this guy.

309
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,560
 But he, I'm sure he's a nice guy.

310
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
 I'm being completely honest.

311
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:03,420
 I don't have anything against this dude, but he repulses me on a level that I can't understand.

312
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,220
 And it's not like I'm repulsed by him physically.

313
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,620
 It's not like when I look at him, I think that he's disgusting.

314
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,700
 It's not that I don't like his personality.

315
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,460
 It's not that I don't like his content.

316
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,500
 I'm not a fan of his content, but it's not like I think there's anything.

317
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,980
 It's nothing personal is what I'm saying.

318
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,800
 But when I watch this content creator, it makes me, I don't have a physical, I don't

319
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,100
 have a problem with his physical form, but he makes me physically repulsed.

320
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,840
 In the sense that I get upset to my stomach whenever I come across this guy.

321
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,220
 I know I'm going to get spammed with emails, pictures and all sorts of stuff.

322
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,440
 But again, I think he's probably a nice guy.

323
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,240
 I think he does have some mental health problems.

324
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,700
 He does admit that he has some mental health problems.

325
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:05,060
 But let's take a look at the story of, sorry, Greg, sorry, Greg, that you're on this episode.

326
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,460
 Nico Cotto Avocado.

327
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
 Nico Cotto Avocado.

328
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,380
 Have you guys heard of this dude?

329
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,940
 I, he's a YouTuber.

330
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,460
 I had no idea who he was for years.

331
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,780
 It was maybe only like a year ago.

332
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:26,200
 When I first heard about Nico Cotto, we'll call him Nico for short.

333
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,080
 His real name is Nicholas Perry, but Nico, the very first time I saw anything about this

334
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,840
 guy, he made a video.

335
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,800
 Oh dude, I was like, I would, oh, I would sue.

336
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,200
 If I was the CEO of Popeye's Chicken, first off, I'd constantly be sneaking out to go

337
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 get KFC.

338
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,560
 I was like, oh, my secret chain.

339
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,460
 Why couldn't I have been the colonel instead?

340
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,140
 If I was the CEO of Popeye's Chicken, I 100% would have been like, sue this dude.

341
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,660
 Because I think I've been to a Popeye's Chicken once in my life.

342
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,620
 It was okay.

343
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,340
 But I don't know if I could ever eat there again.

344
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:17,840
 Because the very first time I saw a video by Nico Cotto, he pooped his bed.

345
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,280
 And the video was him walking around his living room being like, Popeye's Chicken sandwich

346
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,320
 made me poop my bed.

347
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,920
 And he's like singing this little diddy.

348
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 And then he throws the blankets back and there's this huge, like, wet orange stain in his bedsheets.

349
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,720
 Because apparently it was like a Popeye's Chicken's eating Popeye's right now.

350
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,220
 Like extra sauce please.

351
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,960
 Apparently it was like this hot chicken sandwich that had like some sort of fire sauce on it.

352
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,600
 Some sort of orange grease.

353
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,280
 And he had eaten this and pooped his bed.

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,960
 He pooped his bed.

355
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,280
 And he's singing a song about Popeye's Chicken sandwiches as he's filming his bed.

356
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,760
 It's like a big poop stain.

357
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,100
 It's all orange.

358
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,440
 And his husband is still asleep.

359
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,840
 His husband is asleep in the bed next to this poop stain.

360
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,120
 And he's like, "Wake up, wake up.

361
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
 It just pooped in the bed.

362
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,040
 Popeye's Chicken sandwich made me poop."

363
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,440
 I was like, "This is disgusting.

364
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
 This might be...

365
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,600
 I mean, I've seen a lot of bad stuff on the internet.

366
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
 But this is gross.

367
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
 And I remember thinking, "I would sue.

368
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,780
 I would sue him into oblivion if he said that my chicken sandwiches made him poop his bed

369
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,340
 and then showed the greasy poop."

370
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,940
 People go, "That was fake, man.

371
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
 That was fake.

372
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,700
 You don't understand the art form that Mr. Avocado is all about."

373
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,300
 I mean, he might be just a buffoon as an actor.

374
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,700
 There's a lot of debate about that.

375
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,640
 So let's go over a brief overview of his highlights, quote-unquote lowlights.

376
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,520
 And we're going to take a look at this theory that recently popped up.

377
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:18,960
 Is it possible that Nicocado Avocado has been possessed by a demon of gluttony?

378
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,200
 Because if you have no idea about Mr. Avocado, let me tell you a little bit about them.

379
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 I'm just going to start first.

380
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,720
 I just needed to get that off my chest.

381
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
 I needed to get that whole part off my chest.

382
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,580
 So Nicocado Avocado, he's 30 years old.

383
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:41,820
 Back in 2014, he started making videos where he was a vegan vlogger.

384
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,540
 So he'd talk about his diet, eating celery and peanut butter or whatever.

385
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,380
 And he was a fairly slim guy.

386
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,900
 He seemed quite petite.

387
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,300
 I'd say maybe like 160?

388
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,300
 Maybe.

389
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
 Maybe a little bit smaller.

390
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,800
 Anyways, he talked about just eating vegetables and living a healthy life.

391
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,360
 What happened was he did that for a couple years.

392
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,400
 And then this new trend on YouTube started, or at least it hit the West, called MukBanger.

393
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,560
 MukBanging.

394
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,480
 And that's basically how much food can I stuff down my gullet on camera.

395
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,960
 Now it's originally from the East.

396
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
 It's originally, I think it originated in Korea, Japan, places like that.

397
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
 And they were eating reasonable amounts of food.

398
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,220
 Then it came to America.

399
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,940
 Then it came to America.

400
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,900
 And it was the 10,000 calorie and one meal challenge.

401
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,180
 And Nico left behind his vegan ways and just began gorging himself on fast food.

402
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,300
 Nowadays, he's around 320 pounds.

403
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,500
 So he's put on a huge amount of weight in a very, very short amount of time.

404
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,060
 And his videos really play it up.

405
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,520
 If you look at his thumbnails, I'm going to launch them in the show notes.

406
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,400
 A lot of the videos he's wearing, clothes that are too small for him.

407
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,000
 So his belly, his belly's pretty much exposed.

408
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,520
 The shirt is like tight against his arms.

409
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,280
 And he does a lot of, almost like Chris Farley asked, like, look at how heavy I am.

410
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,040
 I'm laughing, but I'm crying inside.

411
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,120
 He also does a lot of crying.

412
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,340
 There's videos where he's just sobbing as he's eating 10 meals from in and out.

413
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,740
 There's one video called "My New Diet as a Disabled Person" because apparently he broke

414
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,060
 three ribs.

415
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,940
 So now he goes, "Well, I'm physically disabled."

416
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:44,460
 So he started doing videos wearing a CPAP mask, which I'm sure he had laying around.

417
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,460
 When you put on that much weight that quickly, it will compress your lungs.

418
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,680
 You'll have a hard time breathing while you sleep.

419
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,520
 There's videos that thumbnail was him wearing a CPAP mask.

420
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,160
 And I counted.

421
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
 I counted.

422
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
 There was seven.

423
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,760
 There's from like five guys, burger joint.

424
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,080
 He had seven orders of fries.

425
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
 Three burgers.

426
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,800
 Two sodas and a milkshake.

427
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,360
 And then next to those, a greasy brown paper bag, which I can only assume is still full

428
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,680
 of other food.

429
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,740
 And then I didn't watch any of these videos.

430
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,380
 I've watched some atrocious stuff for this show.

431
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,820
 I'm like, "Nick Bates, I'll watch this video."

432
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,660
 The Cotto Avocado, he did another video.

433
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,820
 My New Diet as a Disabled Person.

434
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,220
 Same topic, right?

435
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,260
 Because he just goes through these extremes.

436
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:48,600
 He's him wearing a CPAP mask surrounded by 15 large pepperoni pizzas.

437
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,440
 So I mean, there's so much you could look at.

438
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,680
 I mean, like this guy has basically ruined his body for internet fame.

439
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,640
 And that's kind of the big takeaway.

440
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,040
 There's been a lot of, a lot of people say he's playing an act.

441
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,280
 He actually came out with this video and it was the, I mean, out of all the stuff I've

442
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
 seen about him.

443
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
 I've seen snippets.

444
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,820
 I saw the Stupid Popeyes Chicken video.

445
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,700
 It made me sick to my stomach.

446
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,800
 There's a bunch of photos out there of his butt hole.

447
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,980
 And then there's like Photoshopped photos where his butt, his butt is a couch with a

448
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
 cat crawling out of it.

449
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,980
 I mean, it's like I can't get away from him.

450
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:31,020
 Someone used an AI art to turn him into a nebula, but there's like a black hole where

451
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,700
 his butt holes should be.

452
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,140
 It's all so horrible.

453
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,380
 And a lot of people go, "This is what the internet does to people."

454
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,440
 Like, "We know this."

455
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
 Sometimes people go nuts.

456
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
 Sometimes people are already nuts.

457
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,920
 When we look at someone like Austin Jones, that acapella singer who started manufacturing

458
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:52,200
 child pornography, like he probably was a pedophile.

459
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,960
 And now all of a sudden he had this huge reach and he was like only 28 years old, but you

460
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,680
 can still be a pedophile no matter what age.

461
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,040
 Well, I guess probably for now to kid yourself.

462
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
 I don't know, could you?

463
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,880
 I don't want to research that.

464
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,560
 Anyways, you have people like that.

465
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,940
 I mean, he probably would have been doing disgusting stuff whether or not he was famous.

466
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,460
 Just being famous allowed him access to young girls to make child pornography.

467
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,700
 You have people like there's streamers, like this guy named Wings of Redemption.

468
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:23,260
 He's also another guy who's put on a scary amount of weight and he has these huge anger

469
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,940
 issues and people make him mad on purpose because he like streams Call of Duty.

470
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,980
 And they find out where he's playing and they just stream snipe him and he gets mad.

471
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,540
 He starts smashing everything around in his room.

472
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,440
 Wings of Redemption is probably one of those guys who might have been totally, he might

473
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,640
 have had a much more normal and healthy life and not had these massive anger issues if

474
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,680
 he wasn't famous.

475
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,560
 If people weren't pissing him off on purpose.

476
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,640
 When we look at people like Nicocado Avocado is he just chasing trends?

477
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,200
 Did he start with the first thing like, wow, here's a vegan who's eating an American cheeseburger

478
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
 for the first time.

479
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
 So he does that video.

480
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,880
 And then he starts to get more and more extreme where now it's 10 cheeseburgers.

481
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,940
 Now it's like I'm gonna stay up for 24 hours and eat a cheeseburger for each hour and blah

482
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,500
 blah blah.

483
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,820
 He's chasing those trends.

484
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,780
 He's chasing those extremes.

485
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,620
 It's definitely possible we can look at it like that and there is this video out there.

486
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,500
 It's one of the very few videos.

487
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 I think I've only watched one of his videos all the way through where he's like, you guys

488
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,740
 have all been fooled.

489
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,320
 I'll actually play a clip of it because I think it's interesting.

490
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:46,200
 I feel as if my life has been positioned to where I'm monitoring ants on an ant farm.

491
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,360
 One follows another, follows another, follows another.

492
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,480
 It's mesmerizing.

493
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,640
 It's enthralling.

494
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,380
 It's spellbinding.

495
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,260
 Just look at all these consumers.

496
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:18,060
 All of these lost and bored people consuming anything that they're told to consume.

497
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,540
 I am the villain.

498
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:26,600
 I make myself one.

499
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,840
 And people will consume these stories year after year after year.

500
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:44,320
 Stories that shock, that confuse, stories that are deliberately made to blur the boundaries

501
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,560
 between fact and fiction.

502
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:59,140
 Stories that permeate, infect and linger in the minds of the ants.

503
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,980
 Influence the ants.

504
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,660
 Brainwash the ants.

505
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,780
 You are the ant.

506
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:16,260
 He, that video, it's so interesting because I've watched that video a couple times.

507
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,520
 He is saying it's all an act, but you can tell he's acting now.

508
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,720
 That's not how normal people talk.

509
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,920
 That's how people talk when they want to sound superior and sinister.

510
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,560
 That's not how normal people talk.

511
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,680
 I've met people who are superior and sinister, and that's not how they talk.

512
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,440
 That's someone who was raised on Marvel movies and G.I.

513
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,000
 Joe talks.

514
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Ants.

515
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Ants.

516
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 All of you.

517
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,800
 It's just very, it's fake.

518
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
 He's acting.

519
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,540
 I do think there's probably a seed of truth there.

520
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:57,300
 I do think that he was exaggerating on purpose to get more views, but I don't think, I don't

521
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,660
 think he's acting to the level that he thinks he's acting.

522
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,540
 I think he's more serious about what he's doing than he is.

523
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,060
 But this isn't a social commentary podcast.

524
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:15,020
 I'm not really here to basically doom my email inbox to be filled with nicotto avocado

525
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,040
 images until the end of time.

526
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
 That's not why I'm here.

527
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,040
 This conspiracy theory, it came on the export again the other day.

528
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,000
 They've been putting out some good stuff lately.

529
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,480
 Is it possible that this is a case of demonic possession by some form of gluttony demon?

530
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,320
 And all they had to do was post a photo.

531
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
 The photo's a little photoshopped.

532
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,040
 They gave him red eyes and things like that, but that's an interesting question.

533
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,120
 This guy, listen, am I heaviest?

534
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,440
 I was heavier than 320.

535
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,220
 I got up to 350.

536
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,220
 So this isn't a thing of, oh no, look at how fat he is.

537
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
 Isn't that funny?

538
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,980
 Isn't that a huge moral problem?

539
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
 That's not it.

540
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,380
 I mean, that's not what this is.

541
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,380
 So it's not that.

542
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,020
 It's the fact that he does seem to have made a deal with the double.

543
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,500
 Like, he's very famous.

544
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,460
 He has 5.5 million followers.

545
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,860
 Each of his videos get over a million views.

546
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,820
 I mean, this is how he's making his money right now.

547
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,560
 He's making tens of thousands of dollars, most likely tens of thousands of dollars a

548
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,760
 month, I'd say tens of 20,000 a month, just from these videos.

549
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,720
 I don't think anyone's sponsoring him.

550
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,760
 Popeye's chicken partners with Nicoto.

551
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,920
 I don't think it's that.

552
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,200
 So he's like dependent on this.

553
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,040
 And the question is, is did he make a deal with the devil that he wanted to be famous?

554
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,960
 And this is the pit he's stuck in.

555
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
 It's super interesting.

556
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,040
 I was reading a little bit about his life.

557
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,580
 He originally wanted to be a musician.

558
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,840
 He was like a classically trained musician.

559
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,300
 He's living in New York and he used the term, which I think a lot of artists feel like they

560
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,420
 are, it was like being a little fish in a big pond.

561
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
 Especially in New York, right?

562
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,500
 If you want to be a musician or an actor and you're in New York, everyone's a musician

563
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,100
 or an actor.

564
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,540
 And people already have an issue where they don't feel special.

565
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,820
 Most people don't feel special.

566
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,320
 And now you don't feel special.

567
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,240
 If you don't feel special and you're a welder, you can probably figure that out.

568
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,720
 You can probably figure out that everyone's the main character in their own story, but

569
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,360
 a background character in someone else's.

570
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,360
 And what does special mean?

571
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,720
 But if you're in the creative arts and your job is being creative and you're constantly

572
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,360
 seeing people who are less creative than you getting jobs or you feel they're less creative

573
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,760
 than you or less talented than you getting jobs, your non-special nature is getting reinforced

574
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
 every single day.

575
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,540
 If you're a welder, they're not like, "Johnny, you made a cool smiley face on that oil rig

576
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,020
 we welded the other day.

577
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,860
 You're promoted for being extra special."

578
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
 You know what I mean?

579
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,060
 It's not constantly in your face, you're not constantly getting reinforcement.

580
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,660
 That you're not special.

581
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
 You're a welder.

582
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,620
 Your job is not about how special you are.

583
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,340
 So he goes from being a struggling artist to very famous.

584
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,260
 In the world of YouTube it's funny because most people around the world would have never

585
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,140
 heard about this guy.

586
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:19,940
 But if you're huge in just your scene, that's good enough.

587
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
 That's good enough.

588
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,640
 And so the question is, did he, and I think this is a valid question because I can't,

589
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,480
 this isn't, not everything boils down to me, but I couldn't put my finger on it because

590
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,840
 again I don't have a problem with overweight people.

591
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,360
 I don't even have a problem with people eating 10,000 calories in a meal.

592
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:47,260
 But when I look at video footage of this guy, it may, I get physically repulsed and I couldn't

593
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,380
 figure out what it was.

594
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:55,340
 But it could be that he is possessed by a demon.

595
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,620
 Because it does seem like that.

596
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,660
 It does seem like he's been possessed by some sort of demonic entity that he made a deal

597
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,640
 with maybe not even consciously.

598
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,820
 But I just get that fee.

599
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:14,840
 This is, you may totally love his content, you may not get that feeling.

600
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,400
 When I look at him, I feel like I'm not looking at a human.

601
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,380
 I feel like I'm looking at someone who is impersonating or has the mannerisms of a human.

602
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,080
 But something so off, it's all uncanny valley is the way I would put it.

603
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,400
 That's how I feel when I'm looking at something from the uncanny valley.

604
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,100
 In fact, I would say that watching a nicado avocado video makes me more physically sick

605
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,460
 than watching like Polar Express or Mars Needs Moms or any of these movies that toe the

606
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,100
 line of the uncanny valley.

607
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:53,260
 It's super bizarre and I just figured I didn't like his content because it was so gross because

608
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
 he was eating so much.

609
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
 But I like eating.

610
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
 I love eating.

611
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,860
 That's the reason why I put on so much weight.

612
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,000
 So it's not a matter of his weight, it's not even a matter of him eating so much.

613
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 I love milkshakes.

614
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,320
 I wish I had a milkshake right now.

615
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,040
 But I do get this weird uncanny and I could never put my finger on it until I saw that

616
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 headline.

617
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,520
 Like, it does seem when I look at photos, even just photos, but mostly video.

618
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
 When it's in motion, it makes me physically ill.

619
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,040
 And I'm wondering if other people who are watching it go, "He does have a reputation,

620
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,220
 that's why people are taking photos of his butthole, turning it into a quasar.

621
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,260
 He does have a reputation of making people sick to their stomach."

622
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,180
 A lot of people go, "This is so disgusting."

623
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,500
 But I'm wondering if they're also reacting to not the amount of food he's eating, but

624
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:50,620
 the unseen qualities, the demonic qualities of this young man.

625
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,500
 Basically something came into him and made the deal.

626
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,260
 You can be rich and famous and live the life you want where people will pay attention to

627
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,840
 you and you will be special.

628
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:06,920
 But you have to do what I say or even more chilling, you will invite me into your body.

629
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,840
 That's a hard deal for a lot of young people, a lot of desperate people to turn away.

630
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,960
 And we recently did that episode about a guy who had millions of dollars basically set

631
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,200
 in front of him and said, "If you want this, you have to give up your next life.

632
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
 You'll be a vampire when you're reincarnated."

633
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,040
 And he's like, "I don't know if I even believe in reincarnation or vampires, but should I

634
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
 take the money?"

635
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,580
 I think most people, if they got an intrusive thought, if they started thinking that there

636
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,820
 was something outside of them saying, "Except me into your life and I will make things better,

637
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,740
 accept me into your life and I will give you everything you desire."

638
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,180
 I think people who aren't religious, people who don't believe in the paranormal, if

639
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,740
 they get that thoughts in their head, they're like, "You know what?

640
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
 Whatever.

641
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
 Yes."

642
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,380
 Because I don't believe in the paranormal anyways, so I just have this weird goofy

643
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,700
 thought and I'll say yes and since I don't believe in the human soul, it doesn't really

644
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,160
 get anything, so I'm making out.

645
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,360
 I'm getting the best of the bargain.

646
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,920
 Souls don't exist, the afterlife doesn't exist, so sure, you can have my soul, just give

647
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,800
 me the fame and the fortune.

648
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,200
 When you ask a religious person that, they'll be deep in thought.

649
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,640
 They may still also succumb to that, but someone who is religious or someone who is not religious

650
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,360
 but deeply believes in the paranormal, because there is a large contingent of people like

651
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,200
 that, you may not believe in God at all.

652
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,020
 But if you're contacted by something you think is a demon or something outside of you, saying,

653
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,380
 "I can give you everything you want, but I want your soul," even they would be like,

654
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,500
 "Absolutely not because I believe in demons and I know what this is."

655
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,740
 But so much is walking down the street if they are told and again, it could be not like a

656
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,380
 demon showed up in his bedroom holding a Popeye shake and sandwich and go, "Eat this.

657
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,860
 Your butthole will forever be cursed."

658
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,720
 You could have been much more sly than that, but it does feel like something like this

659
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
 happened.

660
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
 Now, there is, let's do the skeptical argument.

661
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,360
 We're going to wrap it up like this.

662
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,760
 Someone on the export, because people were, it was funny, people talked about this, honestly

663
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,760
 a little more civilly than they did with the Civil War post.

664
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,040
 We've got more worked up over that one, but on this one, someone said, it was interesting,

665
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,760
 they go, "Really what we're looking at here is someone," this is what happens when, and

666
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,420
 I know a lot of parents listen to this podcast.

667
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,820
 I find this fascinating, I don't necessarily know how true it is, but they go, "When a

668
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:39,380
 parent gives their child an incredibly restricted diet or limits their exposure to addictive

669
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,060
 things in life," and let's say legal addictive, because I don't think most parents are like,

670
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,700
 "Oh, you can try heroin soon, but only once."

671
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,840
 If that's legally addictive, like sugars and fats and oils, all this stuff we have in these

672
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,240
 super processed foods nowadays, milkshakes.

673
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,480
 When you have children that are raised in a household where there's a zero milkshake

674
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,640
 policy, when they get out of the household, they've never really had milkshakes, they've

675
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,920
 never had a lot of ice cream or anything like that.

676
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,280
 Now they're 22, they're 23, they have a fairly large income, or at least enough to afford

677
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,500
 a milkshake, then for the first time they're being introduced to these fats and these sugars

678
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,860
 and their oils, they gorge themselves on them.

679
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,100
 Because it's been limited to them as a child, and they haven't built up any mechanisms of

680
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,260
 temperance, they haven't built up the thing to be like, "You know what, that milkshake

681
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,860
 is really good, and there's a half gallon of ice cream sitting in the freezer right

682
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,460
 now," but I can't have it.

683
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,260
 One milkshake is too much, it's something Jason's never said, but when you're an adult,

684
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,400
 and the first time you're really eating ice cream out of a carton, you're like, "Oh, I

685
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,440
 can have this whole Ben & Jerry's little thing by myself," and then I can have, "You

686
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,240
 know, it's Wednesday night, it's time for my Ben & Jerry's," and then pretty soon you're

687
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
 eating it all the time.

688
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,640
 I think that's where a lot of stuff we see, like the freshman 15 people who go away to

689
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,160
 college, they're putting on weight, because for the first time they're buying their own

690
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,560
 food and they're making poor food choices, and he goes, "It's kind of what this is."

691
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,680
 This young man was a vegan, he probably had a pretty restrictive diet growing up, and

692
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,900
 then all of a sudden he can drink as many milkshakes as he wants, and he doesn't have

693
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,900
 any...

694
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,820
 It is super weird when you watch videos and how much of it is an act, he seems like a

695
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:30,220
 drug addict, at the very least if he's not demonically possessed.

696
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,780
 It's so bizarre, it is so weird, and it's so off-putting, it's repulsive, and it's funny,

697
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,540
 it's not about him overeating, it's not about his physical form.

698
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:44,840
 It's not that I hate fat people, or I hate food, or anything like that.

699
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,000
 When I watch a video of him in motion, even one where he's sitting on a couch just doing

700
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:58,880
 a testimonial, something seems so inhuman, so off-putting, so diabolical, and I can

701
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,000
 never put my finger, I can never really use any of those words, I just figured, "Pop

702
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,440
 eye chicken sandwich," whenever I saw this guy, all I ever remember was that stupid

703
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,940
 "Pop eye chicken sandwich" video.

704
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,020
 And I always just figured, "Oh, this guy grosses me out, I'm never eating pop eyes again,

705
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,780
 I can't even watch the pop eye cartoon anymore."

706
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,080
 I always figured it went back to that, I'd look at him and I would just get sick to my

707
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,220
 stomach, and I thought it was because of that "Pop eye chicken sandwich" video, but it may

708
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,780
 turn out that what I was reacting to was this demonic presence inside his body.

709
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:40,320
 It's a terrifying story, it may be nothing to it, it may just be that because the first

710
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,720
 time I saw him, I saw him have diarrhea in bed, and then his first instinct was to videotape

711
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,960
 it.

712
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,880
 If all of this is untrue, if he's not actually a demon, I mean, I don't hate the guy, I'm

713
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,920
 not sorry for him, I don't feel pity for him, or he needs to get his life together before

714
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,080
 he dies, if this is the life he wants to live, if this is the life he wants to live, it's

715
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,760
 not, I don't think, I was just, he's not harming anyone, I don't think he has an army of people

716
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,620
 who are like, "You know what, I want to be like my hero, I want to poop the bed as well,

717
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:13,740
 I don't think so, I think people watch him for shock value, I could be wrong on that."

718
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,780
 So is Niccato Avocado possessed by a demon, a demon of gluttony, a demon who's making

719
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:24,900
 him eat so much that he can't buy a new shirt, that it's closer getting tight?

720
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,700
 Well, I mean, he eats so much that he can't breathe while he's sleeping and he's breaking

721
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,120
 ribs, somehow just walking around, he shatters three ribs.

722
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,600
 So has a demon of gluttony possessed Niccato Avocado?

723
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,200
 I don't know.

724
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,720
 I couldn't 100% say for sure, but I couldn't 100% say for sure either way.

725
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,920
 I could not say I would not bet money that no, he is not possessed by a demon, because

726
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,720
 something just seems so off.

727
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,560
 But I do know that if I was a demon, these are the type of people I would look for, I

728
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,020
 mean, he matches the profile of someone who wants fame and fortune and will do anything

729
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,060
 to get it.

730
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,780
 And I would say 99% of the world isn't happy with where they're at, 99% of the world wants

731
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,980
 something more, but then you have just people who, they don't just want more, they want

732
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,980
 it all.

733
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:21,780
 They want the fame and the fortune, the prestige, the power.

734
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,500
 So I can't say for sure that Niccato Avocado is possessed by a demon.

735
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:35,680
 I can't say for sure either way, but I guarantee that right now there are demons on the lookout

736
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,120
 for their next victims.

737
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:48,200
 The only question is, will we recognize them when they star in our movies, walk down our

738
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:58,220
 red carpets, or simply pretend to be close personal friends posting a new YouTube video

739
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:05,860
 that you can't wait to watch.
