1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
 A judge overseeing a murder trial has his own secret to hide.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,460
 And then we take a trip around the United States to visit haunted asylums.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,080
 Are you ready to walk down those dark halls?

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,620
 It's an interactive adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:29,020
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,020
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,020
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,020
 You know, we have a new club.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,020
 There's one member. He's the founder.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,020
 I call it the Golden Rabbit Brigade.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,020
 Because a listener, I have a listener named Chris Kaye,

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,020
 made a great donation to the continuation of the show.

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,020
 I don't have a Patreon set up. He went about it and did it himself.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,020
 I didn't even know that was possible, but I appreciate that.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,020
 It really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,020
 And so Chris Kaye, thank you. You're also now on the show notes as the founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade.

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,020
 Which I think is kind of cool.

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
 Now from now on, imagine Chris Kaye decked out in Golden Rabbit Armour.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,020
 It's like a real cool suit of armour, but it has rabbit ears as well.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,020
 But again, I want to say thank you one more time. Really, really helps. Really, really helps.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,020
 I'm not going to say what the dollar amount was, but I do like how he announced,

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,020
 put the change is 33 cents.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,020
 Uh, uh, Masonic. Masonic symbols. Masonic symbols everywhere if you know where to look.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,020
 Let's go ahead and get started with the first story here.

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,020
 Now this story I had heard a long, this could act, you know, I haven't done in a long time, new news.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,020
 Because I read this way back in the day and I laughed so hard and I stumbled back across it a couple days ago.

27
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,020
 And I was like, I got to cover that story.

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,020
 So we are going back in this case to the magical year of 2003.

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,020
 We're in Bristow, Oklahoma.

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,020
 And we're sitting in a courthouse. We're sitting in the back, just chilling.

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,020
 Checking our chairs, make sure there's no snakes.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,020
 And we're sitting in a deep cut. That's an old episode.

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,020
 And I usually don't do in-jokes, but I couldn't resist.

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,020
 We're sitting in these chairs and we're watching this trial.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,020
 And it's a trial for a murder, a quite grisly murder.

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,020
 Court reporters sitting there typing, juries sitting there going,

37
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,020
 "Hmm, they're all making those noises. Hmm, they question everything."

38
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,020
 Prosecutors giving his case.

39
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,020
 The man here murdered this person in a horrible way and we should have to do in the whole Atticus Finch thing.

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:35,020
 And we just see the judge sitting on the stand, not on the stand, sitting at the bench, sitting on the podium, whatever it is.

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,020
 You know what, you've seen Law and Order, you know where judges sit.

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,020
 And we hear a "pss, pss, pss."

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
 And I'm like, what is that noise?

44
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
 You can see the jurors looking around going, "Hmm, hmm."

45
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
 Now they're saying it even louder.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,020
 Prosecutor kind of gets distracted for a second, but just has to keep going, doing his job.

47
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,020
 Psss, psss, psss.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,020
 And the judge is just kind of sitting there looking at everyone where nobody can know where the sound is.

49
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,020
 Is it a mouse with a pneumatic gun shooting potatoes at people?

50
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,020
 Did a balloon hide as a person and now it's slowly deflating?

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,020
 Nobody knows.

52
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,020
 Nobody knows. I am poking people with pins though to test that theory.

53
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,020
 But the court reporter does know.

54
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,020
 And she's sweating as she's typing her notes because she knows what's going on.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,020
 So Lisa Foster was the court reporter and she had worked with this particular judge for a while, right?

56
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,020
 And she had seen, because of the way she's positioned, she's typing in her little stenographer's chair,

57
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,020
 she is able to every so often kind of look over and she sees the judge sitting there with the penis pump attached to his,

58
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,020
 that's where it goes.

59
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:52,020
 And he would sit there during trial and just go psss, psss, and masturbate while people were on trial for murder.

60
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,020
 Now, she didn't say anything.

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
 And this is very telling.

62
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,020
 This was a quote that Lisa said because after everything came out, they asked her about it.

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,020
 And she's like, "Yeah, I know. You had the penis pump and all that stuff."

64
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
 They're like, "Why didn't you say anything?"

65
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
 This was her exact quote.

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,020
 "I didn't want to be found dead in a ditch somewhere."

67
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:16,020
 That's just insane that she was basically like, "If I rat this guy out for masturbating in a trial,

68
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,020
 there's a chance no one will believe me and I will be retaliated against."

69
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,020
 That's harrowing.

70
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,020
 It's really scary to think she works in the judicial system and even she's like scared of like the bad guys in the system.

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,020
 But what happens is people, he does this for two years.

72
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,020
 He's not constantly, it's not the same jackoff routine.

73
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,020
 He takes it off every once in a while, otherwise he just has like this massive, he needs another robe for his genitalia.

74
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,020
 No, during trials and stuff, every so often you'd be like, "Oh yeah, what am I doing?

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
 Oh yeah, I have supposed to masturbate now."

76
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,020
 And he'd put the penis pump on.

77
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,020
 Sometimes he wouldn't use the penis pump, sometimes he would just masturbate under his robes.

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,020
 And people, you know, you have the same people come into the courthouse all the time, police officers, lawyers and stuff like that.

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,020
 They started to think, this is so funny, because every so often, they'd see him fiddling with his hands behind his big old desk.

80
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,020
 And you know, like in the courthouse, behind the big old like, judge's throne, we'll call it, whatever it's called.

81
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,020
 They would see him playing with like, moving his hands and looking down.

82
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,020
 And they thought he brought like a Game Boy.

83
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
 They thought he was playing straight up Game Gear down there.

84
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,020
 Golden axe too, while these people were on trial.

85
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,020
 But they'd ask him and they'd be like, "Oh no, no, no, that was fine.

86
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
 I had an itch that took me five minutes to scratch and then I moaned when I got done scratching it.

87
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
 I guess that makes sense.

88
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,020
 At one point though, a cop was testifying against somebody.

89
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:46,020
 So he's sitting on the stand and he sees, looks over while he's giving a testimony, looks over and he sees a plastic tube going into the judge's robes.

90
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,020
 So his little detective instinct went off and he's like, "Ah, better investigate that. That's why his wife left him.

91
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,020
 Because he just investigated everything. Who ate the pie?" He's like putting up little police tape around the pie.

92
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,020
 He doesn't let anything go by. He has to investigate everything.

93
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,020
 After they break for lunch, the cop goes over and looks at where the judge sits and sees the penis pump.

94
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,020
 It's just sitting there behind his podium.

95
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:14,020
 So he ends up, the officer ends up reporting it. They start investigating and the judge goes, "Oh, that thing? Yeah, I never use it.

96
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,020
 It was a gag gift and I probably should have thrown it away, but I did get it."

97
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,020
 And they go, "Well, why is it in your workstation?"

98
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,020
 I know there's a hundred law students right now pulling their hair out because I don't know the name of where the judge sits,

99
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,020
 but why did you have that there?" And he goes, "Well, sometimes they keep it in my office, but I always show off when I bring it out here."

100
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,020
 And people, that's even more, but that doesn't answer the question. Why are you carrying a penis pump around?

101
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,020
 And he goes, "Listen, I'll be honest with you guys. This noise you hear going, 'psshh, pshh,'"

102
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,020
 because it actually was so loud it appeared on the audio tape of that trial.

103
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,020
 You can hear people arguing about whether or not this guy is a murderer and you hear a 'psshh, pshh.'

104
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,020
 He says, "Listen, I'll be honest with you guys. I'll be frank with you."

105
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
 I'm just kind of weird because my name is actually Donald.

106
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,020
 And they're like, "This isn't a dead silent. Dude, just tell us the story."

107
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,020
 He's like, "Okay, here we go." Scratches that off of his stand-up routine list.

108
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,020
 He says, "That noise you hear is actually me pressing the penis pump."

109
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,020
 And they're like, "Oh, thanks for being honest." He's like, "No, no, no, but it wasn't on my penis."

110
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,020
 You see, sometimes I just absent-mindedly reach for it and press it.

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,020
 It's just like a stress thing or I'm just not really thinking.

112
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,020
 And they're like, "That's not true. That is 100% not true."

113
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,020
 So the cops ended up having to go and they're like, "We know this guy's masturbating during these trials."

114
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,020
 They got a hold of his robes.

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:40,020
 They went and they took a sample of the carpet underneath his chair and his chair and ran tests on it.

116
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
 And it was all covered in semen.

117
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,020
 So he was masturbating into his robes.

118
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,020
 I don't know what his output was, but apparently he was everywhere down there.

119
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,020
 I guess if you're masturbating for two years in the same spot.

120
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,020
 Chris K's like, "Great, this is the episode I donated to him on."

121
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:04,020
 I guess if you're masturbating in the same spot for two years, it's gonna get everywhere, but come on your robes.

122
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,020
 On your robes.

123
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
 Lift those up.

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:14,020
 That's gross because you know, once he was finished, he just sat in those robes for the rest of the trial.

125
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
 Or the rest of that day. I'm sure he washed them, but...

126
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
 He didn't because they found DNA on them.

127
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:26,020
 Anyways, so he ended up getting four years for it because they could charge him on like four times of doing it.

128
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,020
 They gave him one year for each time. They absolutely knew he was masturbating during trial.

129
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,020
 They gave him four years in prison and a $10,000 fine for each time he did it.

130
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
 So he got $40,000 in fines.

131
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,020
 And defense lawyers were basically, they were masturbating because they were so happy.

132
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,020
 They were like, "We can totally get our client off."

133
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:50,020
 And... but that doesn't seem to have worked because all of this stuff pretty much happened back in the early 2000s.

134
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,020
 I didn't see anything about a bunch of defendants getting retried or anything like that.

135
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,020
 But Judge Donald Thompson, 59 year old man in 2003, masturbating.

136
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,020
 I'm sure he's still alive now, but I really doubt he's a judge.

137
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,020
 But I just find that story absolutely hilarious.

138
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
 Okay, so let's go ahead. It's true crime, right?

139
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,020
 Conspiracy, investigation, you know, I can wrap it in there.

140
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,020
 Maybe it was ectoblasm, ooh, paranormal.

141
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,020
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

142
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
 The next story I wanted to turn a limb in and to eliminate.

143
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:28,020
 I've been so hard on Backpackerverse in the past, they gave me a list of ten of the most haunted and sane asylums.

144
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,020
 With ten of the dumbest ghost stories possible.

145
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,020
 And I said, "You know what? I'm gonna find the true history of these haunted asylums."

146
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,020
 I will take Backpackerverse, if you don't know, as a website that basically just makes stuff up

147
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,020
 and then passes it off as paranormal truth.

148
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,020
 So basically, like most paranormal websites, but they go the extra mile.

149
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
 They just absolutely make everything up.

150
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,020
 I said, "You know what? I'm gonna take these insane asylums, I'm gonna find out about them.

151
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:00,020
 I'm gonna find a real ghost story in there to chill your bones and you get to play along with this one."

152
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:07,020
 Because who doesn't want to have an interactive adventure where you get locked in a place with people who are mentally insane?

153
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,020
 So pick a number between one and five.

154
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
 Okay, you got your number?

155
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,020
 Let's go ahead and hop on board the Carpenter copter.

156
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,020
 And we are flying to Spring City, Pennsylvania.

157
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,020
 In Spring City, Pennsylvania, we have the Pinhurst Asylum.

158
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,020
 And the helicopter's flying overhead and you look down and you're like, "Oh, great. This looks super spooky."

159
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,020
 I was like, "It is. It is super spooky."

160
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:39,020
 The Pinhurst Asylum was originally known as the Pinhurst Home for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic, which...

161
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,020
 So apparently back then, epilepsy was considered a mental...

162
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,020
 I have a really good friend of mine who has epilepsy really bad.

163
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 And I felt bad for him because he had epilepsy.

164
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,020
 He had a stroke so bad or seizure so bad that his...

165
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
 He said his brain doesn't work like it used to.

166
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,020
 He goes, "I talk really slow." And I go, "Dude, I've known you for years. You talk the same speed."

167
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,020
 But because his brain is processing the language slower, he thinks he sounds slow, so he's super self-conscious about it.

168
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,020
 But anyways, you can have like...

169
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
 Imagine you have epilepsy.

170
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 Like, you're a total functioning adult, but you have some short circuit in your brain and your body will start to seize up and stuff like that.

171
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:20,020
 And they put you in a place with like drooling lunatics who have like, were butchering pigs.

172
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,020
 That's kind of how it was back then, which totally sucked.

173
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,020
 And it's almost like prison where you would have to group up.

174
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,020
 You would be like, "I better find the other epileptics and like, hang out with them."

175
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:36,020
 In case there's like a rumble or something like that, because everyone else in here is a raging lunatic.

176
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,020
 So nowadays, they do ghost tours there.

177
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
 And that's where one of these ghost stories come from.

178
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,020
 One of these ghost stories comes from a ghost tour guide.

179
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,020
 He's walking through the spooky, spooky asylum.

180
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,020
 It's no longer full of a bunch of people with medical problems.

181
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,020
 It's just full of tourists and tour guides.

182
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,020
 And he's walking through the asylum.

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,020
 He's all alone.

184
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
 And then he turns.

185
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,020
 And he sees a young woman standing behind him.

186
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,020
 And her face is covered in blood.

187
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,020
 Makeup! Just bloody makeup.

188
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,020
 And he goes, "Whoa, I didn't see you there."

189
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,020
 And she stands there and then he turns, his boss walks by and he goes,

190
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
 "Boss, check out this girl."

191
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 The girl had finished.

192
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,020
 Now I was like, listen, listen.

193
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
 That is the story from Backpackerverse.

194
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,020
 And I thought, if you're gonna make it up, why does she not have just blood on her face?

195
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
 Why is it bloody makeup?

196
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
 And I've realized something.

197
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,020
 A lot of these ghost stories involve guys, like running into girls,

198
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,020
 and then the girl disappearing.

199
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
 And I wonder if there's something Freudian about that.

200
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,020
 Or if they're just normal girls that these guys are running into

201
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,020
 and the guy acts kind of awkward and cringey around her,

202
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,020
 and then he's like, "Hey boss, meet this new girl."

203
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,020
 And then she like sneaks out.

204
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
 She's like, "Weirdo."

205
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,020
 She leaves.

206
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,020
 There's so many of these stories involve guys meeting girls,

207
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,020
 and then they go, and then when I turned around, she was gone.

208
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,020
 Which is basically any guy at a bus stop.

209
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
 Any guy trying to pick up a girl at a bus stop.

210
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
 I did that once.

211
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,020
 Don't do that.

212
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
 So here's the thing.

213
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,020
 You go, Jason.

214
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,020
 That was the story from Backpackerverse.

215
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,020
 You promised me an interactive adventure, and I did.

216
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,020
 So here we go with a newer ghost story.

217
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
 A newer ghost story.

218
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
 Now this one also seems to be fairly made up.

219
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,020
 But, let's do this.

220
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,020
 Pinhurst Asylum was overcrowded, and it was a horrible place to be.

221
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,020
 They ended up shutting it down because it was just so awful.

222
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,020
 But there are stories that are promoted by the current owner of the haunted house.

223
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
 The attraction known as Pinhurst Asylum.

224
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,020
 That the previous doctor was killed by the inmates.

225
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
 [Groaning]

226
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
 And the asylum just burned down.

227
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,020
 And so please donate to my GoFundMe to get it rebuilt.

228
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,020
 But, before you do that, you should know, after all the crazy people escaped,

229
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 people are like, "Are you saying a bunch of epileptics are like serial killers?"

230
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,020
 The guy's like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're totally normal."

231
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
 I'm talking about the crazy people.

232
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,020
 The crazy people.

233
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,020
 They escaped, but sometimes they come back late at night to find you.

234
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,020
 And the mad doctor who performed all these experiments on them,

235
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,020
 that I forgot to mention earlier, mad doctor performed experiments on all these guys.

236
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,020
 Sometimes he comes back too, even though he's dead, he's a ghost.

237
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,020
 Sick with the program. It's a ghost guide, it's a ghost story.

238
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,020
 You're like, "Dude, this is a really confusing ghost story."

239
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:38,020
 He's like, "Shh." So, you're walking through the asylum all by yourself,

240
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,020
 in the dark halls with just a flashlight you little urban explorer you,

241
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,020
 wanting to get some good footage for your YouTube channel.

242
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,020
 And that's when you feel cold, icy hands grab you.

243
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,020
 Not just grab you, but grab into you.

244
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,020
 Grab your spine and pull you into a dark room.

245
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,020
 And there you see the ghastly doctor.

246
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,020
 His medical staff standing all around him.

247
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,020
 And you see a tool in his hand that you saw once in a horror movie,

248
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,020
 or you're just a crazy person and you know what it looks like anyways.

249
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
 It's a lobotomy needle.

250
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:20,020
 And if you picked number five, you feel a little bit of pressure right above your left eye,

251
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:26,020
 as it slowly cracks bone and then slides into your brain.

252
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,020
 And then he stirs you up like a coolin, like a blue jug of cooling.

253
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,020
 And you are now one of the crazy people stalking Pinnhurst Asylum.

254
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,020
 So, I like that ghost story, that's much better than the blood de-makeup.

255
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,020
 Like, it's a much, much better story than that one, but that one's also totally fake.

256
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,020
 The guy, people in town want him to shut down his haunted house attraction.

257
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,020
 They go, "This is so demeaning to people with mental illnesses."

258
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
 And the guy's like, "Dude, I'm just making it up.

259
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,020
 Just making it up that every night these mental people come back and might murder your children."

260
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,020
 They've been trying to shut it down for years.

261
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 But, let's go ahead and go to our next encounter.

262
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,020
 Our next encounter is in Ohio.

263
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
 So hop on board the Carpenter Copter.

264
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,020
 If you're number five, we left you, you're just sitting somewhere in the asylum.

265
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,020
 We didn't keep track.

266
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
 I should have counted people before we went on this trip.

267
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,020
 People, someone's like, "Hey, didn't we have five people on this trip?"

268
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
 I was like, "Yeah, now just get on the copter. Just get on the copter."

269
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
 Fly away.

270
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
 [imitates flying]

271
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
 We're going to Athens, Ohio.

272
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
 I wonder if that's close to Helltown.

273
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,020
 Anyways, we're going to Athens, Ohio.

274
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,020
 We're going to an asylum known as the Ridges.

275
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:38,020
 I thought this one was funny, because the one, I shouldn't say funny, but it's known as the Ridges today.

276
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,020
 And that name came out from some sort of name, like the county had a naming contest.

277
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,020
 Spooky, spooky buildings out in the middle of nowhere,

278
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
 which would be the perfect place to have a mental institution.

279
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,020
 You don't want it in the middle of town.

280
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,020
 The one in Sacramento, though, is like right off the freeway.

281
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
 It's like in the middle of town.

282
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,020
 You can buy candy at the gas station and then walk into the mental hospital in Sacramento.

283
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
 Anyways, this place is known.

284
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
 This has some real ghost stories, so don't shut it off.

285
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,020
 You're like, "Jason's just going to keep reading ridiculous stuff."

286
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,020
 This one actually has some real ghost stories established in 1874.

287
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,020
 And actually has an interesting question about ghosts, too.

288
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,020
 That's the reason why I included this one.

289
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
 There's a shadowy figure located around the buildings.

290
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
 So you got the shadow man, right?

291
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,020
 Walking around.

292
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
 You turn.

293
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
 See, shadow walk by.

294
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,020
 Now, what's interesting about this shadow guy

295
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
 is that he walks weird.

296
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,020
 He walks with a weird walking style.

297
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,020
 Doesn't walk like a person would normally walk.

298
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,020
 And so apparently, according to this part,

299
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
 according to Backpackerverse,

300
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,020
 someone brought a tape recorder to the ridges

301
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,020
 and did an EVP and it told this story.

302
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
 They basically asked it the shadow man questions,

303
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,020
 and this is the story that we heard.

304
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
 The shadow man is a ghost,

305
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,020
 and he's the ghost of a guy who had epilepsy.

306
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,020
 And he felt so fine.

307
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
 I think this is so funny.

308
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,020
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

309
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,020
 But he falls in love with a woman

310
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,020
 who has a mental problem.

311
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:10,020
 It's too late to get your money back.

312
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,020
 It's too late to get your money back.

313
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
 I already cut it out of my paypal.

314
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020
 You're like, "Dude, I've never given this to you."

315
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020
 Okay, there's this guy.

316
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020
 There's this guy.

317
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,020
 Okay, there's a guy with epilepsy,

318
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,020
 and he falls in love with this girl in a mental asylum.

319
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,020
 Sounds very sweet, right?

320
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,020
 Sounds--it's adorable.

321
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,020
 Everybody needs love.

322
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,020
 But unbeknownst to the both of them,

323
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
 she was scheduled for a lobotomy.

324
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,020
 So he's like falling in love with this girl,

325
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,020
 and she's falling in love with him,

326
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
 and then one day he basically just goes to her room

327
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,020
 and is like, "Hey, Natalie, what's going on?"

328
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,020
 And she's just--uh, she had a lobotomy,

329
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,020
 and she doesn't remember him.

330
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
 That's tragic.

331
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,020
 I don't know why I think that story's so--

332
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,020
 Anyway, so here's--let's try to save this as much as we can.

333
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
 So the question is this.

334
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
 So they said that the Shadow Man is the ghost of that man

335
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,020
 still pining after his lost love.

336
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
 So here's the thing.

337
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,020
 Why would the ghost have epilepsy?

338
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,020
 Like, if the ghost is walking around all weird,

339
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,020
 the idea is that the ghost is the ghost of the man,

340
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,020
 and the ghost is walking like someone who has severe epilepsy.

341
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
 Why would the ghost have epilepsy?

342
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
 If that's true, if you're blinded and relive,

343
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
 or you're in a car accident, or you're falling on an airplane,

344
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,020
 and you're flat, is your ghost flat?

345
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,020
 Like, do you just kind of score him along the ground?

346
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
 Is your ghost blind?

347
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
 Like, it doesn't make sense,

348
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,020
 because then all ghosts would be crippled in one way or the other.

349
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,020
 But anyways, according to this, that this ghost has epilepsy.

350
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,020
 But that's not the fate you get,

351
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,020
 although that'd be kind of funny too if you pick this number.

352
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,020
 The love of your life gets a lot of lies.

353
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,020
 But no, no, no, we're gonna do something else here,

354
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,020
 because there's an other more chilling story than that one.

355
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,020
 What you get is this.

356
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,020
 The story of Margaret Shilling.

357
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,020
 She was a patient there, who really liked to play hide and go seek.

358
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,020
 "Hey, catch me, guys. I'm gonna go hide, and you seek me."

359
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,020
 And they're like, "Yeah, Margaret, we know how to play the game. Just go hide.

360
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
 We'll find you."

361
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

362
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,020
 She runs down the hallway, she shuts the door, and hides.

363
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
 "No one will find me here."

364
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,020
 And the nurses would find her and take her back to her room,

365
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,020
 and she'd be like, "He he he, I'm such a good hide and seeker."

366
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,020
 But one day she started the game, and the nurses got distracted.

367
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,020
 And she hid the perfect hiding spot.

368
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,020
 And a month later, they found her, dead in the room.

369
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,020
 Now, obviously, someone who was lucid would go,

370
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
 "Oh, they haven't found me in an hour. I guess the game's over."

371
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,020
 But to her, the game of hide and go seek was so real, it never ended.

372
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,020
 And even today, when you go into that room, presumably,

373
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,020
 you can see the imprint of her body on the ground.

374
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,020
 No matter how many times they wash it, it won't come out.

375
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,020
 So if you picked number three, you get to play hide and go seek,

376
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 and you're never found.

377
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,020
 You're running away from us, you're like, "Hey guys, I'm gonna go hide in here,

378
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
 and you guys find me."

379
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 We're like, "We're not playing that, bro."

380
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
 And you go running down the hallway, dodging different aisles,

381
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
 you're like, "They'll never find me here."

382
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,020
 And you hide, shut the door behind you, and you're like,

383
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,020
 "He he he he, they'll never find me."

384
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,020
 But I left out one other detail.

385
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,020
 The number one reason why men were admitted to the ridges,

386
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,020
 the number one reason, 81 different cases of this,

387
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,020
 of why people were admitted to the ridges mental institution,

388
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,020
 was for excessive masturbation.

389
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,020
 So you hide in the room, no one will ever find you.

390
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 And then the ghosts of 81 masturbating men appear around you

391
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 and say, "We found you, and you're it."

392
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,020
 And then you can imagine what happens after that.

393
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,020
 But we don't go looking for you, you are lost to your fate

394
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,020
 if you picked number three.

395
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
 A lot of masturbation during this episode.

396
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,020
 Not while I'm recording it, but maybe while you're listening to it.

397
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,020
 Let's go ahead and move on to the next asylum.

398
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
 And I honestly might take one out here.

399
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,020
 Let me take a look.

400
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,020
 I might make you guys delete a number again.

401
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
 Let's see here.

402
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,020
 Yeah, okay, I'm gonna take one out.

403
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
 Yeah, I'm taking one out.

404
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
 I know I've done this before.

405
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
 It's just, I'm, okay.

406
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,020
 So, so, I can either go and rerecord everything I recorded

407
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,020
 where I mentioned the number, or if you picked the number two,

408
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
 now you can pick between one and four.

409
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,020
 There you go, one and four.

410
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,020
 We've said goodbye to five, we've said goodbye to three.

411
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
 We hear a lot of moaning as we're leaving the ridges.

412
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
 And I'm like, "Hmm, that's weird.

413
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:53,020
 It kind of sounds like one of my listeners and a new one other people."

414
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
 But we're getting back on the Carbentercopter.

415
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,020
 We are headed to East Bethany, New York.

416
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,020
 And in East Bethany, New York, we go to Rolling Hills Asylum.

417
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,020
 This place sounds absolutely horrible.

418
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,020
 They've done a little bit of recovery today,

419
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,020
 but how it sounded back in the day was horrible.

420
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,020
 Because remember how I said you had like, epileptics?

421
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,020
 And then you had people who were just like, nuts.

422
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
 And you'd be like, "Dude, I can do my taxes.

423
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
 Like, I know how to pet a dog,

424
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,020
 and I'm stuck with this guy who does his dog

425
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,020
 and tries to pet his taxes.

426
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,020
 But this Rolling Hills was actually even worse,

427
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
 because it started off as a poor house.

428
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
 So basically you went there if you were homeless,

429
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,020
 or you were a widow, you'd end up there.

430
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
 If your family was homeless, you'd end up there.

431
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,020
 But then they're like, "You know what?

432
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,020
 We have this great facility with all these homeless people in it.

433
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,020
 And we got all these crazy people running around.

434
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
 Let's combine them.

435
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,020
 Let's Reese's Peanut Butter Cup these two things.

436
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,020
 What could go wrong?"

437
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,020
 So they took in blind people, disabled people,

438
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,020
 alcoholics, orphans, widows, like I said,

439
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,020
 and then just people who were crazy,

440
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,020
 all packed into this facility.

441
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
 That would have to be the worst.

442
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,020
 If you were basically like, "Man, I lost my job.

443
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,020
 This sucks. Oh no, I got kicked out of my apartment.

444
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
 Oh no, what am I going to do?

445
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
 I'm sleeping on the street.

446
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,020
 Cop arrests me, sends me to jail,

447
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,020
 and I wake up and people are just pooping on me

448
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
 and like, clawing at my body and telling me

449
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,020
 all of them are Jesus."

450
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
 I'd be like, "This is the...

451
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
 That to me would be the worst."

452
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
 I would want to be crazy with them.

453
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,020
 Think if you were crazy locked up with other crazy people,

454
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,020
 it'd probably be more tolerable

455
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,020
 than if you were one sane person trapped in...

456
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
 And you would have to group up.

457
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,020
 You'd have to form like a homeless league

458
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
 to protect the other homeless people.

459
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,020
 So anyways, Rolling Hills Asylum.

460
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
 This one has some real ghosts.

461
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,020
 This one has some real ghost stories.

462
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,020
 Here's so these ones, people are known to get ectoplasm on their face,

463
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,020
 which I think might actually be a little bit of blowback

464
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,020
 from the ridges that's flying over state lines,

465
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
 but people said they'd wake up and have ectoplasm.

466
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
 Again, that's probably something else,

467
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
 but they'd wake up and have ectoplasm on their face.

468
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,020
 Sharon Coyle, she's the current owner of the Rolling Hills Asylum.

469
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
 She kind of turned it into a tourist attraction

470
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
 and shut down now.

471
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
 There's not just a bunch of crazy people.

472
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,020
 She's like, "Oh, don't go in Ward H.

473
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,020
 That's still an operation.

474
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
 A bunch of poor widows being like, "Help me."

475
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
 They're getting dragged off by insane people.

476
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
 Sharon Coyle, she's the current owner.

477
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
 She has brought in paranormal investigators

478
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
 and stuff like that.

479
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
 They have a shadow person.

480
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
 We've talked about shadow people before.

481
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
 Generally, they're very tall.

482
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
 They're known to be very tall.

483
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
 You see a little shadow person.

484
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
 You're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

485
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,020
 But anyways, there's a giant seven-foot-tall shadow person there,

486
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
 and you're like, "Dope, I want to wrestle a shadow person.

487
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
 If I pick this number, can I wrestle a shadow person?"

488
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,020
 This isn't technically a shadow person as we know it.

489
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,020
 This is a dude named Roy who had gigantism.

490
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
 So it's actually a giant ghost,

491
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
 which I don't know if--

492
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
 I don't know what's more scary.

493
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,020
 A shadow person who's known to be kind of an interdimensional being

494
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:56,020
 or just a seven-foot-five ghost man who roams the halls.

495
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
 And she says one day she was walking through the halls

496
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,020
 and she saw a rat and it scared her and she ran away.

497
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,020
 And then she came back later and the rat had its neck broken

498
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,020
 and there was a bloody handprint on the wall.

499
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
 Now, I don't believe that story.

500
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,020
 Like, I'm sure that she saw a broken rat.

501
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,020
 She probably saw a rat and then came back and saw another rat

502
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
 with its head broken.

503
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,020
 But again, if the ghost of Roy can do that, do the laundry, dude.

504
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,020
 Like, if you can pick up a rat and break its neck

505
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,020
 and then, like, leave a mark on the wall,

506
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,020
 you could easily put on a tool belt and fix the heater down in the basement.

507
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,020
 Like, why not?

508
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,020
 Why are ghosts super helpful in some aspects,

509
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,020
 but whenever she's back in her car and her parking spot is not back there,

510
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,020
 waving her on and going, "Stop!"

511
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
 A little bit more, a little left and then it vanishes

512
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,020
 when she has the perfect parking spot.

513
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,020
 Why not?

514
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,020
 But you want to know what your fate is,

515
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,020
 because you just want this episode to be over at this point.

516
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,020
 You're on the tour, it's just me, number one and number four,

517
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,020
 and then number two's like, "I can't believe I got left out again."

518
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,020
 Come on, number two, pick another number.

519
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,020
 We're all sitting there and I go, "Are you ready to know your fate?"

520
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
 And you're like, "Yes, I'm ready to know my fate."

521
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,020
 This one has so many ghosts that it is known for its ghost tours.

522
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,020
 So I look over at you and you're like, "Oh, that's interesting. I love ghost hunting."

523
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,020
 It has events like four to eight hour ghost tours.

524
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:33,020
 So from midnight to 8 a.m., people walking through the asylum with their tape recorders,

525
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,020
 their flashlights and their other made up devices, those things are actually real,

526
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:45,020
 but I have this Kalong Nar 2000 that detects the renal gland of a ghost.

527
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,020
 And I go in, just walking through.

528
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
 It costs me $500.

529
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,020
 They have movie nights where you can sit and watch a movie like the original Poltergeist,

530
00:27:54,020 --> 00:28:00,020
 and then afterwards go on an optional ghost tour, maybe you're too scared to go.

531
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,020
 They even have painting with the spirits where a bunch of middle-aged women get together,

532
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:10,020
 drink wine and draw in a supposedly haunted building.

533
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:18,020
 So the scariest of all, the scariest of all on their calendar of events is July 26th to be determined.

534
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,020
 What horrors does the universe hold on that day?

535
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:28,020
 What will pierce the veil and take us onto the other side on July 26th?

536
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
 It's to be determined.

537
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:42,020
 So, if you picked number one, you are trapped here and every day is a ghost tour for you?

538
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
 Not as a ghost, that would be cool.

539
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:49,020
 No, no, no, you can never leave this building.

540
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:56,020
 You walk through it every single day on the exact same ghost tour with the exact same tour guides,

541
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,020
 telling you the exact same stories.

542
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,020
 And they always go, "Oh, you just missed it, a ghost walked by."

543
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,020
 It's like Groundhog's Day, but with ghosts.

544
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,020
 And you have to spend your nights watching the original Poltergeist,

545
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:17,020
 and every night is painting with the spirits night as you're surrounded by these women whose lives hold no excitement.

546
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,020
 So they get together and paint as an excuse to drink.

547
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,020
 And you're like, "Jason, that's ridiculous, that's not you."

548
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,020
 Now you're just, "Oh, you don't let me finish."

549
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:37,020
 But at the end of each night, just when you think maybe the next sunrise will let you leave this prison,

550
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:44,020
 that's when the shadow people come, because there are stories that when you look down the long hallways of the asylum,

551
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,020
 every so often you'll see a head peek around the corner.

552
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,020
 Think it's a trick of the light, you've been down this hallway a hundred times, you've been trapped on this tour forever.

553
00:29:53,020 --> 00:30:01,020
 But you see, every single night that head pokes out, and then the tall shadow person, not Roy, not Roy, another one,

554
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:07,020
 he's changing someone's brakes, gets down on all fours, and slowly begins to crawl towards you.

555
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
 And like that is on top of you.

556
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:17,020
 None of the other people on the tour see it, as this shadow person is tearing into you like a wild beast.

557
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,020
 You feel that experience every single night.

558
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,020
 You feel your own body be pulled into the shadow realm.

559
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:32,020
 And then you wake up the next morning on a bench in the lobby of the Rolling Hills Asylum,

560
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,020
 knowing not only are you going to have to experience that same thing again,

561
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,020
 but that shadow creature running at you down the hallway is actually you.

562
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,020
 And that's spooky for some reason.

563
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,020
 Okay, let's go ahead. That's trippy at least, right?

564
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,020
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to the next one.

565
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,020
 That was number one, did I see that was you?

566
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
 If you picked number one, I don't remember.

567
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:03,020
 Let's go ahead and move on to Byberry Mental Hospital.

568
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,020
 Let's go ahead and move on to Byberry Mental Hospital.

569
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,020
 I enjoy these. I really hope you guys too.

570
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,020
 This one's gone a little off the rails, but I really enjoy these.

571
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,020
 Okay, so Byberry Mental Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

572
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:23,020
 This one was so bad that in 1945, some dude took a bunch of photos of what was going on in there

573
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,020
 and released it to the public and there was this huge outcry.

574
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,020
 And they immediately shut it down in 1987.

575
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,020
 It took them like 40 years to shut this place down.

576
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,020
 So the photos won, there was poop all in the hallways, which you're thinking,

577
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
 "Oh, that's fine. I'm in my room. I don't have to worry about that."

578
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,020
 But the place was so overcrowded, people slept in the hallways.

579
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,020
 So people were sleeping in their poop.

580
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,020
 There was an urban, oh, so the place had been torn down at this point.

581
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
 The place has been completely torn down.

582
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,020
 But we will, through the magic of time travel, we're there.

583
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,020
 After all the poop is cleaned up and all the people are freed,

584
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,020
 we're in the building, it's slightly derelict.

585
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,020
 And it also had a huge underground system to get from building to building.

586
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,020
 The people didn't want to walk in the poop, so they would go underground

587
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,020
 and walk and pop up in another building.

588
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
 You open the door and a bunch of poop falls on you.

589
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,020
 But anyways, us remaining two people, me and you who have picked number four,

590
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,020
 we are going to experience this ghost story in the tunnel.

591
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,020
 Well, let's go. After you. After you, sir.

592
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:27,020
 So we're walking through the tunnel and we hear a chuckle.

593
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,020
 [laughs]

594
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,020
 It's like, "That's weird." It's a weird laugh.

595
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,020
 I don't know, and then our flashlights die.

596
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
 [imitates explosion]

597
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,020
 Now we're standing in the darkness, just me and you.

598
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,020
 The musty dark darkness underneath this former insane asylum.

599
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,020
 And that's when we smell something.

600
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:54,020
 You smell that? You go, "Is that the smell of 81 people masturbating?"

601
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,020
 And I'm like, "No, no, no, no. I know that smell."

602
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,020
 This smells like rotten flesh.

603
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,020
 And then right when I make that realization, both of us get pushed from behind.

604
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,020
 And both of us hit our heads on several walls and we're knocked unconscious.

605
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,020
 And then the next day, some other urban explorers, part of our crew, the Urbex crew,

606
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
 kick down the door and they're like, "We gotta save them."

607
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,020
 Actually, they just stumble across us. We're both laying there unconscious.

608
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,020
 Urban explorers wake us up. They go, "Hey, you okay?"

609
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
 And we're like, "Yes!"

610
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,020
 Even though we were knocked unconscious for 24 hours in the dark

611
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,020
 and haven't suffered any real brain damage, we are fine.

612
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,020
 And then they're like, "Oh my God, look at you."

613
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,020
 And we look down, both of us, and we have huge cuts across our skin.

614
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,020
 Like we were attacked by some sort of wild animal.

615
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
 We're like, "Ahhh!"

616
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,020
 We're both taken to the hospital. Hopefully you have insurance, I do.

617
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:51,020
 And they treat us and we get hundreds of stitches each.

618
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,020
 So about, let's say, 250 stitches between the both of us.

619
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
 Wait, would that be enough?

620
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,020
 You had hundreds, that would mean you would have to have 200 or more.

621
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,020
 So we got 500 stitches total. We're the stitch bros now.

622
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,020
 That's how we're known. Me in number four.

623
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,020
 And we're also briefly hospitalized for our head wounds,

624
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,020
 because we were knocked unconscious for 24 hours.

625
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,020
 Now, if that story is true, it's quite skeptical it is.

626
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,020
 It actually makes a lot of sense. You walk through a tunnel.

627
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,020
 You walk through an abandoned tunnel. You get knocked from behind.

628
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,020
 You do get knocked unconscious, that's possible.

629
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,020
 And the deep gashes on you was any number of wild animals,

630
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,020
 raccoons, or rabbit hobos that stumbled across you

631
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
 over the course while you were unconscious.

632
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,020
 Which definitely, a reason why that could be fake.

633
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,020
 It could also be fake, because that was one of the ghost stories from Backpackerverse.

634
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:44,020
 When I looked into this hospital, most of the stuff on Bibery Mental Hospital

635
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,020
 was about how horrible it was.

636
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
 Not a lot of ghost stories coming from it.

637
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,020
 So I really had to reach out for that one.

638
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,020
 But, I mean, who wants to talk about ghosts when you have like that level of human suffering?

639
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,020
 So you're thinking, "Number four, man, I got it good.

640
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,020
 I just got a couple hundred stitches. They will call me,

641
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,020
 I'm a stitch brother now with Dead Rabbit Radio. That's cool, right?"

642
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,020
 But, no, no, no, no, no.

643
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:15,020
 Because you see, we are stitch brothers now, you and I.

644
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,020
 We went through this horrible experience together,

645
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,020
 and I just can't let it go.

646
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,020
 So one night while you're sleeping in your bed,

647
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,020
 you're all alone sleeping in your bed.

648
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,020
 You got those horrible memories of that mysterious ghost assault behind you.

649
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,020
 I sneak into your room with a giant, giant needle

650
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,020
 and a giant like roll ball of yarn,

651
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:47,020
 and I go, "Stitch brother! We're gonna be stitched together forever."

652
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,020
 And as you wake up as the needle goes into your side,

653
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,020
 you realize that I'm connecting our bodies with unbreakable titanium string

654
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,020
 that I called yarn earlier, sewing us together.

655
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,020
 We'll never be separated now.

656
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,020
 True stitch brothers till the end.

657
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,020
 And as you're howling in pain, not just from the needle penetrating your skin,

658
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,020
 but you also know that I often rewatch transformer movies,

659
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,020
 and you're now gonna be stuck watching those things with me.

660
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,020
 You realize that number four was the cursed number.

661
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,020
 The other people may have died or become trapped,

662
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:32,020
 but you will live forever as just a part of Dead Rabbit.
