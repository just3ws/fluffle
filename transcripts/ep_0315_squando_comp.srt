1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 Is the doll I purchased from eBay actually haunted? We'll do an update on that story.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,880
 And then we're going to take a look at two ghost ships of San Francisco,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,400
 both with extremely different origins. Is it true that a cursed boat still sails the waters

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,480
 under the Golden Gate Bridge? Is it true that a boat that was cursed from construction

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,480
 took the lives of three of their captains? Will set sail and find out the truth today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:44,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,120
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Quick update for those of you

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,760
 who don't listen to every episode. Last week I bought a haunted doll or the week before.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,600
 I got it last week. I got it on Wednesday. Now I bought it on eBay. It was 30 bucks for a doll

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,480
 that you could get at Goodwill for a quarter. And it said that these are the hauntings that it could

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,200
 possibly do. Open and close doors. Now I can open and close doors. So that's not super spectacular.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,520
 I can do that. It can have a woman's voice say, "Hello, hello, hello." I don't know if it echoes,

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,360
 but it would be creepier if it did. It can give you vivid dreams. And what was the other thing?

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,360
 It, um, oh, the smell of a woman's perfume. It can make your house smell like a woman's been there.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,200
 So I got the doll on Wednesday night. No to the doors open and closing unless I'm doing them. Of

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,080
 course. I'm like, why won't this door open? I have to use Veronica. I should take Veronica around

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,080
 and use her as like a garage door opener and just squeak her. Because she has a little, you know,

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 I'm gonna, here, I'm gonna get her squeaky real quick. Okay, so I'm holding Veronica right now.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,040
 Here we go. It's one of those types of toys. I think for the thumbnail for this episode,

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,200
 I'll take, I'll tell you this, the eyes are really spooky. The eyes are really spooky. It's kind of

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:08,400
 scuffed up. That's Veronica talking. Now, again, the only doors that have been opening closing are

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,200
 the ones that I do. I haven't heard a woman's voice say, "Hello." They usually go, "What's up?"

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,840
 Because it's 2019. The ghost should get, how come there aren't any ghosts that are be like,

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
 "What's up dog? What was the other, oh, smells like a woman's perfume." No, when I squeeze it,

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,400
 I get a little bit of a weird, musty smell from her. So let's go to the last one, Vivid Dreams.

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,440
 It was the, it's funny. That was the one when I was reading what she was capable of doing from

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,960
 the eBay listing. I go, "Vivid Dreams." Because those are the easiest thing to misinterpret as

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:49,520
 anything paranormal. Now, since I got Veronica, I have been having the most vivid dreams. The other

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,040
 night I woke up and my hands were like typing like I was on a keyboard and I was going, "Minnesota,

30
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,440
 have to find Minnesota." And that's what woke me up. The night before, I had an incredibly

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,880
 vivid nightmare that I jumped up after I woke up and I was writing down notes. I was like,

32
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,720
 "This would make a good story." So the dreams have been crazy lately. They've really been crazy this

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,320
 past week. So is Veronica responsible for them? You know, back in my early 20s, I lived with this

34
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,200
 girl. She was going to UC Davis and I needed a place to stay. And through a really bizarre setup,

35
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,400
 like, okay, so she had two roommates that didn't like her at all and they needed to leave for the

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,320
 summer, but they couldn't do something with their lease or whatever. They couldn't take their names

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,040
 off the lease. So they went onto a roommate finder website, found me and then said, "Oh yeah, you

38
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,320
 can rent the room. You'll just pay us." And they then told my friend, "Let's call her Blake." They

39
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,320
 tell Blake, "Oh yeah, we know this guy. We've known him since high school. He's a really cool guy."

40
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,920
 I go the very first day I'm moving in, we go out to dinner and she goes, "So, how well do you know

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,320
 so-and-so?" And I was like, "I've never met him in my life. Like, I just rent an apartment from them."

42
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,040
 Oh, she was so mad. She didn't know if she was housed with a lunatic and she found out in this

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,240
 short while that she was. So me and Blake hung out. We lived together. It was really cool,

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,520
 but it was technically a dorm. So whenever the house marm, the resident dean person at the school,

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,040
 would come around, I would have to clean all my stuff up, but she was quite the task and leave

46
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,320
 for the day. So they wouldn't know that there was a non-college student male living at this. It was

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,960
 like off-campus dorms type of thing. Anyways, one day I had this towel that I took a shower with,

48
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,400
 as you do, and then I threw it in the corner of the room. Fast forward three months and I had not

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,360
 cleaned that corner of the room and the towel had grown this large globulous tubular mold

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,080
 chunk. It would have to be at least five, six, and no, it was longer than that. It's probably like

51
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,040
 eight inches long of this. It looked like a gooey sweet potato and the roots were actually like

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,960
 bound in with the fibers of the towel. And I was like, oh man, I really don't want to go out and buy.

53
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,160
 Now I was using another towel at the time. I still wasn't using this one, but I don't like

54
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,280
 having to buy any stuff if I don't have to. So I showed Blake. I was like, dude, isn't this disgusting?

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,840
 She's like, yeah, that's super gross. Now to be fair, she was super gross too, so it wasn't too

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,560
 out of the norm for this apartment. But I said, let's see if we can wash it off. Let's get to the

57
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,520
 laundry mat, the laundry mat in the facility, and we'll wash it and see if the mold just kind of

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,240
 flies off of it apparently. So we do, we throw it in the washing machine, we go out, we're hanging

59
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,640
 out. We come back. It's probably like a Friday night. I remember that. It was a Friday or a

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,600
 Saturday night. It was a parting night. We go back to the laundry mat, pop open the washing machine,

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,880
 pull the towel out, and it's still on there. For some reason, I thought that it would just tumble

62
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,320
 off in the washing cycle. So pull out the towel and I was like, well, that's, I guess I have to

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,360
 get a new towel. So I'll have two towels now. I never wash my, I use the same towel over and over

64
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,600
 again. It's whatever. People get really like, it's water and soap. And then I wash my body with the

65
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,440
 towel and put my towel up on the towel rack, right? And then the next day I use it again. And you go,

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,240
 Jason, why don't you wash it? To my answer is, how do you wash a towel with water and soap? So

67
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,000
 I'm just cutting out the middleman. I am the middleman. My body is literally the middleman

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,840
 between the soap and the water transactions each day. Anyways, so take the towel and I rip off

69
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,480
 the tubular mold. I'm all, curriculum strength. Blake's like, Oh, my hero. I didn't know you're so

70
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,680
 strong. You could defeat micro organisms that have formed a colony. I'm like, yes, yes, I can, little

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,520
 lady. Through the Talloway. Now I'm walking through the laundromat with this huge chunk of gooey mold.

72
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,760
 And as we're walking through the laundromat, I'm looking in dryers because you know, they have the

73
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,320
 big windows. I'm looking at the dryer and I walk by the next one. I look at the dryer and I walk

74
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,640
 by the next one. I look at the dryer and I stop. I open up the dryer and I throw the mold into the

75
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,200
 dryer. And you go, well, there's multiple things that I have questions about here. One, why did you

76
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,760
 do that? Two, why did you pick that particular dryer? And again, the number one is the most

77
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,520
 important question. Well, I'll get to number one in a second. I was looking for a dryer that had a

78
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,520
 lot of clothes in it, a lot of clothes in it, a lot of like nice clothes. And I open up the dryer

79
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,200
 and I throw the tubular mold in and I shut the dryer and Blake stops and she looks at me and

80
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,440
 she goes, why did you do that? And I just look over and I go, I just kind of shrugged my shoulders

81
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,280
 and said, I just wanted to ruin some girls night. And we walked out. Now I imagine at some point,

82
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,320
 this young woman came to get her clothes. This totally true story, by the way. At some point in

83
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,960
 the night, a young woman came to get her clothes before she went out for the weekend for the night.

84
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 She opened up, she grabbed all her clothes, scooped them into a laundry basket, took them back to

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,880
 her apartment and as she began folding them or most likely dumping them on her bed to sort out

86
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:26,240
 later, a big gooey living mass of mold just tumbled out next to her shirt and her pants.

87
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,120
 The reason why I tell you that story, one, because I think it's hilarious and two,

88
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,480
 because if you came across that as a person, as a human being, if you were doing your laundry

89
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:45,760
 and you found a disgusting thing in it that wasn't there when you put the laundry in the dryer,

90
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,280
 your mind would be racing, it would be looking for an explanation. First off, what is this?

91
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,360
 Secondly, where did it come from? And again, first off, what is this? Like you would really,

92
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,040
 really be trying to, it would really mess with your head and you would never know the answer.

93
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,280
 You would never be able to figure that out because at no point would you think someone

94
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,200
 must have thrown this in there. Somebody must have cultivated a, if it was a candy wrapper,

95
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
 you'd figure someone threw it in there, but because it was this giant chunk of mold,

96
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,320
 I had never seen anything like it, okay? So and I'm disgusting, so if I hadn't seen anything like it,

97
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,520
 somebody who's not disgusting, it would have been as if they opened up their dryer and ET was

98
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,360
 sitting in there. It would have been completely alien. So that must have tormented that young woman.

99
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,520
 Now it's possible that she didn't even care, it's possible she took a bite out of it and she goes,

100
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,840
 "I hunger!" and she like eats mold, of course. But there, if it happened to me, I would tell that

101
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,120
 story to people for a while. I'd be like, "Dude, you want to hear something weird when I was doing

102
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,760
 laundry? Assuming I'm not disgusting, let's say I'm you. Let's say I'm you and I'm doing my laundry

103
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,240
 and I'm assuming you're not disgusting and something gross jumps out of the dryer." I would go,

104
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,200
 "There's no way this could have happened." And people would be like, "Someone might have thrown

105
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,240
 it in there." And I go, "What madman would throw this on my clothes at random?" So it would be

106
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,720
 what we would call an unexplained event. You would have theories. You would go, "Maybe it came out

107
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
 of the dryer. Maybe it was in your clothes to begin with and which would make you super petrified

108
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
 about what was going on in your house." Maybe someone threw it in there, but then the question

109
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,640
 has become who? Why? And what is it? It would be an unexplained event. It would be something that

110
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,920
 someone made post on Reddit. That happened like 15 years ago, maybe 20 years ago, honestly. But it

111
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,560
 would be something someone would post on Reddit, you know, weird things found in your laundry.

112
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
 Some girls like, "Well, you know when I went to UC Davis?" The reason why I bring

113
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,280
 this up is because it ties back to the Veronica story. There is a key piece of information that

114
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,560
 is tied into the Veronica story, just like there was a key piece of information about why that

115
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,840
 unexplained event happened to that woman's laundry. You see, in the past week as well,

116
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,280
 I have stopped taking the nicotine losanges because I'm just tired. One, they were expensive.

117
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,800
 Two, they were messing with my keto. And three, I was taking way too many of them. And I said,

118
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,040
 "Okay, it's time to get off nicotine for good." So I'm stepping down using the patch, which has been

119
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,800
 fairly easy transition. But for those of you who have ever tried giving up nicotine, and for those

120
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,040
 of you specifically who have used the patch, they give vivid dreams, vivid, vivid dreams. So by simply

121
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,880
 having that extra piece of information, oh, there is a rational explanation for you to have those

122
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,360
 vivid dreams. And I think that's one thing we always got to look at. I feel like I'm becoming

123
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,960
 even more skeptical doing this show because I'll read stuff and I'll go. There's information missing

124
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,960
 that I know isn't true. Lana recently sent me the story about there's a spate of

125
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,600
 cattle mutilations going on in Oregon. And Lana sent it to me. And she goes, "I thought this would

126
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,560
 be right up your alley." And my response was, "I don't believe it." Like, I don't believe when

127
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,480
 they keep saying, "All the blood is drained from the cows." All of it. I go, "That's just not true.

128
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,520
 That's 100% not true." What happens is you're coming across the scene and there's no blood at the scene.

129
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,640
 So there's no blood. I mean, are they literally going through every single

130
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,240
 vein and artery and organ in the body and discover up? Nope. It looks like parchment down there.

131
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,960
 It's completely dry. There's not a single drop. No, that's not true. There's less blood in the body

132
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,240
 than should be. And there's less blood at the scene than there should be. But I can't go there to

133
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,640
 verify it. I just know from steady and cattle mutilations, you hear these terms. There's no blood

134
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,800
 in the body. When we look at the original news reports, they'll say there's no blood at the scene.

135
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:58,400
 So when we lack the information to really look at it objectively, we are missing a key point.

136
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,920
 Just like how I omitted that detail on purpose that I had recently quit. The loss in jizz,

137
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,120
 I'm on the patch. Those are both will cause side effects of very vivid dreams. At the same time,

138
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,120
 I got a doll that causes vivid dreams. You got to have all the information. Just like that young

139
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,720
 woman who's probably in a mental hospital in Davis. She's like, "No, no, not that night again." She's

140
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,440
 like, "We'll never go near another dryer." She's hand washing all of her clothes and just stands

141
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,840
 guard with a shotgun. She didn't have all the information. To her, that was a gross unexplained

142
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,840
 event. If she had all the information, she would realize there was just a maniac, a gross disgusting

143
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,240
 man hiding out in her off-campus dorms. Let's go ahead and move on to our... That was the story.

144
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,720
 That was a first story. A little Veronica the doll update. Let's go ahead and move on to this next

145
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,200
 story. Now, and I'll keep you updated on Veronica the doll as well. I guess the moral of that story

146
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,160
 is we got to have all the information. Now, these next two stories are kind of weird because they're

147
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,080
 very, very basic ghost stories. But I'll be honest, man, I broke my back looking into these things.

148
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,720
 You know what? Let's do a very, very quick Dead Rabbit Recommends here too. Let's do a quick one

149
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,760
 here. This is probably one of my favorite horror movies. And I'm going to say right off the bat,

150
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:21,120
 it has probably one of the dumbest killer motivations I've ever seen. And I watch a ton of these

151
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,480
 B/R movies. There's a group of sorority girls named Theta Pi. Do or die, Theta Pi. They're sisters

152
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:36,160
 for life. Sisters keep secrets. But recently, one of their brothers was like feeling up a girl who

153
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,200
 was drunk and they wanted to like get back at him and show him how that's not cool. So they pull a

154
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:49,600
 prank. And they make him think that he accidentally caused this girl to overdose. The girl's in on it.

155
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,560
 And they do this whole thing where they drive out to this abandoned well and they're like,

156
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,000
 we're going to dump the body now and you got to keep your mouth shut, Billy or whatever his name

157
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,400
 was. You got to keep your mouth shut. And they're all giggling and laughing. And this kid is drunk

158
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,480
 and he's high and he's overwrought with guilt because he thinks that this girl that he was trying

159
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,160
 to make out with overdosed on a drug he gave her. And while they're debating how far they're going

160
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,040
 to take this plan, he picks up a tire iron and stabs her in the throat. And so kills her for real.

161
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,280
 And so they have to reveal, it's just a joke. It was just a joke. It was just a joke. And then

162
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,440
 they do have to drop her body in the abandoned well and take an oath of secrecy. They'd apply,

163
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,640
 do or die. Sisters always keep secrets. The movie's called Sorority Row and it's funny because it's

164
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,440
 such a basic setup for horror movies. It's actually a remake of a 70s horror movie. But the directing

165
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,560
 is phenomenal for this type of movie. It's not Dunkirk. But there are just beautiful shots in

166
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,520
 the movie. The cinematography is on point. The acting is good. And the women are gorgeous,

167
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,320
 which is always a good selling point. The deaths are really inventive. Really enjoy that. And

168
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,320
 there's a level of tension throughout the movie because that's how the movie starts. So even

169
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,200
 when they're not being stalked by a killer, there's this level of tension because we jump ahead

170
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,680
 a year. And these girls have been living with the secret for this whole time. So you're trying to

171
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,120
 figure out who's going to break. Like who's going to act because it's weighing on all of them. They're

172
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,400
 getting ready to graduate now. And of course, a serial killer shows up with a tire iron. And it's

173
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,400
 one of those tire irons. It's like a cross. So it's like, has the four. It's like a cross. You

174
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,680
 know what a cross looks like. And the killer has tricked it out. So like one side has a blade and

175
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,560
 the other side has like a saw and then one part has a drill. And the dude's like throwing it like

176
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,480
 a ninja star and using it to break down the, it's a really inventive horror movie. And it racks up

177
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,080
 quite the pot account. I'm recommending this one because one, it's one of my favorite horror movies

178
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,400
 of all time. Two, a lot of the horror movies I've recommended for Halloween, they're very like

179
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 movies you want to sit down and watch. Sorority Row is a movie you can have on the background at

180
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,640
 a party. You can have it on the background. It's just a funny, it's a very well written horror movie.

181
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:10,480
 The ending, the killer's motivation is one of the worst killer motivations I've ever

182
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,120
 seen. However, the third act is still really good. The third act is still on point. Like once they

183
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,560
 reveal the killer motivation, I remember I was watching that with Lana and she goes,

184
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,160
 that's terrible. And I was like, yeah, I know, but the next 15 minutes are still really cool. And

185
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,440
 she's like, oh yeah, yeah, I mean, like it does end well. Because then you have this kind of set

186
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,040
 piece after you find out who the killer is. One of the worst killer motivations on record. However,

187
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,280
 other than that, it doesn't completely sink the movie because the movie is that good. Any other

188
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,280
 movie would have completely destroyed it. Sorority Row. Check it out. Anyways, let's go ahead and move

189
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,400
 on with our tale of ghost ships. Wait, there's no where on a ghost ship. What would the ghost,

190
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,440
 you'd hear that ding ding ding ding ding like the little bell and the fog and then the

191
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:08,800
 that's a that's either a ghost boat going through San Francisco Bay or a rocking chair

192
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,080
 knocking over a glass of water. It's your decision. Let's start off with the story of the squando.

193
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,880
 So the ghost story is this. There was a Norwegian ship named Squando. And from the very beginning,

194
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,160
 it was cursed. What happened was a couple of people died building the boat, which

195
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,200
 that must be difficult. Like how do you die building a boat? You're like, oh no, I fell off

196
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,040
 into the soft stuff called the water. And then you just went back on the boat. It's not like building

197
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,480
 a dam where you're like falling like two miles to your death or getting trapped in concrete or

198
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,400
 anything like that. It's you fall and I get that boats can be high, but still. But what happened?

199
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,320
 Did you get your timbers too shivered? How do you die building a boat? Anyways, like eight people

200
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,760
 died building this boat. So I don't know if they were building it out of Ebola or what, but anyways,

201
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,360
 the one of the wives of one of the dudes who died said, I curse this boat. She's like spitting on

202
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,000
 the boat. She's like a cursit. And then to make the curse stick, she kills herself. So very, very

203
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,000
 bleak beginning to the story of the squando. In 1890, it's parked at the Embarcadero in San

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,320
 Francisco. And the captain finds out that his first mate is banging his wife. And so he goes,

205
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,960
 okay, wife, I'm going to murder you unless you help me murder this dude you're sleeping with. And

206
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,880
 she goes, oh yeah, totally down with the whole murder plot. Don't kill me. So she holds the dude

207
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,680
 down and the captain jumps on top of him and cuts his head off with a hatchet. They throw the head

208
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,000
 into a bucket. Throw, I don't know why we'll get into that. Throw the body overboard. They go on

209
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
 the run. Eventually, the other people on the boat are like, Hey, where's our captain? Hey,

210
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,280
 where's our first mate? Hey, what's in this bucket? Ah, they call the cops. The cops find the couple.

211
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,160
 And the couple is executed for their crime. And the boat is still a boat. So they get a new captain,

212
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,240
 the company buys the boat or however boats work. And then the company owns the boat and they hire

213
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,160
 captain. Anyways, they go, we still got this boat. They hire a new captain on the first journey. The

214
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,200
 crew mutinies kills the captain. So they have to get a new captain and they have to get a new crew.

215
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,440
 No one wants to work with those guys. They get a new captain, new crew. That captain dies under

216
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,320
 mysterious circumstances. They get a new captain. That captain dies as well. At that point, it's in

217
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,200
 Bathhurst and New Brunswick, which I believe is up in Canada. And they go, no one wants to work on

218
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
 the boat. Nobody wants to work on the boat. So when the company's trying to figure out what to do

219
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,040
 with the boat, they have to hire these guards to keep watch over it, which if people go on the boat

220
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,840
 die, I don't really think you need guards. Anyways, there are guards at the boat. And they said they

221
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,920
 could see the specter of a headless man wandering around the deck. So they bounced. And then at

222
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,600
 that point, the company goes, nobody wants to be on the boat. Nobody even wants to guard the boat.

223
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,280
 And they scuttled it. And according to legend, sometimes you can still see the squando, the

224
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,720
 ghostly shape of the squando out in the San Francisco Bay. Fascinating ghost story. The question was,

225
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,280
 and going back to the tubular, we'll call this from now on the tubular mold theory,

226
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,720
 is there information that's missing to make the story make sense? I had to really dig into this

227
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,720
 one. Really, really dig into this one. Now, there's a lot of different variations of it. Some of them,

228
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,880
 the head is thrown overboard. There's no head put in a bucket. Some of the versions, the couple is

229
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,640
 not caught. They escape. They're never seen again. Some of the versions are that it wasn't cursed

230
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,800
 because people died while the boat was being constructed. It was cursed because there was a

231
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,240
 woman on board for its first voyage, which apparently is a bad thing. And people were like,

232
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,280
 "What? You brought a woman on board? This ship is cursed!" And then that got retconned to people

233
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,800
 dying. But who knows which version is true? Most likely just the woman being on board,

234
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,200
 just because it's more simple than everything else. But you also have to go,

235
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,560
 "My first thing was, is this story true at all? Is this story true at all?" And it's just all these

236
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,200
 little legends. So, and I honestly spent a long amount of time trying to research this one.

237
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,200
 And it's really real. It's still kind of up in the air. The boat itself did exist, but I found

238
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,520
 it interesting detail. If you go to Bathurst, let's go to Bathurst in New Brunswick. We're

239
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,200
 gonna take the rabbit rowboat. We're gonna sail over there. We're gonna do CSI as in

240
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,640
 "see" scene investigation. See, like, the ocean? Anyways, so we're there. And we hop off the rabbit

241
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,720
 rowboat. We're meeting some old salty people. Horses are constantly licking them. They're like,

242
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,480
 "Get away. Get away." We're like, "So what do you know about this boat?" And this old salty man

243
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,120
 sits down on a snail, immediately dissolves him, and then he sits down in a chair, as he should.

244
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,080
 And he goes, "Yes, there is a boat called the Squando." Or, "There was a boat called the Squando."

245
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,360
 And yes, it was in Bathurst. But there was no verification that it was ever in the

246
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,240
 Embarcadero. It was no verification that it was on the West Coast in San Francisco. Not saying

247
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,720
 that it wasn't. Because British Columbia, I think Bathurst is up in British Columbia. It's all on

248
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,680
 the West Coast, but the idea of this murder taking place in San Francisco couldn't find any record

249
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,720
 of it. You'd seem like that would be a really, really sensational murder. Husband and wife team

250
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,400
 up to kill wife's lover, head found in bucket under bed. News at 11. Page 11, because there was no

251
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
 television back then. So why don't we have any record of that? So you're thinking it must be

252
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,080
 fake. Tubular mold theory. The detail is missing because it doesn't exist, right? There is an

253
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 issue of the Chat Ham Gazette. There is an issue. December 10th, 1887. So, three years before the

254
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,200
 story supposedly took place in 1890 in San Francisco Bay. 1887, the Chat Ham Gazette.

255
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,080
 The little newspaper over there. And it says the boat was stuck in the mud over in Bathurst.

256
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,720
 And it was the storm had knocked it into this muddy bank. And the article goes on to say that

257
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,200
 some guy bought it for $40 and they're going to salvage it, break it up, sell the wood or whatever.

258
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,960
 So you're like, it was never over there. The story must be fake. If there's a news article three years

259
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,080
 before the story supposedly took place, then someone just found out about a boat that was

260
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,520
 scuttled and created a myth. The article in the Chat Ham Gazette, December 10th, 1887, starts off

261
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,160
 with the sentence, "No more will Bathurst be agitated by the headless ghost of the haunted

262
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,240
 squando." And then it goes on to say, "The boat was stuck in the mud because of a storm and some

263
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,560
 guy bought it for $40." And they begin scuttling it. They begin taking it apart. And then the last

264
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,920
 sentence of the article says, "The men engaged in the work were somewhat surprised to find,

265
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,240
 in between the timbers of the vessel, a bucket and an old metal axe."

266
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:06,160
 So is the story true? Fascinating. Fascinating little detail. That's from a news article.

267
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,960
 So, and there's nothing else. Every time you look for this boat, it tells you this story about

268
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,240
 something that happened in San Francisco. It's very sensational and detailed. And the boat had all

269
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,640
 this stuff and the other captains and the mutiny and the gypsy curse and all that stuff. But we can

270
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,800
 go back to three years before that story ever happened, 1887, and find this article. And they're

271
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,440
 like, "Yeah, remember that headless ghost walking around Bathurst haunting us? Don't gotta worry

272
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,080
 about it anymore." And that's all. Who knows? This is a fascinating story because there's enough

273
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,560
 detail to make me think that at least the legend is true. It's not something that was passed around

274
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,560
 on the internet. At least the legend was true. But the truth of the headless ghost, the bucket,

275
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,640
 the axe, we have all these details that most likely are true. And then it got transformed into

276
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,880
 this story that's super detailed that takes place in San Francisco. What was in the bucket? Was the

277
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,160
 axe used to murder someone? Was there really a headless ghost walking around the deck of that

278
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,680
 boat? And over the years, the story has just become this super detailed fake haunting, but based on

279
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,800
 a real life ghost. Let's save the other ghost boat story for tomorrow. I've actually run out of time

280
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,720
 on that one. So that was an anticlimactic conclusion. Tomorrow, though, we have another ghost boat

281
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,360
 story that's fascinating in the same way and, again, found enough news articles, found proof

282
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:39,120
 that this story may also be just as true. There really may be at least one ghost boat

283
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,600
 still haunting the San Francisco Bay. We'll talk about that tomorrow on Dead Rabbit Radio.
