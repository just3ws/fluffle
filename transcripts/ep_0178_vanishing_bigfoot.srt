1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Are serial killers patrolling the world's waterways?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 And then we take an interesting look at the theory of the vanishing Bigfoot.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is there a real reason why we can never find bones or hair or a body of a Bigfoot?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Are they from another dimension?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And even more creepy than that, can they pull us into their homeworld today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I don't know, I think I'm a lot bigger.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I am your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 The Discord server is blowing up.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 We have 40 people jump on probably within the first half hour to hour of announcing that we have a Discord server.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I recommend you guys check out the show notes.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's a really cool place for you guys to communicate with other listeners of the show.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 A lot of cool friendships were born last night, I believe.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I got another piece of fan art from Twitter user 9.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 It is a mashup of Dead Rabbit and Bloody Mary, which 9 said it was their favorite episode so far.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So I'll have that in the show notes as well. Go ahead and check that out.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's just a really cool community. You guys are awesome.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 You guys are really, really cool and I appreciate having such awesome friends listening to the show.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Our first story, imagine you're walking down the road late at night.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And you're not in the boonies, you're not in the middle of nowhere.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 You just left the bar. You just had a good time with your mates.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 You're in America so you just had a good time with your friends.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And you're leaving the bar. You're a little tipsy, a little wobbly as you're walking down the street.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 See a little pink elephant dancing around in front of you, a little pinko dancing around in front of you.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But you don't want to drive so you're like, "I'm just going to walk."

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 I'm just going to walk on a little wobbly, a little unstable.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 It's three in the morning and you start to hear footsteps behind you.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You turn around, you see someone walking. You don't really think anything.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But then you hear...

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And right when you turn around, he grabs you.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Three days later, your family and friends find you floating down the river.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Now I guess that's probably the not the most entertaining and uplifting way to start this story.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But that's the theory that's going on.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Not that you are being thrown in a river, but...

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So between the 1990s and 2008, two retired police detectives investigated over 250 bodies of young men.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Sorry if you were a woman listening to that part, but you're just...

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 You're not in the statistics.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 250 bodies of young men found in waterways across 11 states.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And these two detectives dubbed this phenomenon the "Smiley Face Killer" or "Smiley Face Killers."

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 So they called it that because where the body is either found or where they believe the body was dumped,

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 there is a spray-painted smiley face on the wall.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 This is a conspiracy theory that's been going around for a long time.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And when it first came out, I was like, "Oh my God, this is terrifying."

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Basically a network of serial killers are hunting down these men.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And the men do fit a pattern.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 They tend to be white.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 They tend to be very athletic.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Kind of the cream of the crop of their class, their college-educated guys.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Very fit.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Probably handsome.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Probably would make me question things.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And so the police were saying, these two detectives actually were saying that these guys fit a pattern,

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 which makes us think it's a serial killer or a group of serial killers.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And the theory has broadened out from there.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 The last time I read an interview, one of the detectives was saying, "Yes, there's a group of serial killers,

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 and they communicate via the deep web, and they kind of assign targets."

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And one of the reasons why they may be picking these people is to lash out at the best of the best.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Like, they're going after the top dogs of the school.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 These aren't random events.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Now, the reason why it's a conspiracy theory is almost every local police department has said,

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "That's not true.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 We investigated this.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 We know what to look for.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 This was an accidental drowning.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 This was someone who was drunk, stumbled out of a bar,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 because that's the pattern too.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It's usually late at night, and the subject is intoxicated.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 It's usually in a downtown area with a waterway.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 It's not like you're walking through a goalie, and someone pushes you into a creek.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You're in a populated area when this happens.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 They're saying, listen, these people are just, it's unfortunate,

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 but these young men are out partying, they get drunk, fall in the river, and they die.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It's very, very common.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Now, so when I first heard about the Smiley Face Killers, again, I was like, oh my god, this is terrifying.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 But as time went on, and there was really no...

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 The only real development of note has been one of the cases of the 250 was changed to a homicide.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 One.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I was like, it's probably not.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 We've never seen a network of serial killers, at least one that's really been caught.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 We've had cults kill people, but nothing that could span decades and stuff like that.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So I go, that's a little iffy. The Smiley Face thing, the pushback on that is,

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 the Smiley Face is everywhere.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And there's no limit to, like, if they find a body here, and then they find a Smiley Face a mile upriver,

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 is that that count?

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 What if they find it a mile downriver? Does that count?

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Like, what's the gait?

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Like, a lot of skeptics have been looking into this.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Like, they're saying the two detectives, their investigation methods are fairly sloppy.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 They're in it for the money and stuff like that.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Another one of the...

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 This was interesting. Drunk people tend to walk downhill.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 I think it's interesting when people like psychologists or scientists in general can chart a behavior.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 They say people who are drunk tend to prefer to walk downhill because it's easier,

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 which I actually think it's harder, but I guess walking uphill drunk, I mean, I'd rather just walk straight.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But I guess if you didn't have that option, this is the working scenario.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 These men leave bars, they're drunk, and they walk downhill and fall in the water.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Or they're trying to pee, they're like relieving themselves, they fall in the water,

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 or they're just walking a straight line and they fall in the water.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 There's all accidental.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 There's actually this phrase I came across researching that's called auto-assassination.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 It's a term meaning people who engage in risky behavior.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And that's what the skeptics are saying these guys did.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 They drank to excess, they were walking along a river,

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 they may have been showing off or doing something stupid, they auto-assassinated themselves.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That may or may not be true, but auto-assassination is a dope name for a band.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 So, when I came across the Smiley Face Killer thing, I was like, "Yeah."

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I mean, like I was really into it in the beginning, then I kind of petered out on it.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So, when I started doing the show, I was thinking, "Eh, that's not worth covering.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I just don't really think there's any meat to it."

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So, Las Vegas Carnivore, when he sends me a YouTube comment asking about Smiley Face Killers,

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I was like, "Well, you know, I just think it's been pretty fairly debunked."

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Then, this is what I love about you guys, he sent me a new piece of information.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 This isn't an America thing.

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 So, again, it could simply be that people are leaving bars drunk in other parts of the world.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 That's definitely possible.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 We have the Smiley Face Killers that are spread out across the 11 states in 20 years,

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 so it would take this huge network of killers to really pull this off.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 In England, they have to one-up us, they have something called the Manchester Pusher.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So, there's the City of Manchester. This is insane.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 There's the City of Manchester that does have this huge waterway in it, apparently.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 I don't know, I've never been there.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And that city counts for one-third of all drowning deaths in the country of Britain.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Massive amounts of people are drowning there.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 61 deaths in six years of drowning.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 If you go to Greater Manchester, the number's up to 86 deaths in six years.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So, you're thinking, "Well, that's not as much as 250, but you had 250 over 20 years versus 86 in just six years in this one area."

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Now, Amsterdam has a similar problem, but they actually ran a big...

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I'm going to get back to Manchester in a second, because...

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So, Amsterdam, you know, they have their famous waterways. They also have a similar problem.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 They're the ones who say it's people falling into the water and they're just drowning.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 10% of the people found drowned in Amsterdam have their flies down.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So, they go, "Yes, these young men are leaving bars and relieving themselves in the river and they fall in the river and drown."

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It's unfortunate, but that's what we believe is happening.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 They say that these incidents always happen on Saturday and Sunday nights.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So, again, it's a drinking thing. It's related to a bar.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So, Amsterdam is like, "We are with America. We think it's just tragic accident."

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 In Manchester, though, there have been reports...

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 There has been one report in particular of a man surviving the attack.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He was attacked. He was pushed into the water and someone was trying to hold him down and he got away, and the dude booked out.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So, in that country, you have someone who was drunk leaving a bar and got pushed into the river by another person.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Is it possible he was simply panicking and thought somebody was there?

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Yeah, it's possible. But I think if you looked at the statistics, they should correlate across the board to have 61 to 86 deaths

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 to have one-third of all your drowning deaths in one area within six years and have somebody report

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 that they were attacked in a manner similar to how the other bodies are found raises a lot of questions.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And the weird thing is, the police even in Manchester are just like, "Yeah, no, people are just drowning."

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The questions are being raised and the authorities aren't answering them.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 I don't know if there is a smiley face killer or killers, but there is most likely a Manchester pusher

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 pushing young men into the rivers drunk and helpless and they're just walking away into the night.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 You know, for our next story, we're going to go back to Bigfoot Country.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 We've covered Bigfoot a lot this season and I got some more Bigfoot stuff coming and it's weird

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 because Bigfoot really straddles the line in paranormal stuff.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 A lot of people treat Bigfoot as it is a species, it is a cryptid, it is like a humanoid creature that breeds and has food,

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 like it has eating patterns and it has this structure of some sort.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 People talk about Bigfoot the same way that you would talk about bear population.

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Like, maybe the Bigfoot's moved their tribe or, you know, they talk about it as if it's this real living biological entity.

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And then every so often you come across this story that says, "Bigfoot is so far beyond our comprehension."

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Like, to think of it as a creature that eats, poops, breeds, and dies is very, very wrong.

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Bigfoot is something else.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 I think it's interesting because even this show, like, I'll talk about the Almas and I think the Almas did exist.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I actually totally believe that there were Cro-Magnon or Neanderthal men running around very recently in Mongolia.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 If that stuff I read was true, then I believe that.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 If it was all made up, I don't believe it, but...

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 You know what I mean? Like, I think that's possible.

165
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But when we talk about 8' tall, the Sasquatch, I'm really starting to be iffy on whether or not, if it does exist.

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And I don't know if it does.

167
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 But if it does exist, I don't think it's a half human, half ape wandering through the woods that...

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I think it just may be something totally off base.

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 It's not an animal at all.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Let's get into this.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 This was a request from Bennett.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 He actually sent me an email a while back with a couple bigfoot things and I've been kind of going through it.

173
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The year is 1980.

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I was 4 years old.

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 So imagine me in my underroos while this story is taking place.

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 This story actually also takes place in Eugene, Oregon.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's not too far from me now and the story is, again, it's kind of mind blowing if you're...

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Okay, let's just get into it.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 The year is 1980.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 If it's true, if it's true.

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Could be totally made up, but the year is 1980.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 In Eugene, Oregon, there is a man named Larry Kelm who wants to go for a hike.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 And there's this famous hiking trail from the Saddleblanken Mountain to Oak Ridge that he's going to walk along.

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And there's this old Native American trading camp there that he's like, "I'm going to go there."

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It's a nice place to relax.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 It's a long hike, but this is what he does for fun.

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 This is how he relaxes.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Now, again, I've said in previous episodes, don't ever be a hiker because weird stuff's going to happen to you like this.

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 First two days of a hike, very leisurely, just walking.

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 [Humming]

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 [Humming]

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Giant cat attacks him.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 No, but giant cat doesn't attack him, but it is a leisurely walk.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Little squirrels, little birds, sounds of nature.

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 After two days of hiking, you just, you know, you kind of get lost in your thoughts through your middle of nowhere.

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 [Humming]

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Everything goes blurry and gray.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Larry's standing there in the middle of this forest.

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 It's daytime, but things look off.

200
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 He takes another step forward.

201
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Whoa.

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Things get even more out of focus.

203
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And at this point, he's taking another step almost out of instinct, and he moves into night.

204
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 He is now in an area where it is nighttime, surrounded by jungle.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 The area, just to let you know, Oregon is not a jungle.

206
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 If you didn't know that, Oregon is a forest, but Larry says he was walking and he hit something and he said it was the equivalent of looking underwater for a moment.

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Everything was just blurry.

208
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And his momentum carried him through, and the next thing he knows, he's standing in an area at night in the jungle.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Completely. Everything is just still.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 No squirrels, no bobcats, nothing.

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And he said the area was lit.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 He goes, "There was no stars in the sky," which is actually quite a chilling image.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 When you're out in the middle of nowhere, you should see stars all the time.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So to be out in the middle of nowhere, unless there's clouds, obviously, but to be out in the middle of nowhere and to look up and see no stars, that is a small detail, but it's a very alien, inhospitable detail.

215
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He said, "There were no stars in the sky, but the area was lit by something and I couldn't tell what."

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Gotcha.

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And there's a voice from behind him.

218
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 He said, "I didn't hear it in my head."

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And it didn't sound like it was talking to me, but I heard something from behind me go, "Gotcha."

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And in that moment, almost like in slow motion, he says he turned to his right and he started to see a hand reach around to get him.

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And he stepped back and as he did, the hand grabbed where his throat had previously been and he stumbles back into the daylight.

222
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He described the arm that he saw as long and hairy.

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The hand, the thumb was lower down on the arm than it would appear on a human hand and it had a large, or cut,

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 and he described it as pale ivory sharp claws on each finger.

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 He said, "Actually touched him because it didn't cut me, but I felt the arm reach around and kind of scrape my neck as it moved past and then grabbed right where I..."

226
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 He goes, "If I hadn't moved, when I did, it would have grabbed my neck."

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And he stumbles back out.

228
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 He's now back in the forest and he looks and he sees a shimmering portal that looks like it's water just right in the forest.

229
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 He goes, "I didn't see it when I walked through it."

230
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 He said, his words were, "It was a trap."

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It was a trap.

232
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It's like a spider landing in a web.

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 They don't see it.

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 It's like a fly landing in a web.

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 They don't see it.

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's not designed for them to see.

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 That's how he described this thing, this portal.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So he's watching this portal now and it just disappears.

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And now he can see the trail perfectly clear in front of him.

240
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 By his account that two-day leisurely walk, he was back to his car in three hours.

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 He kicked bricks the whole way.

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 He was out of there.

243
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And then later said, he goes, "I've had...

244
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I can't sleep.

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 That really messed me up."

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And what's so weird is he goes, "I can't imagine what would happen if I'd driven my truck through that thing."

247
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And that's a weird...

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 What's interesting is I don't think he's lying.

249
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 I don't think he's making this up.

250
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 He could be.

251
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But something about the story seems fairly authentic.

252
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 And I think it's an interesting...

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It's interesting to see that you're playing with different materials and outcomes.

254
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Different things that you could have used.

255
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 It's almost like you're trying to prevent that from ever happening again.

256
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So you think, "What if I had a box cutter?

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 What if I had a gun?

258
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 What if I had a baseball bat?"

259
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And you play these events over and over again in your head with these different outcomes.

260
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 That detail rang true to me where he's like,

261
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 "If I was driving in my car, I would have been gone."

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And I think the sense of it being that if his car...

263
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Because he only took about three steps through this portal.

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 If his car was going 60 miles an hour through one,

265
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 and it crashes into the jungle, and then he has to crawl out of his car and find where he got there.

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 But something about the story rings true.

267
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 It could have been a hallucination.

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I think it definitely happened to him.

269
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It could have been a hallucination.

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It could have been a whole bunch of things.

271
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 But I think he experienced what he's talking about.

272
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 So that begs the question.

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Was that creature on the other side of that portal a Bigfoot?

274
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And it really does explain a lot of things about Bigfoot.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And what Bennett requested was vanishing Bigfoot.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And he sent me all of these links.

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And this was one of the stories I got out of this.

278
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 The other stories were like,

279
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 "I was walking through the woods. I saw a Bigfoot, and then it wasn't there."

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And it was like 50 stories of that.

281
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And I read all of those to get...

282
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And I was like, "This is detailed."

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Like, I don't care if you see a Bigfoot, you turn the corner and he's not there.

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I lose people like that all the time.

285
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 The vanishing Bigfoot phenomenon is very well known.

286
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Not in this level of detail, but people saying they saw a Bigfoot,

287
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 and then it disappears, or the Bigfoot...

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Not we can't ever find any of their dead bodies.

289
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 We can find very, very little evidence, if any, that they exist.

290
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 But I think it could be that they're trying to hunt a Bigfoot the way you would hunt an elk.

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 They're looking for feces, and they're looking for fur.

292
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 They're looking for bones.

293
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 But all of that stuff hinges on the idea that the Bigfoot is in some way a biological creature.

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 That is the entire way that the Bigfoot community has really been focusing on Bigfoot.

295
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 As a biological creature that can either be shot and killed,

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 can be captured, or can be communicated with,

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 the way that we communicate with Coco the Monkey,

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 or Lassie.

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And it's really more likely that that is not true.

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 If Bigfoot does exist, I don't think it's a beastal creature.

301
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And I think we have to make a distinction between creatures like the Almas of Mongolia,

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 which were these giant Neanderthal type things,

303
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 that were reported of having a society by historians,

304
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 and this creature that is this hairy beast that apparently walks among us today,

305
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 that nobody can ever get any proof of outside of a few blurry photos.

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Is the Bigfoot not an offshoot of humanity?

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Is Bigfoot not the missing link?

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Is Bigfoot not the gentle giant in the woods?

309
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Is it possible that the entity that we know of as the Bigfoot is plain dumb?

310
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Is it possible that this creature is hunting us?

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I think it's far more likely that Bigfoot is either from another dimension.

312
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 I know that's going to sound ridiculous, but it's Occam's razor.

313
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Like, Occam's razor is obviously that Bigfoot does not exist,

314
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and that it's all completely made up.

315
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 100% made up.

316
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 That's Occam's razor. That's the most obvious answer.

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 But then, if you eliminate that, I don't think it's a biological entity.

318
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It really can't be at this point.

319
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 We've been hunting it for really 100 years at this point.

320
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And there's never been a body or a bone found that's been conclusively known as to be a Bigfoot bone.

321
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 There really leaves a few options.

322
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 One, it's Alien, which we're going to get into on a later episode,

323
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 that Bigfoot's are either Aliens or Alien Pets, or something even more sinister,

324
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 or that Bigfoot can move in and out of dimensions.

325
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 That Bigfoot is basically a solid ghost.

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 It can break twigs when it wants to, it can leave footprints when it wants to,

327
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 it can throw rocks when it wants to, but when it doesn't, it leaves our reality.

328
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 There's a lot of people out there who fancy themselves as Bigfoot hunters,

329
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and they know the territory that they're going to.

330
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 They know where the Bigfoot sightings have been.

331
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 They get all their gear. They get their rifles just in case.

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 They go out with their buddies to go find Bigfoot.

333
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 But there's the possibility that someday they will find Bigfoot in his dark dimension,

334
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 where there are no stars.

335
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And the last thing you hear is, "Gotcha!"

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
