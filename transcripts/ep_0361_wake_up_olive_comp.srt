1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 A grim discovery.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,140
 Stardoles scientists. And then we travel to Reading, California to investigate whether or not a cult is taking over the city.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,380
 But this isn't any cult.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,100
 It's a cult that can raise the dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,600
 [Music]

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenteror.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,220
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a lot of fun today.

8
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,800
 Let's go to Poland. Let's go to the year 2013

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
 Poland.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,040
 Bing! We're magically there. Carpenter copters in the shop. We're just walking around a bunch of trees are surrounding us.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,320
 We're hanging out with a bunch of bat researchers. These guys are hunting bats. So we're there. We have rifles.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,080
 We're like, they're like, no we're not hunting bats like that dude. You lunatic swark.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,480
 He's showing up with shotguns to blow these, blow these bats away. We're like, oh, I thought that's what we were doing.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,600
 We put our rifles and shotguns away. They're like, no we're observing the like migration pattern.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,700
 Then we just kind of zone out as they kind of tell us what they're actually doing with the bats.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,760
 But while they are looking for the bats, this is what happened. True story here. They're hunting bats.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,360
 They're searching for bats and they know that the bats tend to hang out in this underground

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,160
 abandoned nuclear bunker, which is probably the four coolest words you can put together.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,160
 And so they're in there. They're shining their flashlights and the bats are like

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,920
 And they're like all flying out all dramatically. There's some guy in the corner being like, oh today's the day both my parents were killed.

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,960
 There's actually a thing called the Bruce Wayne syndrome in the bat research community. They don't let orphans

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,880
 work with bats because they're afraid what's gonna happen. It's an actual thing. Don't Google it. Don't look don't look it up

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
 But it's called the Bruce Wayne

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:02,240
 What did I call him before the blue? It's not the Bruce Wayne syndrome. It's the Bruce Wayne Claws. They have it at universities. Bat

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,080
 universities. They don't they when you go to apply for this joke's taken too long. You guys got it. It was dumb

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 Let's just keep going here. A bunch of bats flying around some guy in the corner going hmm. What scares a criminal?

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,760
 And the rest of the bat researchers are like again

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,480
 Another vigilante was born on this research trip as well, but as we're watching the bats fly around

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,400
 something

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,320
 Unexpected happens. Not the birth of a crime fighter. No, they expect that at this point when they're walking around this bunker. They hear a

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,560
 Now like what is that noise like we get it? There's leaves and stuff on the ground

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,300
 They're making the noise and who wasn't a goblin story doesn't involve a goblin coming up behind them

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 And they were never seen again. No the crunching noise was from them walking around

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,920
 They're like that's weird and they're looking around making sure none of their co-workers are eating rice Krispies. None of them are

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,200
 They're walking on ants and they're like, okay big deal. Huh? You know me finish. They're walking on

36
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,480
 one million ants a

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,020
 Million ants in there they went in there to steady bats and instead they found a colony of one million ants and

38
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,300
 in a pitch dark

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,980
 Nuclear bunker and they're kind of scratching their heads and they're like

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,500
 I wonder what what all these ants are doing in here

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,300
 Wonder what they're also scratching their heads because bats keep landed in their hair

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,820
 But they're like why are a bunch of ants in here? So they went and got some ant dudes

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,820
 They went and got some ant scientists to come to this bunker

44
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,480
 They go back to the university and they're like hey, yeah, we did all our bat stuff

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,120
 But you guys might want to go check this place out. And so this is what this is terrifying. This is terrifying

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,360
 So they go there. They're looking at ants. This is what they surmised

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,800
 This is what they've figured out is that there's no queen down there. And I like that's weird

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,840
 So this isn't an actual like ant colony because that'd be fine million ants big giant colony

49
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,940
 They're living here, but here's the thing. There's no queen which means they can't reproduce

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,960
 Every ant down there is from someplace else. There's no food at all people aren't dropping sugar cubes down there

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,720
 There's no Eminem wrappers. There's nothing. So the ants are surviving by eating other ants

52
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,880
 There's no light down there. It's pitch dark. That's why the bats loved it so much

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,400
 But the ants, you know, they can do darkness. They live underground, but you know, they like a little light

54
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,520
 They like a little sun sun on their back

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,920
 No food

56
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,200
 Not having food or being able to procreate is more important than their ability to suntan

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,900
 But for me, I wouldn't want to be trapped in the dark all the time

58
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,420
 I wouldn't want to have to eat other humans and I do like procreating as well

59
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:55,280
 But those are the three biggies. So the scientists are like how what is going on here?

60
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,800
 They don't have a queen these aren't these ants weren't born here. Where are they coming from?

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,760
 They don't have food down here. So why would they be in here in the first place? And as the scientists are like, hmm

62
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,960
 Stroking their chin and ant falls on their head. They're like, hmm

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,520
 Where'd that come from? They flick it into the darkness and they hear it immediately being eaten by other ants

64
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,760
 Hmm now that I've gotten rid of that ant now I can think about where are these ants coming?

65
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,280
 Another ant falls on its head. He's like hmm the ants are

66
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,760
 falling through vents

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,040
 Around the nuclear fallout shelter. Now. I know what you're thinking because I was thinking the same thing

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,500
 Why would you build a nuclear fallout shelter that had vents kind of defeats the purpose you're like oh

69
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,000
 We're safe now. It's time for me to breathe in some of that sweet sweet it radiated dirt

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,080
 But apparently there are vents. Maybe there's some sort of weird filtration system that's broken down since

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,820
 1960 when these things were built but ants are falling from the surface into this bomb shelter

72
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,740
 So what's happened what they imagine and there's a million down there

73
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,640
 So what has happened is over it. They're not all alive a bunch of them are like half eaten

74
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,440
 So basically it's probably 500,000 and then 500,000 half bodies

75
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,000
 But the ants are falling through the vent into pitch blackness on top of hundreds of thousands of other ants

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
 And just be like where am I? Oh my god

77
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
 I just up there to get a suntan

78
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,600
 Eating a little bit of a pair getting ready to procreate with the queen next thing I know

79
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,920
 Pitch blackness and he can feel his comrades crawling all over him. Ah get off of me get off of me

80
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,380
 And it's basically sink or swim because you fall down there those ants are starving

81
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,300
 So if you can't immediately start fighting for your life bite people with your pinchers

82
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,380
 You are snapped in half by one of your own clan because all of these ants

83
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,180
 actually were from a

84
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,860
 ant hive

85
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
 ant colony on the surface

86
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,620
 Because they ended up the scientists goes

87
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,260
 This is our theory that these ants are actually from the surface from this other colony that's right by here

88
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:05,040
 They built a bridge out of the bomb shelter back to the surface and when the ants would found the bridge and they crawled up

89
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,300
 They got to the colony. They were immediately accepted back into the colony

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,180
 so all of the ants that were falling down in there were from the same clan and

91
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,800
 You you came super close to being food like that

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,860
 Most of them probably did become food and the ants that were stuck down there. They had no queen

93
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,520
 They had no social system all they could hope for was for another sweet sweet brother to fall through that chute

94
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,820
 So they could gobble them up and the scientists decided to leave the walkway there because they're like this is going to be an ongoing

95
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,400
 Problem ants are going to keep falling through here and now when they fall through here

96
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,800
 They'll be in there for a little bit and then they'll find the bridge and they'll be able to walk back up to the surface

97
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,220
 totally fine

98
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,780
 But one thing they noticed as they were leaving there was a group of ants who refused to take the bridge up

99
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,720
 They wanted to continue to live their life in darkness looking for a family member to fall through that hole

100
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,080
 Gobble them up

101
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,620
 I find this story terrifying

102
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,500
 That story super creepy. I think you and it's 100% true. There are still a bunch of ants down there

103
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,360
 I completely review they're like I don't want to live by the Queen's rules anymore. I'd rather commit cannibalism than be part of the system

104
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,060
 Man, I'm not a cog in the machine. I'm a cannibal

105
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,880
 I don't think I'm shocking anyone to say if that same type of situation happened with humans if there was a thing where humans were

106
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,820
 Falling into a giant pit the first couple humans would be like oh no

107
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,700
 We're trapped in here and you have a couple people go into shock and a couple people just kind of die

108
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,480
 But other people would be like we're gonna survive no matter what and as more humans kept falling in there

109
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,980
 Eventually, they'd be like we don't have any food

110
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:48,100
 We're gonna eat the newest humans and then eventually human would fall down there who was stronger than the existing humans

111
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 And he would eat him in retaliation create a new social order and you would have an entire

112
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,940
 Eventually over enough time you would have a culture that was built for the darkness that was built for cannibalism

113
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,660
 And if people were like Jason, this is the dumbest analogy ever

114
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,060
 You're saying there's a pit big enough for like 60 or 70 people to fall into

115
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,760
 And they immediately devolve into cannibalism, you know what I'm saying

116
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,000
 I think it's creepy because I can definitely see the same thing happening now before we move on our next story

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,760
 I just want to remind my dear listeners a couple different ways you can support the show you can support us on patreon

118
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,500
 It's in the show notes

119
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,060
 We have a merch store in the show notes if you can't do either of those that's totally fine

120
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,800
 You can give us a review anywhere you listen to the podcast or you can promote the podcast let your friends know you listen to the

121
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,240
 podcast all four of those things help the show

122
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,020
 So so much they really help the show grow

123
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,380
 Now let's go ahead and move on to our next story

124
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,200
 So we're leaving behind the forest of Poland before we start walking out of the force you're like Jason

125
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,080
 You really don't have any ants in your pocket. I was like no man. No don't I pull my pockets out. You're like your other pocket

126
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,980
 I'm like a pull the chance come out of my back pocket. He caught me. I'll see you guys later

127
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,920
 I throw a bunch of sugar. I'm like replicate and call me your queen and then we

128
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,080
 Disappear you walk through a portal. We're in Reading, California

129
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,400
 So we're now in Reading, California, and you and I are walking down the street. I do you see me just scan on the ground

130
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,100
 I'm like where my ants where my ant brothers. You're like Jason. Stop looking for ants. I was like

131
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,860
 We're walking through Reading. You're literally holding my chin up

132
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:33,480
 so I can't look at the ground and we see a giant church in the middle of the city and it is Bethel Church and

133
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,900
 You're like so why did you bring us here? You're not taking me to church. Are you you're not gonna pray to the great ant God?

134
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,020
 I was like no no no no no I'll do that later Bethel Church

135
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,880
 They have a huge music ministry big internet presence and a huge somewhat say

136
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,320
 Outsized presence in the city of Reading the city of Reading has

137
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,400
 90,000 people in it and this church claims to have about

138
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,960
 11,000 members so that's over 10% of the population of Reading

139
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,000
 Attends this church

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,720
 At that point a police car drives by behind us and like that's weird. I'm like, yeah, it is weird. Let's walk

141
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,200
 Let's keep walking through the city here. This church has been around for quite a while and their claim

142
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,640
 They have several claims to fame. They do have this big music ministry, but that's really not what we're gonna talk about today

143
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,120
 They have some beliefs that some would consider unusual now. I've talked about this before on the show

144
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,040
 I'm a Christian myself

145
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,080
 There's a lot of people who believe that my beliefs are unusual that Jesus died came back from the dead three days later that

146
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,120
 You know Moses part of the Red Sea those are all things. I don't believe the book of Genesis. I think is a total

147
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,560
 Metaphor I don't think that the story happened literally like that as you get farther in history. I believe the New Testament

148
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,320
 I believe that these things happen so and I believe the book of Revelation is a metaphor as well

149
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,400
 So but so I just to let you guys know where I'm at and you could say well Jason

150
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,440
 That's ridiculous like you're telling me that you believe people can actually come back from the dead and and I'll say yes

151
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
 That is part of my faith that I believe people can come back from the dead. However

152
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,000
 I think there's a limit to it now

153
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Here's the thing there are

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,600
 That and that's a key detail to this story because I want you to know where I'm coming from with this story

155
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,840
 Because I'm going to be start mocking some of these guys beliefs and this is always interesting thing when you cover religion when specifically when a

156
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,040
 Believer covers religion at what point does a belief become

157
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,120
 completely bizarre to a lot of people the idea of someone being crucified being

158
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,960
 Put in a tomb and then coming back three days later is

159
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,000
 Completely impossible and to me. I'm like, yeah, maybe it may have happened. I believe it happened

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,320
 So when these people when Bethel ministry begins preaching that they can bring people back from the dead

161
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,760
 It raises a lot of eyebrows and not only raises eyebrows in the secular community

162
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,080
 But even in the religious community we go what?

163
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,280
 That's happened like two maybe three times in the Bible

164
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
 Jesus brought a dude back to life

165
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,440
 Jesus himself came back to life and there's probably something else that happened in there that I'm not aware of it's a big book

166
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,280
 But it's super rare. So when a church shows up that basically says you can do this too if you join us

167
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,240
 Just as it's basically revenge of the Sith. It's really what Palpatine promised Anakin Skywalker

168
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,680
 He could do but this is real

169
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,160
 This is a real place and Bethel has this thing called the Bethel school of

170
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,520
 Supernatural ministry and other people have called it the Christian hog warts

171
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,780
 And so you're like dude if that's why you brought me to Bethel so we could stand outside of a cult like church and

172
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:45,280
 Then go and visit their school of supernatural ministry. I'm totally down. You're like converting Christianity

173
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,360
 I'm like no no no no no no no no it's not as cool as you think it is

174
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,840
 I mean, it's cool be whatever religion you want, but don't don't change your life just because of a cool name of this school

175
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,120
 So I looked into it of course

176
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,920
 I thought about attending it and you have to be in readying to do it

177
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,080
 I was hoping they had online classes or something like that

178
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,240
 But I also imagined you were like flying around shooting laser beams out of your hands. That's what it sounds like

179
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,640
 Supernatural ministry gives you two powers. They're both fairly lame

180
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,560
 One is the ability to heal people and you're like Jason. That's not lame doc. I'm a doctor

181
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,160
 I listen to your show you calling me lame first off. Yeah secondly

182
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,320
 Yeah, sure healing people would be cool

183
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,400
 But when someone says they have magical powers and the power is basically can be replicated by a bandaid

184
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
 That's not a magical power, bro

185
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,360
 so they believe that they can heal people by laying hands on them and

186
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,640
 They have the power to preach again not a superpower

187
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,560
 You can take a speech 101 class in college and get that power as well now

188
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,840
 They may have other powers in there some people are saying that they know how to walk through walls one of the big things

189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,000
 They do and before you get excited. They can't they can't do that

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,280
 But they also do this thing called grave soaking it's where you lay on the grave of a

191
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,000
 Previous Christian religious prophet type of guy and you can soak up his energy

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
 Apparently that was something from the bible as well

193
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,600
 I mean the bible has a lot of weird stuff in it

194
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,360
 but

195
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:17,080
 They think you can do this now again back in the bible moses is thrown sticks down and they've become snakes and and all sorts of stuff

196
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,920
 There's stuff in the bible that happens that doesn't happen in real life anymore

197
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,880
 So the fact that in the bible they're able to do something doesn't mean that you can be able to do it now

198
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
 But that's one thing bethle teaches

199
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,440
 That if it was a miracle in the bible, it's good now

200
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,320
 You're like jason who cares these people are just walking around and they're telling people that they can heal people and they can lay on a grave

201
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,480
 I mean, are they bugging you now? There's also been allegations that bethle church is

202
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,360
 Taking over redding california. They're getting into the police forces. They're getting into the mayor's office into city council

203
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,480
 They allegations of them getting sweetheart deals

204
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,360
 Because they're starting to gain political power and I have to say to that like I don't endorse that

205
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,800
 I don't think it's a great idea, but that happens everywhere

206
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,560
 Every everywhere does that and it's unfortunate

207
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,120
 But when if you if you have a small group of people and small being relative, you know

208
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,320
 There's 11,000 of them in a city of 90,000 but when you have a group of people you have to do one of two things

209
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,560
 You can create a community or you can take over an existing community

210
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:29,560
 And we see examples of that happen on the internet. We see subcultures infiltrate existing forums and websites

211
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,440
 And within a matter of months, they've taken over

212
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:38,680
 That forum or that website or they start their own and we see this in cities or as well

213
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,560
 Scientology has done this to clear water. Disney has done it to like orange county. You see corporations do it

214
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,840
 You see religions do it. You see cults do it. You see political organizations do it

215
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,760
 This is just something that human organizations do. I don't endorse it

216
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,240
 But whenever someone tells me group x is slowly taking over this community

217
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,000
 I always say I always have the same reaction. Well, that's just what people do

218
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I don't endorse it and that might sound like an endorsement

219
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,680
 But if it was happening in my community, I would if I and we did have that actually up here in the dows

220
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,280
 We had the raw niches before I moved up here. However, you pronounce it

221
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,400
 We had that colt in the dows that was trying to take over the raw niches

222
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,160
 And I know i'm mispronounced it again and they ended up sprain

223
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,360
 Like e.coli all over the the salad bar

224
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,960
 I've never covered that on the show because it's such a well known

225
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,160
 I remember reading about it when I was a kid in california

226
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,520
 It was one of the biggest I think it still is the biggest biological attack from a terrorist group in united states history

227
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,800
 But the church taking over a city allegedly

228
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,200
 Telling kids they can go out and spend a bunch of money enjoying this college

229
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,360
 And they'll get these supernatural ministry powers the powers to talk and the powers to heal

230
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,880
 And they've been walking all over the city whenever they see people in wheelchairs

231
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,920
 Their stories of these kids surrounding them and being like walk walk walk in the old lady wheelchairs

232
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,880
 I was like, what are you talking about? There was a story going around that some kid had an asthma attack

233
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,320
 And they wouldn't call 911 they were trying to heal the kid and the kid ended up having brain damage

234
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,440
 I saw that story get passed around a couple times. I could find no

235
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,760
 News articles on that you figure that would have been a big news story unless

236
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,360
 Even if they've infiltrated the news organizations of redding

237
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,560
 I think that story would have gotten out there was another story about a guy

238
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,000
 Who fell and or was pushed off of a cliff by a member of this

239
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,160
 Supernatural ministry school broke his back and bashed his head in

240
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,800
 And they didn't call an ambulance for six hours because they were trying to find him to heal him and he sued them

241
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:47,240
 And then the judge said you can't sue them because they legally don't have to call the cops and he lost the case

242
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,760
 But he appealed it and now he's actually going to try to sue him again

243
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,640
 You want to go out you want to pray in the street? Totally fine. You want to tell people you can bring people back from the dead?

244
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,600
 Whatever. It's not going to happen. It's totally bizarre

245
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,960
 But whatever all of that stuff being said the reason why I know about Bethel church

246
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,040
 The reason why I really came to my attention was because of olive

247
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,680
 Now olive was a little girl

248
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,840
 This all happened super recently

249
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,720
 December 14th 2019 olive hyal highly genthal olive highly genthal two years old

250
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,800
 stops breathing

251
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,640
 and dies

252
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
 The mom kailey

253
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,120
 She is a member of Bethel church. The whole family is a member of Bethel church, but kailey's a member of the church

254
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,040
 She is in their music. She's done music with them as well

255
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,120
 So her recordings have been out there and things like that very very active in this church

256
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,400
 She posts on instagram after her daughter dies

257
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,840
 And i'm going to read this instagram post for you. We're asking for prayer

258
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,280
 We believe in a jesus who died and conclusively defeated every grave holding the keys to resurrection power

259
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,840
 We need it for a little olive a line

260
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,320
 That's her middle name

261
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,840
 Who stopped breathing yesterday and has been pronounced dead by doctors

262
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,400
 Absolutely tragic story. Absolutely a heartbreaking story

263
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,800
 And if it was just there, yes family in need. We need prayer

264
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,720
 Please be here for us as we're suffering from the loss of our daughter all of that stuff

265
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,520
 But this is where we continue. We are asking for bold unified prayers from the global church

266
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,160
 To stand with us in belief

267
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,520
 That he will raise this little girl back to life

268
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:34,840
 Her time here is not done and it is our time to believe boldly and with confidence

269
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,720
 Wealed what king jesus paid for it's time for her to come to life

270
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,080
 So that caused

271
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,640
 a lot of controversy

272
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
 online

273
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,640
 But not at first at first actually this instagram post that went out to people who are supportive of Bethel church and people began

274
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,440
 praying for olive and putting it the hashtag wake up olive

275
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:06,840
 And the belief was if like she just said enough people prayed that jesus and all of his power and majesty would bring

276
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,480
 This two-year-old girl back to life

277
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,000
 And started to spread around the internet starts trending wake up olive wake up olive

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,840
 Just the those three words just the combination of words is chilling

279
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,360
 Wake up olive

280
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,800
 Day three if you're not familiar with biblical stories jesus died on the cross according christian faith three days later

281
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,640
 He came back to life

282
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,880
 They went to go visit him at the tomb and the the big boulder that was blocking his tomb was moved away

283
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,480
 Jesus was no longer in there

284
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,520
 There's a couple angels chilling in his tomb and they're like hey guys, you're too late

285
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,840
 Jesus is out. He's taking care of business. So knowing that now it's december 17th. It's three days after all of his passed away

286
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,440
 Kaylee starts her instagram post that day

287
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,760
 Day three

288
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
 Is a really good day for resurrection

289
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:06,840
 Oh man, and I I get it. I get it. This family has lost a two-year-old child

290
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,000
 And you're hoping for a miracle

291
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,160
 I totally get that and I think you guys realize that i'm not busting a bunch of jokes

292
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,840
 I totally get where that's coming from day four next day instagram post starts with

293
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,280
 Day four is a really good day for a resurrection

294
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,720
 I found out about this because

295
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,600
 The when the controversy kicked in because now we're on day four people are beginning to get wind of this and saying this is

296
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,440
 This is suffer this is extending the suffering of this family and the family is like no no no no

297
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,920
 Like this can happen the church believes that people can be brought back from the dead today

298
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:52,360
 There's a huge musical concert going on people are out celebrating praising the lord praying for olive to wake up

299
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,520
 December 20th

300
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760
 2019

301
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,440
 They start planning the memorial service the miracle did not come

302
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,400
 olive will not be resurrected

303
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,440
 I don't want to criticize this family for wanting a miracle

304
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,000
 I don't really even want to criticize the church. I think the church probably is more at fault for

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,760
 Putting this belief in people's heads that people can be brought back from the dead

306
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,680
 But I don't want to spend the last few minutes of today's podcast

307
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,720
 Wagging my finger at someone who has religious beliefs different than mine. It's a tragic story

308
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,000
 It involves a church that has bizarre beliefs, but not

309
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,040
 They're not telling people to go out and commit jihad. They're not telling people to go out and blow up abortion clinics

310
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,800
 They're not telling people to do these unspeakable acts

311
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,080
 They're basically have a belief that's weirder than my belief that's weirder than

312
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,880
 You know two billion people's beliefs

313
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,440
 But not by a massive long shot

314
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,040
 The reason why I wanted to cover this story is because we look at paranormal. We look at conspiracy theories stuff like that

315
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,600
 What if

316
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 It worked

317
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,800
 What would happen to human society if it worked?

318
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,440
 We've had stories of people getting frozen in ice. They've been clinically dead for five hours

319
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,840
 They're thawed not frozen in ice but frozen. They're not a block of ice. They're not captain america, but people who have been frozen

320
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,400
 They're clinically dead. They're thawed out. They're back to life

321
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,320
 We have stories like that people who have been brain dead a longer than we thought you could survive being brain dead coming back to life

322
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,560
 We've had miracles

323
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,360
 but

324
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,280
 Being dead for three days that has only happened once and again

325
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,400
 You could argue whether or not that even happened back then but what would happen to human

326
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,040
 society to belief

327
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
 To the way everything is structured

328
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,720
 if

329
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,680
 this

330
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
 worked

331
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,600
 Could you imagine the news that day it would filter out slowly

332
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,200
 From the town of redding. Olive was alive

333
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,800
 Most people wouldn't even know the backstory at this point three days in the controversy really hadn't started

334
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,120
 But you would start to get wind in the news

335
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,040
 A miracle it happened

336
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,160
 And you could say well people who don't really follow religious news

337
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,840
 They probably wouldn't know about it

338
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,920
 But if your church succeeded in bringing back someone from the dead you would make sure everybody knew

339
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,640
 There would be doubters. There would be skeptics

340
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,000
 There would be people going to redding to see if it was actually true and you'd have the local coroner

341
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:32,440
 Local police officers saying no, it's true. She had passed away and now she's back to life. Look at her and you would look

342
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,840
 There's a young girl playing in the yard

343
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:42,920
 Now here's the thing. There are already suggestions. We've talked about them early in the episode that the church of bethle has taken over

344
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,320
 The city of redding

345
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,120
 So skeptics would go that that's impossible

346
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,160
 There was no way this girl could have come back from the dead and we know this church is infiltrating

347
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,720
 The pillars of power. So who's not to say they already own the coroner? They already own the police department

348
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,160
 It has to be fake. This can't have happened

349
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,120
 But the story would still get out there that a little girl died and after three days of intensive prayer

350
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,440
 She came back to life

351
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
 It would change

352
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,880
 everything

353
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,680
 It would change the entire course of human history

354
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,000
 Because not only would you have proof that it's possible to die and then come back three days later

355
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,400
 Not only would you have proof of a faith of a billion people on this planet?

356
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,560
 You would have proof that it could happen today

357
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,960
 You would have proof that all the ministers all the clerics

358
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,920
 All the rabbis of the world could talk about miracles all they wanted

359
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,520
 But there was one church in redding, california that could actually raise the dead

360
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,200
 What do you think would happen to every other religion overnight?

361
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,640
 If it was proven that this group of 11,000 people had the key to immortality

362
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,600
 They had the way the truth and the light

363
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,400
 Their prayers

364
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 worked

365
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,200
 Somewhere out there

366
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,920
 In the infinite sea of alternate realities

367
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,720
 Olive came back to life

368
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 Somehow some way

369
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,920
 A miracle existed in the infinite expanse of time and space

370
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,880
 She came back to life

371
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,000
 And society completely restructured itself

372
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,360
 Because a little girl defied death because the church worshiped and prayed so hard

373
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,880
 That all notion of science all notion of

374
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,840
 Established religions was broken over the course of three days

375
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
 In that reality

376
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,200
 So close to our own

377
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,080
 Olive is alive again

378
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,040
 In that reality that's so close to our own

379
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:04,040
 Every religion has just formed into one the one religion that can provably work the church of bethel

380
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,720
 In an alternate reality so close to our own

381
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,480
 You have a church that doesn't work on infiltrating local government

382
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,320
 But has already infiltrated the governments of the world

383
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,800
 Bringing olive back wasn't just about restoring life

384
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,600
 Into a two-year-old girl

385
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,360
 Bringing olive back was about proving that bethel was the one true religion

386
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,040
 Was proving that only they had a direct line to god

387
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,520
 Performing the greatest miracle of the modern age

388
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,320
 Proved that the church of bethel

389
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,280
 Was the only true religion

390
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,600
 One world

391
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,040
 One religion

392
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,720
 One miracle

393
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,280
 And in that reality so close to our own

394
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,840
 It's the perfect place for another biblical figure to make his appearance

395
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,640
 The antichrist

396
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
 Appears in that world

397
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 Not all miracles

398
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,040
 Come from god

399
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,360
