 Two stories that give us an insight into what happens to us after we die
 And then we take a look at the story of a Russian town that captured a bigfoot-like creature and held it prisoner
 For 40 years today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you're having a great day too man this show just in the last week has really taken off
 I'm getting like 800 downloads a day got an extra
 110 subscribers on YouTube just over the past five days. It's it's growing and I appreciate that guys
 And I'm thankful that you guys are all listening to it
 Recommending it to your friends recommending it to strangers. It's really really taking off and I appreciate that I really do I
 Also wanted to say I got some more fan art earlier this week from bin via email
 We'll post it in the show notes and then it'll be in the YouTube video
 apparently he's actually making a
 Power of what he called a PowerPoint level animation of the Thomas Dick episode. So yes, Mungo
 Mungo is in the episode and so those drawn to there. I appreciate all that fan art. It's amazing guys
 Thank you. I never really thought oh
 No, no, no, I'll save that till Monday. I'll save that till Monday
 I got this other weird piece of information that I'll talk about on Monday involving the show
 But we got a lot of stuff to cover today. So I can't thank you bin
 But yeah, I just can't keep going on about how awesome you guys are. Sorry
 Because people do I gotta I gotta do the other thing we got a lot to cover
 so the first thing we're gonna look at is
 Conflicting ideas of what happens after you're dead now, obviously, that's something that religion has you either go to
 Most religions some of your reincarnated
 But you go to a paradise or you go to hell a punishment place now recently
 I found this creepypasta and some of you guys may have already heard about this
 But I found some interesting details about it and want to give you my own take on it
 The photo is a naked man holding a nice block and of what appears to be poop and
 Notably a micro corg keyboard in the upper left hand corner now
 I can't put the photo on YouTube because they'll just take the video down because the dude's naked
 But I'll have it in the show notes, but let me read you this creepypasta here real quick
 This isn't a creepypasta channel
 But I think it's interesting to dissect to this because there's some weird stuff going on
 Clifford Hoyt age 31 suffered serious injuries in an automobile accident in 1999
 After he regained consciousness, he told a terrified nurse that he had died and
 Visited hell he expounded on the tortures and anguish he experienced in frightening detail
 He refused psychological treatment and was released several weeks later
 Hoyt's neighbors complained to their landlord that strange music was playing in his apartment at all hours of the night
 Upon investigating the building's owner found Clifford in this condition. So the photograph he's naked
 He's holding a nice block. There's much a poop and there's a micro corg in the background
 He left and contacted mr. Hoyt's family who contacted authorities Clifford claimed that demons from hell
 We're still trying to capture him. He explained that his body would burn incessantly unless he played music to scare the demons away
 He would only leave the house for short periods of time to get minimal supplies
 Including large blocks of ice to soothe the burning he felt as he tried to sleep
 Doctors attribute Clifford's actions to brain damage suffered in the accident
 He currently resides in a mental rehabilitation facility in Maryland. So I came across this it's it's kind of older creepypasta
 But I just came across this pretty recently. I was like, oh, that's creepy, but it's most likely fake
 So I immediately
 Started tracking where this came from now. Here's the interesting stuff about this again
 I don't just want to read creepypasta. I thought that I read that and I was like
 I've heard people saying that when they die they've had life after death experiences of going to hell
 They're far more rare, but you do see them
 But here's the thing the micro so this has apparently happened in 1999 the micro corg was not invented until
 2002 so whether or not the story is true the photo isn't
 The photo did was not taken in 1999
 Secondly, there was really a Clifford Hoyt. His name is actually Gary Clifford Hoyt and he had a car accident in 1999
 But he died in that car accident
 He was the single fatality of that car accident the other two people in the other car survived
 So there really was a guy named Clifford Hoyt full name Gary Clifford Hoyt
 And he did have a serious car accident, but he died
 This is what this was my take on this that it's most likely just creepypasta that they either they picked that name out at random
 And it happened to match or more likely somebody knew of that car accident and created this story
 But here's my little take on this. What if this is almost like a carnival of souls type of thing?
 Now carnival of souls is that is that movie where spoiler alert
 It's like 40 50 years old
 But this woman's ride gets in a car accident and then she gets out of the car and she goes to this town
 And it's super creepy and there's a bunch of ghosts chasing her around and at the ending it turns out that she really died in the car
 Accident all along and but people interacted with her while she was not knowing she was dead
 So was it all in her head with the people she was interacting where they real?
 Maybe this is a
 Example of that. I know that sounds super far-fetched, but it's just the story is weird to me
 I don't know. I don't know like I read it my when I was doing my research
 I thought I I feel like there's a little bit more to this
 Than just the standard creepypasta did he both die in that car accident?
 continue to live to have these horrible hallucinations and
 End up in a mental institution, but really he died in the car accident
 I don't know if I'm making sense
 But yeah, like and would we know like could this possibly be a Mandela effect type situation where reality has splintered
 And we have a foot in both realities
 The one where he died and the one where he's locked up
 Probably probably not
 Probably not but I thought I think it's an interesting story and again
 There's just something still not sitting right with me
 But going for I read that and the next day I read this other article about life after death very very fascinating thing going on
 So now we're going from wherever this dude died because I didn't write that down in my notes
 We're going to New York State the Big Apple the state that never sleeps. We're going to a place called hospice
 Buffalo
 Which that's the name of it hospice buffalo now
 It's not a hospice in the shape of a buffalo which would be where I would want to die
 I think it's just a hospice in the city of Buffalo and they just named stuff really badly over there
 There's a guy named dr. Kerr and
 He sounds like a bad guy
 He sounds like he is like an old-timey villain for an old-timey Batman, but dr. Kerr is actually a guy running this hospice and
 One time he was sitting there and he's thinking you know what I think I could have let this patient live longer if I
 Changed the IV like if I gave them a different IV thing and he's thinking about it
 So he went to get the patient and the nurse was with the patient and he goes hey
 I think I'm gonna set up this new IV thing and the nurse goes let me get her actual quote here
 Because this was a real event dr. Kerr says I walked in and the nurse didn't even look up and she said no no
 He's dying and I said why are you saying that and she said well he's seeing his deceased mother and
 Dr. Kerr said he just kind of laughed kind of chuckled like you know and the man died shortly after that and
 He started to notice a pattern his staff because he was running everything
 So he'd see the patients, but he wasn't in that day-to-day scene every patient all the time
 His staff knew when people were going to die not in a creepy final destination sort of way
 But they had gotten used to
 When people start talking about seeing their mom or seeing their sister or seeing people who had passed before them
 The nurses all knew he's they're gonna be dead in a short while a couple weeks a couple days maybe
 And so dr. Kerr said you know what let's start recording these
 Incidents let's see if there's any sort of patterns
 So for ten years at hospice Buffalo, they've started recording these incidents
 14,000 cases
 80% of the people who pass away
 Have a dream or a vision where a loved one comes back to them
 And they've actually been able to identify certain themes and he said one of the most common themes is travel
 They'll have dreams where they're packing their bags
 So weird and he goes their breath their body is old and broken, but their brains are still very very active
 So they'll start seeing their mom or their brother or their best friend who passed away before them
 They'll dream about them. They'll see them in the room sometimes with a vision and then they'll start having dreams where they're packing stuff up
 Getting ready for a journey a long journey now these aren't just the people who are having these dreams also say they're incredibly detailed
 They're the most incredibly detailed dreams. They've ever had they wake up sobbing because they're seeing someone that they miss and
 The person is bringing a sense of peace to them and it's funny because the reporter asked dr. Kerr
 So what do you think the scientific explanation for this or do you think it's a religious explanation for this and he his response was
 It doesn't really matter like I don't know and it doesn't matter
 He says they should just be respected period as far as like these experiences. They're going through
 Just respect that these people are actually having them the saddest thing in it because it's very heart. It's very
 Heartlifting is that a word? It's very affirming to know that
 That you see those people who left before you
 Helping you on that journey. I thought this was the saddest part of the story
 little kids
 little kids
 Who they're young so they haven't had they haven't had a lot of loss in their life
 You know your six your seven and your parents are still around your best friends are still around your grandparents are still around
 They dream about their pets
 They dream about any pets that they've lost
 little puppies
 That is so
 sad
 But again, it's sad to me
 But again, it's affirming to that little boy or that little girl who's kind of scared
 Because they're passing away, but then they see their little puppy Rover
 And they're just dream that they're petting their puppy that they lost two years ago
 And they're just they had that makes them at peace
 That makes them at peace as their body is failing when they sleep
 They're playing with their puppy that they're soon going to be reunited with
 The the big question is this and so that those studies are going on and they're not being done in any sort of scientific way
 They're just logging these dreams and visions. The big question is this this is what happens to people who are
 Dying in a hospice situation
 what happen is there something similar to this if your head gets chopped off or
 You fall off a bridge or you get riddled with bullets and a drug deal gone wrong like is there a correlation between these two things I
 Would think yes, and this is again
 Going back to a whole carnival of souls type thing like let's say I'm sitting in my apartment and a bunch of gangbangers raid it and
 Just blow my brains out
 That event is going to take a total of three minutes
 From the point where they knocked down the door to the point that I snapped two of their necks and stab another one in the chest
 Do a witty one-liner throw him out the window and then the shotguns to the back of my head and I'm like damn it
 As that bullet enters my brain, I almost think that the brain runs into a bullet time mode
 And I'm able to have those same affirming experiences
 I think at the moment that you die
 whether it takes three weeks for you to die or
 Three seconds for you to die. I think your brain still
 Processes that and they're my backup for that is when you dream dreams seem like they're hours or months or yeah
 I've had dreams that have lasted decades
 But it really was only three seconds in my brain that was shooting that spark but to me it felt like 70 years in my dream
 So I do think that's possible
 I think that in the moment of death like the horrible torture you go through will probably be I should say will but let's say that you're
 You're you fall into a wheat thresher feet first
 That's awful, but I think at the last moment you do find that piece as fleeting as it may seem
 Physically mentally it is on par of a little girl holding her puppy
 I think at the moment of death you are at peace in your brain. It gives you it gives you a good dream
 I don't think anyone ever really dies horribly
 But now let's go to the world of cryptids
 Yes, yes cryptids because we've talked a lot about cryptids this week
 And we talked about zermatism earlier and he was saying
 Stanislaw was not Stanislaw Stanislaw was saying that all over the world
 There are stories of bigfoot-esque creatures and he named off a couple of them the woodwows in
 Britain and a bunch of other ones now one of the ones he named off was the almas of Mongolia the bigfoot-esque creature
 I started looking around at a couple of them and there is a story
 from the
 1870s of an Alma that was actually captured
 So let's go back in time to the 1870s. Let's get in the carpenter copter
 Actually, no, that'll probably bring too much attention
 Let's go ahead and hop in the Jason Jalopy. That'll be a little more
 Bit of subterfuge because we don't want to get captured by these people either
 We go into the Jason Jalopy we go back in time we're in the 1870s
 We're in Russia Far East Russia Mongolian area
 So I should have told you to grab your jacket because it's gonna get really cold out here
 But it's too late, so you're probably gonna get frostbite. These are the remote forests of
 Abcazi
 Abcazia Abcazia no it's not a realm from Lord of the Rings. It's actually a real place
 Abcazia there's a village there just a normal little Russian village back in time doing villager stuff thatched tuts
 fire with a little pot over it a
 Metal pot and then you know, they're making stew and little kids are running around with little sticks
 hitting each other whatever and so
 These two hunters. I don't know how many hunters, but anyways these hunters come out of the woods and they're like
 We caught one we caught one and everyone's like what's going on?
 hunters start leading a huge
 hairy woman
 into the camp at
 Musket point or arrow point whatever they had
 ranged weapon pointed at her
 That's that's actually gonna be really bad taste when I reveal this but
 She comes walking in they have her captured
 She's taller than anyone else there. She's very very strong
 They say but they don't say how they know that I don't know if she was like snapping next in the woods
 Or knocking over trees, but anyways
 these Russian hunters captured an
 Alma a large
 Bigfoot-esque beast of the Mongolian region now
 This is how they're normally listed there can be between five which isn't super tall
 But between five to six and a half feet they actually have a lot of Neanderthal like features
 pronounced brow
 flat nose
 Weak chin this one was covered in hair sometimes they're hairy sometimes they're super hairy sometimes they're just normal hairy
 Sometimes they're just like Italian hairy, but anyways this one comes in
 And then you know they got it at ranged weapon point and they're like what do we do with this thing?
 I mean this thing is monstrous. It's one of the almas
 We can't really let it go because then it might like just start bashing us in
 But we can't really keep a prisoner here because it's so strong, but the village elders go
 That we can't let it go at least in this town. We know where it's at at all times
 Now there was something about it that they thought
 Maybe we can communicate with it
 so they tried speaking to it in whatever language I don't think they were speaking Russian that far out in
 The in the area, but probably they were speaking something
 And they tried speaking something to this creature and it wouldn't say anything it wouldn't say anything it was mute
 It would just make noises
 So they're like okay well we can't tell it not to kill us if it sees us out in the woods
 So our safest bet is to keep it isolated in this village. We'll just keep it prisoner
 Now what's bizarre is this is the story we have we have them capturing the Alma they name it Zana and
 then we have
 40 years later she was prisoner for 40 years and in that time period
 One of the tribe members well, I believe one of the elders, but one of the tribe members
 fell in love with Zana this massive hairy beast that they they could they considered it a beast they considered it a beast and
 he fell in love with it and he wooed it and
 Had sex with it. So he's banging this mythical creature
 that they have always been leery of in this area and
 They have four kids
 Four kids two of the sons lived long enough to have children of their own and I believe two of them died fairly early
 And after 40 years of captivity now
 Married to this dude now raising kids still never said a word the children could talk
 Children could totally talk fine
 But Zana never said anything but after 40 years eventually love conquers all but death and
 Zana passes away
 this story has been very popular in
 Russian
 Mongolian circles
 To the point that scientists said, you know what we really need to figure out what Zana was
 Let's get DNA from her descendants
 Like and then it'll show was she a humanoid?
 Was she something else?
 So a couple years ago
 They did it
 They got DNA from her grandson, and I think they actually might have had her tooth. I'm a little iffy on that
 They got DNA from some of her grandchildren, and they look at it and they're like hmm, okay
 Let me let me run these numbers again because this was not a good story if this is true
 And they're looking at the numbers and they're like kind of holding the report upside down and they're like
 This is not what we thought now every so often we'll find bigfoot hair and they run it to a laboratory and
 It's a dog or they'll find a big footprint and they'll start analyzing it
 And it turns out to that like this is obviously a fake
 This is the worst example ever ever of you running a test on a bigfoot type creature and it coming back as something else
 Because basically the story people have been telling for close to a hundred years about how this Russian town had captured a
 Alma
 Turns out that when they do that when they did the test on
 the grandson and
 They ran all the numbers
 That the creature who was described as a large hairy creature who couldn't talk and roamed around and was prisoner for 40 years
 Was a black woman
 That's that's what they caught they caught a black woman in the woods and
 they kept your prisoner for 40 years and
 They had a bunch of babies and she never said a word they want to let her do nothing except you know run around and
 Yeah, that's I mean there's
 People generally people who are racist are like yeah, I'm racist. I'm totally cool with it
 Be an accidentally racist is the worst like at least the person who's who's just like oh, no, I'm totally racist
 I don't like this racist. Okay, but when you're accidentally racist
 It's kind of worse because you don't think you're being racist trapping a
 Black person for 40 years because you think they're a monster is the worst example of being accidentally racist
 I've ever seen so
 Apparently what happened was they run around the test and they said she would have been 100% sub-saharan African and
 There were a bunch of they had just freed a bunch of slave like slavery ended in Russia. I believe two years prior to this
 So there was a bunch of free slaves running around in the in Russia in general
 But in that particular area they figure that she must have just gotten lost from like who she was with or was just wandering around
 She ran into these hunters who were probably smaller who probably were physically smaller than her
 I don't know where the hair thing comes from
 Why they kept describing her as super hairy, but they saw this tall black woman and they're like oh
 You must be a monster and they captured her they captured her and they held her prisoner for 40 years
 And then for decades and a hundred years people are telling the story about this town that caught this bigfoot now
 That story in and of itself accidental racism aside the story of the almas
 Is even more fascinating than that. There's a reason why
 They said this must be an Alma. I'm gonna keep going back to Bigfoot literature here in Bigfoot literature
 It is it's the Native American saw it as this spirit creature
 And when the Westerners came here, they've seen it as this one off maybe in a group of three or four
 Type of creatures that are spotted, but there's no proof ever found
 There's there's maybe one video clips and blurry photos stuff like that the almas are amazingly
 Documented not in modern times, which is what makes it interesting
 Like I said, it was the description of a Neanderthal pronounced brow flat nose weak chin
 How would somebody in the Middle Ages
 Know what a Neanderthal looked like we know what they look like now because we have
 Creations and drawings of them, but they shouldn't have had those back then they didn't have forensic anthropology
 They shouldn't have been able to say this creature looks just like this type of human that it used to exist
 Unless they were seeing them then there's this book. There's this book. It is a Tibetan
 medicinal book
 There is a drawing of an Alma and a description of the Alma
 everything else in that book is a
 Plant or an animal that lives today and can be verified
 That book has no mythological creatures in it at all no dragons no
 Groot slangs nothing deer and tigers and berries and bananas and whatever
 Everything in that book is scientifically verifiable. You can see it today
 Except for the Alma so that makes people think why would you write this huge?
 It basically be if you picked up Grey's Anatomy and you flip through it and on page 84 was an elf
 And then you went to the next page and it was a thorax
 That's how this book was set up. It was 100 percent everything we can do while 99 percent we can verify exists
 except for this creature and it wasn't the almas warrant a
 solitary small group type of thing in
 1420 there was a guy named Hans
 Schlittberger he was taken prisoners by the Mongols. He's tape brought back being brought back to the con
 Here was his quote. He survived long enough to write a book and talk about his journeys
 But as her imagine you're in a caravan
 coming through a the steps of
 Mongolia so your care your your carriage is all bumpy because they can't drive it right it's like one wheels on one step one wheels on the other
 You're coming through this and you're this westerner and you look out the window
 And this is what you see on the same mountain. There are savages who are not like other people and they live there
 They are covered all over the body with hair except the hands and face and run about like other wild beasts in the mountain and
 Also eat leaves and grass and anything they can find the Lord of the country sent to Eddy
 Gee a man and a woman from among these savages that had been taken in the mountain
 So we have another instance of these creatures being captured, but you're he's looking at them
 He's seen a
 basically a herd a tribe of village whatever words you want to use for these beasts these
 Neanderthal like beasts being cited in the year
 1420 when Hans was a captive
 So did these creatures exist?
 I think if anything these probably I mean we don't have photos of them now
 But there's it's in a super remote area. It's one thing to be walking through Oregon and see a big foot
 It's another thing to have to endure the harshness of the Mongolian
 Landscape just to get a photograph and they probably just beat you to death. Actually, it's funny. They keep getting captured
 So they're probably really sucky at combat and they eat leaves and grass
 So I don't know like how strong they really could be
 But they also eat like other animals as well
 My main diet wouldn't be leaves and grass if I was a cryptid
 It's kind of a you want to you want to have sharp teeth to eat people but anyway, so these creep
 I mean these creatures are probably the best bet we have for
 Proving that there's some sort of bigfoot-esque creature and one last story to wrap up the Alma mystery
 I think probably they did exist at some point. I think the descriptions too accurate to things
 We do know existed I eat enough in the andre thals
 I do think they existed at some point in very very modern history and at this point
 They could have been completely wiped out or gone underground or something like that
 But one last interesting tidbit to this in 1941 when Germany invaded Russia the Red Army captured a spy a
 Big Harry spy who wouldn't talk won't say anything and the Russians blew his brains out because what else are you gonna do?
 You're getting invaded you're you read you see someone that you don't
 He's not a local. He's not Russian. He's a big Harry dude
 He's not talking to you so they shoot him and there's always been the idea that that also could have been an Alma
 Because he was a wild man couldn't speak covered in hair
 I know the Germans were pretty savvy on their you know spying, but I don't think they're like hey
 Groober over there make sure you don't shave for a while and run around in the woods and maybe you can pick up some intel
 They probably caught an Alma
 Here's the weird thing really the world is so vast
 That you can have entire
 Tracks of land that are not explored or
 Haven't been visited by humans in a long long time
 There are forests and jungles and planes and caves that we know of or might not
 But we don't go to them to those to it to those cryptids to the almas
 Who are in hiding still having their civilization?
 Somewhere we are the cryptids
 Every so often they may catch a glimpse of a human or
 Look up and see a plane and that's their cryptid. That's their legend. Those are their creatures that keep them up at night us
 This kind of plays into the whole missing 411 thing like
 When we go when when humans go into the woods, we are now on their turf when we go into these vast planes
 We're now on their turf when we move out of civilization. We are on the turf of the cryptids and
 It makes you wonder how many humans have been kidnapped and
 held prisoner for 40 years in
 these dark hidden remote villages
 We'd never hear their stories
 They would just vanish and in that village
 They would tell their children the time that they caught the small person with weak limbs
 To prove the stories true that we really existed
