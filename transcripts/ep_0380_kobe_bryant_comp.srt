00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 I'm gone for one week and you guys decide to blow up the planet.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:17,360
 One week. Was Kobe Bryant murdered by the Illuminati and the Illuminati used a Comedy Central cartoon

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,200
 to warn us of the coming tragedy? Did that happen? Is a virus about to tear humanity apart?

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,160
 At the very best killing all of us. At the very worst turning us into zombies.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,920
 And then both of those stories are quite tragic but in probably the most bizarre turn

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,680
 in Dead Rabbit Radio history. Hawn's Warm Hat. A man, a friend of the shell. A man we have covered

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,440
 multiple times. A man who believes that platypuses are actually CGI. That all monkeys are either humans

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,800
 in suits or hand puppets. A man who believes that all except for a few, except for him,

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,360
 a few others, that all men are women and all women are men. Hawn's Warm Hat. Actually,

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:21,200
 his most insane conspiracy theory, kind of proven, in court. What happened this week guys?

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
 What did you do? We'll explore all of that on this extra special current events episode of

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:40,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

14
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,440
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover so

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,120
 we're gonna jump right in. I know we're really gonna get going with this. Now, the first story

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,760
 we're gonna talk about here is the story of Kobe Bryant. Now, if you have been living under a rock,

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,480
 if you said, you know what, Jason's not putting out any new episodes this week. I'm not going to

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,560
 interact with any humans whatsoever until I hear Jason's sweet, sweet voice. Well, it's back and

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
 you can come out of that rock to download this podcast. And let me tell you what happened to

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,160
 Kobe Bryant. Because apparently you're like, "Wait, ooh." Yawning. You're like, "Oh man, I wonder what

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
 Kobe Bryant's up to." That's the first thing you think of. Well, he's dead and not trying to make

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,360
 light of it, even though I kind of chuckled. It's tragic. It's absolutely tragic. He's passed away.

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,200
 A bunch of kids died. You're like, "Jesus, Jason, you could have let me get a little stretch and I

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,520
 didn't know any of this. It was terrible." I remember one day my mom came to like, I was, when I first

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,440
 moved up to Hood River, I was staying with my mom and my aunt. And because I was trying, when I was

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,520
 like getting everything organized, like getting a place and stuff like that. And my mom comes downstairs

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,160
 and I go, "Oh dude, did you hear? Some dude walked into elementary school and shot like a bunch of kids."

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,640
 And she's like, "What?" And I was like, "Yeah, did you not?" It's like she was wearing her pajamas.

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,560
 And she was coming down to get her morning coffee and I was like, "Oh dude, I think she woke up late

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
 that day." The point, that's not the point of when she woke up. The point is I have a tendency to

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,160
 deliver bad news as casual conversation. So, Kobe Bryant and his daughter and some other young girls

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,600
 died. They were on their way to play in a youth girls basketball team. There was another basketball

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,000
 coach on the helicopter. It was a big helicopter pilot. There's total of nine people who died in

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,520
 this crash. They died flying through the fog. Horrible tragedy. So of course, horrible tragedy

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,840
 famous person within minutes. Conspiracy theories started. Let's get into this Kobe Bryant thing.

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,600
 Most likely what happened, helicopter crashed. Well, obviously that happened, but most likely

37
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,080
 it was an accident. But I kind of want to like, I like going into this stuff and looking at

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,440
 why the conspiracy theories start, why they become popular. And we're also, we're also going to do

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,800
 this. We're going to look at these and we're going to offer our own conspiracy theories.

40
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,760
 Because I, and not because I think they're true, because I like seeing how the, the putting is

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,640
 made. Is that a phrase? I like seeing, it's just milk, it's just milk curdling, put a little chocolate

42
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
 in it. I like seeing, there you go. You know how putting them in. I like to see how this stuff

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,360
 works. So conspiracy theories start off immediately. One of the big things, of course, whenever this

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,600
 type of stuff happens, it's the media making mistakes fuels the conspiracy theory. Up until

45
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
 recently, if you typed into Google, when did, this is true. This was reported by USA Today.

46
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,960
 Bastion of all media have to accept what they say because it's today. USA Today reports,

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,480
 if you typed in when did Kobe Bryant die, Google lists January 26th, 2020, which is the exact day

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:49,920
 he died, but they listed January 26th, 2020, date of assassination. So that's creepy. Now they blamed

49
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,600
 it on Wikipedia. They said, we're pulling the information from Wikipedia and Wikipedia says,

50
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,680
 you didn't get it from us. Glitch. So that's a legit, that I think I, I will put my cards on

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
 the table. I think Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter accident. Now, now some of you guys are full

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,920
 tentos deep into the Illuminati stuff, but I'm just getting out there. I think it was,

53
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,320
 they were flying through fog. Every other helicopter was grounded. This helicopter got

54
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,360
 special permission and it crashed. And that's why the other helicopters were grounded. If you want

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,680
 it, if I was the Illuminati and I wanted to assassinate somebody, I would do it super publicly.

56
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,440
 I'd have Kobe Bryant ready to make a shot and then he has a heart attack. And then you don't mess

57
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,000
 with the Illuminati cause you might suffer from the leading cause of death in the United States. But

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,720
 there's also the whole thing, the predictive programming, cause you knew it. You knew this

59
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,680
 was going to happen. Apparently in 2012, there was a cartoon on Comedy Central that nobody remembers

60
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,120
 that these little fat kids, not South Park. And in the cartoon, a helicopter crashed. Well, okay,

61
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,080
 let me rephrase this. In the YouTube clip being sent around the internet, a helicopter crashes in

62
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,040
 front of these three kids. Kobe Bryant is in the helicopter and he pops out holding two awards.

63
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,200
 I don't know where they are. He goes, "Help me, help me. I'm about to die in a helicopter

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
 helicopter explosion." They're like, "Give us the awards." And he goes, "What?"

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,600
 Helicopter blows up. Predictive programming. The Illuminati predicted Kobe Bryant would die

66
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
 back in 2012. They predicted he would die eight years before he actually died.

67
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,040
 Years after he left basketball, he retired. He was going to die in a helicopter crash. Jason, how,

68
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,000
 how can you dispute this evidence? Well, a couple different ways. One, the media is like chicken

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,480
 bones at this point. There's so much of it. There is going to be stuff that matches. But here's my

70
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,480
 question. This is what you have to look at when we look at it. This is really going to be the bulk

71
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,480
 of this episode. We're really going to be ripping this stuff apart, ripping these conspiracy theories

72
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,680
 apart. If you believe in predictive programming, that is the idea that the Illuminati or whatever

73
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,800
 Satanic group of the week is controlling the world, before they do something, they have to tell us

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,160
 they're going to do it. Stupid theory based on the idea that you can find clues in stuff.

75
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,520
 Stuff has to happen first and then you can go backwards. My question, one, go through,

76
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,280
 this is your homework, if you believe in this, go through all media involving Kobe Bryant and see

77
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,560
 if there are any other jokes about him dying in any other way. If there is, your argument is an

78
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,200
 ol' void. Absolutely. Two, what's the context of the joke in the cartoon? Three, was Kobe Bryant

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,560
 famously known for taking helicopters? Now I'm not saying in the middle of the game, he's like

80
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,280
 "see you later losers" and jumped in a helicopter and fly away. But, traffic sucks in LA. Apparently

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,280
 that is a normal thing for people who are wealthy enough to fly helicopters around LA. It's not

82
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,080
 like his first time ever flying in a helicopter. Let me say this too, this might sound kind of cruel,

83
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,280
 but because Kobe Bryant had a lot of other people in the helicopter who died, but who was more famous?

84
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,040
 Kobe Bryant or Michael Jackson? Now, Michael Jackson's death by the Illuminati, Michael Jackson being

85
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,560
 an enemy of the Illuminati is long in story. They've actually thought about doing an episode on it,

86
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,040
 because there's this whole conspiracy theory that Michael Jackson was fighting against the Illuminati

87
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,640
 as much as he could in all the chivalrous station allegations was them pushing back against his war

88
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,120
 against the Illuminati. That it was all made up and he was fighting the elites and they were

89
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:22,640
 hitting him where it hurt the most, which is being accused of being a chivalrous. So, that's

90
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,960
 it's a whole own episode, maybe, but that's a long, long conspiracy theory that's gone on for a long

91
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,320
 time. Is there any predictive programming involving his death? Was there a cartoon on Comedy Central

92
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,240
 where he's like, "He he, I'm gonna die in my sleep!" As a morally bankrupt doctor is pumping

93
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,560
 him full of opioids? Was that, is that a thing that you can find? Is there like a predictive

94
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,800
 programming thing where they show Michael Jackson just slowly falling asleep and then choking on

95
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,680
 his own vomit? Just stop breathing and then there's a laugh track? No. Not that I know of. And his

96
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,520
 Michael Jackson's career lasted longer than Kobe Bryant was alive. Michael Jackson's far more famous

97
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,120
 than Kobe Bryant always been linked to fighting the Illuminati, been linked to being murdered by

98
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,720
 the Illuminati before his comeback tour. His first comeback tour, like he was a, he, after the first

99
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,320
 set of chivalrous station allegations, he was like, "Okay, that's done." He had this huge comeback

100
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,560
 tour ready. He did a, his big show in Madison Square Garden. It was considered equal to Elvis'

101
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,120
 comeback tour. His Elvis was just a pop star. He went off for a while. He came back, gave this

102
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,160
 live performance, and then he became the legend. This Madison Square Garden show for Michael Jackson

103
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,080
 was considered, they're like, "He's back. He's back." That show at Madison Square Garden,

104
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,800
 September 10th, 2001. So his story has been closely linked to fighting against the elites

105
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,600
 and the elites fighting back. Do I believe any of that? You'll have to wait for the episode that I

106
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,160
 might eventually do. But my point is, is that celebrities die all the time and it's unfortunate.

107
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,800
 Absolutely unfortunate. I'm not trying to make light of any of this stuff. But if predictive

108
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,640
 programming is a thing, we should see it all the time. But Jason, The Simpsons, and 9/11, we should

109
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,960
 see it all the time. But Family Guy and the Boston Bunk, we should see it all the time. Three or four

110
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:38,480
 or 10 or 15 events spread across 20 years is not all the time. If the Illuminati is as powerful

111
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,200
 as people make them out to be and are taking out these people one by one and that they have to show

112
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,760
 what they're going to do before they do it, if you believe that, all media should be

113
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,000
 predictive programming. That every piece of media should be a warning of a terrorist attack,

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,320
 a celebrity death. It all should be that, but it's not because predictive programming is false. But

115
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,560
 let's look at some of these things that people are saying specifically about the death of Kobe

116
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,720
 Ryan. Kobe Ryan? I don't believe this, but some people, apparently people on 4chan, some of them,

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,240
 some of them, pretty rational people, some of them are nuts, is Kobe Ryan a saint worshiper. Now,

118
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,480
 apparently he's covered in tattoos. Can you believe that? A NBA basketball player covered in tattoos.

119
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,240
 I know I was shocked as well, but apparently some of these tattoos may look satanic, they're not,

120
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,320
 by the way. So, but apparently the person who posted this thread on the paranormal board of 4chan

121
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
 goes, "Oh, does this guy look like a saint worshiper? Look at these tattoos." Now, he didn't have

122
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,520
 like a giant pentagram on his stomach, on the back of it and say, "Goat" with a picture of an

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,800
 actual goat. Just a bunch of tattoos. He's a basketball player. This is how the post started

124
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,600
 off. Looking at his tattoos gives you the impression that Kobe Ryan sold his soul to Satan

125
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,800
 in order to achieve all that wealth and success in sports. And then some guy, it goes on for a

126
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,560
 while, and then some guy comments this, "Co- I love this. Kobe woke up at 3am every day to get as far

127
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,320
 as he did. Don't try to diminish his achievements just because you're an impotent dolt." Which

128
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,720
 makes me think that this guy is actually an officer in the Empire. He's currently serving

129
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,000
 aboard a Star Destroyer. You dolt- People don't use that word enough. Just because you're an impotent

130
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,840
 dolt, whose biggest accomplishment is jacking off four times in one day. First off, five times, sir.

131
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,640
 Secondly, if I sold my soul to- This is a good point, right? Because if I sold my soul to the

132
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,600
 devil, which I never would, it's not a good deal. But if I did, I would hope that I get all of the

133
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,160
 fame and success with none of the work or very minimal work. Maybe I wake up every once in a

134
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,720
 while to go to the set of my talk show that's streaming on Netflix. Now watch me get a talk

135
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
 show streaming on Netflix. Everyone's going to think I sold my soul to the devil. But let's say

136
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,080
 that I just, "Woooh, wake up. Go do a monologue. Talk to some people." If I got a talk show on Netflix

137
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,880
 the world, definitely we're living in a simulation at that point. It would be a terrible show,

138
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,280
 but you'd watch it. I would watch it. But anyways, the point is, is that I just interviewed-

139
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,680
 I just interviewed Britney Spears every episode. The point is, is that I think it's implied by

140
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,000
 selling your soul to the devil. You don't have to do any work, right? That would suck to sell your

141
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,440
 soul to the devil. And you have to like work 80 hours a week to get anything done. You know,

142
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,320
 you already have my soul at least give me some vacation time. But this guy says, "Listen,

143
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,600
 dude. Kobe Bryant woke up at 3 a.m. every day shooting hoops, practicing, building up his body

144
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,760
 and his mind to be a sports legend." And because he has tattoos, you think he's saying worship.

145
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,680
 Now, reading that comment- I laughed because I knew exactly what was going to come

146
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,360
 after reading that comment. I knew it. You might know it too. But if you don't, there's two ways

147
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,080
 that this could go. People would go, "You're right. That doesn't make sense." He played basketball

148
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,280
 and played it well, played it hard, practiced hard, probably didn't sell his soul to Satan.

149
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,960
 That's what a rational person would say. A rational person wouldn't be reading this thread in the

150
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,440
 first place, but that's what a rational person would think. An irrational person and the way that

151
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,760
 this thread went after this guy's comment was 3 a.m. Well, that's the witch's hour. That's when

152
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,560
 Satan's is most powerful. So the fact that he woke up at 3 a.m. every morning actually proves

153
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,960
 he's a Saint-Worshipper. So thank you. You're the impotent adult for not believing, for not seeing

154
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,760
 that connection. Why, I got a Comedy Central cartoon clip that I can show you that'll prove

155
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,640
 everything to you. The thread then became, "He's definitely Saint-Worshipper because he wakes up

156
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,560
 at 3 a.m." You know why people believe 3 a.m. is the witch's hour? It's because apparently Jesus

157
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,120
 died at 3 p.m. So that makes that God's hour. As if God is relic. He's like, "Whoop, no miracles,

158
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,480
 no miracles until 3 p.m." As if the Holy Trinity has to wait. It's like 359. It's like, "Oh, no,

159
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,680
 time's running out. Better do this miracle. Better do this world peat." Ah, sorry, guys. Better

160
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,120
 like tomorrow. Apparently, so Jesus died at 3 p.m., which again, there's no reference to that in

161
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,840
 any sort of biblical text. Jesus was crucified at 3 p.m. or died at 3 p.m. That makes that God's hour.

162
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,000
 So the opposite of 3 p.m. is 3 a.m. That's where the witch's hour thing comes from.

163
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,680
 It's completely ridiculous. On multiple levels, one, it would all, if that was true, it would only

164
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,280
 be the opposite hour in Calgary where Jesus was crucified. So in America, it would be like one in

165
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,040
 the afternoon. There'd be witches flying around, goblins jumping out of manholes and all sorts

166
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
 of stuff. Kobe Bryant practiced in there like, "Hey, that's weird. Why are you practicing at 1 p.m.?

167
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,440
 You'll see." This is eyes glow, red. It's just stupid on its face. The idea of there's an opposite

168
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,680
 hour. Like, why would God even... Why would God set up a system of time where he's like,

169
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,080
 "Yes, I will create a 24-hour day, but I will create one hour where I'm incredibly weak

170
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,520
 and the forces of darkness will rise up. It'll also be the spookiest time. It'll be when there's

171
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:16,000
 no sunup and Kobe Bryant will practice that as well." Like, why would you engineer something where

172
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,960
 you have a weakness? So the whole thing is ridiculous, but apparently Kobe Bryant practicing at 3 a.m.

173
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,360
 is proof not that he's a dedicated or was a dedicated basketball player,

174
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,520
 fact that he was actually a Saint-Worshiper. Also, here's this conspiracy theory. And this

175
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,680
 is going on right now. Super Bowl is going on right now. I'm going to take a huge assumption and

176
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,520
 nothing dramatic has happened because nothing dramatic ever happens with this type of nonsense.

177
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,680
 But today, I'm recording this on February 2nd, 2020, there's a big thing that this is a paladrome

178
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,480
 number. It only happens once every 900 years. No matter what country you're in, it's a paladrome

179
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,040
 number. So whatever. Yeah, it's a math. A lot of this stuff relies on math trickery. The lowest form

180
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,680
 of magic. You're like, "Oh, yeah, I picked a number and you guessed it to be 42 and you made me add

181
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,160
 and subtract and multiply stuff. And then you made me subtract everything from my number, leave

182
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:18,160
 me with zero and then add 42." Yay. Anyways, 2-2-2020. A Super Bowl 54 happens on 2-2-2020. It's the 33rd

183
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,760
 day of the year. 333 days left in the year because it's a leap year. Kobe Bryant was

184
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,360
 ritually sacrificed, not my words, ritually sacrificed seven days before 2-2-2020. And then

185
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,040
 they also start talking about that Comedy Central cartoon. This is on 4chan as well.

186
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,400
 Whenever people throw these numbers out about this type of stuff, "Oh, it's 33 days in the year and

187
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,480
 33 days." It's always the numbers they don't include. How many years have the 49ers been playing?

188
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
 How many years have the Kansas Chiefs been playing? Playing? They're ripping the full...

189
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,160
 They're like, "I don't want to play them. They're ripping our flesh off." How many years have they

190
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,840
 been playing? What are all the numbers on the teams added up divided by 33? Does it get 33?

191
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,520
 All the number... If they include the number, it fits them. But if they don't include the number,

192
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,160
 it doesn't. How many miles away from San Francisco 49ers training camp to where the Super Bowl is

193
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,480
 being held at? You know what? All of these numbers that they just disregard, disregard. How old was

194
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,480
 Kobe Bryant? Times? How long has Trump been in office? If it matched, they'd be like, "Bam."

195
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,040
 So when people throw out numbers, you just go, "Well, whatever. Do these numbers match or

196
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,040
 do these numbers match?" And so on and so forth. But anyways, so I do think Kobe Bryant was killed

197
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,400
 by the Illuminati. No. Do I think that they predicted it on a Comedy Central cartoon? A

198
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,600
 coincidence? Sure. But again, I'd have to wonder if there are any other jokes ever made in the history

199
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,200
 of Kobe Bryant's career. Oh, and there was a tweet where it said, "Kobe Bryant's going to die in a

200
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,720
 helicopter crash." Again, that tweet came out like in 2012, around the same time as the cartoon. So

201
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,000
 I'm going to assume that Kobe Bryant has a history of flying in helicopters. If I died in helicopter

202
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,480
 crash, it would be weird because other than the carpenter copter, a fictional vehicle, I never

203
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,120
 get in helicopters. So it would be weird if the media started making predictions that they're like,

204
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,400
 "And before we end the nightly news, podcast host Jason Carpenter will die in a helicopter crash.

205
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,920
 See you tomorrow." That would be weird if I did. And I never flew in a helicopter. And the one time

206
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,440
 I did it, crash. That would be odd. But someone has a history of taking helicopters all the time

207
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
 and saying, "Hey, I got to get there in time. Fly through this fog bank. We'll get special permission

208
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,120
 to go through this fog bank." People are going to say, "Dude, that guy's going to die in a helicopter

209
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,120
 crash." Just like people say, "Dude, something Jason's going to die in a car accident." Or I get this.

210
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,080
 Jason, one of these days you're going to get hit by a car walking on the street. I get that all the

211
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,920
 time because I walk all the time at night. And people can say that all the time. If I get hit by a car,

212
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:55,040
 they'll say, "I told them. I told them. If I don't get hit by a car and I live a long life and I end

213
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,600
 up 80 years old dying in my sleep as I'm fighting two werewolves, I wake up just in time to shoot

214
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,320
 them in the brain and they fall on top of me and smother me." People will never remember predicting.

215
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
 I almost said in a car crash, always saying I was going to have to die in a car crash. So it's just

216
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,640
 selective. But all that being said, I said people want to believe in this. People don't like to

217
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,920
 believe in accidents. People don't like to think about it. So they're going with this Illuminati

218
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,960
 killed Kobe Bryant. There's also been references to killing him was a way to divert attention from

219
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,520
 the coronavirus. We'll get into that in a second. But let's build an actual conspiracy theory that

220
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,720
 I don't believe, but again, shows how conspiracy theories work. Now, all this is about Kobe Bryant

221
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,120
 being a Saint-Worshiver, Kobe Bryant being killed by the Illuminati. And I know I won over this briefly,

222
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,280
 but Kobe Bryant killed by the elite because they want to cover up the coronavirus because that

223
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,720
 worked, right? No one's talking about that. That was another conspiracy theory that was

224
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,520
 going around. Those are sexy conspiracy theories. They involve Saint-Warsherpene. They involve a

225
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,840
 faceless elite that's trying to destroy the world. It involves predictive programming. Here's a

226
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,920
 conspiracy theory for you. I don't believe it, but here's a conspiracy theory for you. Killed by the mob.

227
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:09,520
 Killed by the mob. Kobe Bryant either was supposed to fix a game,

228
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,480
 not like recently he was supposed to be involved. He's supposed to talk to same young sports

229
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,520
 athlete to try and get him to fix a game. Or maybe years ago he's supposed to do something and the

230
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,440
 mob just checked their day planner and they're like, "Oh, we never got back of this guy." Mob killed him.

231
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,760
 Organized crime. There you go. That's a conspiracy theory. But you know, it's not sexy.

232
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,720
 That's the weird thing about it. Like when you hear that, you're like, "That's it." But wouldn't

233
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,560
 that be a thousand times more believable than a Saint-Warsherpene elite group killed him seven

234
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,360
 days before the Super Bowl for reasons and announced it in a cartoon, a Comedy Central cartoon,

235
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,040
 or someone on the helicopter owed a lot of money to the mob or Kobe Bryant turned down something.

236
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,200
 They're like, "Hey, we want you to do this criminal act." And he's like, "No way. I'm Kobe Bryant."

237
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,800
 And I don't commit any criminal acts whatsoever. As I shift from side to side, the mob's like,

238
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:14,640
 "We'll get you." Isn't that more believable conspiracy theory? But again, it's funny. It's

239
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,120
 not sexy. I was talking about the conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton eating babies.

240
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,200
 To me, it's the funniest conspiracy theory. And I was thinking about it today. I thought,

241
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,360
 it almost seems like controlled opposition. It's so ridiculous. It's so ridiculous on its face

242
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,960
 that it almost makes you disregard every other conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton.

243
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,200
 I heard the funniest thing today, the absolutely funniest thing today. I don't like to talk politics

244
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,240
 on the show, but I have stated in the past, I vote for whoever makes me laugh the most. Like,

245
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:54,080
 whatever can, whatever, when I wake up, because I think it's all, I think it's all phony. I think

246
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,320
 local government is perfectly fine, but like national government, I think it's all phony.

247
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,520
 And each time the other side goes, "We would never do that." And they had done that at the

248
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,400
 previous administration. I've been seeing that since I started following politics back in the

249
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,440
 80s. I love politics, but to me it's like professional wrestling. So I tend to vote for the person who

250
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,600
 will entertain me the most when I wake up every morning. I found out that, so here's the thing,

251
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,280
 let me back up here. So Hillary Clinton, there's a conspiracy theory that she eats babies, right?

252
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,960
 Her and Huma Abedin eat children. Now, that's just, that's just probably one of my favorite

253
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,040
 conspiracy theories out there right now. But it's totally, it's totally just so nonsensical. It's

254
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,360
 almost like controlled opposition. Back in the 90s, they started the conspiracy theory of the

255
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,800
 Hillary Clinton body count, where there have been, I think, like 47, 48 people connected to the

256
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,480
 Clintons who have died under, to say the least, suspicious circumstances. Playing crashes,

257
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,280
 suicides with multiple bullet wounds in the head. Epstein has now become part of the Clinton body

258
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,080
 count. I think Trevor Noah asked her, "So how did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?" And she laughed,

259
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,720
 because it's such a common conspiracy theory, the Hillary Clinton body count, right? The

260
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,400
 Clintons, and Hillary Clinton specifically, will kill anyone who gets in her way. Now that, again,

261
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,560
 the eating babies thing, that's a ridiculous conspiracy theory. The Clinton body count

262
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,680
 is much more down to earth. It's not sexy. It's not super mysterious. It doesn't involve reptilians,

263
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,320
 taking over the White House. It just involves someone who may or may not be so ruthless

264
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,280
 and a quest for power that she's willing to assassinate anyone who comes anywhere near

265
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:47,200
 destroying her. Seth Rich is part of the Clinton body count. Okay, I heard this news the other day

266
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,600
 that, and now, and I don't attack politics, but I do have to say this honestly, this, okay,

267
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,760
 I may vote just out of, based on my whole thing of voting on who would be the most entertaining for

268
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,920
 me, I almost can't pass this up. If this is true, if this is true. Hillary Clinton apparently

269
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:14,560
 might run for vice president. She might, she might, she might become someone's vice president. Now,

270
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:22,240
 here's the thing. Here's the, somebody who has 48 bodies, possibly has 48 bodies under their

271
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:31,840
 belt, right? Jim Wunders recently, Jeffrey Epstein, okay, I, I, do you know how big your balls would

272
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:40,000
 have to be to have her as your vice president? Like, just out of print, every morning you would

273
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,240
 wake up and wonder what Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry type contraption Hillary Clinton had built

274
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,040
 in the White House that day to kill the sitting president. Could you imagine being the Secret

275
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,880
 Service agent assigned to protect the president, knowing that the biggest, possibly the biggest

276
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,760
 threat to the president is the vice president? I just imagine every single day would be an episode

277
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,280
 of Tom and Jerry, where she's just constantly running around with a giant mallet and acts,

278
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,800
 sticks of dynamite, whatever it would take. I don't, I don't have the, I honestly commend anyone

279
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:23,440
 who would have the balls to be, to be the president when Hillary Clinton is a vice president.

280
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,080
 Because again, her eating babies completely ridiculous conspiracy theory, her being,

281
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:38,080
 basically eliminating opposition, that's far more believable. That's far more believable. And

282
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,200
 I would wake up every single day, like it was Christmas. And the first thing I would do is run

283
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,960
 to the newspaper, run online, look it up, just to see what contraption she had built that failed.

284
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,760
 They're like, today, today the president went into the Rose Garden and slipped on a bunch of marbles,

285
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,360
 and nobody knows, and she's like in the bushes. That, that would be ballsy. That would be absolutely

286
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:10,080
 ballsy. So hopefully she, hopefully she's somebody's vice president, because I would just, again,

287
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,840
 I'm not saying I would vote for, I'm not saying I would vote for anyone who picked her to be

288
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,480
 vice president, but I, I don't, I think, I think there would be a collective gasp in America,

289
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:31,680
 and they'd be like, oh my, oh my, and she's just like, her shadow is, that whole, even the campaign,

290
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,160
 you'd be like, oh dude, is she going to kill him? Is she going to kill him before they even have the

291
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,880
 election? That would actually be pretty entertaining. Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.

292
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,280
 Our next topic now, we're leaving behind the story of Kobe Bryant, we're leaving behind all of

293
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,360
 those conspiracy theories. Right now, we are going to get into the coronavirus. Now, Sheenanigans,

294
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,120
 Sheenanigans has hit me up before. I don't remember what specifically the story was. Let me look it up.

295
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,360
 You know, you know, here's the thing. I just, I've, I'll be honest with you guys, I've recorded

296
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,320
 multiple versions of this episode now. I've probably been at it for probably about an hour

297
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 and a half, honestly. I'm going to have to break this up into three episodes. I know you guys

298
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,240
 really want me to get, you're like, no, no, I'm afraid the coronavirus is going to kill me.

299
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,640
 Don't worry, we'll talk about that tomorrow and we'll do the Hans thing tomorrow as well. The

300
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,960
 Kobe Bryant thing went on a lot longer than I thought it was going to. You know, but I, so I

301
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,760
 apologize for that. Me, you know, it's funny when I listen to podcasts, I don't mind that they continue

302
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,560
 onto the next day. What I don't like personally is bone, like, paid Patreon and you'll get to

303
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,480
 hear the rest of the story. So I'm going to make an oath to you. I'm never going to do that. I'm

304
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,400
 never going to do that. That bugs me. But that being said, you don't, you can't pay money,

305
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,640
 but you can if you want. I do have a Patreon, but even if you don't, you'll have to wait till

306
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,800
 tomorrow or even if you do, you'll have to wait till tomorrow because I've tried cramming everything

307
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,680
 into one episode. It just doesn't work. So you got your Kobe Bryant stuff. I know that's what

308
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,560
 you were all clamoring for. You got your Kobe Bryant stuff. And then tomorrow we'll talk about

309
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:18,320
 coronavirus and Hans. Hans Wormhat is back. And before you guys ask, I have no idea why he goes

310
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,040
 by the name Hans Wormhat now. I can't even begin to comprehend how that name, but Hans is back.

311
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,480
 Hans is back. He's better than ever. And again, it's easier for tomorrow, dude. He, he, he,

312
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,120
 he took the W. He got the win. I still don't believe in his conspiracy theories.

313
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:48,240
 But he definitely does now because when it came down to a in court, in court, he got one of his

314
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:57,600
 most bizarre conspiracy theories verified. At least, now I'm really teasing, at least this court drama

315
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,720
 gave him so much ammunition that now I cannot wait for the next Hans Wormhat video.

316
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,400
 But anyway, so if you don't know who Hans Wormhat is, you can check out episode, what is it,

317
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,040
 think it was in the 60s. It was a recent classics episode, "Monkey Don't Exist." "Monkeys Don't Exist."

318
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,800
 I recommend listening to that episode. If you do know who Hans Wormhat is, we'll have to wait for

319
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,200
 tomorrow to explore that more. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also

322
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,040
 glad you listened to it today. Have a great one guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Sorry for the tease.

323
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:48,320
 Sorry for the tease, but it's just it didn't work all this one episode. Have a great one guys.
