1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 The United States government investigates UFOs and say they don't exist.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Why haven't they done the same with ghosts?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then I'm gonna tell you a story.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 My story.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 A simple story that happened to me between the fourth and fifth grade.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It's a little mystery I like to call the dragon today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm a wild freak down.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Season finale baby.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We're at the season finale.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Now I did have an episode planned for today.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 But as I got closer to recording it, I was like, "Nah."

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 It doesn't really feel the theme of the show.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And I didn't really like it.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 So I had to pull an audible.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 And I think this is actually a pretty good one for the end of the season.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 So this episode is gonna be a little different.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 It's gonna be a little more casual.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 There's not really gonna be any show notes.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 We're gonna talk about one personal story I had.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 But first off, a conspiracy theory that may not exist.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 That I have no proof of it.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But something that I may have discovered while doing this show.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 In season four, we were very cryptid heavy.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I covered a lot of cryptids, especially the last half of season four.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Because I just kept finding these really weird creatures.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And a lot of people were sending in requests for cryptids as well.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And I really like cryptids.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I think they're kind of half monster story.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Like there's kind of always kind of a spooky element to them.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And then you just have this idea of the wild, wild world that's out there.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Now some of them are likely to exist.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Some of them are just fables.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 But I do like covering them.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 What I realized was a couple of the episodes where I was talking about cryptids.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 A couple of the episodes where I was talking about ghosts.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Like yesterday's episode with the mannequins.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Ghosts, art exhibit, whatever it was.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 The giant bones, the giant skeletons.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Secret civilizations underneath Shasta Mountain.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Secret civilizations underneath LA.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 All this stuff that we've been talking about a lot in season four.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I started to think.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And actually a lot of the episodes almost ended this way.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Yesterday's episode definitely did end this way.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But there was quite a few episodes about cryptids.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 That I originally ended with saying.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Is it possible that these creatures are not here anymore?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Because they've been taken somewhere.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And I was like, no.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And then I would come up with a different way to wrap up that episode.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And as the season went on and I kept investigating these really.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I think season four we had a lot of weird stuff.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 A lot of weird like creatures and things like that.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I thought, is someone taking these things?

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Like is somebody collecting these things?

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Here's my thing.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Let me get to the point here.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 The government investigates UFOs.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And they create Project Blue Book.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And they release it.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And they say all UFO encounters except for maybe 5% of them.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Or swamp gas.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 It's Venus.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It was a spy plane.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It was a misinformed viewer.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 It was the stars.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 99.9% of the time.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Well technically 95% of the time.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 That's what it was.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So technically UFOs don't exist.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 The 5% of the ones we can't explain doesn't mean they're little green men.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Just means that we don't know what it is.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 So the governments come out and release their findings with Project Blue Book.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 The government has investigated psychics.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Remote viewers.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 They've investigated all of these fringe topics.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And for the most part it's come out that they said, yeah,

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 we tried the whole men who stare at goats type of thing.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 It just didn't work.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 We tried remote viewers.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 It just didn't work.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And kind of the official line is we were trying it because we knew the Soviet Union was trying it.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And we didn't want to get caught flat footed.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 But at the end of the day, none of it worked.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And every so often you'll come across a document like there was a guy who was able to remote view

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 on the behest of the US government, Mars, a billion years ago.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Well that doesn't do anyone any good.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 There's no way you can confirm it.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So it's very convenient.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 But they did, we know that they did test psychics and they did test with mind control

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and that came out through MKUltra and that whole congressional hearing and things like that.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Probably out of all of those, the biggest success they had was mind control.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And even that was just like, we're working on it.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 But officially they never perfected it.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Where is the Project Blue Book for ghosts?

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Where is the Project Blue Book for cryptids?

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 You can't tell me that the US government or really any major superpower has not tried to investigate those things.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And going off that conclusion, if that is true, which I believe it is,

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I believe at some point the US government said, are ghosts real?

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Like let's just do it, and everyone's like, oh Barry, come on man.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 He's like, no, no, no, no, no, hold up, hold up.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Let's find out, we did it with UFOs and they're like, yeah, I guess we did.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 That was a national security concern though.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Like someone go, oh, so could ghosts. Ghosts could be national concern too.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And they're like, why is your grandma getting all messed up?

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 He's like, forget that, forget that.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I got possessed for a second.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 If we can prove ghosts exist, it's not a religious question.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It's a way we can weaponize this stuff.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Imagine possessing, just like I was just possessed.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Imagine possessing a world leader.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Imagine ghosts as spies.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Imagine ghosts as a psychological deterrent for an enemy to not enter an area because it's haunted.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Let's just find out if ghosts are real.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 The rest of the military officials, military intelligence is sitting around and going.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Yeah, yeah, why not?

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Let's throw a couple million dollars at it and the best scientists and technology that we have and see if ghosts are real.

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I believe that meeting happened.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 I believe it's very likely that meeting happened.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 The only reason we know about Project Blue Book is because it said UFOs aren't real.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And I think the only reason we wouldn't know about a government investigating supernatural events like ghosts or cryptids is because it is real.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Conspiracy? Sure.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But the longer I do the show, I'm still very, very skeptical.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Very skeptical.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 But the more and more I do the show, eventually I realize that my episodes kind of kept ending wanting to end with the same conclusion.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 If I was a member of a government or a non-governmental organization even, who had money and power and access and wanted the edge on intelligence gathering and warfare,

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 nothing beats ghosts and monsters.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Either every story we've ever heard about a ghost or a cryptid is 100% fake or the government has investigated them.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It's one or the other.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 It's one or the other.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Either every single one is made up, including the ones that I've told you are just mass delusions, psychotic episodes, illusions, whatever.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Either or just people lying, either they are 100% fake or governments of the world have investigated them.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 You have to choose one or the other.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So what do they know that we don't know?

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Why are they holding it from us?

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And is that the real disclosure project we need?

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It's interesting.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I had that thought and I've been thinking about that a lot lately.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Either it's fake or they are doing something with them.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Either it's fake or they've investigated them.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And the fact that they didn't release the ghost project blue book makes me think that not only did they find proof, but they are using what they found in secret.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So next I'm going to tell you about a story.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 This is one of those stories that you kind of got to take it how you take it.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 There's a lot of holes in the story.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 There's a lot of unanswered questions.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I've only told this story to one person.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 To one person in my life.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It was maybe about two years ago.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I think it's weird.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 She thought it was weird.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And then there was just kind of a silence that sat in the room between us because there's a lot of unanswered questions.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Some leaps of logic.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Yes.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But let me tell you this story.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 My family moved around a lot.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 My father was a minister growing up, Southern Baptist minister.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So he moved to where the churches were.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 He was also going to school at the time.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So we lived in Riverside for a while while he was going to California Baptist College.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Then he moved up to the Bay Area and he was at seminary in the Bay Area.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And at that time I was in the fourth grade.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And I went to Strawberry Point School.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Now I used to have a very, very thick New York accent.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Never been to New York.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 It was just a speech impediment.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So whenever I moved, everyone thought I had just moved from New York.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 "Hey, get in the call. Let's get in the call. Come on. What are you guys waiting for?"

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I don't remember having the accent.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I sounded perfectly normal to me, which is interesting to have an accent.

174
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And I know what it's like when people have accents and people go, "I love your accent."

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And they're like, "What are you talking about?"

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Really thick New York accent.

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 When I was in the fourth grade.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So quite old. What is that? Like nine? Ten somewhere around there?

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 The school district said, "We're going to put Jason in a speech therapy class."

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 To work on that accent he has.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 He has a speech impediment.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He has this heavy New York accent. Never been to New York.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 My parents were like, "Okay."

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 This is where the story gets weird.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I remember very little about a class I attended once a week for a year.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I actually only remember one thing.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Once a week, I would be sent out of my class at Strawberry Point.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And I would walk across the field.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And across the field there was a portable.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 So I don't know if they're everywhere in the world, but basically it is a portable classroom.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 It's basically like a long block.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It's like a long building that's usually just set aside.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It's a portable classroom.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I remember I would leave my class.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I would walk across that field.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 That seemed amazingly big, but you know, it's because I was a kid.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I'm sure it was fairly short.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And I would go into the portable.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And then I would go back to class.

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Now what's weird is this is where we get into some weird stuff.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 One, I never remember walking back from the portable.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 But that's fine.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 That could just be because it was so routine.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 You forget about it.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 I remember walking to the portable.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 I don't remember walking back from the portable.

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I don't remember any of the lessons.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I don't remember any of the topics or anything that I learned.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 All I know is that within maybe six months, seven, pretty much a school year,

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 my speech impediment I had for about 10 years was completely gone.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I didn't have it when I was a baby, obviously,

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 but from the time I started talking to the time I was in fourth grade,

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 my speech impediment was completely gone.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Every so often you'll hear it.

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 When I'm talking fast, you'll hear me say "caw" instead of "car."

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 "Breath Fx" is still a word that I obviously get tripped up on.

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 But for the most part, nobody thinks I'm from New York.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I may mispronounce words quite often,

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 but I don't have a speech impediment.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I can, you know, do things.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I remember one time being in that classroom.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I remember walking into the class.

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 There was the teacher who all I can remember about her is she was a white brunette

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and there was one girl who also took speech therapy

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 that I never saw around school.

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 She was there.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I walked in.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 The teacher's there.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 That's the only memory of going to that speech therapy class for a school year

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 was the one time I walked into the room.

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 That's it.

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Couldn't tell you what the room looked like.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Couldn't tell you how many tables there were.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Couldn't tell you what we talked about.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Nothing.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And you're like, "Okay, Jason, you've said before, let's be skeptical about you, Jason,

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 you've said before on this podcast you don't have a great memory of anything like pre-1992."

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And that's correct.

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 That's correct.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I have fragments of memories pretty much throughout most of my early life.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 I'll remember this event here.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I'll remember my great-grandma McGee making me pancakes in the shape of Mickey Mouse.

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And I'll remember sitting there and watching cartoons on my table on the day I got Optimus Prime

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 and all my toys and stuff like that.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 But I don't--and I assume--I always assumed everyone had memories like that

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 until I realized a lot of people remember who they went to school with in elementary school.

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I can't do that.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I remember key names, but for the most part I don't remember most people.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 But--and that's true.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 That's true.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So the fact that I don't remember walking from the portable,

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 I don't remember one classroom, one class session in there,

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 while odd is more in my normal range.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 But it's still kind of weird.

255
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 In fifth grade at Strawberry Point, we had ceramics class.

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Now, I'm not really good with my hands.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I'm not a very good artist at all.

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I'm a writer.

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 That's my art.

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So whenever we did, like, watercolors, I always sucked.

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Whenever we did piano, I was terrible at it.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Dancing, I was okay at.

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 But when it got time for ceramics, I was like, "Great, another thing I'm gonna suck at."

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And I always put in minimal effort in school.

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 It was just like whatever.

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Just want to get stuff, get home, go home, play Nintendo.

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Actually, I think that was around the first time I bought a Nintendo, but they had just come out.

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I remembered putting in the minimal effort and I made a clay bowl,

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 which is the easiest thing you can make in ceramics class.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And I made it, and I glazed it and painted it and all that stuff.

271
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And it was time for us to pick up our art projects.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Pick up our ceramic projects.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 The teacher had gone and had them fired, brought them back.

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I walk up and I grab my bowl and I go back to where I was standing,

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 because we had, like, those tables.

276
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And I think there might have been stools there, but anyways.

277
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And everyone's picking up their thing.

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And I remember when I went up to go pick up my bowl,

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 there was a probably 16 inch tall ceramic dragon

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 that was painted with, like, the green skin.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 It kind of looked like Pete's Dragon, which was one of my favorite movies as a kid.

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And it was about 16 inches tall.

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It had a big old plump belly, little tiny arms,

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 long tail that kind of wrapped over by its legs.

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 You know, like squat.

286
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 It basically looked like Pete's Dragon, but a little more, a little less cartoony.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Colors were a little more muted.

288
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And I think the fins on the back were a dark green.

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And I remember, and they had, like, the white belly.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I think it was actually wasn't painted, so it was, like, the ceramic colored belly.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But it was an interesting piece.

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And I remember when I went up to go pick up the bowl,

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I looked at the dragon and I thought, "That's awesome.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Like, I wish I could make something like that."

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Took the bowl back to my desk.

296
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I remember seeing the dragon before that as well,

297
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 but it was just, I remember just seeing it exist, like, on a far-off table.

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 But now seeing it fully painted and fired, it looked great.

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I take the bowl back.

300
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And everyone's getting their art projects.

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And I'm sitting next to my buddy.

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And the teacher goes, "And, of course, we have this dragon, Jason.

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Come up and get your dragon."

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And I go, "I didn't make that dragon."

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And the teacher got this confused look on her face.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And she goes, "You didn't?"

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And I was like, "No. No, I have my art project right here,

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 and I held up the cheap little bowl."

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And she looks down at the dragon and she looks at me and she goes,

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 "Are you sure?"

311
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, this is my bowl."

312
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And she picks the dragon up.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 There's no name on the dragon at all.

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 She looks underneath it. There's no name on it.

315
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 She puts it back down.

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And then she's like, "Okay, class, let's go.

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Like, you know, take your stuff home."

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And everyone seemed very confused about what was going on.

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Because you have this amazing piece of art that no one in the class had made.

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And I'm thinking, well, someone from another class must have made it.

321
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I didn't, because I made this bowl.

322
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And I remember kids were putting stuff in their backpack.

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And I start putting stuff away.

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And my buddy turns to me and he looks at me and he goes,

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 "Jason, I watched you make that."

326
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And I just looked at him and I go, "No, I didn't.

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I made this bowl."

328
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Just get up and walk past them.

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 That dragon sat on the teacher's window sill for the rest of the school year.

330
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Nobody ever claimed it.

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Nobody ever picked it up.

332
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And I remember on the last day of school, I walked by there and saw it there.

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 I had this bizarre connection to the dragon.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 The teacher thought I made it.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 My friend watched me make it, apparently.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I never made it.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Not only did I not make it, I would never, ever have the skill to make it.

338
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I couldn't make it today.

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I couldn't even draw you a picture of it, except using my words to draw a picture of it,

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 because that's my art.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 But did I make it?

342
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 How many witnesses do you have to have to tell you you did something,

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 that you created something before you believed them?

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I don't think I always had a problem remembering things,

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 but I think at a certain point, it happened.

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But the problem with holes in your memory

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 is that you can never track back to the truth.

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 You can only track back to a half-remembered memory

349
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 of walking across the field, and then the next day starts.

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000

 Have a great week, and I will see you in one week.

356
