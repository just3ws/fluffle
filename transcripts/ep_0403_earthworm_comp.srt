1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 We're gonna talk about ghosts and UFOs and stuff.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,560
 It's a couple conspiracies on the special...

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,500
 The Jason Carpenter is really, really sick.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,600
 Special episode.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,480
 Episode 403.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,600
 The Jason is sick episode.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:27,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,680
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,600
 I'm sick, but I hope you aren't.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,080
 Now, let me get in front of everything.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
 It's not corona.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,920
 It's not the coronavirus.

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,640
 It is something that sucks.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,280
 Nose has been running all day and pretty gooey feeling.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,360
 My bones hurt.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,080
 So I did have an episode planned for today, but I'm recording this one pretty late.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,920
 I know there's gonna be a lot of times that I'm turning away to cough.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,880
 So I'm gonna keep this one easy on me is what I'm saying, but we're not.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,680
 This isn't a filler episode because I got some cool stuff to talk about.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,200
 It's just not going to be in the format I normally do.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,360
 And let me go ahead and say this.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,880
 I almost feel like apologizing, but let's give a shout out to today's Patreon supporter.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,800
 Today's Patreon supporter is Misty.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,520
 Misty specifically requested.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,880
 I do not try to pronounce her last name, but I really, really appreciate the support Misty.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,920
 I'm gonna use your, your, your particular Patreon donation to go buy some more medicine.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,880
 And if you guys can't support the Patreon, you can always support the show by helping

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,280
 getting the word out about the show.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,920
 That helps just as well.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,800
 So Misty, let's, let's, um, let's just hang out at my place today.

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 Come on.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
 Let's take a seat today.

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,600
 I want to talk about some conspiracies I believe in.

35
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,440
 Now let me say this right off the bat.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,520
 I have no proof to back any of this stuff up.

37
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,480
 So legally I'm just rambling, right?

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,760
 With me and you know, with me and you know, I have a couple of weird conspiracy theories

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,040
 that have been, or insights, not a standup comedian, but here's conspiracy theory number

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
 one.

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,000
 I believe, okay, so you know when you see like, okay, I, I don't want to use real actors'

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,080
 names because then that is actual slander.

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,200
 But let's say there is an actor who's preparing for a role in a superhero movie and they go

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,080
 from being a normal looking human to 180 pounds of raw muscle.

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,880
 You guys know this has happened multiple times.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,880
 I'm not singling out one particular hero, but it used to be that action heroes were

47
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,440
 built genetically built like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme.

48
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,800
 These were people who did not look like normal humans, just, just in their normal everyday

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 life.

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,320
 But recently though, past 10, 15 years, people started going, let's hire actual actors.

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,440
 Let's get an actual actor to do this and make them look buff for this particular superhero

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
 movie that begins.

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,560
 So I think that, and not just that movie, Captain America, pretty much every Marvel movie

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,720
 started a man, I think outside of the Hulk.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,160
 I think my personal conspiracy is, is that when you see an actor put on, this might blow

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,280
 your mind at first, but you gotta think about it logically.

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,760
 When you see an actor put on 30 pounds of raw muscle in between shooting movies, they're

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
 doing steroids.

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,720
 They're mo- they are, they are allegedly on steroids.

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
 Now let me say this, I don't care, steroids is one of those drugs that I don't really

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
 care about.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,480
 I think steroids regulated very well outside of a sports competition, I think should be

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,880
 totally fine.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,960
 I think you should be able to go to the doctor and say, hey I want to get more fit, or I

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,560
 just want to look better.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,600
 If we're allowing people to do plastic surgery, if we're allowing people to do surgery to

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,440
 their body, why can't people do steroids under, under like medical supervision?

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,600
 I don't have a problem with steroids personally.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,080
 Steroids like any drug can lead to harmful things, yes.

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,200
 But I've always viewed steroids more as something that could be regulated within the medical

71
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 system.

72
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,920
 If, if people want to take steroids, that's one of those things that I've always thought

73
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,160
 should just be regulated and should be legal.

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,280
 As long as you're not playing sports, because then it's not fair.

75
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,400
 The point is, is that I believe that when we see these actors put on all this muscle

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
 weight, because a lot of times steroids may not even make you stronger, it just makes

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,320
 you look bigger, which is the kind of the connection between that and plastic surgery.

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,880
 I think they give these actors steroids.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,280
 Now, that would be it.

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,560
 Could you imagine the fallout if that came out?

81
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,480
 Because we always see these diet plans, I was watching this YouTube video today and

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,360
 they're like, "Do you know how so-and-so got into shape for Captain America?"

83
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,920
 Intermented fasting and I was like, "Nope, steroids."

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,760
 That dude obviously did steroids for that franchise, because what happens is then, I mean nowadays

85
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,880
 they have the franchises can last a while, but for the most part they, they look normal

86
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
 their next movie.

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,560
 Like, "Oh, look at me, I magically lost all that, all that muscle that took me so long

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
 to build up.

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
 It's magically gone.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
 I can fit in this business suit for this family drama."

91
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
 Steroids will do that if you stop taking the steroids.

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,480
 And I bet you anything that they go to these quote-unquote trainers, I'm not, I'm, I don't

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,360
 know if they're tricking these guys.

94
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,200
 They're like, "Look at me, mom, I'm so strong, I'm so strong."

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
 And the guy's like, "You are strong, Billy.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,360
 Here, let me give you another injection of strong sauce."

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 Yay!

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
 I mean, like, they probably sit down with them and say, "Hey, listen, we're gonna have

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,000
 you eat nothing but fish and you're gonna be lifting much of weight, but you're also

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,360
 gonna be taking human growth hormones."

101
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,280
 And here's, this is why I think this is true.

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,160
 One, it's my eyeballs work.

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,800
 I can look at actors who have massive weight fluctuations between movies.

104
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 My eyes work.

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
 That's the first part of the conspiracy, too.

106
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,280
 If I have a $200 million movie on the horizon and part of it is you looking like a superhero,

107
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,840
 I'm not gonna be like, "Hmm, I hope he has good genetics.

108
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,200
 I hope he can put on weight, muscle weight really quickly."

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,840
 Now, norbit, you can throw on a fat suit, right?

110
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
 And then you're fine.

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,400
 There's your $200 million investment.

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,480
 But with this dude, like, with these guys I'm talking about, there's no way they're like

113
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,440
 checking their watch and they're like going into the gym each day and they're like, "How's

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 he doing?"

115
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,760
 No, they're injecting them with human growth hormone or steroids or something.

116
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,760
 Again, I don't have a problem with it, but it would be a huge scandal if that ever got

117
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
 out.

118
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,880
 And you heard it first, on Dead Rabbit Radio, you know what's funny?

119
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,880
 All the stuff I talk about, lizard people taking over the planet, gray aliens, all the

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,000
 other weird stuff, Mormon Vicput, never worried about him breaking through my door.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,860
 It's funny 'cause all the conspiracy theories I do watch, that'll be the one that gets me

122
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,640
 shot in some back alley.

123
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,680
 I'm shot behind a 24-hour fitness bunch of needles in my back.

124
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next segment.

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,400
 Our next segment is more of a thought experiment.

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,200
 So you know how, let me ask you this, guys, and gals, you have, I can almost guarantee,

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,920
 you have something in your house, your apartment, your dorm room, your shack.

128
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,560
 Remember MASH when we were kids, mansion, apartment, shack house?

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,520
 That has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,200
 That was just a nostalgia thing.

131
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
 You remember?

132
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,120
 Wait, no, no, no, no, no.

133
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,480
 Now, I'm starting to lose it.

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,360
 Now, not remember.

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
 Just descend in the apartment.

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,600
 She's like, "Dead, why did I have to donate this episode?"

137
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,520
 The episode that is the first step in Jason's mental decline.

138
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
 It's almost sad that he's even recording an episode right now.

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,960
 So I can guarantee that you guys either have a guitar that is not being played, or some

140
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,560
 sort of musical instrument that you bought that you planned on using.

141
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,720
 Or maybe you have a program on your computer about how to make a video game.

142
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,840
 Maybe you have the first chapter of a book you've written.

143
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,360
 Maybe you have the first chapter of a book you've read that you're like, "I always wanted

144
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,080
 to read a book, but you've just never finished one."

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
 Maybe you haven't even gone that far.

146
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,640
 Maybe you have a story idea that you've totally built out the world, but it's not built out

147
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 enough.

148
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,960
 You need to have the world building completely done before you start putting pen to paper.

149
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,440
 I'm not mocking any of that because I've done that my whole life.

150
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,320
 Now I've been blessed that I've done that type of stuff where I'll start a book and

151
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,360
 then I'm like, "Oh, I have to do this and I have to do that."

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
 And I'm the same token.

153
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,720
 I've also been like, "Oh, here's another idea and I've run with it."

154
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
 Like this podcast.

155
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,880
 Like before I started the podcast, I was trying to be an author.

156
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,360
 I was writing all this stuff.

157
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
 Nothing was really catching fire.

158
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
 Do this podcast.

159
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
 It blows up.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,280
 So that should be inspirational that what you're trying to do or what you started and

161
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,040
 put away.

162
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
 Maybe that's not the thing for you.

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,960
 Maybe it needs a second look.

164
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
 Maybe all that stuff.

165
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,320
 Maybe all that inspirational stuff that really sounds better when I feel better.

166
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
 That's not the point of this segment.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
 What is, kind of, you should follow your dreams.

168
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,440
 But think about this.

169
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,680
 Think about this right now.

170
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,840
 So back in the 50s and stuff, people had to be...

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,480
 Okay, so let me say this too.

172
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,560
 First off, I apologize for this episode.

173
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,280
 Secondly, I'm getting this from a note I wrote to myself called Weird Thoughts.

174
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,440
 I found it on my computer when I was like, "What do I want to talk about?

175
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
 What do I want to talk about this episode?

176
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,960
 I want to talk about steroids."

177
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,080
 Because I've had that conspiracy theory for a while, actually.

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
 The YouTube ad about intermittent fasting reminded me of it.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,720
 Here's this.

180
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
 This is my note.

181
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,360
 I don't know why I thought of this, but here's this note.

182
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,120
 People used to want to be married...

183
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,240
 Just to show you how my brain works.

184
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,440
 This is what I wrote down.

185
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,760
 People used to want to be marionette operators or, like, using dummies.

186
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,600
 So I was sitting there one day and I thought...

187
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,480
 I used to have a guitar in the corner of my room.

188
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
 Right?

189
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 Everyone does.

190
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
 Everyone has that.

191
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
 So nothing to be ashamed of.

192
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,960
 But I was kind of ashamed of it because it was all dusty.

193
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,480
 So I gave it to Veronica who gave it to her daughter and that way if she ever becomes

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,640
 an ex-Taylor Swift, I'll be the Colonel Tom Parker of that action.

195
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,520
 But that's normal, right?

196
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
 But think about it.

197
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,240
 At one point, somebody convinced their wife that they were going to be the next...

198
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,520
 I don't even know who was a famous marionette dude.

199
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
 Somebody...

200
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,040
 The reason why I'm thinking this is because it shows how I think familiar the human experiences.

201
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
 Right?

202
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,280
 I'm not going to spend too much time going on this because then I just feel like a stoner.

203
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
 I'm the worst kind of stoner.

204
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,240
 I'm a stoner who doesn't get high.

205
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,800
 I'm a stoner who hasn't been high in almost a decade, but I still have stoner thoughts.

206
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,320
 We have those dreams and stuff like that and we see, like, guitar people, musicians, they're

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,720
 normally called, playing guitars and you're like, "Oh, I would like to do that."

208
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,560
 Like, I don't see myself as Mr. Maroon 5, but I could see myself as, you know, Jason

209
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,240
 Mraz sitting at a coffee shop picking up chicks with my guitar.

210
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,400
 But back in, like, the '50s, I mean, they had guitars and stuff like that, but it was

211
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
 all, like, jazz music and stuff, right?

212
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 But you know what was really, you know what was really big was marionettes.

213
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,360
 So you had some dude who had an apartment and, like, in the corner of his apartment was

214
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,120
 a equilibrous dummy and people would come over and it'd be all dusty and they'd be like,

215
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,920
 "Hey, Jason, weren't you trying to get...

216
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,200
 Didn't you just talk about trying to get on the Ed Sullivan show with, like, your dummy

217
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,680
 and doing that dummy stuff?

218
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

219
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,160
 I practice on the weekends.

220
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,560
 I mean, I don't have a lot of time now, but you know, I still break it out every once

221
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,600
 in a while and people are like, "It's kind of dusty."

222
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,360
 Have you noticed, too, actually, that joke notwithstanding, when you...

223
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
 There's almost an unspoken code.

224
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,240
 I guess this is a conspiracy.

225
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,520
 There's an unspoken code among us.

226
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,240
 We all have the dusty guitar.

227
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,680
 The half-written book is really hard to see.

228
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,400
 A lot of times people at work or people at school talk about a book they're writing

229
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,160
 and then there's an unwritten code there where none of us ask the other person how

230
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,600
 that's going.

231
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
 Have you noticed that?

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,400
 I guess this is kind of a weird standup routine.

233
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,720
 I had my dusty guitar in the corner and it was for a couple years.

234
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
 Multiple people came over.

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,160
 Sometimes people would pick it up and they'd kind of strum it because they actually knew

236
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
 how to use it.

237
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,560
 But no one ever went, "Man, this guitar is dusty.

238
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,920
 You never followed your dreams, did you, Jason?"

239
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
 You're like, "No."

240
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,560
 There's never ever comments on the dusty guitar.

241
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,000
 When you say, "Yeah, I'm thinking about writing a book," and you start telling the story and

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,720
 people are like, "Oh, yeah, it sounds kind of interesting."

243
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,080
 They may ask you once or twice, "Hey, how's that book coming?"

244
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,520
 But after and you go, "Oh, I'm still working on getting the characterization," after a

245
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,160
 while people stop asking and it's not because they're not interested.

246
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,600
 It's because we all have that dusty guitar and we don't want to be asked about it, right?

247
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
 Isn't that weird?

248
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,880
 It's kind of like a communal shame.

249
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,440
 I believe you have to have the dusty guitar to get the dead rabbit radio.

250
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,840
 I believe you do have to have the failures at creativity or whatever you're doing.

251
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,200
 Doesn't necessarily have to be created.

252
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,720
 You may be trying to rebuild a car.

253
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,920
 It's just sitting in the garage.

254
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,280
 But I think you need to have the failures to have the successes.

255
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,400
 So I tried picking up the guitar.

256
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 It wasn't working.

257
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
 I wrote some stuff.

258
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,520
 I wrote, written a couple of scripts.

259
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,000
 I've sent them out to production companies.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,560
 No one's ever bitten on them, stuff like that.

261
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,680
 So I think you have to have those failures to have the successes.

262
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,360
 And I'll tell you this, man, success is weird.

263
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
 Success is weird.

264
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,920
 I know I've heard of the term fear of success.

265
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,480
 Everyone has a fear of failure or most people have a fear of failure.

266
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 You can get over it.

267
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,520
 Some people have a fear of success where they'll self-sabotage themselves, where they'll be

268
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,320
 like, "Nope, this is getting too big."

269
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,000
 And the reason why I don't have that is because I've had failures in my past and I've had

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 successes in my past.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Let's say I go, "You know, I'm going to spend this next couple of years being a journalist

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
 and as a very successful journalist.

273
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,920
 I'm going to spend these next couple of years being an actor, a fairly successful actor."

274
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
 And then I had all these other failed projects behind me.

275
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,200
 So you have to have those successes and those failures.

276
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,400
 But anyways, let's get back to the dummies.

277
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,800
 So the point is, is that I think it's weird that we all have this communal thing where

278
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,560
 we don't talk about a dusty guitar in everyone else's room because we don't want people to

279
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,320
 ask us about our dusty guitar.

280
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,440
 And if you haven't got it yet, it's a metaphor for giving up on things you want to do.

281
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,800
 But that experience has even pushed farther back.

282
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,240
 In the 40s and the 50s, there were dusty marionettes and dummies and we were just dummies

283
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,280
 sitting in corners and people finally like, they always wanted to learn how to do it,

284
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
 but they just couldn't talk.

285
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,680
 They couldn't talk without moving their mouth.

286
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
 But they kept it in the room because I'm going to pick it up one of these days and eventually

287
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,280
 they packed it in a box and stuck it in the attic.

288
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,320
 And then eventually they probably sold it or got stolen.

289
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,640
 Got stolen by the notorious dummy thief.

290
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,440
 And then we can, I can almost guarantee you, we can even go farther back to like, when

291
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,000
 did people start having fun?

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,320
 I know that's actually, that might sound like a joke, but happy?

293
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,800
 Being happy?

294
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,320
 The old version of that was luck.

295
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,280
 Happiness in olden times basically meant luck.

296
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,480
 You're really, people, people did have joy, but it wasn't like, oh, I'm going to go do

297
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 my hobby now.

298
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,200
 You basically worked until dinner time and then you rested.

299
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,400
 And then as society became a little more comfortable, you're like, oh, now I can like read this

300
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
 book.

301
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,760
 This book that's not a religious text.

302
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,120
 That's when people are like, oh, look at fiction.

303
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,600
 This is awesome.

304
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,720
 When before you were either like reading the Bible, someone reading the Bible to you or

305
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,800
 whatever religious text of whatever region you were in and then working the rest of the

306
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
 time.

307
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,760
 But eventually we got to a point where we could start going, what is this thing I'm feeling?

308
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
 It's joy.

309
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,600
 This is awesome.

310
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,400
 Even back then people like in that time where people were able to start to find human joy

311
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,520
 and comfort in the little things.

312
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,800
 And I'm not talking about the super wealthy.

313
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,160
 I'm talking about, you know, just normal people.

314
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
 They had marionette puppets, right?

315
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
 They were still stuck on that.

316
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,680
 You had little Otto in 1890 Germany who really, really wanted to, you know, he had all of

317
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,720
 his, the story ideas in his head of his own Punch and Judy show.

318
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,240
 He's like, oh, I'm going to have two punches and it's going to be like, they're going to

319
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
 be like robbing banks.

320
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,680
 He's like the Quentin Tarantino of hand puppets back then.

321
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,160
 And then at a certain point he goes, no.

322
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,200
 And his puppets got dusty in the corner.

323
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,800
 So yeah, it's just a weird thing.

324
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,920
 That is a new conspiracy.

325
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,360
 I'm dubbing the, the dusty guitar conspiracy.

326
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,520
 So yeah, that's that segment too.

327
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
 That segment too.

328
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,680
 That's technically a new conspiracy.

329
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,120
 We can put that on conspiracy theory.

330
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,520
 Iceberg, the dusty guitar.

331
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,120
 Because everyone has one.

332
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,200
 Nobody wants to talk about it.

333
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,880
 And everyone hopes the best for themselves.

334
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,280
 I'm not a huge believer in the crabs in the bucket theory.

335
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
 Maybe because I'm not a crab in the bucket.

336
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,560
 Grabbing the bucket theory is nobody wants to see other people do good.

337
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,000
 If you put a bunch of crabs in the bucket, if one's about to escape, the other crabs

338
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,280
 will pull it back down into the bucket.

339
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,200
 And there's a humanity theory, a sociological theory called crabs in a bucket where humanity

340
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,600
 doesn't like to see other people rise up so they'll pull them down.

341
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,000
 People do like to see really high up people fall.

342
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,800
 But the one thing people like more than to see people at the top fall is redemption stories.

343
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,440
 Those are the ones.

344
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,880
 It's a really weird cycle.

345
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,520
 Like nobody likes to see, like say, Britney Spears.

346
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
 She's the best example for this because she actually did this.

347
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,760
 She rose to the top.

348
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,560
 She had a mental breakdown, whatever you want to call it.

349
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,520
 She's attacking people with umbrellas and her kids get taken away.

350
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,040
 It's all sorts of craziness.

351
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,440
 And everyone is like, "What did you expect?

352
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
 Child celebrity.

353
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
 She's nuts."

354
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,400
 And then she came back bigger than ever.

355
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
 And now that's where she's at.

356
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,000
 Her dad's going through some health problems and stuff like that.

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,160
 But people like to see people.

358
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,080
 They do like to see people fall, but they like it even better when they come back.

359
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,560
 Elvis Presley, perfect example of that.

360
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
 So what was I talking about?

361
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,960
 Oh yeah, yeah, dusty guitars.

362
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,800
 I think everyone wants to see all the dusty guitars get dusted off and all the dreams

363
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,040
 fulfilled but everyone's too afraid.

364
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
 Sometimes you just got to find another guitar.

365
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
 This microphone is quite dusty for a while.

366
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
 Actually, I've talked about this before.

367
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 I was a musician.

368
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,520
 I have a couple of my zombie songs online.

369
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,200
 I had some earlier episodes and I had this microphone.

370
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,840
 It got dusty because I stopped using it and broke it back out for this.

371
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,000
 So you always have time to dust it off.

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,360
 Let's go ahead and do one more topic.

373
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,920
 Let me think about it.

374
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
 What did I talk about already?

375
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,560
 I talked about dusty guitars and I talked about...

376
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,520
 What did I talk about in the beginning?

377
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,880
 Oh yeah, actors breaking the law to get buffed for superhero movies.

378
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,600
 Okay, so here we go.

379
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
 Here's my last conspiracy.

380
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
 I don't even know if this is a conspiracy.

381
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,400
 So you're like, "Jeez, I'm not going to talk about a married hip-hop that's again."

382
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,680
 No, no I'm not.

383
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
 I don't know how to...

384
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,240
 Let me just start.

385
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,760
 I think it will appeal to you guys because I think it explains a conspiracy theory.

386
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,200
 You know, I walk a lot and I have this weird thing when I see worms on the ground.

387
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
 I pick them up.

388
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,680
 I throw them in the grass.

389
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,120
 Now I'm not a big ol' fuzzy dude.

390
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,680
 I'm not super...

391
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,880
 I love animals but not to the point where I don't eat them, right?

392
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
 I'm always eating an animal.

393
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,000
 I actually was a vegetarian for a couple years but then it just got too expensive so I was

394
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 like, "I'm back down my goal at poor cow or..."

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,120
 But you know, I also don't go out of my way to hurt animals.

396
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,800
 And that's kind of the same way I'm with humans.

397
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,040
 Like I'm not super like, "Oh life should be cherished."

398
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,480
 But I'm also not like, I'm just walking out the street randomly beating people up.

399
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,440
 I mean, I'm a normal human is what I mean by that.

400
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
 I'm a normal human.

401
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,200
 But a lot of times I'm walking and it's a little bit of an effort to bend over and pick

402
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
 up that worm.

403
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 I'm older.

404
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
 I'm overweight.

405
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,040
 Oh yeah, the keto's gone out the window.

406
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,160
 I've been eating my body weight in soup since I got sick.

407
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,680
 But you know, even on the keto, I'm still like 270, 43 years old.

408
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
 I walk everywhere.

409
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,040
 You know, I get a good amount of exercise.

410
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,080
 And then over to pick up worms.

411
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,920
 Man, that's when you know you're old.

412
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,800
 I can't do it anymore, Judith.

413
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 I can't do it.

414
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
 I don't know who Judith is.

415
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
 There's some random woman walking down the street.

416
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,040
 She's like, "What talking to me?

417
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
 Sorry, Judith."

418
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 But I have a theory now.

419
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,400
 I'm sure you're like, "I can't.

420
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,040
 What in the world is going to come out of Jason's mouth?

421
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,160
 Misty's already left.

422
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
 She's gone.

423
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,520
 She's left the apartment.

424
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,840
 She goes, "I do not want to know what conspiracy...

425
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
 Dusty worms?

426
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 What's going on here?"

427
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,120
 Now, let me say this too.

428
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
 This is not...

429
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,520
 I'm not telling you to go out and start squishing worms.

430
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,800
 Because I'm going to pick them up.

431
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
 They don't deserve...

432
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,560
 I know why worms are on the pavement.

433
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,600
 It's because their house has got all wet and they don't know what to do.

434
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,920
 They don't got eyeballs, right?

435
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 And the second they get on concrete, they're like, "Oh, this is not good.

436
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,360
 I'm just going to keep going in the same direction I'm going."

437
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,440
 They get further and further on the sidewalk.

438
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,840
 Now, the other day was real early.

439
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
 It was like four or five in the morning, walking around.

440
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 I'm a cat burglar.

441
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,520
 That's one of my many jobs.

442
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,320
 I was leaving a very, very successful heist.

443
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,880
 And I'm walking on the street and I see a fat worm right on the sidewalk.

444
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
 Almost stepped on it.

445
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
 I didn't.

446
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:51,400
 And I reached down to pick it up and I thought, "Only a..."

447
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,920
 I had a legit head of this thought.

448
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,760
 And I can't preface it anymore.

449
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,920
 I just have to say it.

450
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,240
 Only a millionaire could step on a worm.

451
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,200
 Now that is not a knock against millionaires at all.

452
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
 I've known a lot of millionaires in my life.

453
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,800
 It's not a knock against...

454
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,560
 So that's one of the cool things about getting older is you meet tons of people.

455
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,480
 When you're younger, you run into the same social group.

456
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,000
 When you get older, you meet people and you're like, "Hey, how you doing?"

457
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 "Oh yeah, I own this business."

458
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,800
 "Oh yeah, they got like $10 million in their bank account."

459
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 "I'm totally fine."

460
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,440
 "It's not a knock against millionaires."

461
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,640
 I think that it's the reason why I'm not a millionaire.

462
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,760
 So let me explain.

463
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
 To have...

464
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,560
 And you know, I've talked a lot about visualization.

465
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,480
 So when I visualize having a successful podcast or having a healthy life, cough, cough, or

466
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,240
 I actually don't visualize my health that often, but I'm generally very healthy.

467
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,240
 When I talk about visualization, I visualize having a successful podcast.

468
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
 I visualize all these things.

469
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,760
 I also visualize being financially successful, having advertisers and things like that.

470
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,240
 But part of visualization is believing you're already there.

471
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,160
 I already believe this podcast is incredibly successful.

472
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,320
 So it's no surprise to me when it is.

473
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,120
 Very, very happy that we're huge in Argentina and other parts of the world.

474
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,840
 Today was a great day for downloads, 2000 downloads in a single day.

475
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,760
 Huge in the world of podcasts.

476
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,200
 But I visualize those things already.

477
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,400
 I know they're going to happen.

478
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,320
 But those are all just numbers and things.

479
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,600
 The reason why you need to be able to step on worms to be a millionaire is because part

480
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,800
 of being a millionaire...

481
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,880
 This is like I said, I've met a lot of millionaires in my life.

482
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,680
 Part of being a millionaire is saying no to people.

483
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,960
 Now I'm actually really good at saying no to people.

484
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,840
 I don't think you can be successful unless you say no to people.

485
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,240
 But at the same time, I don't have a lot of respect for money.

486
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,760
 I see that as kind of a number as a kind of a thing.

487
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,440
 So if I was given a million dollars and people started coming out of the woodwork asking me

488
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,480
 for money, how would I deal with that?

489
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 Interesting question.

490
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,400
 I don't necessarily consider myself a nice person.

491
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,800
 I'm definitely not someone who can be manipulated.

492
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,680
 But if you want to know who can be manipulated, it's generally people who say that they can't

493
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,080
 be.

494
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,000
 If I had a million dollars given to me, I feel like I would have to isolate myself for a

495
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,680
 period of time to prevent myself from being taken advantage of.

496
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,840
 Now I've actually done a really good job in my life surrounding myself with people that

497
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,000
 I can trust and people who don't really care about money either.

498
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,960
 They either have enough of it themselves or it's just not something that concerns them.

499
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,040
 So if all of a sudden, let's say a network came to me and said, "Hey, we'll give you

500
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,400
 a million dollars for your show.

501
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,480
 We want you to be exclusive on our network."

502
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,840
 It would trouble me because I know that that worm, so much as I love it, it's biological,

503
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
 it's alive.

504
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 It's kind of gross, right?

505
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
 And it's in my way.

506
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,600
 But I'll take the time out to pick it up because I don't want to hurt it.

507
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,640
 It's not just me stepping over the worm.

508
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,880
 It's the fact that I picked the worm up and put it to where it'll be safe.

509
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,320
 I've done this for years.

510
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,200
 Obviously, when I was a kid, I was burning them with magnifying glasses and stuff like

511
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
 that.

512
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
 We used to take bees and ants and make them fight.

513
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,720
 But as I've gotten older, it's not only that I'll step over the worm, I'll pick it up and

514
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,440
 put it to where it will be safe.

515
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,280
 So other people won't step on it.

516
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,560
 So when people come to me and say, "If someone comes to me and says I want you to invest

517
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,280
 in a business, I'm not dealing with that," or make your podcast grow if you get mad,

518
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
 I'm not dealing with that.

519
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,960
 I'm talking about people coming to me and saying, "My daughter's sick."

520
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,160
 Or "My son needs to go to a private school.

521
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
 He's getting bullied."

522
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
 Stuff like that.

523
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,640
 I'm not going to give you money just because what I'm talking about, like people coming

524
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,040
 to me and I have a million dollars and they're like, "Can I have 80,000 of it?

525
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,280
 My daughter's life is on the line."

526
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,600
 That's not really me being manipulated unless it's some sort of big scam.

527
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,680
 But I'd be hard pressed to say no to that, obviously.

528
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,520
 Because to me, money doesn't really mean anything.

529
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,360
 I think it'd be different if I earned the money if I went from having $30,000 a year,

530
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,760
 which is roughly what I'd make, 20,000, somewhere around there, 20,000 to next year, 50,000

531
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
 to next year, 100,000 to next year.

532
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,600
 That would, I think, be different because I would learn along the way how to say no.

533
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,200
 Because they say making money is not super hard.

534
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,960
 Keeping it is the hard part.

535
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
 Everyone can make money.

536
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,960
 It's saving it and keeping it, which is the difficult part.

537
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,120
 So if I can't step on that worm, then someone comes to me with a serious health concern or

538
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,360
 a sociological concern, something like that.

539
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,560
 Because I was bullied in the fifth grade particularly, or was it the sixth grade I was bullied.

540
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,840
 I did go to a private school.

541
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,560
 So that was a real example for me.

542
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,600
 We had to scrounge money together.

543
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,640
 So I was going to a really, really rough school.

544
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 And it was in the sixth grade.

545
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,000
 I ended up going to St. Philip Nairie, which is a Catholic school, which was not as rough.

546
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,040
 And I made a lot of good friends there.

547
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,160
 But I think if I was slowly making the money, it would be easier for me to kind of figure

548
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,440
 that out.

549
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,520
 Because in my daily life, I won't step on that worm.

550
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,880
 So in a visualized future, when I'm visualizing myself saying this podcast is successful,

551
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,880
 I have all this money, I also visualize people coming up to me saying, "Hey, can I borrow

552
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 some of that?

553
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,640
 I need it for this."

554
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
 And me saying, "No."

555
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,360
 And then other people saying, "I need it for this liver transplant."

556
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,840
 And me going, "Well, I only have a million dollars and you're asking for 10% of it."

557
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
 Like, "Yeah, sure.

558
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,000
 Here you go."

559
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,400
 So it's just a weird--and what happens is then 10 people ask you for 10% of it.

560
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,600
 And then you have nothing.

561
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,040
 I think that's one of the reasons why I said earlier about the fear of success.

562
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,680
 I'm not a fear of being financially successful, but I want it to come slow enough that I can

563
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,360
 acclimate to it.

564
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,880
 Because otherwise, I'm just going to blow through all of it, either me doing stupid stuff

565
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:19,480
 or me caring too much, just like I care about that worm on the ground.

566
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,480
 So on that dark morning when I almost stepped on that worm, I remember I didn't step on

567
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 it.

568
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,360
 The moral is not me stepping on it and going, "Hahaha, universe!

569
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 Give me what I ask!"

570
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,920
 I have created the sacrifice.

571
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,160
 But I think in that moment I thought--I picked the worm up through it in the grass and went

572
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,560
 on my way right into the maw of a flying bird.

573
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,240
 Went on my way and I thought, "I think this is the reason why conspiracy theories about

574
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,600
 the ultra-wealthy being super evil and eating babies and sacrificing children and all that

575
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,120
 stuff, I think this is one of the reasons--and this--so this is really where we're ending

576
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
 this.

577
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,320
 This is one of the reasons why that type of conspiracy theory is so prevalent.

578
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,280
 It's never the poor people eating babies.

579
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,560
 You very rarely hear about the homeless population injecting the blood of the young into their

580
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
 bodies.

581
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,320
 Now I'll be hobo and young forever, forever, forever.

582
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,480
 I think it's easy for us to see a separation between us versus them because for us to look

583
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,720
 at them and for them to have that type of wealth, it's easy for us to go--if I had that

584
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,520
 wealth, I wouldn't be that wealthy.

585
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,240
 If I had $200 million, if I had $200 billion, I would be giving it to my friends and my

586
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,960
 family and be taking care of everyone.

587
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,880
 That's who we are.

588
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,240
 So when we see someone else who has an obscene amount of wealth, we go, "Why isn't he--they

589
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
 get--why aren't they spreading the love?

590
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
 That's what I do.

591
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
 That's what I do.

592
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,280
 I think it's because it is that slow acclamation to it."

593
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,680
 I'm learning to say no.

594
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,400
 Doesn't necessarily mean they're stepping on the worms, but it doesn't necessarily mean

595
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
 that they're not either.

596
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,920
 If I had $200 billion, if I had that type of money, you know, my family would be taking

597
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,760
 care of people that I believe would need it would be taken care of.

598
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:17,120
 But if I slowly got richer and richer and richer, I'm not walking at four in the morning.

599
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,040
 I'm not walking that much at all.

600
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 I'm not seeing the worms anymore.

601
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,080
 I don't see a worm for four or five years.

602
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,600
 I'm sure there are people who listen to this podcast who are like, "I don't even remember

603
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,280
 the last time I saw a worm.

604
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,320
 I've walked more in my life than I've driven at this point."

605
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,960
 And people are like, "Where is this guy walking?

606
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,040
 Wormville, USA?"

607
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,560
 But you get acclimated at that type of wealth.

608
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
 You stop walking.

609
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
 You're driving everywhere.

610
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
 You're busy.

611
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,440
 It's not that you don't care about the worms anymore.

612
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,840
 You don't even see them when you step on them.

613
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,160
 You're too busy just looking ahead to your destination.

614
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,280
 Then walking slowly and enjoying the sights.

615
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:11,680
 And walking slowly may not make you rich, but it may help you help the little guys along

616
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,960
 the way.
