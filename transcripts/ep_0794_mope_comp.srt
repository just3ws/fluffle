1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
 When the Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan of the porn world meet up, all bets are off.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,160
 Can these two men take over the entire porn industry, or are they destined for spectacular

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,600
 failure?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,840
 And then we travel to a group meeting, where the attendees have shown up to learn some

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,680
 new life lessons.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,840
 Instead, they're about to learn that nothing is as it seems today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:39,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 I'm your host Jason Carviner.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
 I'm having a good day.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,040
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the snow or in the desert wherever you're

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
 at.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
 I hope it's fantastic.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,480
 Speaking of fantastic, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our Thanksgiving

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,280
 livestream supporters.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
 Come in inside, give it up for an idea guy.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,160
 Shaking that snow and that dirt off of his coat.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
 Idea guy, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,280
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
 Just helps read the word about the show.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 Really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,880
 Long time listener and supporter of the show, Fabio, recently sent me a photograph.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,000
 He was investigating a story that I'd recently done in his home country of Italy, and he

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,280
 posted a flyer in the town while he was there and he sent me this amazing photograph.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,080
 So that is exactly what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,600
 Travel to Italy and cover it in flyers.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,160
 And idea guy, let's go ahead and talk to the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,040
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,560
 We're headed all the way down to Los Angeles.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,120
 And while we're headed down there, let's take a look at this artwork we're using for today.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,040
 This is from DreamPillot on Twitter.

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,840
 Thank you so much for sending this over.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,800
 You'll see it's one of those memes and it shows how, if you can't read it, basically

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,600
 the meme is how I talk about some of the most deserving topics possible, but yet I try not

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,840
 to swear on a show.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,120
 I never use cuss words to keep it family friendly.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,840
 Very, very funny meme.

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
 Thanks for sending it over, DreamPillot.

39
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,360
 And the reason why I wanted to have it, I just love that image.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,960
 And we're going to be talking about the pornography industry.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,440
 So even though I'm not going to be cussing, I will be talking a lot about sex acts and

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,080
 probably making some sexy noises in the background as well.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,320
 So that's just a way to say if you're listening to this artwork, time to put on the headphones.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,200
 The reason why we're in Los Angeles is we're going to look at the story of a man named

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 Steve Driver.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,000
 Now, I talked about this story briefly a couple weeks ago because I saw a movie that was based

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,240
 on his life called Mope.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,280
 And the movie is so excellent.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,520
 The movie is so good.

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,200
 I said, guys, I'm going to cover this soon, but I want you guys to all watch this movie

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,920
 because there's a lot of twists and turns.

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,800
 And some of the stuff you're not even going to believe is real until I talk about it on

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 this episode.

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
 And I'm going to say that one last time.

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800
 If you watch the movie and you have no idea what's going to happen, it's a spectacular

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 ride.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,200
 If you watch the movie after this episode, I think you'll still enjoy it.

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
 But it's a really, really good movie.

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
 Dead Rabbit recommends Mope.

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
 And I got a lot of my information from that movie.

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
 I had to sort through what was real and what was kind of combined.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,880
 And he took certain characters in Tournament 1, character and things like that.

63
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,000
 And hats off to writer/director Lucas Haney, Lucas Haney who made Mope fantastic film.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,160
 And then also I got a ton of information from an LA Weekly article written by Michael Albo.

65
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,000
 A ton of my information came from that article as well.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,760
 So shout out to both of you guys.

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,240
 The reason why I run Los Angeles is we're about to meet Steve Driver.

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,920
 Steve Driver, professional porn actor.

69
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,360
 He's getting off the bus.

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,680
 He takes off his sunglasses.

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
 He looks around this new land LA.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,880
 And he goes, "I'm going to take this place by storm.

73
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,920
 I'm Steve Driver.

74
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,840
 I was destined to be the biggest porn star in history."

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,000
 He starts walking down the street and he's hearing like this song on his head.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 "Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,880
 Oh, sexy Steve Driver doing all the stuff.

78
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
 Being another woman.

79
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
 Having sex.

80
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
 But not cussing.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
 Never, never in this episode."

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,840
 And he's walking down the street and he's hearing his own theme song on his head.

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
 And we're just kind of watching Steve Driver walking down the street.

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,520
 And I look at you guys and I go, "Yeah, this guy is really Stephen Clancy Hill is his real

85
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
 name.

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
 Steve Driver is his stage name."

87
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,760
 And the reason why he's in Los Angeles is yes, he does want to be a porn star.

88
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,240
 That is his number one goal.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,120
 But interestingly enough, that's not what he started.

90
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
 I was a little kid.

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
 And they're like, "What do you want to be?

92
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
 I want to be an astronaut.

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,680
 I want to be the next Peter North."

94
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
 No.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,840
 What happened was he was, it's such a, even the origin story for Stephen Clancy Hill or

96
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,400
 Steve Driver as I'll call him for the rest of the episode, is so bizarre.

97
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,240
 Back in 1998, he was attending the University of Maryland.

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 He was a 21-year-old guy back in 1998.

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
 He's attending the University of Maryland and he doesn't take a test.

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,200
 He's not able to take a test for whatever reason.

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,880
 So he corners a teacher's assistant and says, "Hey, you got to give me an A on the test."

102
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,520
 And the guy's like, "You didn't even take the test.

103
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,840
 What do you mean you're giving me an A on the test?

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,440
 Get out of here, dude."

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,720
 And apparently, allegedly, actually I think he was found guilty for this, Steve Driver

106
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,000
 threatened to shoot the instructional assistant.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
 So he was arrested for that.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
 But it was like five years probation and then that was kind of changed.

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,960
 And eventually it was all kind of argued down to just house arrest, 18 months of house arrest.

110
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,120
 So Steve Driver's sitting at home and he's under house arrest for 18 months.

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,160
 So what are you going to do?

112
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
 He consumed pornography.

113
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,240
 In that 18 months, he became a porno addict.

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,440
 And he would watch pornography the way other people would watch football games.

115
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 He would analyze it.

116
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,320
 He'd look at it and go, "Oh, I totally fumbled there.

117
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 Oh, no, it just got in her eye.

118
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 He was supposed to get all over her face."

119
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,760
 And all of a sudden he's taking notes.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,320
 He has like a little chalkboard that he has like X's and O's you're on on.

121
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,880
 The X's mean kisses.

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,320
 And he's totally in a pornography and he's doing this for 18 months and he ends up like

123
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,840
 filing for credit cards and being like, "Buy much porn and then he had no intention of

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
 paying off the credit card."

125
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,400
 He racked up $20,000 in porn debt, porn related debt in 18 months.

126
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,200
 So anyways, he basically is unemployable at this point.

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 He has a police record.

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
 All these creditors are coming after him.

129
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
 So he fumbled around from job to job.

130
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,240
 But he's like, "I gotta be a...

131
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,640
 Why am I at this mortgage lending office?

132
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,440
 I need to experience the world of porn."

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,320
 Because he's watching porn in the mortgage office.

134
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,560
 People are like, "Ugh, are you doing our paperwork?

135
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
 Because it looks like you're masturbating under the desk."

136
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
 And he's like, "I'm doing both.

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,840
 Actually, a man be dexterous."

138
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,120
 So he goes in 2006, he ends up in LA.

139
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,160
 He's intent on becoming a porn star.

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,560
 But what he becomes is a mope.

141
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
 So a mope is the lowest level porn performer.

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,560
 I had never heard of this term before, but apparently it's a huge insult in the porn

143
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,680
 industry.

144
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,600
 A mope is the lowest level of a porn performer.

145
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,920
 It's funny, I was reading this article, they were talking about the very first time that

146
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,240
 mopes were really essential to the pornography business.

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,000
 Because before, you would get the biggest, hunky-est stud, or the dude with the longest

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,680
 shlong, and you'd have sex with the hottest girl you could find available.

149
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
 And that's your porn movie.

150
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,960
 And it has scripts and plots and things like that.

151
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
 They used to have these huge plots.

152
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
 And everyone just fast-forwarded through anyways.

153
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,880
 But in the early 1990s, when people were looking for the next big thing in porn, some guy goes,

154
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,120
 "I got it.

155
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,120
 People have these plots and they have these devices and this thematic experience.

156
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,720
 How about if 200 dudes bang a woman in one day?"

157
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,560
 And so there's not 200 porn performers that are available on the same day in Southern

158
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,280
 California and, at least back then there wasn't, and are you going to get Ron Jeremy and Peter

159
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,120
 North and all these other big stars?

160
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,040
 No one starts to come out and be part of this circus act?

161
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
 No.

162
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
 These are professionals.

163
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,360
 This would be like if you got Brad Pitt and George Clooney to do community theater together,

164
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,040
 which sounds fabulous actually.

165
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,600
 The porn industry had become its own culture.

166
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,800
 And you had people just like there were people who are like Marvel nerds, people who are

167
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 Star Wars nerds.

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,640
 You have porn nerds that have alliances to different companies.

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,800
 It's bizarre.

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,880
 So they were able to go out into the general public and say, "Hey, do you want to bang

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,840
 a chick and be in this porn?"

172
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,680
 And you had just horny dude show up and then you just had people who really loved porn

173
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,560
 and wanted to be part of the industry.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,320
 And this gang bang, it was like 250 guys had sex with this chick.

175
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,940
 And that was the beginning of the mope culture.

176
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,600
 You could not get a star to do this stuff.

177
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,760
 You couldn't get a star to smell armpits.

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,080
 You couldn't get a star to suck on toes.

179
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,880
 You couldn't get a star to do all sorts of crazy stuff, get kicked in the balls.

180
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,040
 But there was a market for this porn, so they started just hiring mopes.

181
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,280
 People who would do the lowest thing possible.

182
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,800
 Now, you may have a movie or something like that where there is a porn star and is part

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
 of it.

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
 He's licking her feet.

185
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 I don't know.

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 I'm sure that exists.

187
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,960
 I'm sure that's not lost media.

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,520
 But if it was just a video house where that's all they did was foot fetish videos, you're

189
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,280
 not getting a name brand star for that.

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,560
 One, you don't have to pay them because the guy's not important.

191
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
 It's the feet.

192
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
 And two, just hire a mope.

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
 But mopes hate being mopes.

194
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,960
 They all want to be the stars.

195
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,360
 That's why you're in the industry.

196
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,400
 Now, on the set of a gang bang, Steve Driver is sitting there and he's like, they jerk

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,760
 off while they're waiting to have sex with this lady.

198
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,240
 And so there's like 10, 15 dudes in this room.

199
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
 And so he's in the industry.

200
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,560
 He's not just like looking in through a stained window, like Tiny Tim seeing a Christmas ham.

201
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,200
 He's actually like in the industry, but he's a mope.

202
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,240
 And he thinks, oh, at any moment I'm going to be discovered.

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,360
 And during this gang bang, he discovers the meaning of true friendship.

204
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:01,160
 When he meets Herbert Hin Wong, aka Tom Dong, that was his stage name, Tom Dong.

205
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,320
 And they realize that they both, other than just being in this shit together, they come

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,680
 to a epiphany, they both love porn more than just even the average actor.

207
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,400
 Like they're really into the industry.

208
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,760
 So they start hanging out as buddies.

209
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,360
 Now you have Tom Dong and Steve Driver trying to make their way through the industry.

210
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,480
 The problem is, is that pornography is very, very racist.

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,720
 And Steve Driver was biracial and Tom Dong is Asian.

212
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,680
 And so no one wants this.

213
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,760
 So let me kind of explain a little bit more about who Steve Driver is because he is a

214
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,040
 biracial man.

215
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,440
 He's a big buff dark skin dude.

216
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,600
 And so people keep wanting him to be these gangsters, these thugs in these porn movies.

217
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,320
 He's a nerd.

218
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,600
 This guy, this predates the term in-sell, but he's 100% an in-sell.

219
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 All he wanted in life was fame and recognition.

220
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,200
 And the only reason he wanted that, because he wanted female love.

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,360
 That was his entire motivating thing.

222
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,800
 If we become rich and famous, Tom Dong will get all the women we want.

223
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,080
 They can't stay away from us.

224
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,120
 He's in the porn industry.

225
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
 He's actively having sex.

226
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,960
 But for an in-sell, a lot of times you go, "Well, just get laid."

227
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,120
 For someone who's an in-sell, it's the lack of emotional connection to another person,

228
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,560
 specifically of the opposite sex or of what sex they're attracted to.

229
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
 That's what drives them.

230
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,400
 You can pay money and have sex with a prostitute.

231
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
 Any in-sell could have sex.

232
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,080
 That's not really the complaint about in-sells.

233
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,880
 It's not just about them not having sex.

234
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,960
 It's about them not being able to forge a connection with another human being.

235
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,640
 It's someone they find attractive.

236
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,000
 And that's what drives that fire.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,520
 Having sex, you can have sex, either in a criminal way, which is awful, or by paying

238
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,800
 for it, which is technically still criminal, but whatever, or by dating someone.

239
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,920
 The sex is the easy part.

240
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,440
 It's that human connection.

241
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,960
 And that's what Steve Driver wants.

242
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,760
 Now, he's finding that in Tom Dong.

243
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
 He's finding that connection in Tom.

244
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
 He has a friend.

245
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,160
 But Steve Driver and Tom Dong, they're in an industry where they're basically broken

246
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,800
 down into, "Oh, you're the Asian guy, so we're going to have you be the Japanese tourist

247
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,520
 who's like, you're getting cucked as this black gangbanger, like, grabs this woman

248
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
 in front of you."

249
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 Because they were a package deal.

250
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,320
 They walked around calling themselves the Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan of porn.

251
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
 And it's a really exciting name.

252
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,640
 You're imagining they're going to be able to at least do stunts, right?

253
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,840
 The other problem is, is despite going uphill in the racism and pornography, Steve Driver

254
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,800
 is not a gangbanger.

255
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,120
 He looks the part, but he is a total nerd.

256
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,800
 He is obsessed with ninja movies, with samurai movies.

257
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,280
 He is all about nerd culture.

258
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,760
 And he keeps getting called out for being a nerd and not being a real black person.

259
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
 And it's cutting him to the core.

260
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,000
 Because this is, people who are telling him this, or people, he wants to be in this industry

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,680
 and they're saying, "You're a dork."

262
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,240
 And the other big problem Steve Driver had was personal hygiene issues.

263
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,120
 And hated working with him because he smelled like poop.

264
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,040
 He smelled like body odor.

265
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,680
 This one actress said, "I didn't have a car and Steve Driver drove to pick me up to take

266
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,040
 me to the shoot."

267
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
 She goes, "I got it.

268
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,400
 I never driven in his car before."

269
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
 She goes, "I got it in the car."

270
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,000
 And the smell of body odor was so overpowering.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,160
 He drove a block and I got out of the car and I just walked to the set.

272
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,200
 I cannot even imagine being in this car any longer with this dude.

273
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,920
 Now we've all had coworkers, I can't say we all have, but a lot of us have had coworkers

274
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,440
 who have hygiene issues, body odor issues.

275
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,760
 I'm not banging them.

276
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,240
 I'm not banging them at the call center.

277
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,720
 So this was all the clothes are taken off and the smell is even more pungent.

278
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,080
 When these women are getting paid $500 to bang the dude, the director tells them to bang,

279
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,280
 but they would go up afterwards and be like, "I please don't make me do any more shoots

280
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
 with Steve."

281
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,160
 He's super disgusting.

282
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,600
 He's so gross.

283
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,280
 He creeped people out.

284
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,800
 He was too smelly to have sex with.

285
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,880
 And he would come up with these bizarre plans.

286
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,160
 One of them was keeping Tom Dong next to him.

287
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,640
 Him and Tom Dong had formed this friendship and he keeps telling Tom, "We're going to

288
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
 make it.

289
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
 We're going to make it together.

290
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
 We're going to be doing all these big movies.

291
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
 We're going to be on the box covers.

292
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 I got a four face plan.

293
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
 We're going to do this thing."

294
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,720
 And Tom, listen, Tom wasn't built for this industry either.

295
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,800
 Tom was not built for this industry either.

296
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,080
 He wasn't the most well endowed man.

297
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,720
 He's also facing this issue with the racism.

298
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,840
 And he has a second job.

299
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,040
 He's like a very quiet guy.

300
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,720
 He's like an IT guy.

301
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,400
 He was better prepared for what the world had to offer.

302
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,080
 He found Steve's zest for life, zest for porn refreshing.

303
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,080
 This was kind of seemed to be like a secret he was hiding.

304
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,800
 That he loved this so much and Steve Driver just relished in it.

305
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,280
 So it was just like this magnetic combination.

306
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,140
 So he kept coming up with these plans and things like that.

307
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
 So that's good.

308
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
 It's going to be motivated.

309
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,280
 But then one of the most bizarre things in this story is his gimmick.

310
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:35,020
 So Steve Driver said, "Okay, I'm not a mope, but I am an extra on a porn set that also

311
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,720
 happens to clean up the splooge on the ground and do all these menial tasks in between shoots.

312
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,720
 But I'm not a mope.

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,400
 And I'm going to have my signature move.

314
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,640
 I'm going to have a signature mope.

315
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
 I'm not mope.

316
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,080
 I'm going to have a signature move for sex performer."

317
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,280
 And what he would do was he would be having sex with women.

318
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,840
 Oh yeah, take it.

319
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
 Oh yeah, baby.

320
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
 Oh yeah.

321
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
 Oh.

322
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
 Oh.

323
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 Oh.

324
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
 Monster hands.

325
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:07,640
 And he would all of a sudden be wearing giant Frankenstein hands.

326
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,600
 Like you know those Hulk gloves?

327
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 He would do that.

328
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 And people are like, "What are you cut?

329
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 Cut.

330
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
 What are you doing?

331
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,840
 Why are you showing it with monster hands all of a sudden?"

332
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,440
 This became his gimmick.

333
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,520
 He would show up on the shoots of porn.

334
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,320
 I don't know how this guy had any work at this point.

335
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,240
 He would show up on porn sets and he'd be banging chicks.

336
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,360
 And then as he was ejaculating, as he was coming, he would have on monster hands and

337
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,760
 scream out "monster hands!"

338
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,840
 And then there was a quote from one of the actresses.

339
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,600
 She goes, "It was absolutely bizarre."

340
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,080
 You don't need a quote for that, right?

341
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,040
 But she was like, "He would sit there and want to finger bang us with these rubber gloves

342
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,280
 and go to the dollar store."

343
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,080
 And I was like, "These werewolf hands with fur and everything."

344
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,720
 And the director would be like, "Maybe someone's into it."

345
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,920
 So apparently, I looked for this footage.

346
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,520
 There's footage of him finger banging random porn stars with these gloves and him screaming

347
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,120
 out monster hands as he's ejaculating into these women.

348
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,040
 Let me read you this quote too from an actress to sum up his story.

349
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,560
 This is from Alana Evans.

350
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
 She was the co-star.

351
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,520
 She was Palin in Palin.

352
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,040
 Erection 2007 was the name of that movie.

353
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,160
 "He was one of the new type of guys.

354
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,320
 He wasn't strong or dominant.

355
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,640
 He was scared.

356
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 He struggled in his scenes.

357
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,600
 I knew he'd never be the next Lexington Steel.

358
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,680
 He'd rarely talk to the women.

359
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:40,760
 He was a total nerd."

360
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,680
 Porn industry, any sort of industry like this is hard enough.

361
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,040
 You always feel like an outsider when you're coming in, but he got no respect from the

362
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
 actors.

363
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,840
 He got no respect from the producers or the directors or anyone involved in the industry.

364
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,840
 The only person who was ever really nice to him for any long period of time was Tom Dong.

365
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,680
 At a certain point, they get a pretty sweet deal as far as being a mope goes.

366
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,680
 They sign up with a company called Ultima DVD.

367
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,240
 And Ultima DVD, I guess this might be standard in the porn industry for mopes, but they'll

368
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
 see.

369
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,040
 Tell you what, you can work for our company, we'll pay you $50 a scene, and this is a sweet

370
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 deal.

371
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
 Don't get me wrong.

372
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,840
 And room and board.

373
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,360
 So we'll give you a place that is expensive to live in Los Angeles.

374
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,320
 We got some rooms in the back.

375
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
 You guys can stay in.

376
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,480
 During the day, you do menial work, you mop up the floor, you clean off sex toys, stuff

377
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
 like that.

378
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:42,440
 And then when we need you, you bang these chicks or other things and you'll get paid.

379
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
 So this was awesome.

380
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,320
 Actually, Tom Dong found out about this first and then introduced Steve Driver to it.

381
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,960
 So let's do this.

382
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
 We room and board.

383
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
 We're just going to sit in the back.

384
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,280
 We're going to be banging chicks.

385
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,960
 But Ultima DVD was a fetish DVD studio.

386
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,960
 So there wasn't a lot of having sex with women.

387
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,160
 There was a lot of them getting kicked in the nuts.

388
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,920
 There was a lot of them sucking on toes, smelling armpits, all this stuff that is general mope

389
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,540
 stuff.

390
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,760
 But Steve Driver still sees this as a ticket to the big time.

391
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,000
 At this point, Tom is getting a little suspicious and he seems to be like, "This is the lane

392
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I'm in."

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,240
 There's a great quote from the movie, Mope, where Steve Driver is trying to encourage

394
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,160
 Tom to keep going along with the dreams and he goes, "We can do what we love to do."

395
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,480
 And Tom Dong says, "I suck at what I love to do most in the world."

396
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,400
 I'm like, that's a really powerful line and I think a lot of people can relate to that.

397
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,840
 Something you really, really, really, really love but you're just no good at it.

398
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
 And Tom realizes that.

399
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,840
 Tom realizes he doesn't have the constitution, doesn't have the physicality to be a porn

400
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,560
 star but maybe he can eke out a existence in the porn industry.

401
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,120
 Again, he has another job.

402
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,400
 This is like fun for him.

403
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,640
 But this is Steve Driver's main thing.

404
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,000
 But this whole thing with Ultimate DVD starts to go sideways because the problem is they're

405
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,800
 living in the studio and the producers and the directors are now seeing close up what

406
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,360
 a lunatic Steve Driver is.

407
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,360
 In Monster Hands aside, he's just a force of chaos in the studio and he's not worth

408
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
 it.

409
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 He's not worth it.

410
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,840
 He's not a name brand.

411
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,880
 His stupid Monster Hands, his stupid body odor, they just go, "You know what?

412
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,520
 We're just going to have to cut him loose."

413
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,760
 Tom, you can stay with us.

414
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,920
 Tom, you're actually really helpful around here.

415
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,200
 Apparently he did some IT work for him.

416
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,640
 Steve Driver tried doing some IT work and they had to scrap the whole page and start

417
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
 over.

418
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
 He couldn't do anything.

419
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,000
 So they go, "We're just going to have to evict Steve."

420
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,100
 And you can start to see the friendship fray here as well.

421
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,480
 Does he stay the Jackie Chan to Chris's Steve Driver?

422
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,720
 Does he try to make his way in the industry alone?

423
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,520
 Does he just give up on all of it?

424
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,440
 And he's able to kind of rationalize this out.

425
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,680
 Steve though knows that the House of Cards is about to fall.

426
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,480
 And really, he never saw it as a House of Cards, right?

427
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,760
 He saw it as Brick by Brick building his legacy, but something in his brain is starting to

428
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,920
 click in.

429
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,840
 The walls are closing around him.

430
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,480
 The owner of Ultimate DVD says, "We've got to get rid of him.

431
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
 Let's get rid of Steve.

432
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
 We're just going to evict him."

433
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,440
 Christopher Ricale, he was the studio manager.

434
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,920
 He was the guy who managed the studio for the owner.

435
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,040
 He gets Christopher to go, "You've got to go fire Steve."

436
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,760
 He's like, "Oh man, that guy, Steve was thinking I don't want to go anywhere near him."

437
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,120
 Well, we got to get him out of here.

438
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,640
 He's just too much of a mess.

439
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,720
 So on June 1, 2011, Christopher walks into this room where Steve is sitting there on

440
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:53,280
 the couch and he's watching a scene from Kingdom of Heaven, that Ridley Scott Crusader movie.

441
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,480
 And Christopher is walking in and he's like, "Hey Steve, we need to talk."

442
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,920
 And he's watching Steve just watch this scene from Kingdom of Heaven and he keeps rewinding

443
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,320
 it and starting the scene over again.

444
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,120
 It's a battle scene.

445
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,600
 This guy is running around with his sword.

446
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,240
 He's cleaving other people and he's just watching this over and over again.

447
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,120
 And Christopher is like, "Dude, I know that movie is good.

448
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,280
 At least the director's cut is supposed to be good, but you need to shut it off.

449
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
 You need to get out of here.

450
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
 It's time.

451
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,600
 We've given you tons of warnings.

452
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,840
 It's time to go."

453
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,320
 And Steve's just sitting there and he goes, "Why don't you come over and sit on this couch

454
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 with me, man?

455
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 Come over.

456
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
 Let's watch this movie."

457
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
 And he goes, "No.

458
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,920
 I'm over here because you're so smelly.

459
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
 You need to leave.

460
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,000
 Pack up your stuff and get out of here.

461
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
 You're done.

462
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
 Come over here, Chris.

463
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
 Come over here.

464
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
 Just take a seat."

465
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
 And Christopher eventually gets annoyed that this guy isn't doing what he's saying.

466
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,680
 That's kind of what he expected.

467
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,760
 He's such trouble, Steve Driver, to begin with.

468
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,120
 So Christopher begins walking over to the couch and he kind of walks a bit near him to

469
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,640
 get in front of him.

470
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,920
 And as Christopher is walking past Steve, Steve reaches into the couch.

471
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:02,680
 And between the couch cushions pulls out one of Ultimate DVD's props.

472
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,840
 Now, remember, they do ball busting videos.

473
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,520
 They do armpit sniffing videos and things like that.

474
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,200
 One of the videos that they were known for was fake castration videos.

475
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,680
 And for that, you'd have a sexy woman with this very dull samurai sword.

476
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,120
 And she would pretend to chop your nuts off.

477
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,680
 Who gets off to this?

478
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,320
 I don't know, right?

479
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 But on set, there was a samurai sword.

480
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,120
 It was part of the props.

481
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,400
 And Steve and Driver is always picking it up and playing with him.

482
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 People were like, "Dude, put it away."

483
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,960
 But he loved everything martial arts.

484
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,400
 So when he pulls this samurai sword out from between the cushions, Christopher thinks,

485
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,800
 "What in the world?"

486
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,440
 "Steve Driver's totally lost it.

487
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,640
 He's going to swing this prop."

488
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,520
 And sure enough, Steve Driver, this huge muscular dude, swings this prop and hits Christopher

489
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:02,280
 so hard in his left shoulder, Christopher's arm almost falls off.

490
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,760
 He had sharpened the blade.

491
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,640
 He had turned this prop sword into a deadly weapon.

492
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,080
 Christopher's totally in shock about what's going on.

493
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,480
 They're just the shock of someone hitting you with something you thought was a toy.

494
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,920
 And it cutting so deep his arms just hanging on there.

495
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,680
 That when Steve swings again, Christopher goes to grab the sword.

496
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,280
 And that's when it hits him.

497
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,920
 Not literally, not when the sword hits him because it does.

498
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,840
 But when he grabs the blade of the sword and he blocks the blow, but then he looks at his

499
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,280
 hand and he can see the tendons.

500
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,880
 The shock of being chopped up while he's still alive is wearing off.

501
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,000
 He's no longer in shock.

502
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,780
 He knows he's about to die.

503
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,880
 He's starting to feel all of this energy, all this panic, all this rage.

504
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,920
 He's screaming out loud.

505
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,320
 Next door there was a business because this was like an industrial business and Yuri

506
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,960
 Drell was a business owner who lived next door.

507
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
 He hears the screaming.

508
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,120
 A bunch of people in the studio are here to scream because this is a port studio and they

509
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,240
 seem to be running almost 24 hours a day.

510
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,640
 So a bunch of people are there.

511
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,760
 And one of those people is Tom Dong.

512
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,260
 And they hear the screaming coming from the room that Steve Driver was staying in and

513
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,900
 Tom Dong was staying in.

514
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,740
 And Tom most likely knew he was getting evicted that day.

515
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:32,260
 They go running down the hallway and they enter this room and they see Chris bleeding

516
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,740
 out.

517
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,500
 And Steve over him with this sword getting ready to make another swing and they begin

518
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,260
 pleading with Steve.

519
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,580
 Don't do it.

520
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
 Don't please, please.

521
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,180
 And they're getting through to Steve.

522
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,720
 He's thinking about it and he starts to lower the blade.

523
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,600
 And there's a moment where everything seems to be going okay.

524
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,920
 And in this moment, someone in the group of rescuers, you had the owner of the studio,

525
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,080
 Eric Jover.

526
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,440
 You had Yuri Drell who was the businessman from next door and then you had Tom Dong.

527
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,720
 In the moment when tempers are starting to fade, one of them pulls out their cell phone

528
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,500
 and dials 9, 1.

529
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,380
 And when Steve Driver realizes that he's been betrayed yet again, that they're calling

530
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:27,300
 the police, he raises that sword high above his head and begins charging the three rescuers.

531
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:33,100
 They begin taking off down this tiny hallway and there is one single door leading to outside.

532
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,420
 Pornography studios are not known for keeping up to fire code.

533
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,460
 There's a single door and they're running down this hallway and Steve Driver's right

534
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,360
 behind him with this samurai sword.

535
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,440
 And when they get to the door, there's a pile up.

536
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
 They can only go through it one at a time.

537
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,760
 Eric Jover jumps out the door first, Yuri Drell jumps out the door second, and Yuri

538
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 said I was three feet out that door when I heard Tom get butchered behind me.

539
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:12,140
 He said I just heard a high pitched squeal and I turned around.

540
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,300
 Here's a quote from Yuri Drell, quote, "Tom was bleeding everywhere.

541
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,920
 He was cut at the waist and his elbow was cut to the bone.

542
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,540
 He was turning purple."

543
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:37,000
 Yuri in a rage jumps towards Steve and actually makes Steve push back and hit a wall, throws

544
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,760
 him off his footing for a second, but then Steve, who actually did train as a martial

545
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,360
 artist as a child, regains his footing, takes that sword and slashes Yuri's shoulder open.

546
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,400
 Yuri then runs out of the building.

547
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,880
 Steve Driver hops in his RAV4, sees the owner of the studio, Eric, in an alleyway, tries

548
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,240
 to run him over.

549
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,980
 But after missing him, just takes off into the LA night.

550
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,660
 Christopher was taken to the hospital, he was totally fine but had some gnarly injuries.

551
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,540
 Tom died.

552
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,100
 Tom did not make it.

553
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:21,940
 Tom Dong, the only man who ever showed Steve any respect, any love, any compassion, was

554
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,740
 murdered by him.

555
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,000
 Tom was slaughtered in a hallway of a porn studio.

556
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,160
 The man who stood by him this entire time was now lying dead.

557
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,520
 And Steve and Samurai Sword was stained with his best friend's blood.

558
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
 Three days later, this is a big manhunt, right?

559
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,940
 Because obviously it's a shocking story.

560
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,680
 This was all over the media back in 2011.

561
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:57,380
 You had the salaciousness of porn stars and then you had just a murder, his bizarre weapon.

562
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,480
 Everything was so Hollywood about it.

563
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,860
 So the police are looking for this guy.

564
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,980
 Who knows what he's going to do next?

565
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:09,740
 And someone spots his RAV4 out at the Chatsworth Nature Preserve.

566
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,940
 So the police show up, they encircle the area, they send in SWAT.

567
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:23,400
 So there is Steve Driver, a hot LA afternoon, standing on a cliff overlooking the city of

568
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:32,840
 Los Angeles, holding a Samurai Sword as SWAT officers approach him.

569
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,120
 This is the way Steve and Driver wanted to end his life.

570
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,280
 One man, one blade against a horde of faceless enemies.

571
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,980
 He holds him at bay.

572
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,140
 They don't want to kill him.

573
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:51,060
 This man's obviously insane.

574
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,420
 He's holding that blade and he'd alternate between making threats to making threats to

575
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,860
 kill himself.

576
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,660
 I will fall on my blade.

577
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,180
 I'll do it.

578
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,940
 Stand back.

579
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,900
 This goes on for eight hours.

580
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,200
 And it's at a certain point where the SWAT officers are throwing water bottles to Steve.

581
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,400
 They're rolling him, and they're not throwing at him to hit him.

582
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
 They're rolling him on the dirt.

583
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
 They're like, "You need a drink.

584
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
 You need to take a drink.

585
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 It's super hot out here.

586
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
 It's June.

587
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
 It's Los Angeles."

588
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,600
 And he's just standing there with this Samurai Sword.

589
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
 This goes on for eight hours.

590
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,560
 And eventually the SWAT team goes, "We've got to end this.

591
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,920
 Let's get our less than lethal munitions.

592
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,600
 Maybe we'll hit him with a beanbag, taser, whatever.

593
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,860
 We've got to get that sword out of his hands, because that will kill at least one of us."

594
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,460
 It's very, very hard to take on a bladed opponent, even with a gun.

595
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,180
 And he's at the edge of the cliff and he's watching them, and then he knows this is the

596
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,660
 end.

597
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,300
 So he turns and he looks out at the city.

598
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,460
 His back is now to the SWAT officers.

599
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,900
 And with that sword in his hand, he sits down on the edge of the cliff, and then he pushes

600
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,920
 himself off.

601
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,840
 He falls 30 feet until he hits a rocky outcropping.

602
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,240
 He hits it with such force that the sword goes flying out of his hand, and he cartwheels

603
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,040
 another 20 feet, kicking up dust and debris.

604
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,320
 He lays there at the bottom of the cliff, slowly dying.

605
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,980
 By the time the ambulance loads him up, he's already dead.

606
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:49,740
 Later, this case was so notorious that a porn studio bought a bunch of their clips of Tom

607
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:57,500
 Dong and Steve Driver, and they created the movie "Pornosamurai Killer."

608
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,220
 They're both on the cover, both standing there banging chicks.

609
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,920
 In a twilight zone-esque way, they finally got the recognition they wanted.

610
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,280
 But I think Tom Dong would have been okay with just being a mope, or even just working

611
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,720
 IT for these porn companies.

612
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
 I think that was enough for him.

613
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,680
 Steve Driver needed to be famous.

614
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,000
 He needed to be remembered.

615
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,960
 He needed to be loved.

616
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,200
 And even in the end, people forgot about this story.

617
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,980
 It's just become a curiosity of Hollywood.

618
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,100
 Look at the bizarre underbelly of the porn industry.

619
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:46,220
 Even after taking the life of his best friend and co-worker, and then killing himself live

620
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,940
 on camera, by the way.

621
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,220
 The way I found out about this story was I was looking at a Wikipedia list of people

622
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,540
 who were killed on camera.

623
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,900
 And one of them was Stephen Clancy Hill.

624
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
 I was reading all of them.

625
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,160
 That was the only one that seemed to be notable, or that I hadn't heard of.

626
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
 Stephen Clancy Hill.

627
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
 There was a news crew at the bottom of the cliff.

628
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,040
 The standoff was going on for eight hours.

629
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,280
 And so you see it, and they show it in the movie.

630
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,920
 The movie ends with the actual footage of him dying.

631
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,640
 Bizarre choice for the director.

632
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,680
 I think that may turn off some viewers.

633
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,800
 The movie is really...

634
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 The movie's a comedy.

635
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,840
 Actually, the movie's a very, very funny comedy.

636
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,880
 And it's true, they take some details and they kind of create an amalgamation of all

637
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,860
 of his attempted girlfriends and turned it into a homeless girl named Tampa.

638
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,820
 So they make some choices like that.

639
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,020
 I really recommend watching Mope.

640
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
 Just to see...

641
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:41,500
 I don't think I can convey the true brotherly love of Steve Driver and Tom Dong as well

642
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,300
 as those two actors could.

643
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,220
 I think I've kind of done a disservice to their friendship.

644
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,020
 I think I've kind of glossed over it.

645
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
 They were best buddies.

646
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,220
 This was Huck Sawyer and Tom Finn.

647
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
 Wait.

648
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,300
 This was Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer.

649
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,840
 These were best buddies.

650
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
 Han Solo and Luke.

651
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:02,640
 I should have included all that before the revelation that he murdered Tom Dong.

652
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,080
 I still recommend watching the movie.

653
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,400
 It's a brilliant piece of work and it's just such an amazing...

654
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,440
 The movie's so good and the story is so tragic.

655
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,600
 It's a fascinating story.

656
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,200
 It really is a fascinating true crime story.

657
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,120
 The movie, I personally think, ranks up there with Joker as far as a look into this type

658
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
 of personality.

659
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
 And this is real.

660
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,540
 This is an absolutely real story.

661
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:31,500
 Fascinating, fascinating look at a subculture and a fascinating look at a man who really

662
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,780
 in the end all he wanted was...

663
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,860
 He wanted to do something he loved, which everyone does.

664
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,260
 Everyone wants to have a job that they enjoy.

665
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,740
 He wanted to be loved himself.

666
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,300
 He was lacking that.

667
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,620
 He was lacking that warm affectionate hug from a woman.

668
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,240
 Now he was an owed vat society didn't owe him that and he didn't know how to get vats.

669
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,760
 He just saw images of this distorted images through the world of pornography.

670
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,080
 And even though he was actively having sex, he was an in-cell.

671
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,480
 He couldn't forge a romantic relationship with someone who was a woman.

672
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,120
 He just couldn't do it.

673
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,720
 He couldn't see that it was him.

674
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,400
 It was his own failings.

675
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
 Things he could fix.

676
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,280
 Instead he just kept doubling down on this dream of being famous.

677
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,380
 So it wouldn't matter how bad his personality was.

678
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,140
 It wouldn't matter how bad he smells.

679
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,740
 If he was rich and famous, if he was the number one porn star, women would want him despite

680
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,860
 him not having to work on himself.

681
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
 Fascinating story.

682
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,380
 Just a narcissistic personality with a samurai sword on the day he's about to be evicted

683
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,300
 and fired.

684
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:44,340
 What do you think is going to happen?

685
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,780
 He's a real life supervillain.

686
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,740
 This is the movie Joker.

687
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,760
 Except he doesn't get away and start a cult at the ending of it.

688
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,600
 He has a showdown with armed SWAT officers and then kills himself by jumping off a cliff

689
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,760
 while holding a samurai sword.

690
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
 That's nuts.

691
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,640
 That's absolutely insane.

692
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,360
 There's no continuity to it.

693
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,000
 There's no world building or the Steve Driver Cinematic Universe where they have to do

694
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 multiple sequels.

695
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,200
 That's the end of the story and to me that's just more intriguing than anything that Hollywood

696
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,400
 could pump out.

697
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
 Fascinating.

698
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
 Fascinating story.

699
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
 We've run out of time.

700
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,260
 We're going to save the alternate universe story for tomorrow.

701
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,220
 Idea guy, I'm going to have you back so we can make sure you fly that carbonar copter.

702
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,660
 We'll have you back tomorrow.

703
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,620

707
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,740

708
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,460
 Have a great one, guys.

709
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,460
 Bye.

710
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:50,460
 Bye.

711
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:57,460
 Bye.
