00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, where we listen to some

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,080
 classic episodes with new intros. Now I'm gonna tell you guys this right off the bat. I have not

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
 listened to this episode. I recorded it, you're like Jason, you recorded it. Like in a sense, yes,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,880
 my voice said it, my ears heard what I was saying, and I edited it obviously, but I have not listened

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,960
 to this episode in two years. I know it because I lived through it, but it's one of those episodes

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,840
 that was difficult for me to record, it was difficult for me to edit, it's not a fun episode for me to

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,960
 listen to, but I think it's one of those core episodes at Dead Rabbit Radio. Now I talked about

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,520
 this before when I do personal episodes, they tend to be the ones I don't listen to the most,

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,080
 because not only have I experienced the events, but I've thought about the events over the years.

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,800
 Long before I had the podcast, I would still, my mind would still dwell on these events,

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,760
 and that's why so many of the details are so fresh and raw for me. So I'm specifically talking about

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,240
 the marquee story of this one, the Solar Plexus Clown Gliders, which is an conspiracy iceberg

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,720
 term, and I kind of take that and go with the thing that I think, if these things are real,

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,760
 and I kind of tell this story about this thing that psychically may have, it's a really, really weird

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,400
 story, it's probably one of my most personal episodes. I've talked about like,

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,800
 "Oh, I was here," and then like the mummy started chasing me, or "It was a dark and spooky night,

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,320
 and a shadow man crawled out of his" I've talked about stories like, apparently in Vincent Price,

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
 now I've talked about stories of me having paranormal encounters. This one took place over

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,640
 the course of years, and I watched my life spiral out of control as I was just enveloped in pain,

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,160
 and physical pain, and mental pain, and that's why I don't really like listening to the episode

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,680
 again. It's a period of my time where I had some great friends, had some great experiences,

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,200
 but there was that fog of pain over all of it, and now you know it's funny because I'm much older

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,800
 now than when this episode took place, but, and I'm in pain still, I'm doing jiu-jitsu,

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440
 my neck hurts, my shoulders hurt, like everything from my ears to my waist is in pain right now,

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,080
 because it was a crazy day training today, and then I throw 20 pounds on my backpack,

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,680
 and I'm walking everywhere, and all this stuff every time I turn my neck, but the pain is different

27
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,240
 because mentally I'm in a different place. The pain is actually probably as painful

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,440
 as it was back then, but one, I know this is temporary pain, and two, I'm in a different

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:55,280
 place mentally. I'm in a different place mentally. So, which is good, which is a good thing, right?

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,120
 So, I think it's an interesting episode, I think, I remember two when this episode came out,

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
 because we're talking episode 69, so I did not have a lot of listeners back then,

32
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,800
 not a lot of listeners at all. I remember, and over the year this episode came out about two

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,920
 years ago, I've gotten the occasional email from someone saying, I think one of these attached

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:26,320
 itself to me as well, I'm lost in a sea of dark emotions, I'm not getting letters from my chemical

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,400
 romance, but basically people saying they're struggling with these things, how do you get

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 out of them and stuff like that, and I've kind of counseled these people, they all seem to be doing

37
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,120
 well, but yeah, it's just a weird, it's weird for that, it's weird because it's a deeply personal

38
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,880
 episode where I'm talking about me being in pain and me being horribly depressed, but it's all,

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,640
 let's not forget this story too, it starts off with a story about the sunspot solar observatory,

40
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,360
 remember that? Where the observatory got shut down and the helicopter showed up and the FBI

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
 agents were swarming it and it was gone to mainstream media, like what's going on, I did an

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,640
 episode on that, and then this was the follow-up episode where I go, oh they found a guy accessing

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,560
 child porn, and again, I have not heard this episode in two years, so, but I believe, correct me

44
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,280
 from wrong, but I'm pretty sure in the episode I say this could be a cover story, because that's

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,080
 such a gross allegation, people really don't want to look into it, we'll see what happens,

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,440
 we'll see if I can find any more information, I believe that I say that I just went back to Google

47
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,560
 and looked into it and there's still no information who this guy was, court dates, sentencing, so it

48
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:52,080
 most likely was a cover story, weird man, weird, the sunspot solar observatory is one of those

49
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,840
 things that gets lost among all the stupid conspiracy theories about lizard people and

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,320
 coronavirus turning people into bat soup and then China's burning them and then using the ashes to

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,360
 create more coronavirus, this story, and I think like in this episode I'm like, oh it was probably

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,960
 just this, and this is one thing, when you're even a skeptic has to go, maybe I was wrong about that,

53
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,080
 because we should have had more information, court transcripts, things like that by now,

54
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,200
 but it's just gone, so, or it could just be that that was the real thing and then people just

55
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,680
 stopped paying attention to it, who knows, the whole story was weird, whole story was weird,

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,920
 and it's back, the observatory's back open, you can go there, check it out, I wouldn't recommend

57
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,840
 using their wi-fi, but other than that, it's just that's bizarre, the solar plexus clown glider

58
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,880
 story is bizarre, this one also has the dog vivisection one, that's a weird story, a weird

59
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,760
 historical story, and like I said before, I like telling those weird historical moments, so anyways,

60
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,680
 I'm rambling at this point, I hope you enjoy this episode, it is a little more serious and it's a

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,120
 kind of a very personal episode to me, but I hope you guys enjoy it, and if you are currently

62
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,480
 having some sort of emotional pain or physical pain or both or just depressed, maybe this episode

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,800
 will help you, because I got through it, and you can get through it too, you can get through it,

64
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
 I didn't believe it and it sounds trite when you're going through that, when other people

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
 tell you stuff like that, when I was in the middle of it and people would be like, oh,

66
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
 you'll get over it, they weren't that kind of sending, but you know what I mean, like,

67
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,920
 when you're in it, it's really hard, when you're in the valley, it's hard to see the sunset,

68
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,120
 but when you get to the peak, the sun never sets, because now you're like in Alaska maybe,

69
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,280
 and the sun sets every six months, I don't know, terrible analogy, but you know what's not terrible

70
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
 is episode 69, Solar Plexus Clown Gliders.

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,640
 The real reason why the Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down,

72
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:05,120
 United States has issues with Confederate statues, but that's nothing with what happened

73
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,080
 in England a hundred years ago, and finally we tackle an issue that has been highly requested,

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,480
 Solar Plexus Clown Gliders, and I think I might have seen one today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

75
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:31,920
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

76
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,760
 I'm having a great day, I hope you're having a great day too, we're going to dispense with a

77
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,240
 bunch of pleasantries, this episode's going to be coming out early because we have breaking news

78
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,360
 and I want to get to the forefront of it. The Washington Post reported just a few hours ago

79
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,160
 that the reason why the Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down was due to someone using the servers

80
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,200
 to not only download but distribute child pornography. The FBI has said that that is why

81
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,880
 they've gone into the area, the reason why the places were evacuated is because the suspect was

82
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,720
 the janitor, I haven't released his name yet because he hasn't been formally charged, but the

83
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,160
 suspect was the janitor working there, and for the past year he's been moving a laptop from

84
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,600
 room to room that he knows aren't really used during certain times of the year to download and

85
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,240
 upload child pornography. When a worker, like a scientist at the Sunspot Observatory, thought it

86
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,880
 was weird, saw the laptop in a room no one should be in and it was running, and he had seen, the

87
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,720
 scientists had seen the laptop kind of move from room to room every once in a while, he looked at

88
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:41,120
 it, and then he alerted the authorities and took the laptop. When the janitor came back looking,

89
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,160
 so then what happened was later on the scientists saw the janitor come out of the room where the

90
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,760
 laptop was previously and started acting a little odd saying, "Hey, was anyone in that office were

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,600
 missing some cleaning supplies?" and the scientists was like, "I don't know." And then the janitor began

92
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,320
 acting very frantically in their words and started talking about there might be a serial killer in

93
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,600
 the area and he was afraid that terrorists might hit the observatory and that someone may end up

94
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,320
 getting executed. So at that point, and like I had, like they had stated previously, the ARA group,

95
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,640
 the people who ran the Sunspot Solar Observatory, made the decision to pull the people out because

96
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,560
 of the way he was behaving. So that's why they cleared out the observatory and that's why they

97
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,480
 cleared out the post office. The FBI came in and were doing their investigation. There are still

98
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,880
 some unanswered questions, but I hope I have a couple answers for them. A lot of people are going,

99
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,040
 "Why was there a Black Hawk there for child pornography investigation?" Fair enough. Personally,

100
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,600
 I don't know how FBI rides into and out of locations. If they felt that it is a federal

101
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,000
 facility and if they felt that the danger was high enough, they may not have wanted to take

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,520
 vehicles and that was the best way of them to get up there. I mean, a Black Hawk helicopter is not

103
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,040
 really going to help against aliens either, but there could be a logical reason for that.

104
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,120
 There's been a lot of YouTube comments on my channel and a lot of just comments everywhere

105
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,280
 saying, "But this wasn't the only observatory shut down." Now, it was. I stated in the original

106
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,400
 episode that it was the only observatory shut down and then I got pushed back on that. Fair enough.

107
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,240
 I went and I did more research. I'll provide the links below. The other observatories that were

108
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,480
 being stated as being shut down have been down for quite a while. I think one was down for maintenance

109
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
 and the other ones were websites that had been offline for like a year or a couple months. These

110
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,000
 weren't new things. So those other observatories have been down for a while. They were, you know,

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
 there were reports saying all these observatories or cameras were shut off. They'd been shut off

112
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,680
 for a while. I think one, it just recently went down for maintenance. You have to remember,

113
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,080
 there's hundreds of these observatories around the world. So the fact that only six went offline

114
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,840
 you know, other people could do this work as well. Plus the big one in DC, which has the,

115
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,440
 which gets the information from the SOHO that has the golf instrument on it that we've talked about

116
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,120
 a couple times on the show. They were fully operational. So apparently that is why the FBI was

117
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:23,280
 investigating child pornography. Child pornography is, is, it actually can be used to cover up

118
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,240
 stories. There was the weapons inspector in Iraq who went against the official narrative and said

119
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,360
 that there were no mass weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Then they found child porn on his

120
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,760
 computer and he fought it. And he's like, I'm not that they put that on there. FBI put that on

121
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:47,600
 there to retaliate against, you know, it's an easy thing to take out a political or a really any

122
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,720
 opponent. You fled their computer with child porn. They lose a bunch of allies. That could be the

123
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,640
 case here. It's the perfect cover up. But I think that is the most logical explanation. I talked

124
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,280
 about that on my episode with solar observatory. I thought it may be some sort of criminal activity.

125
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:12,000
 I was thinking more towards drugs, but using someone else's server to upload and download

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,760
 pornography, child pornography in particular is definitely, you know, I, I, one of the crimes

127
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,920
 worse than cooking drugs out in the middle of nowhere. So this may be the end of it. I'm like

128
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,320
 I said also in that episode, this conspiracy will go on forever. People will keep saying no, no, no,

129
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,200
 it was aliens. It was this, it was that. But at a certain point, you have to look at the preponderance

130
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,240
 of evidence. If why aren't all of the observatory shut down? Why just that one? Because we know

131
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,760
 for sure it's just that one now. So a lot of those myths have been debunked about the other

132
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,000
 observatories being shut down and so on and so forth. So there we go. We can still keep looking

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,680
 into this. If any new information pops up, we'll cover it. But I wanted to go ahead and get that out.

134
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,480
 That is the official reason of why the Sunspot Solar Observatory in New Mexico is shut down.

135
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,560
 Crazy stuff. Crazy stuff. Wanted to guest it, but there we go. We're going to go ahead and move on

136
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,760
 to our next story. Now it's funny because I'm in America. We have listeners all over the world,

137
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,400
 and I don't know how much of the news got out from America to the rest of the world,

138
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,160
 but we've had a big controversy the past couple of years of tearing down statues of confederate

139
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,880
 leaders and confederate generals. I guess that's the same thing as leader, but they're tearing down

140
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,840
 these statues because they say it's a monument to hate. It's a reminder of racism. It's a really

141
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,840
 interesting topic politically and socially because it's a part of history. I get, I see both sides.

142
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,080
 It's a part of history and you don't want to forget history. It really smacks of 1984 and the

143
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,840
 Taliban blowing up the statues of the Buddhists, blowing up the statues of Buddha in Afghanistan.

144
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,800
 It's this real thing about destroying the past, renaming streets and schools and things like that.

145
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,920
 It's really odd. On the other hand, I get the idea that in certain parts of the country,

146
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,320
 we have these schools and streets and statues named after people who, one, not only tried to

147
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,640
 break America apart, but also were trying to uphold the institution of slavery.

148
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,880
 So I get both sides and it's not a particular issue that is divided strictly among race either.

149
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 There are a lot of black people who are like, "Oh, no, I'm cool with that statue. I don't have

150
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
 a problem with it. You know, I've lived in this area my entire life. My grandpa lived here. It's

151
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,720
 whatever. It's a statue." And then you have white people going, "No, no, you have to destroy it." So

152
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
 it's kind of a weird, very interesting issue. For the most part, they do get taken down.

153
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,200
 Once people start complaining, they're just like, "Ah, take it down." That is nothing.

154
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,800
 That is nothing compared to the Brown Dog Affair. So we're going to travel to England,

155
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,080
 Jolly Old England, as I like to refer to it in my show notes. And what we're going to look at

156
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:10,800
 is this horrific story. It's pretty sad. So back in 1902, at the University College London,

157
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,360
 there was a laboratory and they were doing a lot of vivisection. So that's where you basically,

158
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,800
 you cut the dog open. I think vivisection is where you cut the dog open while it's still alive.

159
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,080
 And dissection is where you cut something open after it's dead. And there's medical reasons to

160
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:34,480
 do both, obviously. But they had this little brown puppy, this little brown terrier. Skip ahead.

161
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,880
 Skip ahead, guys, if you're sensitive to dog stuff. I'm not going to get into too much detail, but

162
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,600
 I don't know how long this is going to run, maybe 10 minutes. Once you start hearing me talk about

163
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,160
 demonic clowns and all that stuff, you know you're in the right place. So they had this little brown

164
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,720
 terrier and they said, "Okay, this is for medical reasons. We're going to do this." They did a

165
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,160
 vivisection. They took out its pancreas and then sewed it back up. And they're like testing,

166
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,440
 doing testing, things like that. And it was still alive. Like they took the pancreas out and then

167
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,120
 they kept it alive. Then what they did later on was they go, "Okay, you know, now it's time for the

168
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:18,160
 next part of the test. We are going, now it's 1903, so it's a year later." They have a lecture hall

169
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,360
 with all these medical students standing there. And again, I'm not going to get into the details

170
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,720
 here, but they did another. They opened the animal backup, did some more stuff in there. It gets

171
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,760
 real graphic, but I'm not going to talk about that. Closed it back up, gave it to another researcher,

172
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,280
 and that researcher performed another procedure in the same room. You know, like, "Oh, here,

173
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:46,080
 I'm done with it. Here you go." And the other guy did another thing. And then they go, "Okay, well,

174
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,800
 they gave it to a third doctor and he stabbed it in the neck and killed it." Now in that audience

175
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,320
 was two women who were actually undercover. They were anti-vivisectionists. So there was a group

176
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,280
 of people, like we have PETA now, these people, because it was a big issue back then. A lot of

177
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,040
 vivisectionists were going on and there were special laws. One of the laws was that you could not

178
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,520
 perform more than two procedures on the same animal, which is interesting. And the other one was the

179
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:27,600
 dog had to be properly anesthetized. You need to be given enough anesthesia. And so they reported

180
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:36,160
 it. They left the lecture hall, totally grossed out, and basically reported it and wrote a book

181
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,800
 on it and contacted law enforcement and got a lawyer and all that stuff. And they said, you know,

182
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,560
 the doctor was like, "No, it was properly anesthetized. You don't have to worry about that." But

183
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:55,440
 they did break the law on doing the two procedures. And it was this big brouhaha back in England,

184
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,320
 because it really gave the anti-vivisectionists something to hold onto. It gave them this item.

185
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,960
 They're able to hold this dog up and say, "This is the horrible things that are going on." So now

186
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:13,440
 we're going to move ahead to 1906. And near the school, they erect, the anti-vivisectionists,

187
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,040
 erect a huge statue of a brown dog, big metalwork statue. And it says on the plaque, "In memory

188
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,280
 of the brown terrier dog done to death in the laboratories of university college in February

189
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,000
 1903, after having endured vivisection extending over more than two months and having been handed

190
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 over from one vivisector to another till death came to his release. Also in memory of the 232

191
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,600
 dogs vivisected at the same place during the year 1902, men and women of England, how long shall these

192
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,480
 things be?" So this statue stood there as this monument of what happened. And the scientists

193
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,800
 were like, "You guys are so superstitious. This creature doesn't have any soul. It's just a thing.

194
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,920
 You guys are totally trying to put all of this old world thinking. We're creating health. We're

195
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,680
 doing this so we can help people." And the anti-vivisectionists were like, "It's cruel. It's cruel.

196
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,120
 It's cruel." And scientists were like, "It's not cruel. It's just an animal. What are you going to do?"

197
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
 So this debate raged back and forth. But what happened was you have these young medical students

198
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,400
 and their college students. So they're going to get a little rowdy. They started to

199
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,920
 try to break the statue down with crowbars. They tried to destroy the statue to the point

200
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,720
 where they had to start stationing 24 hours a day seven police officers at the statue to prevent

201
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,360
 people from trying to destroy it. Because of that, because the scientists can no longer try to destroy

202
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:56,160
 the statue, 1,000 scientists, 1,000 students, medical students descended upon the statue one day.

203
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:04,000
 And at that point, they were met by anti-vivisectionists, by suffragettes, by trade unionists,

204
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,880
 socialists, and other progressive factions. Riot breaks out. They're battling over this multiple

205
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,480
 arrests. I think it took, I think I saw it was like 240 police officers had to get involved in the

206
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,000
 melee. They just, it was this huge fight. And it went on for a couple days from what I could see.

207
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,120
 There's an interesting quote here. It says, "The mainstream press was apparently largely

208
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,960
 supportive of the medical students, offering up mind blowing headlines like, 'Medical students

209
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,720
 gallant fight with women.'" So you had the media going, uh, that women are just being hysterical,

210
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,080
 you know, because they had, it was, there's a lot of women. You had the suffragettes and the

211
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,560
 anti-vivisectionists and things like that. And the scientists just wanted to get rid of the statue.

212
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:55,200
 And this went on for so long. So all of that started in 1906. The statue went up in 1907.

213
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,440
 The brown dog riots is what they were called, started. And then in 1910, the council, the

214
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,440
 Battersea Council, which oversaw the park, said, "You know what? We're done with this stupid statue."

215
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,440
 In the middle of the night, they sent four workers and 120 police officers to protect them.

216
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,400
 They took the statue down, gave it to someone, and it disappeared. They think it was Melton.

217
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,640
 As of today, there is a new statue. In 1982, a new statue went up in the area. So 80 years later,

218
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,680
 70 years later, they put up a new statue with pretty much the same plaque and it's a picture of

219
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,880
 a little dog. It's a much smaller statue where the old statue used to be, all that's left is

220
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,520
 like an indentation in the ground. And there's a sign on the fence nearby that says, "No dogs."

221
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,240
 And it's funny to think, like, I imagine a bunch of medical students, I know they weren't wearing

222
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,120
 like white coats and stethoscopes, but just like these college students fighting with

223
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,720
 suffragettes and the police like, "Oi, oi, oi, break it up, break it up. Don't make me wallop you."

224
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,960
 And, you know, all, just all like this craziness over a dog statue. And you know what's funny too,

225
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,000
 is now whenever I see a story about a Confederate statue being taken down, I'm just going to think

226
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,160
 of a bunch of scientists in white coats riding over a metal dog and, you know, a bunch of like

227
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:22,560
 terriers on the other side, like biting them on the ankles. It's like, you know what they need to do?

228
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,440
 They need to make, okay, let me pitch this to you real quick. I don't want this episode to go

229
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,000
 long, but let me pitch this to you real quick. Airbud MD. And MD stands for medical dog and he,

230
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,240
 Airbud, after done, he's done playing sports. He got a scholarship to play football in college.

231
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,440
 He ends up going to medical school and he finds out that the other Airbuds are in laboratories

232
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,680
 and they're going to be vivisected and he has to save them. And it's perfect because all the kids

233
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,880
 who grew up with Airbud, they're adults now. So it's a little edgiest little like dark retelling

234
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,520
 of the Airbud store, you know, like they love doing that. They love taking a normal franchise

235
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,240
 and giving it a grim dark feel. Airbud MD. And it could be at the ending, it'll be like,

236
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,880
 everything you saw in this movie is based on historical events. If you'd like to know more,

237
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,640
 please visit your library. And it would be, if we'd just be like peeing on scientists and like

238
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,800
 putting poop down and they'd be like, like slipping on it and stuff. And then like,

239
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,960
 he's rescuing the Airbuds. That would be awesome. Oh, oh, you know, and you can have a scene where

240
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,400
 Airbud actually like ties down a scientist and he picks up a scalpel and Airbud goes,

241
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,600
 hate to cut and run, but and then like all those guts come out, telling you million dollar,

242
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,800
 million dollar idea, million dollar idea, Airbud MD. Let's move on to the next story. Because the

243
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,160
 next story is from the conspiracy iceberg list. And the next story is something that people have

244
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,800
 been talking a lot about, requesting a lot about. Most of you guys have never heard of this. And

245
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:01,040
 it's a kind of an odd one. Like I said in the promo, if we accept that it's real, I might have

246
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:08,240
 seen one of them. So what this is, is this is something called a solar, a solar plexus clown

247
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,880
 glider. So a solar plexus clown glider is simply a phrase that appeared on the conspiracy iceberg

248
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,280
 list. And because of that, we have to go through a couple of different things real quick. The most

249
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,640
 likely explanation, people watch my videos and people mostly my videos and they go,

250
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,480
 what, you're an idiot that's totally made up. Listen, I get that. I get that a lot of these

251
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,960
 phrases are totally made up. I investigate them nonetheless. You know, the most obvious answer

252
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,720
 is solar plexus clown gliders is a joke. It was posted on the iceberg list as a dead end.

253
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,320
 It's a random collection of words. I get that. That doesn't make for an exciting episode or an

254
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,640
 entertaining episode. Because then right there I go, that's it. Dead rabbit radio, gmail. So we

255
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,520
 do extrapolate from that. But I fully understand that phrase is like golf rumors, the ocean at night,

256
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,520
 things like that. Ailish travel was able to be tracked down, but there are certain phrases that

257
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,200
 could just be made up. You know, I'll always address that as that. We will take that as a possibility

258
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,760
 and really the most likely possibility. Solar plexus clown gliders, first explanation is it's

259
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,680
 just a word stew. Means nothing. I've heard that it is a creepypasta from the Usenet days. So it's

260
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,360
 basically like an old lost scary story. I've searched this episode I've done probably about

261
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,160
 two or three weeks of research on and I've used all my internet tricks of like isolating time periods

262
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,240
 and doing all sorts of different definitions for the words and having to break the phrase up solar

263
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,760
 plexus clown glider, jester glider. I've done everything I could and I was setting parameters

264
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,080
 for when I could search and I couldn't find anything from showing a creepypasta written

265
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,560
 pre-2017, which is where the earliest phrase, the earliest use of this phrase, solar plexus

266
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:03,680
 clown gliders is August 19th, 2017. So it's very, very recent. It's the earliest I could find of this.

267
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:11,360
 There's a theory that it's an old hacking term. Again, couldn't find anything of it related to

268
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:19,200
 that prior to 2017. Now the two theories that were the most intriguing was one that it is a phrase

269
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,560
 that if you speak aloud or meditate on or think about for prolonged periods of time, it causes

270
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,720
 a mental breakdown. It is basically a tool that can be used to break down a human's mind. I was

271
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,360
 going that angle. The thing is, like I said, I spent three weeks prepping this story and I have not

272
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:44,560
 had a mental breakdown or really any ill effects and I've been focusing on this story exclusively

273
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,040
 on my free time. Looking up, looking this up hours and hours and hours into this and like I said,

274
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,920
 trying every variation. People have said you have to think about it while you're listening to a certain

275
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,560
 frequency, but that theory just came out yesterday, this morning, as I was on the paranormal board on

276
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,200
 X. Never heard the thing about the frequency, so I mean that could be an out, but like I said,

277
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,240
 I've heavily researched this and the only things I found about it being a phrase to reprogram your

278
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,080
 mind was on the 4-chan board. So that leaves us with our last and most compelling explanation.

279
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,600
 A solar plexus clown glider is another term for, and you're going to have, so here's where we get

280
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,760
 onto the crazy train guys. Solar plexus clown glider is another name for a interdimensional

281
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,240
 demon that latches onto your solar plexus like an infection. So after a ton of research on this,

282
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,480
 and I looked, I saw those couple, saw those five theories and I looked for other ones and really

283
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,960
 out of those, the one that I was able to find the most supporting quote unquote evidence for

284
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,440
 is the interdimensional demon. And they're specifically known as archons. Archons? Archons?

285
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,320
 Archons? We'll go with archons. The re, the only way that I've ever found a connection between

286
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:12,480
 the creatures known as the archons and the term solar plexus clown gliders is they attach to

287
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,320
 your solar plexus. And again guys, this is, we start stretching after that first one. The clown

288
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:27,840
 and the jester are loosely tied, very loosely tied. I'm even saying this here, loosely tied to like

289
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,280
 demons, trickster spirits, things like that. Gliders couldn't find anything. I tried everything

290
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:40,960
 to figure out how these things supposedly move, what type of technology they use. I, the, so I

291
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,840
 tried valiantly to connect all four words to this idea of these demons. And I could only really,

292
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,320
 I could connect two of them and then the clown was kind of loose in the glider. I wasn't able to

293
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,160
 find anything. Unless you count the way that they do move as gliding because they slide across the

294
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,480
 floor. So apparently what these are is these are interdimensional demons that invade your solar

295
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,120
 plexus. The solar plexus is where supposedly your chakra is that determines things like will.

296
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:18,160
 Your will to do things, your personal power. And these demons supposedly, again, they travel

297
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:23,840
 through these dimensions. They have cut themselves off from the divine light so they can't create.

298
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,040
 They have no imagination. There's, they are basically in the darkness. And so they attach

299
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:38,000
 themselves to living beings to experience light, to experience creation. And when they're attached

300
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
 to your solar plexus specifically, they can get you anywhere. But when they're attached,

301
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,040
 attached to your solar plexus specifically, it causes you to like overly worry and depression

302
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,080
 and doubt and all these things. And it feeds off that fear. It brings you into their darkness while

303
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,440
 it's experiencing our light. I'm like, okay, that's an interesting, that's an interesting

304
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,560
 hypothesis that there are these demons out there that exist and they're kind of like cut off from

305
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:09,360
 what's pure and beautiful in this world. So they have to infect part of that beauty to experience

306
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,440
 it and in the end bring you down to their level. I'm reading all this stuff about archons and then

307
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,120
 it says they've already infected the grays and the reptilians. And I'm like, ah, we're back to those

308
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,720
 guys. But you know, they're saying that's why aliens tend to be quite cruel. Like the experiences

309
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,720
 that people have of grays, they're just kind of cold with their medical experiments and they're

310
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,600
 kind of just like emotionless. It's because they've been their entire race has been infected by these

311
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,840
 archons. The theory is is that these things are so pervasive, they move from reality to reality

312
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,120
 and plan it to plan it until they've completely infiltrated an entire species. And it's just

313
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:50,000
 these tendrils coming out. They're generally viewed as slugs or snake like slugs. And once they

314
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,720
 latch on to you, they're difficult to get off. Faith healers and mediums say that sometimes

315
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,040
 they can see them and sometimes they've got infected with them themselves. And it's a really big

316
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,760
 problem. And it's a cause of a lot of people's unlike there are people who have depression for

317
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,920
 known reasons. And then there are people who have depression, they just can't figure out why. And

318
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,080
 they're saying that the archons are kind of responsible more for the second type of depression,

319
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,000
 just kind of that overwhelming depression. And the, you know, just problems in your life is

320
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 general. So are those solar plexus clown gliders? Is that why that's on that list? Because it is

321
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:30,560
 this alien species that basically has destroyed other alien species. Is it this creature, this

322
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,760
 demonic entity, this interdimensional creature that is just moving slowly through the universe?

323
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,400
 And that's why it's so low down on the conspiracy iceberg list. Because to know of it and to be

324
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,320
 aware of it is in a sense, depression enough that these things exist. And they're just overwhelming.

325
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,760
 They've already conquered most of our universe, let alone other universes. I think I've seen one.

326
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,000
 I don't talk a lot about my own experiences on this show. I actually was talking to my two friends,

327
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,480
 Lana and Mitcham. And I said, Lana, I've told Lana a lot of stories that have happened to me.

328
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
 And I said, do you think I should talk about my personal experiences on the show? And she goes,

329
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,280
 no, you'll sound like a crazy person. And that's true. Because some of my experiences are kind of

330
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,760
 crazy. This one in particular, this episode may run a little bit long, but I think it's kind of

331
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,720
 important because it heavily relates to this idea of these solar plexus clown gliders, these demons

332
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,520
 from another dimension. So when I was in college, I had an assignment. I had to sit in a courthouse.

333
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,320
 I think it was a, I was, it wasn't criminal justice. It might have been journalism class.

334
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,320
 I had to sit in a courthouse and watch a trial and take notes. And I'm sitting in the back because

335
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,320
 I'm too cool to sit in the front. I'm sitting in the very back and they have those orange,

336
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,320
 hard plastic chairs because who wants to be comfortable while watching your loved one be

337
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,480
 tried for murder? I'm sitting in one of those orange plastic chairs. And I remember just kind

338
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,520
 of had my arm up. It was, I don't know, just a more a weekday morning. Had my arm up on the chair.

339
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,480
 I'm just kind of leaning back like Jason does. Cause I can't sit like a human again, too cool.

340
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,520
 I saw something out of the corner of my eye, my right eye. And I'm alone in the back row. It's

341
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,200
 just me and I'm sitting right at the aisle because I always like to be on the aisle in case I got to

342
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,400
 go to the bathroom. And I'm sitting there and so I catch something out of the corner of my right

343
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,400
 eye. And I remember turning to look and in the chair, maybe two or three chairs down from me

344
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,320
 was a three foot long cobra. And it was like coiled at the base and it was,

345
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,800
 you know, probably about as high as me. So it was wrapped up. It actually must have been more than,

346
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,880
 well, no, probably about three feet. It was coiled at the bottom and then like its head was about

347
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,720
 the height of me. And it made this super weird movement, almost like this hyper animated movement

348
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,520
 that I don't think a snake could move in real life. Now, obviously there was real no cobra

349
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,840
 sitting there. And I knew there's no cobra sitting there. I wasn't like, I just looked over and saw

350
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,320
 it and it was such a weird thing. And at the time I was just like, I must just be tired. I must

351
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,120
 just be dreaming. And to be fair, that's the most likely explanation. I was super tired as early

352
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,480
 in the morning. I was bored. I always stay up late. I turn, I look, I see something out of the

353
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,440
 corner of my eye and then my brain is trying to construct something really quick for me to actually

354
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,120
 see because I'm basically in a dream state. I see a cobra and moves in a weird way and I don't

355
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,440
 react to it. I just kind of look at it for a second. And here's, you know, another weird part. It

356
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,520
 disappeared. Now, when it didn't disappear like it blinked or it faded or it turned to dust, it simply

357
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:48,240
 wasn't there. It didn't just go, it's hard to explain, but it didn't like, it didn't disappear.

358
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,240
 It simply ceased to be there because there's a difference. It was really weird at the time. And

359
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,440
 I remember I just kind of turned back to watch the trial. I was like, you know, but yeah, it just

360
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,840
 simply stopped being there. I got a sore back. I woke up the next morning with a sore back. I

361
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,280
 remember being a little uncomfortable in that orange chair and I was like, man, these chairs are

362
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,800
 really uncomfortable. I woke up the next morning. My back really hurt. I was like, oh, that orange

363
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,920
 chair really, really hurt. Really hurt the small of my back. Now, at that point, I'd been like in

364
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,240
 seven car accidents. So I didn't have the best back to begin with. I was like, that chair just

365
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,000
 wasn't working for me. So I just had a sore back. I go to my doctor and I say, hey, you know, I have

366
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 a sore back and he's looking at it. I'm like, yeah, I had a hard time sleep. I think I waited a couple

367
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,640
 days, but it was just sore. And I go, you know, I'm having this pain in my back. I don't know what

368
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:47,200
 to do. And he's like, well, okay, here you go. He prescribed me 120 Vicodin a month for what is now

369
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,320
 I know was minor back pain. And because the back pain didn't cease, it got worse. Maybe after about

370
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,080
 five or six months, he upped it to 250 Vicodin a month. So this, you know, this was back in like

371
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,760
 2004, 2005, where the doctors were prescribing over prescribing pain killers because they didn't

372
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,440
 think there's anything wrong with them. That time period, when I look back at that time period

373
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,080
 between 2000, it probably would have been around 2004, 2009, it was about five years,

374
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:26,320
 was some of the darkest times of my life. And trust me, that's a high fucking hurdle.

375
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,480
 I remember taking those pills and no matter how many pills I took, I was still in pain.

376
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,480
 I would just get loopy. And I remember because that's back when I was doing my music,

377
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,720
 I came to the point where I could not operate, could not do anything functional unless I was

378
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,920
 taking that medication. And since it wasn't helping me physically, it was just making me loopy or

379
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,640
 and loopy or and loopier. And I was just like, I mean, I was a, I had hard time, you know, working

380
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,640
 on my next album. I had a hard time hanging out with people. I had to plan everything around my

381
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,760
 pain. And no matter how much medicine I took, the pain got worse and worse. I was having huge

382
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,440
 emotional breakdowns. I was having huge problems with being, I think you guys can tell I'm fairly

383
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,440
 optimistic. I was having a huge hard time being even optimistic enough to wake up in the morning,

384
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:30,800
 to go to work. I was completely just dead. I was walking dead. Now, what happened with the

385
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,200
 medication was I ended up changing doctors. My new doctor was like, why are you taking 250 pills a

386
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,960
 month? Your MRI shows that you should have minor pain, if anything, your pain tolerance is totally

387
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,720
 screwed up. I'm going to wean you off the pills. You're going to hate me for a year, and then you're

388
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,960
 going to feel better. And that's what happened. And I feel 100 times better. I still get a sore back

389
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:02,400
 from time to time, but not how that was. I remember when I was really, really depressed about my

390
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:13,280
 situation, like really depressed on the brink depressed. And I remember that snake. I don't know

391
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:21,360
 why it popped in my mind. But I kind of in my mind started putting it together. I was like, all of

392
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:29,120
 this pain started that morning in that chair. Like I remember that chair being uncomfortable and it

393
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,800
 like just feeling painful. And I remember thinking, and this is again, weird, a weird thought. But I

394
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:42,480
 was like, what if somebody left that snake there? What if somebody else? That was, it was so bizarre.

395
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,760
 It was, I was thinking, what if it was like a curse? What if somebody else had previously been

396
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:56,000
 sitting in that row? And they had dropped it off or something and had left whatever that was had

397
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 left them and came for me and caused me all of that pain for all of that time. Because I had not

398
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,720
 only the physical pain, but then I had the mental anguish of not being able to do what I wanted to

399
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,960
 do because I was so cloudy. My thoughts were just, I couldn't really think in that fog. I felt like

400
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:23,920
 a different person on that stuff. But yeah, you know, it, I'm better. I'm far, far better. I'm back

401
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:33,600
 to how I was. And I don't know why it would have left me or what I did if it really was something

402
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:42,240
 like that. But what if that was one of these solar plexus clown gliders, this Archons, this

403
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,680
 parasitic entity that saw me, someone else, who had left someone else, and saw me sitting there

404
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,360
 and attached itself to me and said, I'm going to cause some chaos and I'm going to feed off this

405
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,520
 man's fear for a while. I don't know. Most likely explanation is I had a pinched nerve and I went

406
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,720
 to a doctor and he overprescribed medication and it threw off my pain tolerance and throws you down

407
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,840
 that spiral and all of that stuff. But I still, every once in a while, think of that snake.

408
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,320
 And wonder if it's somewhere else out there.
