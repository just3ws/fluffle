1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 An epidemic of mass delusion almost starts a war.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,400
 And then we take a look at the strange case of the talking tumor.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,240
 Is it possible for your own brain to tell you it's time for help?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:26,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,600
 You know it's funny because, well it's funny to me, an episode, it was two episodes ago.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,240
 I did the story, My Haunted Apartment.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,760
 And I recorded it and it was like oh this is a cool story to tell.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,320
 I've gotten so many emails and texts from people who know me personally saying thanks

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
 a lot bro.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,280
 That episode was super spooky.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,800
 Rabbitfish on YouTube says he normally listens to the show to go to sleep.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,440
 This is the first episode that he wasn't able to fall asleep to because he was so creepy.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,560
 And I woke up this morning to a text from another friend and she's like thanks a lot.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
 Thanks a lot.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 That episode was super creepy.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 And I'm glad.

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,720
 I didn't set out for it to be really creepy.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,080
 But I'm glad that it affected my audience on that level.

23
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 I don't know.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
 I find that interesting.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,520
 And before we get started into the story, I actually got some fan art describing that

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,720
 episode from Ian through email.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,600
 It is an illustration and MS paint of that episode.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,840
 And if I can gather it right, it's me in bed with a giant stick trying to shut my light

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
 off.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,760
 A ghost in underwear hovering away a book.

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,920
 And I believe those are Franz's arms sliding underneath the door.

32
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,680
 That may be another closet ghost, I'm not for sure.

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,520
 But it does look like Franz.

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
 And his sleeves are orange.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,880
 Oh, and a picture of my microphone with a bunch of dollar signs on it.

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,520
 Because yeah, it is quite expensive.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
 So thank you Ian for that awesome.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,760
 I was laughing so hard when I got this.

39
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,040
 And I was out with a bunch of people and I was like, I can't really show this to anyone

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,840
 because they didn't listen to the episode that I knew of.

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,160
 So but I appreciate all the feedback.

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,840
 I'm glad the episode was super creepy.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,800
 And I don't know how I would top that if I told any more personal stories.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,240
 I was thinking maybe I could tell some true crime stories.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,640
 Then I was like, no.

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,320
 True crimes that I've been involved in probably wouldn't fly over very well.

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,960
 Okay, so we got that and I again, I appreciate all that.

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,720
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story now.

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,880
 The reason why I'm covering it, I've had the story ready to go for probably about a month.

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,880
 And I was thinking, oh, you know, it's, I've covered a lot of mass delusions and I was

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
 like, I've done a couple of those.

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,240
 But the reason why I'm covering it right now is because I'm not trying to get political,

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,440
 but this is going on in the news with Jesse Smollett.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,440
 He was the actor from Empire who now has been charged with staging a fake hate crime.

55
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,600
 It's all allegations right now.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,880
 But there have been talks saying that this could have actually led to big consequences.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,720
 Like this hymn staging this thing could have sparked off a firestorm in the city of Chicago

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,240
 thinking that it was real and it could have even spread to other places.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,960
 People could have said enough's enough.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,800
 We're done with this hate crime.

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,200
 People are done with this type of racism and it could have really gotten out of control.

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,960
 And I thought now is a good time to talk about the West Bank fainting incident because it's

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
 the same thing.

64
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,920
 Now it wasn't fake.

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,640
 It was real kind of.

66
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,480
 We're in the year 1983.

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
 It's late March.

68
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
 8 a.m.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
 There's a 17 year old student.

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
 She's a Palestinian girl.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,840
 Her throat starts itching really, really bad.

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,840
 She's in class.

73
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,680
 She can't breathe.

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,720
 Now imagine if you're sitting in class.

75
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,600
 It's a totally normal day.

76
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:01,520
 You see a young woman walk in and she grabs her throat and that would be creepy.

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,480
 Of course you're probably going to think oh you know poor girl she probably has something

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
 wrong with her.

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 She's sick or something like that.

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,000
 I hope I don't catch it.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
 Eventually she gets a headache.

82
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
 She starts to get dizzy.

83
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,720
 They end up removing it from the class and just send her home.

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 Over the next two hours.

85
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,280
 So now you're sitting in this class.

86
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
 You're at school.

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,360
 You're like that's weird.

88
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:28,200
 And two hours later six students start and you're sitting in this crowd and these other

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,920
 people around you are starting to have the same symptoms that she had.

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,440
 And then your teacher.

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
 Now at this point panic starts to set in.

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
 Of course.

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,800
 It's something airborne and it's something incredibly contagious.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
 Couple of the students started saying who were affected by this thing said they could

95
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 smell sulfur.

96
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,320
 They could smell rotten eggs.

97
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,000
 Eventually the local police, the local health authority show up at the school.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 This is in the West Bank.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I don't know if I said that.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Well I guess it's in the title.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But this is in the West Bank.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,440
 So this is in it's complicated.

103
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,960
 But there's like Israel in the West Bank and there's Palestinians and there's the Israelis

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,760
 and it's a volatile situation.

105
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,920
 It's always been a volatile situation.

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,320
 When you start to have people in the West Bank which is primarily Palestinian go there

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,200
 spend some sort of gas release and it's affecting these students.

108
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,240
 So the public health authorities that's why the police show up.

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,640
 They're trying to figure out what is going on.

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,760
 They begin going through the school.

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
 They're thinking it's one of three things.

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,920
 There's some sort of gas.

113
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,120
 A natural gas leak or something that would be caused through faulty system.

114
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,040
 Two, there's an illness spreading through the school.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,600
 Four, three this is some sort of attack against the Palestinians.

116
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,920
 So they're really really suspicious of what's going on.

117
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,160
 They begin searching the school to try to figure out what could be causing it.

118
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,600
 While they're doing that that same day investigators are looking around looking for something.

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
 They look into a room.

120
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,120
 They see another girl.

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,440
 While they're searching for it 17 more students come down with this.

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
 This all started like I said at 8 a.m.

123
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
 By 11 a.m. they shut down the school.

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,200
 They just shut it down.

125
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,960
 Five days later they didn't know what he died and they started to notice a pattern.

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,520
 It mostly affected women.

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,760
 It was mostly women dealing with this.

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,260
 Women and girls.

129
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,800
 Five days later though in another city in the West Bank people are walking down the street

130
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,600
 mostly young women walking down.

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 At that point you really think that it has to be some sort of a chemical or a biological

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
 weapon attack.

133
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,760
 And at this point there were rumors that a car was driving through this city, Jinnin,

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,360
 this is a different city in the West Bank and it was emitting a cloud of smoke behind

135
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 it.

136
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,240
 More than just like smog.

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 It was something that it was like releasing a weapon.

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,000
 So now you have outbreaks in this city and then in other cities and this went on and on.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,920
 Now the Palestinians were demanding answers for this because again they think that there's

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,360
 some sort of chemical or biological weapon attack being used on them.

141
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,440
 But the Israeli government says, "Hey guys, listen, we're getting it too."

142
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,600
 It turns out that in other areas in the West Bank, female Israeli soldiers, not as high

143
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,560
 as an amount of the Palestinian women who were getting it, but female Israeli soldiers,

144
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,120
 "Ugh, they just be sitting in their barracks and all of a sudden they couldn't breathe.

145
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
 They started getting dizzy.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,240
 They're having headaches.

147
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
 They were fainting."

148
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,920
 I guess I should have said that earlier.

149
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
 They all fainting.

150
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,600
 That's why it's called a fainting incident.

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 I guess I should have said that a couple minutes ago.

152
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,160
 943 people hospitalized over this, over the course of about two weeks.

153
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,840
 People walking down the street, going to school, sitting at work, all of a sudden can't breathe,

154
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,960
 get dizzy, get a headache, fall over.

155
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,000
 When it was happening to the Israelis, they started thinking maybe the Palestinians are

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
 using some sort of chemical weapon.

157
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,920
 When it was happening to the Palestinians, they thought Israelis, they were using some

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,480
 sort of chemical weapon.

159
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,560
 In the end, they figured out that 20% of the cases were related to the inhalation of some

160
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,320
 sort of gas.

161
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,640
 And they tracked down that at the original school, at the original school, and the original

162
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:30,120
 school was in Arabah, there was a sub-toxic concentration of a gas that was coming out

163
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,200
 of a leaky toilet.

164
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,560
 But even they were like, "That's the only thing we can point out, but that's only for

165
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,120
 this school."

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,440
 So what they think is that a few people at that school actually got hit by this thing,

167
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,240
 at the original school.

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,360
 And then as they went to their neighboring towns, went home, and they were telling people

169
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,320
 about it, it started that little mass delusion going on.

170
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
 And then once the Israeli women, the soldiers who were hearing about it, they started to

171
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
 also have those effects.

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,040
 The other option is that a chemical weapon or a biological weapon was used, but there's

173
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,000
 never been any proof of that.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,400
 But it brought them to, once again, the brink of a major conflict.

175
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,840
 If you thought the young women in your community were being gassed with some sort of toxic

176
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,240
 substance, you would want to stop that.

177
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,640
 We've dealt with a lot of mass delusions, like the dancing delusion and the laughing

178
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,400
 epidemic in Africa.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,040
 And they've always been fairly benign.

180
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,160
 People died from the dancing delusion, but I mean, it didn't almost spark a conflict.

181
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,000
 But that's why it's important when we look at stuff like mass delusions, how quickly,

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
 how volatile the situation can be.

183
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,320
 Because if they weren't, if the rumors had kept spreading, if this delusion had kept

184
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,000
 going, the other side would have had no choice but to react to it.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,640
 Pretty crazy stuff.

186
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
 Pretty crazy stuff.

187
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
 So I see, it would be your only answer.

188
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,320
 If women in your town were falling over, choking, and you were fine, and you would think someone

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,280
 had, first off, you would be having a heart attack, as you'd afraid you'd be next, but

190
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,840
 you would have that idea that there has to, this has to be an attack.

191
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,160
 This absolutely has to be an attack.

192
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,000
 Because again, they didn't know what it was when it first started.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,600
 But luckily, cooler heads prevailed on both sides, and it was just chalked up to another

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,640
 bizarre case of mass delusion with a little, little hint of truth.

195
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
 Little hint of truth.

196
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,120
 There was that, some of them did inhale some gas, but they don't really know what it was.

197
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
 Maybe it was chemical acid.

198
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 Nobody knows.

199
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,800
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

200
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,200
 Now our next story is an interesting one, and it actually ties into another story that

201
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 I've been researching.

202
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,120
 So you're kind of getting a double header here.

203
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,320
 Uh, uh, no pun intended.

204
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,080
 We're going back to the year 1984.

205
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,280
 There's a young woman, she's unnamed, because all of the information about this story is

206
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,400
 from a medical paper, and they don't reveal the patient's name for privacy reasons.

207
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,040
 We're in the year 1984, we're in Britain.

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,480
 There's a young woman sitting there reading a book.

209
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,960
 She's reading a book, hanging out, not really thinking of anything.

210
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,120
 And then she hears a voice.

211
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,480
 Not from the corner of her room, not from her closet, but from inside her own head.

212
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
 Please don't be afraid.

213
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,080
 Yeah, let me stop there.

214
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,320
 Whenever something tells you don't be afraid, or don't panic, pretty much you're going

215
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,800
 to be afraid or panic, but you're sitting there reading the book.

216
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,280
 Please don't be afraid.

217
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,040
 I know I must be shocking for you to hear me speaking to you like this, but this is the

218
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,160
 easiest way I could think of.

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,840
 My friend and I used to work at the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street, and we would

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,720
 like to help you.

221
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,400
 She startled, startled obviously.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,840
 That's the direct quote that the patient said that the voice said.

223
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,880
 Now the patient knew of that Children's Hospital.

224
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,000
 She was aware of it, but she had never been there, she had children, her children had

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,440
 never been there.

226
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,720
 And then, that wasn't it.

227
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,960
 When the voice said, "To help you see that we are sincere, we would like you to check

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,880
 out the following."

229
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,080
 And then at that point, the medical paper goes on to say that the patient was given three

230
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,200
 separate pieces of information that the patient didn't know about already, and she went and

231
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,280
 looked it up and the things were true.

232
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,680
 Now we don't know what those things were, it's not listed.

233
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,640
 It might be things that were too private, it might be things that would lead more to

234
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,240
 her being revealed.

235
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,080
 But at this point, first she thinks she's hearing voices, so she's incredibly startled.

236
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,880
 Then the voices tell her things that she doesn't know and she looks them up and they're true.

237
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,120
 So she went to the doctor.

238
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
 She immediately was put down her book after she got done research and because first she

239
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,040
 probably thinks it's her imagination or something like that.

240
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
 She ends up going to the doctor.

241
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,720
 She sees the doctor, she's in complete state of panic and the doctor says, "This is a

242
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,760
 little bit out of my specialty, you need to go see a specialist."

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,840
 So she ends up going to this psychologist or psychiatrist, one of the two, I always

244
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,680
 get him confused, but she ends up going to see this person.

245
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,440
 And they're having this debate because the person who's writing this paper says, "What

246
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:33,760
 you are experiencing is a functional hallucinatory psychosis and we can do counseling, I'm going

247
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,600
 to put you on some medication, but this is just something that happens to people sometimes."

248
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
 And we will take care of it.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,840
 And she started taking it, taking the medicine, going to the counseling and she felt better.

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,520
 She was like, "Okay, I'm not afraid of the voices coming back."

251
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,760
 It doesn't specify if the voices were constant through this time period, but just hearing

252
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,400
 it once or twice would be bad enough.

253
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,160
 She takes the medication, she goes out onto a holiday, which is what they call a vacation

254
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,520
 in England.

255
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,520
 Now she was on the drugs, she was on holiday and the voices came back.

256
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,920
 And this time we don't have the direct quote, but the voices told her she's in the sunny,

257
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,480
 sunny beaches of wherever is not England.

258
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,360
 And these voices say, "You immediately have to take action.

259
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,720
 You are in danger.

260
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,360
 You need to have treatment right now."

261
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,280
 And they gave her an address.

262
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,440
 She goes back to England and she's totally panicking.

263
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,320
 Her husband's like, "Listen, we have this address.

264
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,880
 I'm telling you it's not going to lead anywhere."

265
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,320
 Everyone is still under the impression that she is just having a mental breakdown, a temporary

266
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,960
 mental breakdown.

267
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,320
 Husband puts her in the car because they're not going to let her drive.

268
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,480
 They're driving through England.

269
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,880
 They follow the address and it was a department of, it was basically a brain scan department

270
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,220
 for a major London hospital.

271
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,920
 She goes back to the specialist and she goes, "The voices are back.

272
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,200
 They told me to go in there and get a brain scan."

273
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,080
 As the car is pulling, this is so bizarre, as the car is pulling up to the brain scan

274
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,600
 building, just a giant building in the shape of a brain.

275
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,760
 No, because they have the hospital, but then they have the separate buildings for specialty

276
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,560
 stuff, at least they do in America.

277
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,360
 As she's pulling up to the brain scan place, the voices come back and they say, "You need

278
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,400
 to go in there and you need to have a brain scan done."

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,920
 For two reasons, you have a tumor and your brainstem is inflamed.

280
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,520
 Imagine, again, you're in a car.

281
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,720
 You're driving.

282
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,480
 Your hope is that this address is to a meat packing factory or a field or a playground

283
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,400
 or something that you can just be like, "You're right.

284
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
 I am just going crazy.

285
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,760
 I just need to take more medicine."

286
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,120
 As you're turning the corner and you see the building and it's shaped as a giant brain

287
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,880
 and it's glowing, Dr. Wiley's famous brain palace, as you're driving around the corner

288
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,960
 and you see it and you see what it is, the voices come back and say, "Go inside.

289
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,840
 You have a brain tumor and your brainstem is inflamed."

290
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,160
 And her heart just sunk because she wants to prove that it's fake, so she can be treated

291
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,480
 for it.

292
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,280
 But in her heart, she knows that it's not fake.

293
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
 She freaks out.

294
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,840
 Someone takes her back to the specialist and the specialist is like, "Listen, it is all

295
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
 in your head.

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,240
 There's a chance that maybe at some point you had seen an ad for this place and that

297
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,480
 information was stored in your brain and your delusion is building off of that information."

298
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,160
 But he's like, "Nothing's talking to you.

299
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
 Nothing's talking to you.

300
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,600
 There's rational explanations for this.

301
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,120
 However, to allay your fears, I will schedule you an appointment.

302
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,160
 I will give you a referral to have your brain checked to this place and your brain is going

303
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,120
 to come back and it's going to be 100% fine and then we can get past the delusion."

304
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,760
 The specialist calls up the brain people.

305
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,080
 They're just floating brains there at Dr. Wiley's brain palace and he goes, "I need

306
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,560
 to get her brain checked out."

307
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
 And they go, "Well, what's her symptoms like?"

308
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
 And he goes, "Well, she has none."

309
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
 And they're like, "Well, we can't check her out."

310
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,720
 And he's like, "Listen, I know that this is weird, but she's hearing these voices and

311
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,960
 they directed her to your place."

312
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,200
 And that went back and forth for like two months.

313
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,600
 The brain scan people are like, "That's a waste of time."

314
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,560
 She's not showing any signs.

315
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,120
 Her regular doctor's not saying there's any problem.

316
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,720
 But finally the specialist was able to say, "Please just help this woman.

317
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,840
 It will help her on a path to recovery."

318
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,040
 So they say, "Fine.

319
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,640
 We'll give her a brain scan.

320
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,040
 It's covered by insurance because it was a referral from the psychologist, psychiatrist

321
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
 guy."

322
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
 And there might have been a woman.

323
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,240
 But anyways, that's equivalent to this point of 10 minutes into the story.

324
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,120
 The patient is then taken to the brain scan place.

325
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,600
 You know, I put her in the machine.

326
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,160
 Mother brain is sent back there to do the taxes.

327
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,840
 The whole place is populated by brain people, famous brain people.

328
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,320
 Pinky in the brain or in the back.

329
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
 She gets her brain scanned.

330
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 She has a tumor.

331
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,880
 There's a tumor in her brain.

332
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,760
 Brainstem's inflamed because of the tumor.

333
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,920
 She showed absolutely no symptoms of this.

334
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:21,480
 So now the husband and the specialist and the brain people are like, "Oh, okay.

335
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
 This is kind of spooky.

336
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,440
 It is a little spooky now."

337
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,000
 And the brain people said, "You know what?

338
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Here's the thing.

339
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,120
 Right now you're not showing any symptoms.

340
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,840
 And it may not cause any damage, but it's your call.

341
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,400
 Should we, we can go in and operate now and take it out."

342
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,000
 Because brain surgery is not something you necessarily want to go through just for, you

343
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 know, just for giggles.

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,160
 They go, "We can go in and take it out now or we can wait till it's symptomatic."

345
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,120
 The voices in her head returned and said, "Take it out now.

346
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,360
 Take it out now.

347
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
 Take it out now."

348
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,480
 Now they may not have chanted, but the woman said, "Oh yeah.

349
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
 No, the voices in my head are saying we should take it out now.

350
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
 So they should take it out now."

351
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
 So they did.

352
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,640
 They took it out now.

353
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,600
 And after the procedure is done, after she wakes up, she hears one final message from

354
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
 the voices.

355
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,520
 "We are pleased to have helped you.

356
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 Goodbye."

357
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,240
 Hasn't heard the voices since.

358
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,280
 Now again, this woman's identity is private to the public, but she has actually gone with

359
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,440
 the specialist to conventions and seminars to be interviewed by other psychologists,

360
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,280
 psychiatrists people.

361
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,760
 Like it is a no-in-case-in-that community because they've really tried to figure out what caused

362
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
 it.

363
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,840
 And some of the theories are that the brain was talking to itself in a sort of self-healing

364
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,040
 fashion, that all the information that she said she didn't know she actually knew on

365
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,320
 some sort of subconscious level.

366
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,080
 One of the things, one of the debunking things was that it was all a scam that she wanted

367
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,360
 to get because it was in England.

368
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,960
 She wanted to get free healthcare because she had only moved there like seven to ten

369
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,760
 years ago.

370
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,040
 But in England, she did already have a free medical care through their national health

371
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,540
 system.

372
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,000
 So people were trying to say, "Well, maybe it was just a scam because she wanted a brain

373
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
 scan and she knew she was going to pay for it.

374
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
 Maybe she already knew she had a tumor."

375
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,440
 But then people were like, "No, she had free health insurance."

376
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,240
 The psychiatrist was like, "She came to me.

377
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
 It was free.

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,800
 It was all covered."

379
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,560
 So it wasn't a scam.

380
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
 Could have been ghosts.

381
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,040
 Could have been a future self talking to her.

382
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,800
 What's interesting is that when you look at the original voice, when you look at what

383
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
 the original voice said.

384
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,260
 First off, it's one voice, but it speaks as if there's two of them.

385
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,820
 It says, "My friend and I" refers to itself, "My friend and I used to work at Children's

386
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,460
 Hospital Great Ormond Street and we would like to help you."

387
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:59,500
 That's an interesting part of it because it's identifying itself as a particular entity

388
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,100
 or group of entities.

389
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,740
 It's not like, "We are your brain."

390
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,800
 It's not just a voice saying, "Go to the doctor."

391
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,680
 It's specifying that there's two of us in here and this is where we used to work.

392
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,380
 So that kind of leads you at like a ghost angle.

393
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,400
 Or maybe even an angel/marital angel where they're like, "Yeah, we used to quote unquote

394
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,800
 work at the hospital because we're angels and we're like doing miracles and stuff like

395
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
 that."

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,620
 But they never really could come up with a reasonable answer for this.

397
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:38,140
 But I think I have in my four hours researching this.

398
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,700
 I think it came up with a reasonable angle and it actually ties into another story that

399
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,260
 was a recommendation.

400
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,540
 So a couple, I don't know, probably a couple of weeks ago, months ago or something like

401
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,700
 that, I got a recommendation on YouTube from Rusty Shackleford.

402
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,740
 Rusty Shackleford said, "Hey, have you ever heard of bicameralism?"

403
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,260
 And I hadn't.

404
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,620
 And we're gonna go over it fairly briefly.

405
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,420
 It's quite a fascinating topic, but it's a little outside of my ability to explain.

406
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,020
 Because it gets pretty deep, actually.

407
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,580
 But what it is, is that up until maybe a couple thousand years ago, through the whole course

408
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,380
 of human history, up until a couple thousand years ago, humans had absolutely no sense

409
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,120
 of introspection.

410
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,540
 They never asked why.

411
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,940
 They simply did things.

412
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,740
 And they did things because their brain was telling them to do things.

413
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,380
 They heard voices all the time.

414
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,540
 Time to wake up.

415
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
 Get up.

416
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
 Go.

417
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,540
 Wake up.

418
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
 And they would actually hear that voice.

419
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
 "Get up.

420
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,540
 It's time to go to work.

421
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,620
 You gotta go out to work.

422
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,020
 You have to work this long."

423
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
 He called them...

424
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,460
 So there was a psychologist called Julian Jaynes.

425
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,140
 And this was back in 1979, he wrote this book.

426
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,260
 Sorry, yeah, back in 1976.

427
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
 The year I was born.

428
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
 I was born.

429
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,180
 I was coming out of my mother's womb as this book was being published.

430
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,180
 The book, The Origin of Consciousness and the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.

431
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,340
 And his theory was that there was just no...

432
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,260
 There was no why.

433
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,940
 One side of the brain told the other side of the brain what to do.

434
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,300
 And people just did things.

435
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,100
 And he called them noble automatons.

436
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
 Not robots.

437
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,220
 They were human.

438
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,780
 But they would hear voices compelling them to do things.

439
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,260
 And that is why they did things.

440
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,300
 They didn't do things because they were like, "Oh, what a beautiful sunny day."

441
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
 You know what I feel like?

442
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,740
 I should go fly a kite.

443
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,860
 They would hear a voice in their head saying, "It's time to relax.

444
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,500
 You should go out and invent a kite and then fly it."

445
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,660
 Like a little caveman out there flying a kite.

446
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,820
 It was all voices.

447
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,820
 And it's interesting because the theory plays into a lot of different things.

448
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,620
 There's always that question of how come in religions, how come when we look back in

449
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,180
 early history, God is constantly talking to people and people are constantly getting visions

450
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,900
 and messages from angels and communications with gods.

451
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,180
 Jane's theory was that they weren't.

452
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,420
 It was their brain telling them stuff and that's how they had no concept of what was

453
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,540
 going on.

454
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,620
 So if you asked someone, "Why did you go up there and write those 10 commandments?"

455
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,020
 He's like, "Uh, God told me to?"

456
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,820
 Because he just hears a voice in his head saying, "Walk up the mountain.

457
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,020
 Stay up here.

458
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,540
 Write these things down.

459
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,580
 Go down the mountain."

460
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:40,620
 It was all, but you would hear it as clearly as the patient did with the tumor.

461
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,020
 Full on just sitting there next to a burning bush and you would hear a voice saying, "This

462
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,300
 is what is going on."

463
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,780
 And you would simply do it.

464
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:54,900
 Julian Jane's theory, one of the things that he uses to back this up is when we look at

465
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,940
 super, super early literature and he's talking about the Iliad and the oldest parts of the

466
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,420
 Old Testament.

467
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,140
 Let me read this quote to you here from this article.

468
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:12,420
 The characters of the Iliad do not sit down and think out what to do.

469
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,860
 They have no conscious minds such as we say we have and certainly no introspection.

470
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:25,340
 It is impossible for us with our subjectivity to appreciate what it was like.

471
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,940
 And the same thing with the earliest books of the Bible.

472
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,900
 Characters simply did things.

473
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:39,140
 But when we look at the Odyssey versus newer parts of the Bible, Ecclesiastes on, characters

474
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,100
 do start, well not characters in the Bible, but you know there's people in the Bible and

475
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,380
 characters in the Odyssey.

476
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,900
 We see them start to go, why?

477
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,700
 They start to question, they start to become introspective.

478
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,060
 There's a whole ton of debate on this subject.

479
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,500
 There's a ton, obviously this was a super controversial book.

480
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,100
 And James has been described as either mad or genius or both.

481
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:10,220
 Like he is either 100% right or 100% wrong in either way it redefines things.

482
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,780
 Because no one's out and saying this guy's a fraud or a crackpot.

483
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,260
 There's just a lot of debate over whether or not what he says is true.

484
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,500
 And really a lot of the debate comes around his term noble automatons.

485
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,220
 People are like are you saying that we were robots back then?

486
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,060
 And James was like no no no no I'm not saying that they were robots.

487
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:32,660
 If your brain was telling you to do something, you would do it.

488
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,780
 Because that's all you knew.

489
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,100
 As a baby it would be like you're hungry.

490
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,420
 Crawl, go outside, stick a fork in that electrical outlet.

491
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,780
 But as you got older, till the field, it's time to go home.

492
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,660
 You're hungry.

493
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,340
 And all the way up your children would do that, their grandchildren would do that, would

494
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,860
 go on and on and on.

495
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:59,420
 And at some point in fairly recent human history, the human brain connected.

496
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:05,020
 But the way we are, how we can have internal dialogues and go do I really want, I really

497
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,220
 want to eat that Dairy Queen but I gotta watch my diet, it's not good for me.

498
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,660
 But you know I want that, no Jason you know it's not good.

499
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,140
 Just walk on by the place and da da da da.

500
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,020
 That didn't, his theories, that didn't happen before.

501
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,300
 You would just walk by Dairy Queen, caveman style Dairy Queen where they all, it's like

502
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,460
 soft serve rocks.

503
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,740
 And a voice would either say keep walking, you're not hungry.

504
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,340
 Or go inside and eat some Dairy Queen you deserve it.

505
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,340
 That was it.

506
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,380
 There was no introspection, there was no why.

507
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,580
 Should I or why shouldn't I, you simply did things.

508
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,260
 And the only way you could describe that was, God's talking to me.

509
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,620
 I think that's what happened with the tumor.

510
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,740
 I think that might actually be a case of a bicameral mind.

511
00:27:50,740 --> 00:28:00,420
 Not saying that she is like a throwback to the Neanderthals but what if that tumor separated

512
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:08,500
 her mind back to that basic level of a noble automaton and it set her back to where her

513
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,100
 body was now, her brain was basically now in control of her rather than the other way

514
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,340
 around.

515
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,580
 Her brain was commanding her to do things.

516
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,660
 She was hearing voices and you could say they were voices from God or voices from an angel

517
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,660
 or someone who's having other evil delusions could say I hear demons in my head or something

518
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
 like that.

519
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,060
 What if these are all cases, what if this is all proof of Jane's theory of a bicameral

520
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
 mind?

521
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,340
 I think it's fascinating to think because evolution is supposed to take place over millions

522
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,580
 of years but if we can look at something, if Jane's theory is correct, you can tell

523
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,220
 I'm pretty excited about this because I just find this fascinating.

524
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,980
 If Jane's theory is correct, we had a major leap in human evolution within the past 6,000

525
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
 years.

526
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
 7,000 years.

527
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
 Probably 5,000 years.

528
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,460
 Somewhere around there but you know what I mean?

529
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,940
 To go from a level where everyone simply heard voices telling them what to do to being where

530
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,900
 we are right now where I can actually debate and I have control over what we do.

531
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:14,100
 Where my essence, like I have both sides of my brain but my essence of who I am, like

532
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,700
 if a voice tells me to go out and run, I can say you know what, now I'm too tired.

533
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
 What's the point?

534
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,100
 And they didn't have that back then.

535
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,300
 They just simply did.

536
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,380
 And what I think is even more fascinating about that is most religious people do have

537
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:33,720
 the question is how come God seems more in people, in human affairs, thousands of years

538
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,020
 ago than they are today?

539
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,860
 Why is it that it seemed like everyone would pray and something would happen but today everyone

540
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,180
 can pray and it doesn't seem to affect things?

541
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,740
 Why is it that back in the time you had all these prophets and you don't have them now?

542
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,060
 Maybe there's an evolutionary reason for that.

543
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:57,580
 And maybe the old way, maybe by having the ability to ask why and to be introspective

544
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,340
 and be able to make decisions for ourselves, that sounds like a great thing but what if

545
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:14,140
 that evolution of the human mind cut us off from something greater, something more spiritual?

546
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:20,420
 This patient's mind, this tumor may have regressed her brain pattern to that of someone living

547
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,180
 6,000 years ago.

548
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,780
 But that tapped her in to that voice in your head.

549
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,060
 And who's to say that that voice in your head doesn't come from somewhere else?

550
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,700
 What if now everyone's running on cable?

551
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,860
 Everyone's running on, our brains are strapped into a metaphorical coax cable that's going

552
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,780
 into a wall so we can get the programming we want when our brains were originally designed

553
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:57,100
 to have rabbit ear antennas to pick up the signals that the universe wants us to have.
