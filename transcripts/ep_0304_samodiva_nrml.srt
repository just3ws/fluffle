1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 An up-and-coming Russian model is horribly mutilated in a brutal crime.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,600
 Bulgaria has its own nymph that will make you dance to death.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,280
 And then we travel to Japan to take a look at a story that some people claim is one of the earliest meetings between aliens and humans.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,440
 Who was the woman in the boat?

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,160
 Find out today on the seductress special of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
 *Maniacal chatter*

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carviner.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,840
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,280
 It is the seductress special because I met my future wife this weekend.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
 Now before you panic, before you go, don't leave us, Jason. Don't leave us.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,040
 She's gone. She's still alive. I think that sounded ominous.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,680
 She's gone. She was passing through Hood River on a road trip or the road trip ended in Hood River.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,040
 Didn't really make heads or tails of that.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,760
 She was there with a bunch of friends. I was at a bar with my friends. Her and her friends are at this bar.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
 And I saw her and I go, I need to talk to this girl. She looks like

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,400
 if Taylor Swift was a librarian at a community college.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,960
 Which in my world is top notch. Now before you guys go, that is sexist, Jason.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
 You describe the woman in physical terms. Hold on. Hold on.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,120
 Let me tell you why I'm in love with her. So I walk up to her and start making conversation with her.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,640
 Which is a little, I normally don't approach girls in packs, but I do from time to time.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,800
 This one I kind of had to. And so I walk up to her and I start chatting her up.

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,280
 We're talking for a bit. We probably talked for like 20, 30 minutes.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,480
 Long enough for me to fall in love. We're talking, that's all it takes.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,080
 I'm talking to her. We started talking about science because she's like a chemist.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,800
 And I go or a chemistry major. Again, I wasn't paying super close attention at this point.

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:00,480
 But anyways, we're talking and she goes, what does Silver say to Gold when he walks in a bar?

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,480
 Now that is a very clunky delivery of a joke. That's a terrible delivery, right?

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,000
 It should just be what does Silver say to Gold. So I'm just going to do it that way.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,440
 Because I'm a professional comedian. I'm not. But more so than her, what does Silver say to Gold?

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,240
 And the answer or the punchline? No, the answer is not a quiz. You don't get great at this.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,840
 Okay, let me start over. What does Silver say to Gold? I guess you do need the second part.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,240
 What does Silver say to Gold when he meets him in a bar?

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:35,120
 A.U. How you doing? So she told me that joke and my immediate internal response was how many

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
 children do you want? Like who doesn't want to be with a girl that goofy that she'll tell

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,440
 that joke to a total stranger in the first 10 minutes of meeting her. But she's gone.

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,800
 She left with her friends. So Taylor, if you're still out there, I hope you are again. She's

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,360
 not buried. I don't know why you're making this so ominous. She's still out there law enforcement.

38
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,000
 I had nothing to do. If she isn't, I had nothing to do with it. But Taylor, that's her fake name,

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
 because she does look like Taylor Swift. Kind of. Taylor, if you're out there and you're,

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,520
 she doesn't listen to this podcast too. I asked her about that because you never know.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,040
 She doesn't believe in ghosts. She also said I was smart, which proves to me she doesn't listen

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,040
 to the podcast. But anyways, you know where I live. Okay, so let's go ahead and move on our first

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
 story. Oh, so this is the seductress special for two reasons. One, because I met the future

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,520
 Mrs. Jason Carpenter. And two, I'll get to in a second, but I got three stories of seduction

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,320
 and darkness and kind of lightheartedness. No, I guess they're all pretty bad.

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,040
 So don't listen to this episode, future wife. Let's go ahead. We are going to go to Russia.

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,280
 Let's take the rabbit rowboat. We haven't broken this out in a while. And we're rowing across

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,960
 the ocean. Hey, actually, all these stories kind of take place around each other. So this would

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,640
 be cool. We're going to take the rabbit rowboat. We're going to take it to Russia. We're going to

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,760
 get there. And it's the year 2016 because it took so long time reset. And it started over. So the

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,360
 year is 2016. We're in Russia. There is a young woman named Stefani Dubrovina. Stefani Dubrovina.

52
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
 And she's a 17 year old fashion model in Russia. Live in the high life. That's not true. It's funny.

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,800
 A lot of people think models live very glamorous lives. Same thing with porn stars, but mostly for

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,960
 the most part models, they're usually in abject poverty. You, I can almost guarantee you live better

55
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,720
 than 90% of the models out there. And I'm even talking about models who do like runway shows.

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
 Like of course, the models who do like suicide girls or just like webcam stuff, they're not making

57
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
 a ton of money. But like when you see models in magazines, a lot of times they're very, very poor.

58
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,640
 You're really not making a lot of money. You're probably in unless you're a top model, America's

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,880
 top model, or is that America's next model? It doesn't matter. Very rarely do you make millions

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,120
 of dollars. A good model can clear like 50,000 a year. And then the majority of models are like

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,640
 20,000. So it's really, really, or maybe more, but they have a lot of expenses with it as well.

62
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,000
 And they know they don't have to pay you that much because there's 100,000 other girls who would

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,440
 kill to get where you're at. So it's a very, very low income job unless you're a super, super elite.

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,000
 But anyway, she looks like she's living a glamorous life, but she's not. She does have a sister,

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,240
 Eliza Vita, Eliza Vita Dubrovina, who's 19. So Stefani's 17 years old fashion model,

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,880
 her older sister, Eliza Vita. They are very, very close. They actually are uncannily close.

67
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,480
 Same hair color, same lipstick shade, but Eliza Vita is not a model. She's an attractive woman,

68
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,120
 but she's not a model. So one day Stefani is found dead. Dead in her apartment. Her lover,

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:45,200
 who is 44 year old, Alexi Fativa. He's 44, she's 17. He had left the apartment that he was staying

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,280
 at with Stefani and Eliza Vita was visiting. He leaves to go buy some wine. This is what he says.

71
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,840
 He comes back to the apartment. Stefani is stabbed to pieces and that's not an exaggeration. 189

72
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,240
 stab wounds, eyeballs cut out, ears cut off, and Eliza Vita is like, "See ya." And she starts walking

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,040
 out of the apartment and Alexi's like fighting her and holds her there until the police show up.

74
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,720
 Now, that happened in 2016. The reason why this is news today is because the trial is starting.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,280
 What happened is the police say that Eliza Vita killed her out of jealousy. She was so jealous

76
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,520
 that her little sister was so much more beautiful than her, drove her to a fit of rage, and she

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,560
 got drugged at a party. And oddly there's not a lot of details on this case. She would be really

78
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,040
 big because true crime people are kind of eracious about this stuff, but and every time they have

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,880
 an article about these people, it's just photo after photo of models and stuff like that. So

80
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,040
 you think it'd be more information, but I don't know what type of drug she was on or if it was

81
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,600
 voluntary or involuntary that she was at a club or a party and something got laced. But anyways,

82
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,560
 they're saying Eliza Vita was drugged out and she was finally pushed past the boiling point due

83
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,240
 to her jealousy and mutilated her face and stabbed her all over the place. That rhymed. Unfortunately,

84
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
 gouged her eyes out and so on and so forth. Eliza Vita's saying no no no, Alexi did it.

85
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,680
 I was just there. And what's weird is she was arrested in 2016. The trial's taking place now.

86
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,440
 It took her three years for her to be competent to stand trial. So whatever drugs she was on,

87
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,040
 that would have had to be a massive dose. Or she was faking it, or both. But three,

88
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,360
 what, when's the last time you took a drug trip that lasted three years? No human ever. I guess

89
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
 maybe like if you did a bunch of acid. But again, like I think even if you did a bunch of acid one

90
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,760
 night, it wouldn't take you three years, you wake up you're like oh I got a horrible hangover. Man,

91
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,120
 what did I do last night? And they're like well three years ago you killed your sister and she's

92
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,240
 like ugh. I knew I shouldn't have drank the punch. And to put a little paranormal bint on it, you know,

93
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,200
 we do cover true crime, but to put an extra little dead rabbit radio bint on this story, she says

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,320
 that now that she's competent, now that she can stand trial, she says now that I've regained my

95
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,400
 memory after that horrible drug trip that lasted three years, I saw in the apartment Alexi shape

96
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,360
 shift into a demon. I didn't kill her, he did. But I'm the one standing trial. Now you probably

97
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,760
 didn't turn over demon, that's probably part of her drug hallucination, but the police have said

98
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,280
 Alexi was just a witness to this whole thing, he had nothing to do with it. Which is also an

99
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,640
 interesting note, a lot of articles said he was the witness, but I'm thinking I thought he came

100
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,480
 home after the murder. So there's some details that aren't 100% in there, but driven mad by someone

101
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,880
 else's beauty? That's not really a seductress, it doesn't really fit the theme of the show, but it

102
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,240
 does lead us into our next story. I guess like just being like so enchanted by beauty that it

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
 drives you mad, I guess that's kind of that's seduction, not seduction you want to do because

104
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
 you don't want to get murdered, but it's seduction so it fits. But it also leads into our next story.

105
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,000
 Now our next story was actually a request in kind of a roundabout way. So our next story though,

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,200
 and it leads into this, is actually a request. I got this request from a listener named, and it's

107
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,840
 kind of not what he requested, but I got this email from a listener named JaisaDor.

108
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,200
 JaisaDor or Jasador? JaisaDor? Also listed, also calls himself the Bulgarian Jason. So thank you so

109
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,520
 much for this recommendation, JaisaDor. He's from Bulgaria, and which is obvious from the name,

110
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,440
 and it's funny because a long time ago I did an episode about the Czar China Hole, and I ragged on

111
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,920
 Bulgaria for not having warlords. There were some, there was something, they were looking for a great

112
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,720
 Bulgarian warlord, and I go, what were they like two? And I've gotten so much YouTube comments

113
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,200
 and the occasional email and and, and Jasonor mentioned that too. He's like, you know, we have

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,760
 like a long rich history of warlords. It's just not very well known, and I understand that. It was

115
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,960
 obviously a joke when I said that. I'm sure, you know, Bulgaria is a total war-torn country that

116
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,640
 has no vegetation because war after war after war after war over there. They can't build a house

117
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,280
 because there's constant warfare for the past thousand years while the rest of Europe was

118
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:06,160
 building cathedrals. Bulgaria is just one giant village to this day. Again, I'm just joking.

119
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,240
 Thank you for all the people who responded to my anti-Bulgarian rant, and we'll respond to this one.

120
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,560
 Thank you, JaisaDor, for this recommendation, though. So what he did was he sent me this email.

121
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,320
 I thought this was interesting. I'm gonna, I'm gonna read what he wrote to you. I'm gonna read

122
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,080
 this particular part because I can't cover this part because it's all in Bulgarian stuff, language,

123
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,560
 but it led me somewhere else. Let me read this part of the email. I want to, and I'll have this

124
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,880
 video in the show notes. I wanted to, if you can speak Bulgarian, I wanted to introduce you to a

125
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,920
 more obscure thing in Bulgaria. It's a village called Shai Shensi. It's super weird, this whole

126
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,400
 video. These old ladies live hundreds of miles from the nearest cities. They just kind of grow

127
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,200
 what they eat, and every night they are like, "Oh yeah, we just close up the windows or the

128
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,960
 Samodivas are gonna get us." Like super effin-casually. Like, you know when you live near the train

129
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,440
 station for a long time, you stop noticing things, and someone comes over and they are like, "How can

130
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,400
 you actually stand this noise? It's the same effin thing." They say you go around the houses and

131
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,880
 sing and dance, and the locals just kind of let it be. So I read that, and I go, "What's a Samodiva?"

132
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,360
 Like, that was my takeaway there. So there is like this 40-minute long video, and it probably is

133
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,920
 a fairly interesting video about this culture there, but I don't- and he offered to translate it,

134
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,160
 but I think you've- I appreciate that offer. But with a daily show, a lot of times we're just

135
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,240
 kind of getting stuff out. But in this email, I go, "What is a Samodiva?" So I looked that up.

136
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
 And this is the reason why we have this seductress special. So thank you again,

137
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,680
 Jaystador, I assume when I'm pronouncing that correctly, for giving me kind of the theme for

138
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,560
 this episode. I go, "This is something I can put my hat on. I can find two other seductress stories

139
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,480
 to work into this." So we are traveling to Bulgaria. So we're going to carry the boat over land. I'm

140
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,520
 sure there's some rivers that go from Russia to Bulgaria. And we know we're in Bulgaria because

141
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,000
 the blue crystal waters of Russia slowly start to turn brown and swampy, and now we're- we're

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,160
 rowing through a swamp super slow. Yeah, see a sign that says, "Welcome to Bulgaria." Yeah,

143
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,040
 I guess that's what I thought. We're rowing past the Bulgarian Warlord Monument. It goes, "Here

144
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,920
 lies Bulgaria's greatest warriors, all two of them." We look at each other. We're like, "Yeah,

145
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,040
 that's what I thought, bro. That's what I thought." We're rowing the boat down the Bulgarian

146
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,680
 River Slash Swamp at this point, and we hop out. We carefully unpack the clean water we brought

147
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,240
 with us and some sandwiches that are in Ziploc bags. We don't want to eat anything around here,

148
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,360
 where I actually have a lot of listeners in Bulgaria. We're walking through Bulgaria now,

149
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,080
 eating our clean Russian food and drinking our pure crystal water. And the townspeople are like,

150
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,240
 "Oh, there must be witches. How do they seal such things? What is this plastic wrap? What's plastic?

151
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,640
 No, no, no, plastic is. So anyways, we're walking around Bulgaria." And we decide to take a shortcut

152
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,600
 through the woods. So we walk through the woods and kind of like, "Doodadoo." Walking around. I'm like,

153
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
 "Hey, did I tell you about that hot chick I met at a bar?" You're like, "Yes, Jason." Several times

154
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,920
 on the way on the boat ride over. I was like, "Oh, I can't wait to see her again." So as we're walking

155
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:22,000
 through the woods, we see a beautiful woman out in the woods, just kind of dancing around by herself,

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,440
 doing the robot. We're like, immediately entranced by this woman. And what we're seeing is a being,

157
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:38,080
 known as a Samo-Diva. They're described as blonde, tall, slender women with pale glowing skin

158
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,880
 and fiery eyes. Her eyes just burn into our soul. And she is so beautiful. We both fall in love. Now,

159
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,040
 that's bad. It's bad to fall in love with a mythical creature right off the bat. It's probably even

160
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,200
 worse when both of us are in love, because then we're going to fight each other for her. Like,

161
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,560
 "Ugh, Russel and rolling through the dirt, rolling through the mud of Bulgaria." We're like, "It burns!

162
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,360
 It burns! It's not normal mud!" But anyways, we have to call a quick truce, because I can't kill my

163
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,440
 listener and I can't be killed myself. So we both hop up and we begin pursuing this woman.

164
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,280
 And she's running away. Okay, this guy's dark. Okay, it's part of the legend. We're not just

165
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,760
 doing this because we're creepers. Part of the legend. Okay, let me get to the legend part,

166
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,920
 because that sounded really dark. What it is is that when you see a Samo-Diva, you become instantly

167
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,640
 in love with her, and then you begin to chase her, and she runs away. And what she's doing is she's

168
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,200
 actually draining your energy from you. So the more you chase, you can never catch her. The more

169
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,440
 you chase her, the more she runs, the more energy she's draining from you. And eventually, you become

170
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,560
 weakened. She circles back around and she tortures you to death. Which, I mean, if she's that attractive,

171
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,160
 I can... that's a death I'm willing to do. Like, the running part? No, I'm not cool with that. I'm

172
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,480
 like, "Oh, my knees!" But, I mean, like, if I'm being tortured to death by a stunning woman, yeah.

173
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,360
 I mean, it's not on my to-do list of ways to die, but, you know, there's worse things to see. Like,

174
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,640
 I'd rather see a beautiful woman cutting my heart out than, like, fall face-first in a meat grinder.

175
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,240
 A very slow meat grinder. A rusty meat grinder that needed to be maintained a couple years ago.

176
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,960
 So, horribly killed by this woman. Tortures you. Not just kills you, tortures you. Also,

177
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,760
 if you're walking by the forest, because they usually hang out in the forest, we'll get to that

178
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,040
 in a second, but you're walking by a forest, they tend to hang out by themselves. Samo-Diva,

179
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,880
 Samo means alone and Diva means wild. So, that means, like, alone in the wild. It actually

180
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,040
 means alone and wild or something like that. You see them in a d- sometimes they go to dance parties,

181
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,720
 because they do hang out with each other. See them at a dance party. If you see them dancing,

182
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,040
 they play such beautiful music and they're so hot, you go to the dance party and you dance until you

183
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,000
 die. They hang out at night, they go away when the sun comes up, and you just, you're dead in the

184
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,160
 woods. Which would be a way to explain why people died of heart attacks and stuff like that. It would

185
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,640
 also be a way to explain when you find your elderly grandpa in the woods dead and his pants are down.

186
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,080
 We've looked at myths like this before. That would be a way to explain why you would come

187
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,240
 across bodies in the woods. Who apparently died of natural causes. People who die of heart attack

188
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
 in the woods, you would create myths around that. You'd be like, "Oh, maybe this happened."

189
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,200
 Or you could be saying, "Hey, listen, I'm a woman. Jason, you keep going off on these adventures and

190
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,520
 getting murdered by mule women who turn into mules, and you're falling for these beautiful

191
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,400
 six-foot-tall, blonde-haired maidens that torture you to death, and for some reason you're okay with

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,480
 that. I'm a woman. I don't have to worry about that. I'm not going to wrestle you in the burning

193
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,880
 Bulgarian mud. I am not under their power. But if a man sees them, they're going to dance till they

194
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,800
 die, or they're going to chase them through the woods and get exhausted and get murdered. If a woman

195
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,960
 sees a Samodiva, they will kill themselves on the spot, because they are so beautiful, and a human

196
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,680
 woman can never be that beautiful. You will murder yourself on the spot. So that's why in the email,

197
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,760
 the elderly women were like, "Oh yeah, we sing and dance to keep the Samo..." Or they're shedding

198
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,680
 the windows to keep the Samodivas away. They do that because if a woman sees a Samodiva,

199
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,520
 they will kill themselves on the spot. So you have a risk of doing it too. Yeah, you're right.

200
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,640
 You wouldn't wrestle me in the noxious Bulgarian Earthscape, but you would just kill yourself.

201
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
 And you have a couple different origin stories. One of them is there, the daughter of the Lamia,

202
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,040
 or the Lamia. It's this snake monster goddess dragon thing from old, old times. Some people say

203
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,000
 that they are virgins who died before they lost their virginity. That's pretty dark. And then

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,360
 there's no jokes there. And then the other one is they're just wicked women. These things are

205
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,120
 normally considered evil. Mischievous at best. Evil at worst. Sometimes they're just wretched women,

206
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,640
 horrible women who died in her trap between heaven and hell. What I love is they don't have a lot

207
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,480
 of easy ways to kill them. There's a Macedonian version of this myth that if you poke them with a

208
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,280
 thorn, they die or they lose their powers, which is actually if you are a forest dwelling creature

209
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,560
 and your weakness is thorns, how do you even survive to the modern age to like even be a legend?

210
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,840
 You should have died out during the dinosaur. That's an interesting question. Word, if we accept

211
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,080
 that these like fey type spirits exist, these forest nymphs, cryptids, cryptids are a bit

212
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,600
 different because you figure cryptids may have evolved. But like spirit based, where, this is

213
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,440
 what I'm getting at, where was Zeus during the age of the dinosaurs? Like were the Greek gods around

214
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,960
 during the crustacean period? Were the Greek gods around during the Jurassic period? Was Zeus

215
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,920
 straight up like changing himself into a T-Rex and getting banged by other T-Rexes? Like that's

216
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,240
 interesting. Like all of these forest nymph type characters were there leprechauns getting chased

217
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,800
 by stegosaurus back in the day. Because technically they would have had to have been.

218
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,640
 Because the leprechauns, fey, all that stuff exist out of our reality, they're interdimensional,

219
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,200
 so they would have existed. They may have popped their head in every 65 million years and go oh no

220
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,240
 an asteroid and then went back. But I don't think Bigfoot was getting chased by a pterodactyl,

221
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,880
 but I think that these type of creatures, these, what are we talking about again? Oh these Samo

222
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,600
 divas, did they exist? Were they like writing on the backs of triceratops? Interesting.

223
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,800
 I wonder if anyone's looked into that. I don't think anyone is as insane as I am, but

224
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,680
 interesting nonetheless. So they get pricked by a thorn and they die, or they lose their power

225
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,000
 or something like that. It's kind of the same thing, but because that's how they exist. Also,

226
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,360
 they take baths, they're only around from like the evening, they leave before the sun comes up. But

227
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,360
 the first thing you do every night is they take a bath, which is everyone should do really,

228
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,120
 or shower at least. But anyways, so they take a bath, they take all their clothes off, they wear

229
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,920
 these long white dresses and they have like a green or a rainbow belt. So they take their clothes

230
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,080
 off and they jump in with all their other hot nymph buddies and they're swimming in the water.

231
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,280
 If you happen to jack one of their dresses, you have power over them, they will marry you and they

232
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,200
 can have children, but the whole time they'll be thinking, if only I could get my dress back.

233
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,120
 These creatures are pretty popular in Bulgarian myths. There are a lot of the

234
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
 like antagonist or obstacles for the hero to overcome. Sometimes they're the main antagonist,

235
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,440
 sometimes they're just something, because they're medicinal. One of their key points is that if you

236
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,960
 overhear them talking to their buddies, all they do is talk about medicine and stuff like that.

237
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,120
 So there's Bulgarian folktales where people are like hiding in the bushes and they're like,

238
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,680
 oh, did you know if you rub mushrooms on your eyeballs, you can grow wings and then the guy

239
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,520
 will go back and rub mushrooms on his eyeballs and fly and save his damsel in distress. So sometimes

240
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,920
 they're simply an obstacle to overcome or to get information from. Sometimes they're bad guys,

241
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,360
 but they have a legend of a guy who jacked his chick's dress and forced her to marry him and

242
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
 she got pregnant and had a kid and then they went to the wedding where they were going to get married.

243
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,600
 So they go to the wedding, his wedding, they're getting married and his dad is like, I thought you

244
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,840
 said that girl was a Samodivan. He's like, oh, she was. I stole her dress and they're like, dude,

245
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,480
 she's dancing horribly. That's not what a Samodivan dances like. And the dude's like,

246
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,560
 let me get her clothes. This is years later after he stole her clothes. Let me put her

247
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,240
 clothes on her, then she'll have her powers again. And he gives her back the clothes,

248
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,680
 she puts it on, she dances away, he flies away and he's left with this son that he has no wife for.

249
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,760
 Not the worst ending to a fable. He didn't end up like getting his liver eaten out for eternity.

250
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,800
 It just has to be single dad. There's nothing wrong with that. And this is the part, so we have

251
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,160
 these tall blonde, they're blonde, oh by the way, I think I mentioned that a couple times. They

252
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:55,440
 actually have blonde hair. It's part of them being so beautiful, but their hair is described as loose

253
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,640
 slash a wig. And I guess you can yank their hair off and that also can diminish their power.

254
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,800
 Doesn't completely take it away, but it does weaken them to a certain point. And my favorite part of

255
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:15,120
 this myth is they are known to live in, not around trees, like normal nymph, they live inside trees.

256
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,400
 They're also known to live in abandoned shacks and dark caves. And I like all of those things,

257
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,200
 because those are probably the only three places that are worse than my apartment. So I don't have

258
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,000
 to worry about bringing a Samodiva over to my place, because then I can, I don't feel bad about

259
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,720
 bringing them back to my place. Like my place is still pretty clean since I had it feng shui'd by

260
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,560
 that girl who came over, but my bedroom is just like four feet of clothes on top of my bed. But

261
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,960
 you can't really complain about my bedroom if you live in a tree. Like I think that is a fair

262
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,800
 thing. You come out of my apartment and you're like, have you ever vacuumed? And I was like, yeah,

263
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,320
 yeah, I vacuumed a couple months ago. And she's like, and that's fair. Okay, I'm sure the tree

264
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,560
 at least has a clean floor is clean as ground can get in Bulgaria, but I'll give Bulgaria that

265
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,560
 I'm sure their carpets are cleaner than mine. But I'd be like, listen, listen, yes, my bed is covered

266
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:20,640
 in clothes. Yes, some of those clothes probably have like flex of sand and wood in them. Because I

267
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,320
 walk everywhere. I'm a nymph like you, I live in the forest as well. Or I just walk through wooded

268
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,760
 areas, which is creepy. And yes, sometimes because I throw my clothes on my bed, dirt and pieces of

269
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,880
 wood on it, the dirt and the pieces of wood get on the bed. And then I brush it off with my hand.

270
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:49,120
 And then you come over and you're like, why is there a piece of bark on your bed? Which,

271
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,920
 to a normal woman, obviously, I will say, lie, I will come up with a quick lie as to why there

272
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:03,280
 is bark in my bed. But if you live in a tree, maybe they like bark. If you live in an abandoned shack,

273
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,640
 to you, I live in a mansion. Like, yes, I could probably do my dishes. I'll do my dishes. But

274
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,400
 at least I have a sink. You have an abandoned shack. If you live in a dark cave, the fact that I even

275
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,840
 have a lighting makes me deady warbucks. So the Samodiva is an actual cryptid that I could see

276
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,560
 myself in a relationship with. A Samodiva is a cryptid or a nymph that I could actually see

277
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,800
 coming over to my place. And before she tortures me to death, go, this place isn't that bad.

278
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,120
 I could see myself in a relationship with a Samodiva. But more importantly,

279
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,320
 I think a Samodiva is the only cryptid that could see itself in a relationship with me.

280
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
 Because, let's be honest, even Bigfoot would come over and be like, uh,

281
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,560
 me not know about safety of sitting down on couch. I'm like, no, dude, it's totally cool.

282
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:04,000
 What's that smell? Me smell many smells in woods. This smells like decaying elk and

283
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,280
 axe body spray. And I'm like, just get in the bed, Bigfoot. Just get in the bed.

284
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:16,080
 Mothman would just fly away. Leprechauns would be like, my luck has run out. This truly is the

285
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,120
 end of the rainbow. This is where color does not exist. But the Samodiva is a creature after

286
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:29,840
 my own heart. And in the end, she may not be seductress. No, it is I who am seducing her.

287
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:38,560
 Why does that sound so dark? What is supposed to sound? But we've run out of time for the

288
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:44,240
 Hollow Boat Story. So, the seductress episode is just those two stories. The Hollow Boat Story,

289
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,120
 though, we will tell you tomorrow. I'm going to give you a little bit of a teaser here now.

290
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:58,000
 The year is 1803 and a boat crashes onto the shore of Japan. It's 10 feet high, 17 feet wide,

291
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:07,760
 with a diamond shape bottom and a lid. And when the fishermen open it up, they find food, water,

292
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,760
 a beautiful woman, and a box she refuses to let anyone see what's inside.

293
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,000
 Yeah, I like that. I like ending that on a teaser. That's kind of cool.
