1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When archaeologists find a village built on the remains of another village, it may point

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 towards a cosmic catastrophe, and then we travel to the Grand Canyon to meet a young

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,300
 man out on a Boy Scout trip.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,380
 He thought he was just going to earn some merit badges.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,460
 But he may have unlocked the mystery of why people just disappeared.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,460
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,720
 I hope you guys enjoyed the end of yesterday's episode where I just said "Why cows?" for

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,680
 three minutes straight and then the episode just kind of ended.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,200
 Hope you guys enjoyed that.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
 I'm still wondering why cows?

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,640
 It's still very puzzling, but I'll continue to keep that puzzle in the back of my mind

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,400
 and we'll talk about it for three minutes and then just kind of end.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,240
 Instead, I'll give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Luis.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,200
 Everyone give a round of applause to Luis.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
 He's riding a cow.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
 I'm like, "Oh great.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,120
 Oh, it's back in my head."

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,440
 Luis is doing cow tricks, if that's a thing.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,320
 Luis, you're going to be our captain, our pilot of this episode.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,840
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,920
 Just help spread the word about the show.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,320
 Really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
 Luis, go ahead and hop off that cow.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,520
 I'm going to toss you the keys too.

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,040
 The dead rabbit dune buggy.

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,920
 We are leaving behind dead rabbit command.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,920
 It's a new place.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,440
 We'll have a play set coming out in 2021.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
 It's really cool.

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,560
 We are leaving behind dead rabbit command.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,200
 We are headed out to Syria.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,120
 Dead rabbit dune buggy is jumping over a bunch of sand dunes.

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
 It's pretty dope.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
 Doing tricks.

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
 Cow.

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
 Going back?

41
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
 Is it counting the back giving us a thumbs up?

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
 Or like, "What?

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 We didn't know cows had thumbs.

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
 This one does."

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,240
 We are headed out to Syria and we're going back in time.

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,480
 And I mean back in time.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
 So, I hit that time travel button, I suppose.

48
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
 It's just regular back in time.

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,440
 If you say differently, you go farther back.

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,040
 We're headed back 12,800 years ago.

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,240
 God, I don't know why I put the emphasis on the 800.

52
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,320
 That's the least impressive part.

53
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,840
 1,000 and 800 years ago.

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
 Going through the time vortex.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,720
 Now, as Luis is navigating the time vortex, I turn at you and I say, "Hey, so I found

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
 this article the other day.

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
 You're like, "This isn't every episode of your show.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,280
 Why are you making such a big deal?"

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,440
 It's all about you finding articles or people sending you articles.

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
 True.

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
 True.

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
 True.

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
 But it was interesting.

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,320
 I came across these articles the other day and it talked about RR gods created by meteorites.

65
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
 This is really, really interesting.

66
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,120
 It's a series of articles I read.

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,400
 25 or 30% of all meteorites have the same shape.

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
 It's the shape of a cone.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
 It's the shape of a conical object.

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,400
 They say that actually helps it maintain stability as it's through the atmosphere, less likely

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
 to break up.

72
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,520
 And they're specifically talking about iron meteorites.

73
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,840
 But they've been able to track back in history, King Tut, one of his knives, was made of iron

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,000
 from a meteorite, which is pretty dope.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,560
 And they know it wasn't just accidental.

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,800
 Some guy was like, "Man, I really need to make a dagger for the emperor.

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
 I'll do that."

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
 They knew, they called it from the sky.

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,920
 That was the type of iron it was.

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,000
 So they knew it was from meteorite.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,440
 You can go back and you can look at, there's Bible verses.

82
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,520
 There is a Bible verse in Acts where they talk about the statue of Diana that fell from

83
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 the sky.

84
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,080
 And people are always like, "Is that like a turn of phrase or something like that?"

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
 No.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,560
 Modern archeologists believe that the statue of Diana, the image of the goddess Diana

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,200
 or Artemis in Greek mythology, that was in her temple at Ephesias, it was described as

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,700
 a cone.

89
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,340
 It was described as a cone-shaped rock.

90
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,680
 So they think that it was a meteorite that came down.

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
 And of course she would think that was divine back then.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
 Find this thing.

93
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,200
 And they go, even modern depictions or later depictions of Diana, she had like a bunch

94
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,440
 of boobs.

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,000
 And they said that they think that was actually a modification from the--sometimes meteorites

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,800
 will land and they'll have these like weird ridges on them, that if you try to emulate

97
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,920
 them they could look like a bunch of boobs.

98
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,880
 The idea was that some of the earliest worship, idol worship, was from meteorites.

99
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,840
 Because you're in the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden there's just this chunk

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
 of iron.

101
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,400
 And if you're lucky enough, you saw it fall.

102
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,760
 But even if you were walking through a forest and there was a cone of iron just sitting on

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,600
 the forest floor, you're going to think there's something divine about them.

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,200
 But that's just a little taste for the story.

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,560
 I just kind of thought that was fascinating to talk about.

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,440
 Luis is taking us out of the time void we are now in Syria 12,800 years ago.

107
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,080
 There's a village off in the distance and Luis is being getting us closer and I kind

108
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,120
 of go, no, slow down buddy, slow down.

109
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,680
 We don't want to get too close to this place.

110
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,640
 So we're standing on a ridge and what we're looking at below us is the Syrian village

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,920
 known as Abu Hurayah.

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,600
 Now almost all of this information I got from an article on the Smithsonian website is

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
 written by Javier Barbuzano.

114
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,200
 So thank you Javier, really cool research you did on this.

115
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,920
 12,800 years ago there was a village there known as Abu Hurayah.

116
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
 Well, kind of.

117
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,800
 That's kind of what it was known as.

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,240
 Just a village is probably really unnamed at that time.

119
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,280
 So we're sitting there and it's dawn and we start to see the hunters gather up their supplies

120
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,840
 and they're going to go out and look for fresh meat.

121
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,680
 It might take them a couple of days, that's not the easiest thing to go down and track

122
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,640
 a wooly mammoth or a sea monster or whatever was in this region at the time.

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,160
 We also see the gatherer contingent, they're getting their baskets ready, they heard in

124
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,960
 the news, they heard from the papyrus, there's a cool new berry patch somewhere off in the

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,240
 mountains, it'll probably take like an 8 hour trip to get out there, get some berries man.

126
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,520
 But we know something's coming.

127
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,280
 You could warn them but we don't want to interrupt the timeline.

128
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,040
 We're just kind of sitting there, we're all eating our grilled cheese sandwiches.

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,360
 First we see it.

130
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:32,080
 We look up, even though it's a sunny day, you can see the flames in the sky.

131
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,500
 Huge fiery chunks are entering the earth's atmosphere.

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,120
 You look over at me and you go Jason are we safe distance from what I assume will be a

133
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
 catastrophe?

134
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,760
 I go probably.

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,400
 It's so loud at this point.

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,360
 You can't hear me running back to the Derev Dume buggy trying to start it.

137
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,760
 I don't know far enough away from this thing.

138
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,600
 What is going on is a comet had fragmented in space.

139
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,180
 As it was passing through our solar system, fragments of this comet begin to enter the

140
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
 earth's atmosphere.

141
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,980
 Now most of them just burnt up.

142
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,940
 But the theory is that one of them was large enough that survived the entrance into our

143
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,660
 atmosphere and when it got to a certain point, it burst in the sky.

144
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,740
 You might go that's cool, maybe like a nice little rain shower of hot iron.

145
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,640
 A bunch of new gods were born that day.

146
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,920
 No, when a comet air bursts in the sky, this is the theory.

147
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,640
 Each one is as powerful as a nuclear bomb.

148
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,360
 Let's fast forward to the year 1972.

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,160
 They're going to build a dam at Lake Assad in Syria.

150
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,000
 And archeologists know that this area is important.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,520
 They know that there used to be a really big settlement here called Abu Hurayah.

152
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,920
 It was one of the biggest settlements in the area.

153
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,240
 It was a huge center for trade, a huge agricultural center.

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,660
 It was the place to be in ancient Syria.

155
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,900
 But they're going to build a dam, it's going to be flooded, archeologists goes, "Okay,

156
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
 just give us like a year."

157
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,260
 They're like hurrying up their dust and stuff off as guys are like getting the bricks on

158
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
 the dam.

159
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,740
 The water's just kind of starting to get held back.

160
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
 They're like, "Can you slow down a bit?"

161
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
 And they're like, "No, no, we're not."

162
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,100
 They think it's hilarious watching the archeologists brush stuff super fast.

163
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,100
 They're breaking skulls.

164
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,940
 They're like, "Oh, I'm so scared."

165
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,780
 Archeologists had like a year or two to do as much as they could with this place before

166
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,320
 it was all underwater after this dam was completed.

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,520
 But as they were going through it and they knew the history of the region they knew as

168
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,880
 an agricultural center, they realized something.

169
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,120
 Abu Hurayah was built on top of another village.

170
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,000
 Now that's not super unusual.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,600
 Places got razed generally due to war or someone just wanted to rearrange the furniture so

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,520
 they knocked down all the thatched huts and built like clay adobe huts.

173
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,920
 But they started to notice something.

174
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,220
 The village underneath Abu Hurayah was Hunter Gatherer.

175
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,220
 The one on top of it was an agricultural, again, not just an agricultural place, but

176
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,540
 an agricultural powerhouse.

177
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,140
 And they go, "Okay, that makes sense.

178
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,540
 We do know that hunter gatherer societies just stopped because it got harder to find

179
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
 food.

180
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,620
 There was an ice age at a certain point that lasted like 1300 years.

181
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,860
 The woolly mammoth died off.

182
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,260
 It became more difficult.

183
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,740
 So people moved to agricultural.

184
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,720
 This isn't, again, super unusual, fascinating, but not so fascinating that I'm going to get

185
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
 drowned.

186
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
 We can't spend a lot of time.

187
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,480
 But what they start to notice is that in the old settlement, there's a ton of glass, a

188
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
 ton of minerals that should not be there.

189
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,520
 Now when I say glass, it's not like they had a neat little stained glass window there.

190
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,720
 As they were looking at it, they said, "The only thing that could burn something this

191
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
 hot, not just the glass."

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,380
 They said, "Whatever was here, the entire village was torched."

193
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,500
 They said it would take 3000 degrees Fahrenheit to do this level of damage to the soil.

194
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,220
 And no village at that time period, 12,800 years ago, would be able to generate that

195
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
 kind of heat.

196
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,940
 They said volcanoes don't generate that kind of heat.

197
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,220
 Doing all the soil samples, looking at everything they have, they come to the conclusion there

198
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,640
 is a theory that about 12,000 years ago a comet or some sort of cosmic disaster happened,

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,620
 plunged us into an ice age for 1300 years.

200
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,260
 They believe this village was ground zero.

201
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:37,040
 The theory is that a comet air burst over the village and nuked the entire area, burnt

202
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
 it to the ground.

203
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,720
 Everything that was there was instantly vaporized.

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,660
 But what they also noticed was Abu Hurayah, the town that they knew of from historical

205
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:55,540
 texts, had the same tools, they had the same cultural markers as the hunter-gatherer tribe

206
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,620
 beneath it.

207
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,980
 So the theory is that the hunters went out and the gatherers went out their respective

208
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,060
 ways.

209
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,860
 And then the village you had, the elders, you had the children, you had the children's

210
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,340
 caretakers.

211
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,220
 And while those two groups were away, the city was incinerated.

212
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,760
 When the hunters and the gatherers returned, which I'm sure they would have heard that,

213
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,280
 didn't matter if you were three days away on foot, you heard a nuclear blast.

214
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,840
 When they returned, there was nothing left of the village, which you would obviously

215
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,080
 chalk up to some sort of religious act.

216
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,640
 So the theory is because the culture seemed the same through the artifacts that the hunters,

217
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
 the gatherers came back and they just rebuilt a new town on top of it and they immediately

218
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,900
 dropped their hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

219
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
 They probably did it for a little bit.

220
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,460
 They probably weren't like, "Oh, I need to wait for this wheat to grow."

221
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,220
 No, no, no, don't hunt, don't hunt.

222
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,820
 We gotta sit there and look at this wheat.

223
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,140
 They said it wasn't the first tribe in the area to do agriculture, but it was the best

224
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
 at it.

225
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,580
 Which I'm wondering if somehow this cosmic radiation, Jason you're like, yesterday you

226
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,640
 talked about Batman comic books, the world isn't fantastic for.

227
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,980
 What if the cosmic radiation from, you're like Jason you were doing so well, just telling

228
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,320
 a good science story.

229
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:15,640
 What if the cosmic radiation from the comet actually did help them grow wheat and stuff

230
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
 there?

231
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
 Who knows?

232
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,320
 Again, that's non-scientific, but this is known as the only human population center

233
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,680
 that's ever been destroyed by a meteor or a comet.

234
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,560
 It's never happened before as far as we know.

235
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,720
 And there are people who say, "No, there was no younger dry-ass period," and that's what's

236
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,920
 called when that mini ice age happened.

237
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,420
 Yeah, it happened, but it didn't have anything to do with the comet.

238
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,620
 The science isn't fully there on that, but the archaeologists and scientists who looked

239
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,340
 at this area go, "The soil, this can only be generated by an air burst of a comet."

240
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,660
 So this could actually be proof of that theory that a comet got caught into Earth's atmosphere

241
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,260
 and plunged humanity into a mini ice age.

242
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,940
 Either way, a fascinating story, whether or not my version where Audrey II came down

243
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
 and it was like, "Grow wheat."

244
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
 They're like, "What?

245
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
 Grow wheat!"

246
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:14,040
 Or just that this is the only time we know of a human civilization being wiped out by

247
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,520
 an air burst or really in a sort of comet or meteorite.

248
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,600
 Either way, it's an interesting story of human endurance.

249
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,880
 They're like, "Oh, well, that sucked.

250
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,440
 My kids were there and they all got incinerated, but let's build another town."

251
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,760
 And it's actually now that I think about it, it is a story of human survival and human

252
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,500
 endurance, but at the end someone goes, "Well, let's just build a dam here and all got washed

253
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,900
 away even though the fire of the universe couldn't destroy this town."

254
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,180
 Eventually some guy was like, "I want fresh water in my area."

255
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,620
 So they flooded the entire thing.

256
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,780
 But either way, I find it very, very fascinating.

257
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,060
 Louise, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the carbonar copter.

258
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,260
 I have a little Audrey II in a pot.

259
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,580
 She's taking a ride with us.

260
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,220
 Let's leave behind Syria.

261
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,340
 We are headed out to the Grand Canyon.

262
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,400
 Louise is actually flying through the Grand Canyon.

263
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
 It's super dope.

264
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:11,200
 Like that movie, Blue Thunder or Airwolf or one of those helicopter things.

265
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,440
 This story actually originated on, I believe the export.

266
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,920
 I saw a green text of it online.

267
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,760
 I didn't see the original thread.

268
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
 But we don't have a year.

269
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,920
 We don't have a name.

270
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,720
 These are things that happen when stuff is posted anonymously on the web.

271
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,760
 Those are details I like, at least like a date.

272
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,620
 However, you got to play the hand your dealt.

273
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,260
 I do find it a fascinating story.

274
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,100
 So we're still going to explore it.

275
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,660
 Louise, land the helicopter right here.

276
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,140
 And we're just going to walk along the bottom of the Grand Canyon.

277
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,340
 And currently also at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, there are a bunch of Boy Scouts.

278
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,740
 They're also on a little nature hike.

279
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,260
 And the scout master is like, "Everyone, look, the Grand Canyon, this is...

280
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
 Look on both sides of you.

281
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,260
 Isn't it grand?

282
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
 There's a wall on this side.

283
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
 There's a wall on that side."

284
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,060
 There's a little creek beneath us.

285
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
 There's a swell.

286
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,120
 And the other Boy Scouts are like, "Do we get a merit badge for like looking at both

287
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
 canyon walls?"

288
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
 And he's like, "You get two merit badges."

289
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
 They're like, "All right.

290
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,680
 We're going to call the narrator of this story.

291
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,240
 Let's call him Bobby."

292
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,080
 Bobby's a 14-year-old boy.

293
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,800
 So Bobby is walking with the rest of this group through the Grand Canyon.

294
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,240
 Now he explains that there's basically two groups here.

295
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,040
 Fast walkers are at the front.

296
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
 Slower people are near the back.

297
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,560
 And he goes, "Listen, I did cross country at the time, but I had a friend who wasn't

298
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
 very fast.

299
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,500
 I kind of hung back with him because you're not just fun walking through the Grand Canyon.

300
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,140
 He also says he's a big rock nerd.

301
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,420
 Really, really enjoys the sedimentary life.

302
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,940
 So he's walking through the Grand Canyon with his buddy.

303
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,580
 And farther up ahead are the rest of them.

304
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,420
 You know, Boy Scouts are pretty self-sufficient.

305
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,780
 The Scoutman, they're not a bunch of babies.

306
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,060
 The Scoutmaster knows that the kids in back are going to be able to take care of themselves.

307
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,660
 So he's walking up there with the fast kids.

308
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,420
 Bobby's walking and he's kind of just taking in all the geological formations around him.

309
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,800
 His buddy's talking about probably Pokemon or something like that.

310
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,680
 As he's walking through the Grand Canyon with his buddy and taking in all the sights and

311
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,200
 the not sounds, just rocks, so there's no sounds, they're just there.

312
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
 He sees a vein of andesite.

313
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,560
 He thinks to himself, "That's weird."

314
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,000
 Andesite shouldn't be at this point in the Grand Canyon.

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,600
 This part of it shouldn't have that.

316
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,760
 In fact, check, I don't know.

317
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,400
 The only thing I know about the Grand Canyon is that it's a big old cut in the earth.

318
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,640
 And so he goes, "Hey, man, I'm going to go check out this andesite vein."

319
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,020
 The buddy knew he was a big rock nerd, so he didn't really think anything about it.

320
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,380
 So Bobby starts kind of climbing up little ridges in the Grand Canyon.

321
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
 He's not at the top.

322
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
 He's not spired, man.

323
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,420
 He didn't crawl all the way to the top, but he's kind of like working his way around

324
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,020
 the sides, the bottom sides of the Grand Canyon.

325
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
 He's following this andesite trail.

326
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,020
 And then he says he comes across the flower that's popping out of this andesite vein.

327
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,540
 He goes, "I've never seen a flower like it before."

328
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,300
 To be fair, he's not a flower nerd.

329
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,460
 This flower may exist, but he's looking at this flower and he said, "It was unusual

330
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,040
 because it had green petals.

331
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
 I hadn't seen a flower like this before."

332
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,640
 And as he's kind of looking at the flower, he goes, "Something in me made me want to

333
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,040
 touch the flower itself."

334
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,600
 He says that when he pressed on the flower, the leaves almost acted as some sort of Venus

335
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,680
 flytrap mechanism.

336
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:18,160
 They close shut and at the same time, pollen shoots out of the flower and gets in his face.

337
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
 This is why I like rocks.

338
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
 This is why I like rocks.

339
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,140
 They never hurt you unless it's a landslide or a rockslide of rocks, rocks, help, help.

340
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,140
 He's getting hit in the face with all this pollen and he says almost immediately his

341
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,020
 body goes into a state of panic, which would make sense.

342
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,340
 I got shot in the face with a fire extinguisher more than once actually.

343
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,540
 It sucked every time.

344
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,740
 But the first time it happened, you get panicked because you don't know what's going on.

345
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,380
 It sucks all the oxygen out of your lungs.

346
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,180
 It totally sucks, dude.

347
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,420
 I got shot in the face with a couple fire extinguishers.

348
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,080
 The first time was the worst because you just...

349
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
 [GASPING]

350
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,880
 Like, you can't...

351
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,800
 You go into an instant panic thing.

352
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,080
 Now that was fine compared to what's about to happen to this guy.

353
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,440
 But I can understand the second you're hit with some sort of bizarre powder.

354
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,560
 It does kind of freak you out.

355
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:13,000
 He said with this powder from this flower and he immediately feels fear wash over his body.

356
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,780
 Not shock where you're emotionless, but pure fear and he starts to run away from the flower.

357
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,820
 He scrambles down the mountain and at this point even the slower groups a bit ahead of

358
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,740
 him because he kind of peeled off.

359
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,900
 He's heading down, not the mountain, he's headed down the side of the Grand Canyon and

360
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,100
 he's running and he sees the slow group in front of him and he starts to slow down.

361
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,460
 The danger has passed.

362
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,140
 Whatever that flower was is gone.

363
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,080
 He's gonna go home and destroy all the flowers in his house with the mighty rock.

364
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,960
 He starts to slow down as he gets to the group and as he's slowing down the fear begins

365
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,000
 to well up in him once again.

366
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,160
 Inhuman fear.

367
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,560
 This isn't like I don't want to walk by a sewer grate because I'm afraid Pennywise is

368
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
 gonna get me.

369
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
 It's...

370
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,800
 Pennywise has me and he's about to eat my soul.

371
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,400
 It's the most intense fear you can experience.

372
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,640
 He's slowing down, he feels it begin to well up in him, he begins running again.

373
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,820
 He's running not just from the flower at this point, he's running from the fear.

374
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,700
 He runs past the slow group.

375
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,340
 "Hey Bobby where you going?"

376
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,180
 He's running.

377
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,420
 And as he's running he's feeling his body want to slow back down.

378
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,500
 But every time he slows down the fear gets worse.

379
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,700
 The only thing that keeps the fear at bay is the speed.

380
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,660
 He's running, he's running through the Grand Canyon.

381
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,980
 Imagine like a road runner cartoon, there's like dust kicking up from behind him.

382
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
 He's running.

383
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,640
 He's running so fast that he's very quickly gaining on the fast group.

384
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,280
 And they were much farther up the canyon.

385
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
 He's running and he can see the fast group in front of him.

386
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,640
 He can't stop though.

387
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,360
 He knows he can't stop.

388
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,040
 People see him just hauling down the Grand Canyon.

389
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,800
 They see a coyote shaped silhouette at the top with a box of dynamite.

390
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 They're like, "Uh."

391
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,160
 They see him running through the canyon.

392
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,360
 The Scoutmaster obviously knows something wrong.

393
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,600
 He's thinking that someone must have got injured in the slow group.

394
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,340
 And this kid's trying to warn him.

395
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,420
 But as Bobby's approaching the fast group they can tell he's not slowing down.

396
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,700
 He runs right past them.

397
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,740
 The Scoutmaster at this point is now pursuing Bobby through the Grand Canyon.

398
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,980
 As well as other Scouts are now trying to chase him down as well.

399
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,700
 They have no idea what's going on.

400
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,860
 They just know this kid is running, blows past him and is running to who knows where.

401
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,260
 Eventually the Scoutmaster catches up to Bobby.

402
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,740
 Scoutmaster gets ahold of him.

403
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,100
 Bobby needs to run.

404
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,200
 He's trying to his feeder up in the air.

405
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 His feeder kicking up in the air as the Scoutmaster is holding him.

406
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 Beep beep.

407
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,560
 The Scoutmaster supposedly, this is where the story gets a little weird, but in the

408
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,400
 flower this is where he starts to go, maybe.

409
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,000
 Scoutmaster gets the kid in a chokehold and other kids also have to hold Bobby down.

410
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,040
 And then Bobby passes out, like in an 80's action movie.

411
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,520
 You can pass out and wake up later.

412
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
 But whatever.

413
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,000
 Again, this is where the story is going.

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,980
 Yeah, maybe, but Bobby passes out and then he comes to later and everyone's standing

415
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,460
 around him and they're like, dude, what happened?

416
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,380
 And he tells the story about the flower.

417
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,260
 They're actually on their way to a Native American reservation.

418
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,460
 And when he got there, he asked, hey, you guys know anything about this flower?

419
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,660
 And they're like, no, we've never heard of anything like that.

420
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
 Now, like I said, I saw this on Reddit.

421
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,900
 So you had a bunch of people saying maybe it was Dutura, maybe it was some sort of loose

422
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,660
 indigent flower and things like that.

423
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,420
 And they're kind of picking the story apart from that angle.

424
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,200
 Going back to the green text itself, Bobby ended the story by saying, I thought this

425
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,080
 was an interesting point.

426
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,840
 He goes, that happened when I was 14 years old.

427
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,040
 Every time I hear in the news or when I'm looking at stuff like Missing 411 or things

428
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 like that, and you hear about people disappearing in one location and then they're found 30

429
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,520
 miles away and people always go, there's no way they could have done that.

430
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
 There's no way they could have made that journey.

431
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,600
 He said he ran six miles in 30 minutes.

432
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,740
 He goes, I'm a fit guy, like he said, he was doing cross country, but I was completely

433
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
 wasted.

434
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,820
 They actually, when they were trying to figure out a way to get him out of the Grand Canyon,

435
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,460
 at a certain point they were like talking about they went and got a horse to help get

436
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,820
 him out of there because he was so physically beat, but he was able to get back to his feet.

437
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,340
 But six miles and 30 minutes, he shouldn't have been able to do that.

438
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,660
 Around a five minute mile is doable, but to be able to keep that up for six miles is very,

439
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,060
 very difficult.

440
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,700
 So that is an endurance thing.

441
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,040
 He goes, but I reminded of my own experience with that flower whenever I hear about people

442
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,440
 who are missing in one location and are found 30 miles away up on a cliff or something like

443
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,640
 that.

444
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,240
 That's an interesting little clue to stories like missing 411, where you have someone,

445
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,440
 a kid even, go missing in the bushes and then they're found on the edge of a mountain top,

446
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,320
 dead, people go, there's no way this kid could get up there.

447
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,040
 But if the kid was under the influence of some sort of adrenaline drug, you could take

448
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,420
 someone who was six or seven and basically run until they died.

449
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
 That's what Bobby said.

450
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,060
 He goes, if I was there by myself, I truly feel I would have ran until I just died.

451
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
 I would have kept running.

452
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,500
 And when I fell down to the ground, I would run in the circles, run in the circle like

453
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,900
 the three stuages, whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop whoop
