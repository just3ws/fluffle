1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
 Fires burned through the Amazon this summer, and standing in the ashes and the smoke is

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,540
 the man responsible for it all, Leonardo DiCaprio.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:21,200
 And then we travel to mining country, where a story has been passed around for decades.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,880
 Was there really an ancient chamber discovered by simple miners, and when they broke through,

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,920
 a beast murdered them all.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:42,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
 day too.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,680
 Just a quick reminder, this is the last week, and then I'm gonna take a week long break.

11
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,960
 I take a week long break every 50 episodes, so these next 5 episodes are leading up to

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
 that.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,480
 So thanks guys for listening to the show, but also for the Thanksgiving special, that

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,280
 was a lot of fun to do.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,880
 After that, I did another live stream where we watched Jesse James meets Frankenstein's

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,480
 daughter, it was like me and about 12 other people for about an hour and a half watched

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,720
 it, but it was a lot of fun interacting with you guys watching the movie, I was able to

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 kind of relax.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,960
 And then after that, after everyone went to bed, I decided to watch another movie by myself

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,600
 late at night, it completely ruined my Thanksgiving, absolutely ruined my Thanksgiving.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,840
 You know when the Joker came out, when the Joker movie came out, I went and saw that

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,520
 opening days of the movie theater, all that stuff, talked about Joker a bunch.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 Now there was a big push in the media, I saw a bunch of articles saying, "Joker celebrates

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,680
 in cell culture if you want to see the same movie, but it doesn't celebrate in cells,

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,120
 it doesn't celebrate," watch this movie called "Cuck."

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:03,760
 And I was like, "Oh, okay, so I was vaguely aware of the movie Cuck, I knew it was supposedly

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:11,760
 like the Joker, what I imagined it to be was, you know how God's Not Dead is a movie, is

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,480
 a series of movies now, but basically it's a movie where all the good guys are Christian

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,080
 and all the bad guys aren't Christian, very, very black and white, to the point that in

30
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,080
 the first God, in the first God's Not Dead movie, there is a Muslim girl listening to

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,720
 the Bible on tape, she has like an iPod, right, she's downloaded Bible verses, and her Muslim

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,120
 father comes into the, I'm trying not to laugh, this is a horrible thing, but it's just so

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,760
 ridiculous in the context of this movie, because they're like in the middle of Idaho where

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,440
 this movie takes place, this Muslim girl's listening to Bible verses on her iPod, her

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,120
 dad comes in and beats the crap out of her, because like she takes the headphones out

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,560
 and he hears like Psalms 8, "Let the joy of the Lord be poured upon you," and he's like,

37
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,320
 "What?" and he starts beating her, it's completely over the top, there's like all these characters,

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,560
 and at the end, all of the new Christians meet at some concert for like DC talk or whatever,

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,920
 Jars of Clay, doesn't matter, very, very just good, that's what I thought, I thought Cuck

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,120
 was gonna be a good laugh, thought it was gonna be a movie, I thought it was gonna be

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,280
 a movie bordering on parody, where a kid, a young kid watches like four Ben Shapiro

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,520
 videos and then goes out and starts like beating up minorities, I thought it was gonna be this

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:36,840
 complete black and white, chuckle-fest movie that was totally heavy-handed, it might have

44
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:45,360
 been one of the ugliest movies I've seen since "Gateway Meet," and the fact that I'm comparing

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:53,640
 it to a movie called "Gateway Meet" should tell you the level of, the movie is like watching

46
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,920
 cancer grow, and you may think, Jason, you're really hyping this up, I'm not recommending

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,400
 people to see this movie, it ruined my Thanksgiving, and what's really weird, it is the exact same

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,080
 movie as Joker, it's the exact same movie, you have a guy who's living with an elderly

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,400
 single mother who's very, very sick, who has delusions of grandeur and a plan to get out

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,720
 of their current cycle, and just the worst possible things happen to these people.

51
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,640
 In Joker, he gets beat up, a bunch of dudes, he's holding up a street sign, a bunch of

52
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:38,080
 dudes beat up, Arthur Fleck, and Cuck, another dude jacks off on him, I mean, the stuff that

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,760
 the Cuck goes through is so much worse than what Arthur Fleck went through, again, it's

54
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,840
 not a movie I would necessarily recommend, because it's probably one of the ugliest movies

55
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,200
 I've ever seen, it's just so tough, there's a scene in it, and this might seem like a

56
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,600
 bit of a spoiler, if you whole movie you don't, I'm probably talking about this for a little

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
 bit longer than I planned to, but there's this whole thing in the beginning where you

58
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,000
 don't know, his father's dead but you don't know how, or why, or if he's not dead if he's

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,480
 left, if he's just out of the picture, and he wears his father's military uniform, and

60
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,240
 he looks like a boy wearing an adult clothes, and it's the perfect way to start the movie,

61
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,440
 because he really is a boy in an adult world, he's in his 20s, but just acts like a child.

62
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,800
 When we find out, in Joker, we find out, spoiler alert, that he was beaten as like a six year

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,720
 old, and that's what gave him the laughing, that part is pretty stupid, he gets hit so

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,960
 hard as a kid, it makes him laugh all the time, that part was really dumb, and Joker,

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,720
 in this movie, so you're like, okay that's horrible, six year old Joker is tied to a radiator

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 and beat up, he's hit so hard that he has a laughing disorder, and Cuck, we find out,

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,800
 again, totally worse, we find out that when he was a baby, when Cuck, when that's his

68
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,600
 name now, when Cuck was a baby, Cuck Finn, when he was a baby, we see in a flashback,

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,920
 his dad blows his brains out, kills himself, the dad kills himself while holding Cuck,

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:22,280
 baby Cuck, and the baby begins playing with the wound in the head, playing with the brains.

71
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,520
 That's the difference between these two movies, one of them was like, oh this guy was kind

72
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,720
 of like punched, punched so hard 20 years ago, now he laughs, the other one was, I played

73
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,840
 with my dad's open wound, totally ruined my Thanksgiving, but if you're a fan of extreme

74
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,880
 cinema, watch Cuck, and I don't recommend it, that one on far longer than I thought it

75
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,040
 was going to, but I just wanted to share my misery, I wanted to share my misery with you

76
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,560
 guys, let's go ahead and move on to our first topic, Amazon, let's hop in the Carbinder

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
 Coptor, we're headed to the Amazon jungle, the, what do they call it, the scuba gear of

78
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,160
 the planet or something like that, the lungs of the planet, the lungs of the planet, a

79
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,720
 bunch of oxygen comes from, comes from the Amazon, comes from trees and stuff like that,

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
 whatever, trees are burning down, trees are burning down since the beginning of time,

81
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,520
 I get it that these trees, this was a particularly bad forest fire, I got these notes written

82
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,640
 down, last year there was like 10,000 forest fires, this year there was 30,000, but that

83
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,800
 includes like just one tree burning, which I get it is still bad, but Jair Bolsonaro,

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:43,240
 Jair Bolsonaro, he is the president of Brazil or its prime minister or something like that,

85
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,640
 I think he's president, I don't know, I don't pay attention to anything outside the United

86
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,760
 States, I don't know if you guys haven't caught on to that, I specifically read an article

87
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:58,720
 about this guy and I don't know what political office he holds, USA, USA, now America is

88
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,480
 the lung of the planet and the heart, the spleen probably, America is also probably the spleen

89
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:13,360
 of the planet, maybe pinkries, anyways so Jair Bolsonaro believes that the forest fires,

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,560
 most people believe the forest fires are man made, that ranchers were setting stuff on fire

91
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,160
 to make room for cattle, but Jair Bolsonaro says no, that's not it, I know who's responsible

92
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,040
 for the forest fires, it's Leonardo DiCaprio, people are like what?

93
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,360
 And he goes okay okay that's ridiculous, that's ridiculous, and the reporters are like oh

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,160
 okay that makes sense, I thought our president was just saying that Leonardo DiCaprio was

95
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,780
 setting fires, the president goes no, no, I'm not saying he's out there personally setting

96
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,440
 fires but he is supporting, he's giving money to the people who set those fires, people

97
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,920
 are like what is going on, so this is the thing, apparently there's a bunch of volunteer

98
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,160
 firefighters down in the Amazon, brain water everywhere, putting fires out as you do, but

99
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:07,080
 these firefighters have been accused of setting fires, so they're fire lighters, the motive

100
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,220
 is this, the World Wildlife Fund, the WWF is raising tons of money based on the Amazon

101
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,540
 fires, oh no we gotta stop the fires, you know panda bears are losing their homes, they

102
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,340
 actually happened in Australia, I guess there was a huge fire in Australia and they're like

103
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:29,460
 well wait not panda bears, koala bears, panda bears in China, they said, I guess there was

104
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,620
 a big fire in Australia and people were like oh you can guess the koala bears don't have

105
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,240
 homes no more, gonna be extinct, no more littlest koala, what was that show on, there was that

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,200
 trippy show on Nickelodeon about the koala and it would like go to other dimensions,

107
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,640
 I think it was the littlest koala, it was these two koalas, it was like anime on Nickelodeon

108
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,960
 in the early 90s and it had all this dream time aborigine stuff, nothing to do with

109
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,440
 the story, totally going off topic here, but anyways so the koala bears are gonna have

110
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,720
 a hard time finding, that's not part of the story either, but they're gonna have a hard

111
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,220
 time finding a home, back to the story, Amazon Ray Force totally on fire, so he's saying

112
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:14,180
 that the World Wildlife Federation, WWF is setting fires, having amateur, not amateur,

113
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,940
 yeah amateur, volunteer is the word, totally different, well I guess you can be an amateur

114
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,900
 and a volunteer but just because you're a volunteer doesn't mean you're an amateur,

115
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,980
 he believes that the WWF is setting fires in Brazil, taking photos of said fires and

116
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:36,680
 using them to get money and supposedly Leonardo DiCaprio donated $500,000 to the WWF to fight

117
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,440
 these fires and they've arrested those four volunteer firefighters, now they've been released

118
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,680
 but they're still gonna be tried for setting these fires, now here's the weird, obviously

119
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,920
 here's the, there's a lot of things to unpack here, here's the weird thing about this, so

120
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,720
 he says these guys, we don't know obviously if the people really set those fires, that

121
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,940
 will be for the trial to be held, the media says you are such a corrupt president that

122
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,540
 you are trying to hide your corruption from us by saying those people set fires, which

123
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:20,180
 to me is a weird defense because you're saying, okay let's say I was a super corrupt president

124
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,660
 and people are investigating me, I, there's a hundred other things I could say rather

125
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,840
 than Leonardo DiCaprio is setting fires in the Amazon, which was close to his original

126
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:38,920
 statement because Leonardo DiCaprio supposedly gave $500,000 to the WWF and they're saying

127
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,560
 you're using this to distract, now there's a, if you were a president you could say the

128
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,340
 drug problem's too high or kids with their fidget spinners, right, am I right, like there's

129
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,800
 a lot of other stuff, it's a weird conspiracy theory to make up if you want to divert attention

130
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:03,320
 from yourself, you wouldn't say I saw Bigfoot, you wouldn't say a ridiculous conspiracy theory,

131
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:12,900
 so listen it's probably not true but I also wouldn't put it past somebody to do that,

132
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,400
 to set fires and then take pictures of it and then use it to get donations, now Leonardo

133
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,440
 DiCaprio has come forward and this is an all other weird part of the story, Leonardo DiCaprio

134
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,120
 comes forward and says, I didn't give him any money, like I appreciate, I'm paraphrasing

135
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,280
 obviously, I appreciate what the WWF does but I have not donated any money to them,

136
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,400
 I've donated money to other charities that are fighting the Amazon Rainforest but not

137
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:45,540
 the WWF specifically, which was another weird thing, he wasn't saying this isn't true, which

138
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,060
 to be fair Leonardo DiCaprio has better things to do than defend the WWF from a ridiculous

139
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,420
 conspiracy theory but it's also telling, again as a conspiracy theorist you could go well

140
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,940
 that's weird, he didn't say well that's not true and I'm gonna write a check to them today,

141
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,940
 he says I never gave him any money so the fact that I'm being brought into this conspiracy

142
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,960
 theory is ridiculous to begin with, I have nothing to do with them, they do good work

143
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,240
 but I didn't have anything to do with them, if I was Leonardo DiCaprio, first I was president,

144
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
 now I'm Leonardo DiCaprio, first off I know how to pronounce my name, for some reason

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,280
 I keep saying Leonardo, that's how you pronounce it, right, Leo, Leonardo DiCaprio, I don't

146
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:37,280
 know, I feel like I've been mispronouncing it, Leonardo, it's not Leonardo, Leonardo,

147
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,700
 Leonardo, Leonardo, whatever, it doesn't matter, Mr. DiCaprio, if I was Mr. DiCaprio I would

148
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:50,340
 say that's ridiculous, no, they didn't start these fires, the end, and also I didn't donate

149
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:58,180
 the money but you sir, the fact that he didn't deny it is odd and so just a weird conspiracy

150
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:04,340
 theory, now, hey everybody welcome back, see you didn't take a break, I did, I had to take

151
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,880
 what is going to be turned a heater break, had to turn the heater on and get this apartment

152
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,000
 a little warmer, the snow is here, the snow is here, I would do anything for an Amazonian

153
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,520
 forest fire right now, I guess technically I could just set a forest on fire, it doesn't

154
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,760
 have to be Amazonian but it's freezing, let's go ahead and move on to our last story of the

155
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,680
 night, we're gonna leave behind the beautiful warm fields of Amazon, I guess they're fields

156
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,820
 now because all the trees have burned down, oh it feels so warm there, I'm setting fires,

157
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,300
 Leonardo DiCaprio I see him, he's like handing me some gas, he's like here you go, but this

158
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,640
 is not fossil fuel gas, this is environmentally sound gas so it's just air, I'm just spraying

159
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:55,260
 air everywhere, anyways thanks Leo for nothing, I leave, we leave, I leave, you stay there,

160
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,180
 you're hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm like uh huh, because you can pronounce

161
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,280
 his name correctly, he wants to hang out with you, so while you guys are partying with Mr.

162
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:11,640
 DiCaprio, I'm, and I'm flying the helicopter all lonely through the sky, aww I have sad

163
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:18,600
 ending, but you chose to hang out with Mr. DiCaprio, enjoy his podcast jerks, and so

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,400
 I land, get out at Dixonville, Pennsylvania, walking around all by myself, hmm I wonder

165
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,380
 where my listeners are, you guys are in the party jet with Leonardo DiCaprio, he's like

166
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,380
 yes, you guys have all, have do whatever you want, see those hot models over there, make

167
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,980
 out with them, or if you're not into that, have a good conversation with them, they all

168
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,620
 have PhDs, so some of you are making out with them, some of you are talking about economics,

169
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,440
 Leonardo DiCaprio still can't pronounce the name correctly, his jet lands, it lands on

170
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:59,480
 top of the Carbentercopter, I've officially become the cuck, ugh that movie was so depressing,

171
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,780
 and the Carbentercopter is destroyed, you guys all get out, you're still partying, and

172
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,880
 I'm just kinda sitting there on a rock, like thanks guys for finally showing up, thanks

173
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,080
 for destroying my only motogenthridation air vehicle, oh wait I have the dirgeable still,

174
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,280
 let's get on topic, listen the narration is, we've set the mood, we are in Dixonville,

175
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:28,200
 Pennsylvania, and the year is 1944, there was a mining disaster, pfft rocks, mysteriously

176
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,760
 15 men and Leonardo DiCaprio died in this mining disaster, I pushed him in front of

177
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,960
 a boulder and I'm like take my friends will you, ahhhhhhh, so now it's just me and you,

178
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:47,040
 it's me and you, stripping his plane for parts, rebuild, I guess I'm gonna just use the airplane,

179
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,800
 and instead I'm rebuilding the Carbentercopter, mining disaster 1944, Dixonville, Pennsylvania,

180
00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:00,880
 15 men and one gorgeous young man died in this accident, now they bring in accident inspector

181
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,520
 Glenn E. Barger, Glenn E. Barger, Glenn middle name E. Barger, now they bring him in and

182
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,240
 they're like hey we need to find out what happened to this mine, we need to find out

183
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,480
 like was it like a bomb to go off, was it Wiley Coyote around here, was it a simple cave in,

184
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,840
 what happened, so he's like yes, I will investigate this cave in, that is my job, that is why

185
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,600
 I'm here, and they're like but before you go on to the cave, before you start looking

186
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,760
 around we gotta show you something, and he's like ooh is it that new Mickey Mantle baseball

187
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,080
 card, ooh is it, I wonder when baseball cards were invented actually, I bet you they were

188
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,840
 invented like in the late 1800s, just saw this on my head, and now I know right when

189
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,920
 I said that, a bunch of you thought Jason baseball wasn't even around in the late 1800s,

190
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,640
 but weren't they playing it during the Civil War, like weren't they playing baseball back

191
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,800
 then, I wonder how much of my audience listens to this podcast just to get angry, just to

192
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:05,640
 be like how can one man know so little about so much, like he can go on and on about Big

193
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,040
 Foot, he can go on and on about UFOs, but if you ask him when baseball was invented,

194
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,480
 or when the first baseball card was printed, he will be wildly off, I'm, you know what,

195
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,600
 I'm gonna look it up right now, I'm gonna look it up when was baseball invented, I'm

196
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,960
 gonna say right now Civil War, let's find out how close I am, thrilling podcasting I

197
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:39,560
 know, when was baseball invented, 1846, so yes, so baseball was around pre-Civil War,

198
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,840
 nice, I was, I was very very, now let's see when the first baseball card was, you're like

199
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:53,680
 Jason this isn't even the topic that you promised us, when was the, when was the first baseball

200
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:08,920
 card made, 1886, bam dude, all you doubters out there, because I get so many facts wrong,

201
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,160
 bam, you guys thought I was gonna get humiliated on my own podcast, you're wrong, that's gonna

202
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,120
 happen next episode, or probably this episode as well, you guys are all standing around,

203
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,240
 you're still 1944, you guys are just waiting here, story about a mysterious cave-in, I'm

204
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,560
 going on about baseball cards, Glenn Barger is looking at me being like dude, who is this

205
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,120
 lunatic, I'm sorry guys, I don't remember why I got on this subject, oh yeah I made a joke

206
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,960
 about Mickey Mantle, anyways the point being is that they do have something to show him,

207
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,960
 and so now I'm going to be quiet for a second, I'm gonna, that's why you guys abandoned me

208
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,080
 in the Amazon, you guys are like Leonardo DiCaprio never went off on segues and talked

209
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,040
 about baseball cards during a monster story, I'm like I know I miss him already too, but

210
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,800
 anyways so Glenn Barger says, yeah let me see what you got, so the, this mining company

211
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,280
 executive in this chair set, he just like come over here, and they throw back like a

212
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,640
 blanket, let me, okay let me build a picture, that's vague, where they at, bed, bath and

213
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,880
 beyond, then that'd be totally normal, there's a body laying on the ground, I forgot that

214
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,400
 key detail, covered with a blanket, and they throw the blanket off, and Glenn goes, I've

215
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,320
 never seen a rock leave injuries like this, and the mining executive is like me, neither,

216
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,360
 and the sheriff's deputy goes, those look more like the wounds that a wild animal might

217
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:45,120
 give a man, not a stalactite, or a stalagmite, and Glenn Barger stands up and goes, you're

218
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:57,200
 stalag right, so, yeah, afterwards, afterwards, they, I'm sorry, Glenn goes into this cave,

219
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,000
 I'm quite proud of that joke by the way, came up, bit off the top of my head, Glenn goes

220
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 in the cave starts looking around, and they start finding more bodies, now there's one

221
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,600
 or two of them, just giant rock fell from the ceiling, crushed them, just like a grape,

222
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,680
 like putting your thumb on a grape, but there are other bodies that have, what could only

223
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:25,440
 be described as claw marks, deep, not like a little raccoon claw, we're talking like

224
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,880
 fingernails, like little katana blades, like if you took a little knife and cut a grape,

225
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,680
 and so he's walking around, he has another inspector with him, and they're like, and

226
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,240
 they notice that there's supposedly 15 miners that didn't come out of the cave, and they

227
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,040
 found a couple of them now, but there's a lot of them missing, and then he hears screaming

228
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,960
 down the tunnel, and Glenn turns, you know, I think one of the worst sounds in the world

229
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,160
 is a man screaming, it's horrifying, I think I might have mentioned this before, it absolutely

230
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,360
 terrifies me, and here's why, I think as a society really, you become immune to the

231
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,120
 sound of a woman screaming, because you hear it all the time in horror movies, and also

232
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,880
 a lot of times women will scream when they're happy, you go, hey, here's your engagement

233
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,320
 ring, they're like, but you know, a lot of times girls will scream when they're having

234
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,720
 fun, roller coaster, stuff like that, but also you hear it so often in horror movies,

235
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,120
 when you hear a man scream, it's chilling, because you never, ever hear it, ever, super

236
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,320
 terrifying, but anyways, he hears this man screaming, and sleep tight kids, the sound

237
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,360
 of men screaming all night, he goes running and he sees his buddy, his fellow inspector,

238
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,840
 in a cave system, like in a, in a site, they're all in a cave system, that's not, that's not

239
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,200
 a shock to him, he's like, oh my god, we're underground, what?

240
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,920
 So he sees like a cave off to the side, like a tunnel, I guess is the term, and he sees

241
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:03,920
 what appears to be some sort of monster attacking his buddy, and then the rocks, like form up,

242
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,520
 like old school stop motion, and seal the tunnel, so now Glenn is separated from his

243
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,760
 buddy, so he's like, come on guys, let's move these rocks, and they start moving these rocks

244
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,080
 away, and then a bunch of stop motion skeletons show up, and they start fighting them like

245
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,280
 old timey Jason the Argonauts, but no, in real life, they move all the rocks away, and

246
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,720
 his buddy is okay, but there was some sort of monster down there, and the quote was,

247
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,080
 the thing wasn't human, and they never found the bodies of the other missing miners, and

248
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,960
 the theory, working theory was this, that these miners were working in a cave, and they

249
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,680
 broke into an old cave system, and one of the people who got out of the cave and survived

250
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,360
 this incident said, this is all reported in the newspaper, we'll get into that in a second,

251
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:57,560
 but one of the men says, I'm in the caves, and we were mining, picking with the picks,

252
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,160
 you know, do do do do do do, that's like a Middle Eastern snake charming song, I was

253
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,640
 trying to do whistle while you work, but they're moving stuff around, I wonder if miners always

254
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,640
 get tired of dwarf jokes, back then they were probably always getting made fun of for being

255
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,360
 dwarves, so you could assume one of them went on a crazed pickaxe killing spree, but anyways,

256
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,200
 he goes no, that didn't happen, we're going on segways, Jason, the miner says to me,

257
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,520
 he goes, and then he turns to the rest of you in a dress, this is what happened, we

258
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,200
 were doing our thing in the cave, we were mining, and we broke through to an ancient

259
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,640
 tunnel that was like parallel to us, it was next to us, and then this creature came out

260
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,440
 of it and started attacking people and was making rocks fly around and making cave ins,

261
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:52,880
 and I ran out, because I was scared, I'm super spooky, so the Glenbarger takes his report

262
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,280
 and never releases it, ever, but then how do we know this stuff, how do we know this

263
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,360
 stuff, what happened was in the 70s his son finds this report, he's going through his

264
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,880
 stuff, his dad passed away, mysteriously, a giant rock fell on him, no his dad passes

265
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:21,120
 away, the son, Barger Jr., Mr. Young Barger, whatever his name is, he finds this report

266
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:29,200
 and then he takes it to a local journalist named Stony Brakefield, and he published this

267
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,340
 story in News Extra, Pennsylvania's newspaper News Extra, he published it in 1974, 30 years

268
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:41,200
 after the attack in Dixonville's mining system.

269
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,940
 So this story has been going around for quite a long time online, it hasn't gotten super

270
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,960
 viral, but it's not hard to find resources on it, a lot of people have covered it, and

271
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,440
 one person in particular covered it, and I gotta give credit to this website, it's called

272
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,560
 the Paranormal Pastor, Paranormal Pastor basically did all the research of the after

273
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,860
 events, the stuff that I normally have to do, so hats off to the Paranormal Pastor for

274
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,940
 this, my first thing is looking at the story as I go, that's dope, that's totally awesome,

275
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:20,100
 monster underground, chopping people up, eating dudes, making them disappear, making Geomancy,

276
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,620
 controlling the rocks, all that type of stuff, really cool, really cool thing, but it's probably

277
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:32,460
 not true, so let's find out, the easiest thing for us to track down is the newspaper, News

278
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,440
 Extra, Pennsylvania's New Extra, doesn't exist, newspaper never existed, so that's the easiest

279
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,000
 place to start, the guy who runs the Paranormal Pastor did some more digging, there are mines

280
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,840
 in Pennsylvania obviously, and there are mines in Dixonville, but there's no mines by that

281
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 name, they named it the Dixonville Mine, I think it was like Dixonville Mine 22 or something

282
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,520
 like that, there was no disaster in the year of 1944, again, you know mine disasters are

283
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,900
 very, very well documented because they usually turn into lawsuits, there's all sorts of paperwork

284
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,380
 filled out, they're run by corporations that have to report it in their books, now I'm

285
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,980
 not saying that obviously they're an illegal mining operation, they're not going to have

286
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,940
 any paperwork or the best paperwork, but generally mines that are run by companies are very well

287
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,180
 documented, they would have to show, oh there was an accident this year, this is how many

288
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,980
 people we lost, this is government oversight, these are the penalties we paid, these are

289
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,240
 the lawsuits we had to file, or settle with the families and all that stuff, so we're

290
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,280
 losing a bunch of the information, and then actually he goes on to say Paranormal Pastor

291
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,920
 says I searched and there is no Stony Brake Field, there is no reporter by that name,

292
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,800
 so this story is interesting for two reasons, one it's a cool little monster story, it has

293
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,360
 all the hallmarks, it has people in an area that normal humans don't go to, it took place

294
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,800
 a long time ago, and you have this monster running around in the darkness gutting people,

295
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,140
 just like a horror story, and I think that's why it spread so much on the internet, this

296
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,580
 is what's fascinating about this, and the reason why I wanted to cover this isn't just

297
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:12,540
 because it's kind of a cool spooky story, because of the implications, the implications.

298
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,020
 What I think is interesting, we talk a lot about deep things, we talk a lot about video

299
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,500
 footage being manipulated to look like it's real, and that has implications on two sides,

300
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,860
 one if somebody, if I want to make it look like my political opponent eats babies, then

301
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:33,320
 I can have doctor footage to show my political opponent eating babies, and on the same factor,

302
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,240
 if I do actually eat babies, I could then say that wasn't me, that was a deep fake, and

303
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,120
 they're like, sir we're watching you eat a baby during this press conference where you're

304
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,280
 denying it, you're like I'm hungry, but that video, that was fake, so can people are afraid

305
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,320
 that deep fakes are going to work both ways?

306
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,520
 I think that the cryptid game, because we've covered a lot of stories like this where people

307
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,940
 have totally made stuff up and when you track it back there was no newspaper of that time,

308
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,980
 there was no op, this isn't new, we've covered a lot of stories where they were totally made

309
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,700
 up and when you look back and they'll be like this was reported in the Atlantic as that,

310
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,580
 and you're like what, that newspaper doesn't exist, it might exist, but you know just an

311
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
 example.

312
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,020
 I think the people who tell these stories, tell these legends going forward, are going

313
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:23,020
 to start using real sources and real names, because a key component to finding out this

314
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,340
 story was fake, definitely for me to start off was that the newspaper didn't even exist.

315
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,480
 If the person making up the story used a real newspaper, found an article written by someone

316
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,280
 with a byline in that newspaper, which wouldn't be hard, which wouldn't be super difficult,

317
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,280
 that person could be dead, that person could be old, whatever, it wouldn't matter.

318
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,000
 If I saw, whoa, there was a news extra newspaper in Pennsylvania in operation in 1944 and Stoney

319
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,420
 Brakefield is a real journalist, that would make me start to lean more towards, hmm, this

320
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
 is real.

321
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,140
 Now, obviously the other things he would have to, the person who made the story up, would

322
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:08,580
 have to make it take place in a real mine, and then in the story include the point, because

323
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:14,420
 of the mysterious events that took place, there is no record of this mine disaster, the government

324
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,660
 covered it up.

325
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:21,120
 It's that suspicious, obviously, but it works better than all of those verifiable details

326
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
 being made up.

327
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,800
 Most of these stories, this is creepypasta, most of these stories are made up to entertain

328
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,180
 the author and then to creep out teenagers and stuff.

329
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,240
 And then it spreads and it gets into the paranormal community and people act like it's a real

330
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
 thing.

331
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,920
 And again, I don't know how much, I don't know how many of these paranormal websites

332
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,580
 just know that this stuff is nonsense and stuff is fake and they just want clicks or

333
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:53,180
 they actually believe in it, it's sometimes hard to tell, but, and really conspiracy theories

334
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:59,560
 are creepypasta, that is already using real life events.

335
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,220
 This X happened, therefore it was the government or it was the Illuminati that did this.

336
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,620
 That's really, and then it gathers around the internet that narrative builds, that's

337
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
 a creepypasta.

338
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,600
 But we're gonna see that same method attribute itself to monsters running around in a cave.

339
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,600
 It will be very soon that only basic common sense will keep you from being tricked about

340
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,800
 a story involving monsters or semen, not that type, or you know like creatures from the

341
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 deep.

342
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,620
 Only common sense.

343
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,960
 And common sense is, even for me, a fleeting thing.

344
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,580
 Because sometimes you get a story that's so juicy and so scary, you want to believe it

345
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,540
 so badly that common sense goes out the window.

346
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:51,820
 And if our ability to debunk these stories is overridden by a master storyteller, who

347
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,460
 knows what we're gonna be believing in the coming years.

00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,900
