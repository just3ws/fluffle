1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 A breaking news story that may mean the end of the world.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,800
 And then we take a look at one of the newest conspiracy theories that's blowing up right now.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:18,300
 Is it possible that buildings are evil and they plan to take over the universe today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,000
 [music]

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,300
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's 8 a.m. I'm already sweating.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:43,800
 Let's go. Let's go ladies and gentlemen. First off, let's get it so hot here. First off, let's give a shout out to our newest supporter, Marshall Blevins.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,500
 Marshall, Marshall, thank you so much for supporting this show. Really, really helps out a lot.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,300
 If you can't support the Patreon, go ahead and help get the word out about the show.

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:59,700
 That also helps spread the word, talk about it online, in real life, whatever you do, hire a skyrider, any way to help get the word out about the show.

11
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,000
 That would be awesome.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,500
 Marshall, let's go ahead and hop into Dead Rabbit Dreadnought, our vaunted battleship. We're gonna take it. We're leaving behind Oregon.

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,800
 We're headed to Puerto Rico. This is actually a breaking story. I had something else planned and this popped up. This article just popped up.

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,300
 I find it weird that nobody's talking about this, because I'm gonna make some comparisons to another story that blew up.

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,800
 We're going to Puerto Rico. It's August 10th, 2020. We're in Puerto Rico. It's 2.45 a.m.

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 So everyone's asleep on the island. A little parakeet that's sleeping. A little lemurs are sleeping.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,200
 I'm out of gas car. I don't think they're in Puerto Rico.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,300
 But somewhere off in the middle of the forest and/or jungle, I don't know what the biome is in Puerto Rico.

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:55,800
 There is the Arcebo Observatory. It's that giant radio telescope that you've seen in GoldenEye and you killed guys in GoldenEye on that level.

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,100
 And it was also in a couple other movies. And it has real-world implications. But just so you know, it looks like it's a giant crater.

21
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,100
 There's a giant satellite dish in it. It's 2.45 a.m. Lemurs everywhere are unconscious.

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,100
 And then there's like this big cable that is like connecting stuff with the antenna.

23
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,600
 And it's like, I'm trying to build a scene here. Okay, guys, just go with me.

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,400
 It's 8 a.m. I'm sweating. We're already starting the episode. This isn't a good sign.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,700
 There's a big old cable, right? 2.45 a.m. Lemurs asleep. There, we're all caught up.

26
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,100
 And the cable starts going...

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:34,600
 And then it's like...

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,300
 And it smashes into a bunch of stuff.

29
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,900
 Now, it would have been really cool if people were there to watch it to see it so they could be like, "Look out. It's a cable!"

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,100
 And like people are like jumping over it. I don't think you...

31
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,000
 I think the cable is actually like bigger than two human bodies. I don't think it's like a wire that you could jump rope.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,500
 Anyways, mood is built. Let's get to the actual story here. This is whatever the waste of time that was.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,300
 The cable... So what happened? Let me get to this. So what happened? Was it 2.45 a.m.?

34
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:10,300
 Lemurs may or may not have been asleep at that time, but this cable broke free for lack of a better term.

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:20,100
 It broke free from its harness and smashed into the radio telescope, cutting a 100-foot swath through the main dish.

36
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:27,400
 Now, this thing has withstood hurricanes and earthquakes, and it's been around for about 53 years at this point.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
 I think it was built back in the '60s.

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,300
 And they've done regular maintenance on it. It survived budget cuts, the most disastrous of all disasters.

39
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,600
 Congress was constantly trying to cut funding to it. They had to keep finding money from other sources.

40
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,000
 But this cable may actually do it in. It was actually the world's largest radio telescope for a long time until they built one in China.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,200
 But it smashed. It smashed up good.

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,600
 Why is this a breaking story? Why do we really care? They're a bunch of nerds. Old toy from the '60s got destroyed.

43
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,200
 Well, this thing has two uses. It has a bunch of uses.

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,000
 But the two things that are important to us as homo sapiens is it detected asteroids, right?

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,600
 So that's something you want to detect way before.

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,400
 But we have other things that can do that. It was mainly famous for the SETI program.

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,300
 That's the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

48
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,600
 It was constantly... That's where... Other than you guys who have played a lot of GoldenEye or saw the movie once,

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,100
 it's mostly known for the SETI project. So we were using it to try to detect alien broadcasts.

50
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,100
 And then they had to start doing the METI project. It was messaging extraterrestrial intelligence.

51
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:44,300
 So Carl Sagan famously beamed out the Arcebo message, which was like a little pixelated picture, sent it out into deep space.

52
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,800
 So it has some applications in the world of the paranormal supernatural alien stuff as well.

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,700
 And also it's not getting destroyed by an asteroid. You can't investigate ghosts.

54
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,200
 If everyone's a ghost, it's the new catchphrase for this show.

55
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,800
 When they look at what happened, the first thing was the cable snapped.

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,700
 If you look at some articles for this, they'll say the cable snapped and it smashed up all this stuff.

57
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,000
 And not only did it cut 100 foot swaps through the dish itself,

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,200
 it kept hitting other cables and smashing them and then they were smashing stuff.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,900
 It probably would have been pretty cool to watch, honestly, right?

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,500
 If it didn't possibly doom the planet.

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,200
 But all this stuff fell. There's wreckage everywhere.

62
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,900
 They haven't even been able to really take in the scope of the damage of the thing.

63
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,800
 But here's the weird part.

64
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 CBS News talked to the Arcebo Observatory Director Francisco Cordova.

65
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,000
 This is what he had to say. Quote, "The cable didn't really break in the sense of a cable kind of snapping,

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,400
 but it just sort of slipped from its socket, which is, you know, an even weirder condition."

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,500
 And they said that these cable, this cable in particular, should have had another 15, 20 years shelf life.

68
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,000
 This cable was just installed in the 90s, so this is not a 53 year old cable.

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,700
 This is a much newer cable and they said it should have had at least 15 years.

70
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,000
 Now, of course, they've had earthquakes, they've had hurricanes and stuff like that,

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,100
 but they just don't know how it happened.

72
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,800
 And right now they said in-depth, this thing is, we want to get it back online.

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,700
 We just don't know when.

74
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,200
 And with the fact that they've been facing budget cuts for so long, this may be the death knell for this thing.

75
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,100
 Put on our conspiracy caps. We can look at this from a couple different angles.

76
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:24,800
 One, you have this massive telescope, radio telescope that's known mostly, really, in popular culture,

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,400
 for talking to aliens or trying to talk to aliens and it's smashed up now.

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,100
 So you could say sabotage, right?

79
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,400
 We were going to receive a message from aliens and somebody didn't want that message to get heard,

80
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,300
 so they destroyed the radio telescope.

81
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:50,100
 You think that's fairly unsubtle, but if you had a thing where someone was internally trying to sabotage the radio telescope,

82
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,900
 they're like getting ready to enter their sabotage.exe, lobby disk, and people kept catching them.

83
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,000
 They're like, "Hey, what are you doing, Barney? What are you doing with Skolin Crossbones' lobby disk?"

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,100
 He's like, "Ugh."

85
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,700
 And then maybe they did eventually enter their program, but it didn't work.

86
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,300
 So at the end of the day, they go, "Well, we got to do something so they smashed up."

87
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,400
 That's obviously a big conspiracy theory.

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,200
 It could also be that, a natural accident, obviously, but we have our conspiracy caps on.

89
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
 So you could try to be sabotage.

90
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,100
 It's also possible that someone didn't want to be subtle.

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
 They wanted to send a message.

92
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,600
 They want--not the message the aliens are sending, but they just wanted to smash it up.

93
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:46,100
 They weren't trying to subtly go in there and do the computer, and they wanted to just smash the thing.

94
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,300
 So it could be a bunch of different stuff.

95
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
 The aliens could have done it.

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,400
 They could have shot it with a laser beam.

97
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,200
 We don't know.

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,100
 That's probably--listen, in our phone calls, will you?

99
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,800
 That's probably not the answer.

100
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,700
 What I find really fascinating about this is I just read this article literally this morning.

101
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
 It's Sunday morning when I'm recording this.

102
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,100
 I haven't heard of any of this in the conspiracy theory realm.

103
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,700
 None.

104
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,400
 No talking about this at all.

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
 Now, think about what happened.

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,300
 This is very, very fascinating.

107
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:22,100
 Remember the Sunspot Solar Observatory in New Mexico, where the feds ran into the building

108
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,800
 and it was shut down for like a week, maybe longer?

109
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,900
 And that story is still talked about.

110
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,500
 It was the observatory shut down.

111
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:39,600
 The official story was someone was downloading or uploading child porn on the--using the computers there.

112
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
 We never got the name of the guy.

113
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,000
 We never got an arrest record.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,500
 It's super suspicious to be fair.

115
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,300
 It's super suspicious.

116
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,400
 We covered it a couple of times on this show, and I've looked into it since to see if they've ever had any more information about it.

117
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,200
 And I've never found like the name of the guy or what he was charged--officially charged with or anything like that.

118
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
 So that's weird.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,400
 But that story was national news and that story in the conspiracy realm.

120
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,000
 I still get asked that question.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,400
 Hey, did you ever find out anything more about the solar observatory?

122
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,100
 So that story was huge and rightfully so.

123
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,800
 It was a bizarre story.

124
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:20,100
 But this one we have one of the most, if not the most recognizable telescope, satellite dish, whatever you want to call it.

125
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,500
 Well, technically it's radio telescope.

126
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,200
 But you know what I mean?

127
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
 It's iconic.

128
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,700
 Destroyed.

129
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,400
 Nobody's talking about it.

130
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,900
 It's not anywhere in the conspiracy circles that I run in.

131
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,100
 Nobody's talking about it.

132
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,400
 I just think it's weird because they're basically both the same.

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,300
 This story I think is actually more dramatic because you have damage, possibly permanent damage to this one.

134
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
 And both of them have a mystery.

135
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,600
 You can't say, "Well, you know, the other one, we didn't know why the feds were there."

136
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,500
 They both have a mystery.

137
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,400
 How did it happen?

138
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,700
 But I don't think this will gain as much traction.

139
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,800
 And I think that's very curious.

140
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:02,700
 I'm not saying this is intentional, but I think it just kind of goes to show the psyche of the average conspiracy theorists.

141
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,900
 And why, actually, that's a good segue.

142
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:11,100
 Why we tend to glom onto some conspiracies and not other conspiracy theories.

143
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,700
 That's always fascinated me.

144
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,900
 Marshall, we are leaving behind.

145
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,500
 Let those nerds clean up all that damage.

146
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,900
 We are leaving behind the Arcebo, which I'm sure I've mispronounced eight times already.

147
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,500
 We're leaving behind the Arcebo Observatory.

148
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,700
 Let's hop in that carbonar copter.

149
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,700
 We are headed out to a building.

150
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:38,100
 We're in the middle of nowhere and there's a large building just sitting there.

151
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
 The carbonar copters flying around the building.

152
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,900
 And Marshall goes, "This is kind of a weird location for a story.

153
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,200
 A single building?"

154
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,100
 And I go, "No, no, no, no, no.

155
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,200
 Watch."

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,400
 And as that building sits there, in the middle of nowhere, it begins to grow roots.

157
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,200
 No, not roots.

158
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,400
 Begins to grow roads.

159
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,700
 Marshall, let's land in this pristine, beautiful field.

160
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,400
 Now we're farther away from this building.

161
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,500
 We're slowly watching roads expand from this building.

162
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 I'm going to warn you guys right now.

163
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
 I've mentioned this a couple of times on the show.

164
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,700
 I'm a wonk.

165
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,000
 I'm a guy who really loves the details of stuff.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,200
 I'm actually kind of getting chills just going into this.

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,800
 This story I've been wanting to share with you is actually a request.

168
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,500
 It's funny, I glossed over it.

169
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,200
 When I saw it pop up, I was like, "Gray of PTA, thank you so much for sending this to me."

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,600
 Because again, I saw it pop up and I was like, "I didn't really get into it.

171
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,900
 It sounded so stupid."

172
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,800
 And then when one of you guys will send me a story, a lot of times I will take a second look at it.

173
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 And so I really appreciate it.

174
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,500
 But I'm a wonk though, so I can really dig into the details.

175
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
 This segment I'm going to try.

176
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,600
 Hopefully you find it entertaining because what we're going to do is we're going to deconstruct this conspiracy theory.

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,300
 I don't think we've really done this yet.

178
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:09,500
 This conspiracy theory is so new and it's such a fetal form that we can actually really dig into it.

179
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,200
 So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to read you the original conspiracy theory that was put out.

180
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,300
 Originally it was put out on X and then it jumped to Reddit very, very quickly.

181
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,400
 And now it pretty much has a life of its own, much like the building in front of us.

182
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,600
 I'm going to read this conspiracy theory to you.

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,800
 It's not very long.

184
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,300
 I'm going to read it exactly how it's written without comment.

185
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,600
 And then we're going to dissect it.

186
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,300
 And as I'm reading it to you, I know a lot of you guys are doing dishes and driving and stuff like that, so that's fine.

187
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,800
 I don't want you guys to take attention away from the tasks you're doing.

188
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,600
 But if you have a moment, I want you to listen to this conspiracy theory.

189
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,900
 And I want you to note when you agree with the conspiracy theory, when it starts to lose you attention-wise,

190
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:01,100
 when it reinvigorates you or does it, I want you to kind of pay attention to the rhythm and how it affects you.

191
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:08,800
 Because this conspiracy theory, I think we can dissect this and look at why some conspiracy theories work and while others fail.

192
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,200
 I'm totally jazzed by this type of thing and I hope you are too.

193
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,400
 Let's go ahead and take a look at the conspiracy theory as it was written.

194
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,300
 "Buildings rule the world.

195
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,900
 All of global civilization is designed to service them, not human beings."

196
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,400
 The biggest mistake of human history was the construction of permanent structures,

197
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,000
 which eventually led to our enslavement by them.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,400
 We've been enslaved by buildings ever since the construction of the Great Pyramids

199
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,200
 and have worshipped buildings ever since.

200
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:48,100
 The post-9/11 insanity was because 9/11 was an attack on some of the most prominent buildings in the world,

201
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
 not because people died.

202
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,800
 The outrage of the Black Lives Matters protest is because buildings are targeted with graffiti and broken windows.

203
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,300
 The federal secret police was called into Seattle to defend the federal courthouse.

204
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,000
 Still not convinced?

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Freemasonry evolved from the guilds of stone masons and cathedral builders of the Middle Ages.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,100
 Consider how buildings such as McDonald's franchises are like organisms,

207
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,000
 reproducing according to their architectural DNA.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,300
 On the back of every bill of U.S. currency is a famous building.

209
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:28,500
 The hell of a modern world is homelessness, the state of not being owned by a building.

210
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,200
 A building is very similar to a tree.

211
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:38,000
 Drawing nutrients from the land around it via its roots, which are roads and utility infrastructure.

212
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,800
 But unlike a tree, a building is an undead organism that feeds off of the destruction of life at every step.

213
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,600
 The forest of buildings we call cities is where life is most absent and detached from the natural world.

214
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,700
 What is the end game of buildings?

215
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:03,000
 The elimination of humanity and all life on earth via complete robotic automation of the means to sustain and build them.

216
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,200
 Nothing but mindless building forever and ever.

217
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:14,000
 Buildings have a sentience, and that sentience is that of a paperclip maximizer.

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
 And I'll explain that.

219
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,500
 Paperclip maximizer was a kind of like a thought experiment.

220
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,600
 If you build a AI or a computer and you say collect as many paperclips,

221
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,200
 that's all you need to do is collect paperclips.

222
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,300
 Eventually this AI could have an explosion of intelligence and start manufacturing paperclips

223
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,000
 and then eventually turn the entire universe into paperclips.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,800
 Because that's its end goals to have as many paperclips as possible.

225
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,200
 So it uses all the resources on earth to create paperclips, then it moves throughout the galaxy and then through the universe.

226
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
 So that's paperclip maximizer.

227
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,700
 It's a thought experiment.

228
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,100
 We all have a little picnic set out.

229
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,800
 The building's still far off, but we're seeing these roads grow.

230
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 Now we see little houses next to the roads.

231
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,300
 The roots are definitely growing.

232
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,800
 We're having this little picnic, me, you, and Marshall.

233
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,400
 Let's dig into this conspiracy theory here.

234
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,100
 Let's dissect this, because I think this has a potential to be a huge conspiracy theory going forward.

235
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,000
 It's something about it seems...

236
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
 Let's look at it on a global level right now.

237
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,000
 There has always been this thing about the unnatural world replacing the natural world.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,600
 Green belts being replaced by buildings, swamp land being paved over for super centers.

239
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,800
 All that's a very natural thing to push back from.

240
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,300
 We've all, at this point, we've all grown up and looked back and go, "Whoa, that neighborhood has changed."

241
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:40,500
 You know, where I grew up was kind of rural for a while, and now I went back there just a couple months ago and just so many neighborhoods.

242
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,800
 So it's a conspiracy theory we can just look at.

243
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,100
 Which is always good for a conspiracy theory.

244
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,600
 Flat earth is the... One of the reasons why it works is that you never really see the curve of the earth.

245
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
 It's not true, but it's a conspiracy theory that...

246
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,900
 That's one of the reasons why it's so popular. It's an observational conspiracy theory.

247
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:06,000
 This one, anyone who's lived, it really any... I'd say over 15, 20 years, has seen their neighborhoods change unless you're in the city.

248
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,600
 But even then you could go, when you go into the countryside, you go, "Oh, this is what air smells like. I can actually see the stars."

249
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,100
 So we do have this thing about the natural unnatural world.

250
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,300
 Perfect scenario for a conspiracy theory.

251
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,400
 The first sentence where it's just like buildings rule the world, it controls civilization.

252
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,800
 Super tight, grabs your attention right off the bat.

253
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,900
 The second part where it's talking about the biggest mistake was creating the permanent buildings and it starts with the pyramids.

254
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,200
 Again, a strong conspiracy theory a lot of times will tie into an existing conspiracy theory.

255
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,500
 The mysteries of the pyramids have been with us since people... The first person goes, "Hey, what's that?"

256
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,300
 And the people who built them weren't around to really explain what was going on. So again, that's a really tight thing.

257
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,300
 Now, you could easily... I think a misstep, and I've seen other people talk about this in the comments referring to the story.

258
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:03,300
 They start talking about gobel tepli. I don't know how to pronounce it, but they started talking about these other mysterious monoliths and cities and monuments.

259
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,000
 It doesn't work. It doesn't work. Everyone knows what the pyramids are. A little kid could draw a pyramid.

260
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,500
 Don't get too complicated with your conspiracy theory.

261
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,400
 I think you can go with pyramids, Atlantis, Bermuda, Triangle, stuff like that, that everybody knows about.

262
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,500
 Once you have to start explaining it, no. But the person who did this was smart because they straight up said, "It's like the pyramids."

263
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 That was the beginning of our enslavement. It's evocative. The pyramids already have a lot of links to mysticism.

264
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:36,200
 Did we accidentally create our own prison by creating these buildings?

265
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,700
 And the pyramids, and saying it started with the pyramids, "Perfect, perfect conspiracy theory building."

266
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,500
 But this is where I think he starts the mess up.

267
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:51,300
 It goes into examples. The first one is brilliant. The first example is absolutely brilliant.

268
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,900
 That is, the post-9/11 insanity was because 9/11 was attacked on some of the most prominent buildings in the world, not because people died.

269
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:07,600
 I don't agree with that, but that's a brilliant example because, one, you want your conspiracy theory to outlast you, really.

270
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,400
 You want your conspiracy theory to go on and on and on. 9/11, we were reminded of that every year.

271
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
 And if you can get something in someone's head, then when people talk about 9/11, it goes, "Oh yeah, I remember that conspiracy theory,"

272
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,900
 saying that that was the real reason why everyone was upset was because we attacked these buildings.

273
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,900
 These buildings were basically gods, or demigods. These were giant structures that were controlling humanity.

274
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,900
 That humanity killed. It would be the equivalent of...

275
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,500
 It wouldn't be David versus Goliath. It would be David versus the Archangel Michael.

276
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,600
 The Twin Towers were recognizable buildings. It was something that you just knew of.

277
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,900
 Not as common as the pyramids, but still, it was as common as, say, the Empire State Building or the Golden Gate Bridge.

278
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,700
 Very, very perfect example. This is this person. This next part is this person's first slip-up.

279
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,300
 And we are going to kind of dissect this as well. This next part.

280
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:06,100
 The outrage of the Black Lives Matter protest is because buildings are targeted with graffiti and broken windows.

281
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:12,500
 So that was his second example. And then he goes on to say the Federal Secret Police were called into Seattle to defend a federal courthouse.

282
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
 That's not true. It was in Portland.

283
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,500
 So you got to be really careful when you're constructing this type of stuff because that's a factual error.

284
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 The idea that buildings are evil and sentient and trying to take over the planet, that's a fanciful idea.

285
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,900
 You can make a fanciful statement, but you're really going to get stuck on your facts.

286
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,000
 But that wasn't a deal-breaker for me. When I saw that, I wasn't like, "What? No way!"

287
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,800
 I'm indulging in the conspiracy. I love conspiracies as an art form, almost.

288
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,200
 It almost is an art form, and it's a form of mind control art form.

289
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,700
 So it's more than just looking at a painting. It's a painting that actually isn't trying to convince you that the painting is good.

290
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,200
 It's trying to convince you that the painting is real important, and only you can see that painting.

291
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,700
 That's the different-- That's the layer of art form of a conspiracy theory.

292
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,800
 It gives you a sense of importance because you know the truth, and other people don't know the truth.

293
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,100
 But so you want to get your facts right, though. But again, that wasn't a deal-breaker.

294
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:18,500
 But I thought this-- Earlier on in the show, like episode 6 or 7, I gave the recipe for a good conspiracy theory.

295
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,400
 You guys remember it. You guys get a gold star.

296
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 Time plus distance plus a group you don't trust equals a good conspiracy theory.

297
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,900
 In this conspiracy theory, buildings are the group we don't trust.

298
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,800
 That's what the argument is, is don't trust buildings.

299
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,400
 So that's fine. It's not something that people normally don't trust, but think about it.

300
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
 We think of haunted houses. We think of creepy buildings.

301
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,700
 We think of beautiful fields and untouched land being taken over by civilization.

302
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,000
 So people do have a distrust or a leariness of buildings.

303
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,700
 It's touching on something that people don't really talk about.

304
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,000
 And that's another thing this conspiracy theory really makes you think about something that you otherwise wouldn't have thought about.

305
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,500
 You know what I mean? Like, you can already kind of make the argument.

306
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 There's been tons of stuff about liminal spaces and the back rooms and all these other things.

307
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,200
 So buildings are evil. It's actually a group we don't trust.

308
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,500
 Time plus distance is what this-- What that example fails.

309
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,200
 The Black Lives Matter protests are going on right now.

310
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,000
 And you're going to have people who read that comment.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,300
 And some of you may too, because I read it without comment the first time.

312
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,600
 Some of you too may go, "Huh?" at that part.

313
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,500
 Because they go, "Well, that's not why I'm upset."

314
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,400
 Or there's someone who goes, "Oh, I don't care about buildings being destroyed."

315
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,000
 And what it does is it creates a little schism in your head.

316
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,300
 It gives you a chance to think.

317
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,800
 It gave you a chance to think and go, "What?"

318
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,500
 Because that's going on right now.

319
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,900
 I don't think that's a good example. I have a better one.

320
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,400
 I have a better example.

321
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,200
 That doesn't take you out of the narrative and doesn't make you start thinking about the news you read that day.

322
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
 Here's my example.

323
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
 If you're listening to this person who crafted this or really anyone who wants to adjust this,

324
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,200
 I think this is a much better example.

325
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,100
 If someone walked down the street with a shotgun and killed five people in the middle of the street,

326
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,400
 it's a tragedy, it's a mass murder,

327
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,800
 it could be considered a terror attack depending on the reasoning of why they did it.

328
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:18,500
 But let's take that same perpetrator, those same five victims, and move them 200 feet to the south.

329
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,100
 Now you're in a college classroom. What do you call it?

330
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,700
 It's called a school shooting.

331
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,000
 You blow up a car, kill 20 people, tragedy. Obvious tragedy.

332
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
 Mass murder, possibly terrorism.

333
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,900
 You move that half a mile north.

334
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,300
 Same bomb, same people.

335
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,900
 Church bombing.

336
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,000
 We use the location.

337
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,500
 Sometimes, though, we use the location sometimes in lieu of the victims.

338
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,300
 If it takes place, you never heard of a field shooting.

339
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,000
 You never heard of a street attack.

340
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,100
 They don't call them that.

341
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,400
 Church bombings, school shootings.

342
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:05,200
 That is a much better example because it's basically saying the violence inflicted on the people is second to the building where the violence is inflicted on.

343
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,100
 And, like I said, you want to implant that seed the next time.

344
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,500
 Hopefully, I mean, you would pray that there's never another church shooting or workplace violence.

345
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,800
 See, it's the place that's labeled.

346
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,900
 And I know why.

347
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,400
 I mean, obviously, jumping out of the conspiracy theory, it's evocative.

348
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
 It's scarier, right?

349
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,100
 The church bombing is scarier than a street bombing because it's a place where we should be safe.

350
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,500
 And I understand that's the reason why they're labeled like that.

351
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,000
 But in this conspiracy theory, I think that's a better thing.

352
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,400
 And when those things happen again in the back of your head, you go, "You know what? That reminds me of a conspiracy theory I read a long time ago."

353
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,100
 When you read about some horrible tragedy that happened somewhere, you're like, "Oh, yeah, I've read this thing about like, buildings are evil."

354
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,200
 And that's why, that's why I refer to them as like, church bombings because, you know, the buildings and that.

355
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
 So it would keep that in your head.

356
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,800
 So that's, I think, one of the weaknesses of this conspiracy theory.

357
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,600
 They actually run into another one pretty quickly after this.

358
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,900
 When they talk about money, they say on the back of U.S. bills, there's a building.

359
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,200
 We tend to produce content for ourselves. I do it.

360
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,200
 And so you just assume everyone who's reading it is you, or like you, or thinks like you.

361
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,900
 And not everyone, not every country uses buildings on their currency.

362
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:26,000
 That was another point when I read that and I go, "Nah, the loony. Canada has their little duck or loon or bird or whatever it is on the back of their coin."

363
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
 I started thinking about money that doesn't have that. It took me out of the narrative.

364
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,200
 That one I would just take out.

365
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,900
 If you're reading this and you're in another country, you're like, "What? I don't care what America does with their money."

366
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,500
 He does recover. Bring it in Freemasonry.

367
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 I thought that was one of the strongest points.

368
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 Saying that, you know, Freemasons who run the world, the conspiracy theory Freemasons run the world, or they're a big power player.

369
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,700
 They're basically descended from the Stoemasons, the Cathedral Builders.

370
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,700
 That's, again, right back on point.

371
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:59,300
 Like, it stumbled a bit with the current event segment, but then got back on point because then you go, "Oh, yeah, yeah, Freemasons.

372
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:06,900
 That's a known conspiracy theory. That's not as known as the pyramids, but that's like Baby's first conspiracy theory.

373
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,400
 You'll have Freemasons run the world, Illuminati runs the world.

374
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,500
 It's not complex. It's very, very basic conspiracy theory.

375
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,800
 One of them, I put it up there with Moonlandings and JFK.

376
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,400
 Secret groups rule in the world. Super normie level stuff.

377
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,600
 So it's perfect. It's absolutely perfect to go into this to give it some staying power.

378
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,900
 And then goes into the whole thing about how McDonald's seemed to spring up like weeds.

379
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,700
 Oh, perfect imagery.

380
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:45,000
 I mean, you could have, he could have used any example like Starbucks or anything like that, but McDonald's, actually McDonald's is not only so iconic, but it's worldwide.

381
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,800
 I, I, I, it feels like this was constructed in a lab, honestly.

382
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:59,600
 Like again, other than one or two, really the only misstep was the current events thing, because I think it makes you think about outside the conspiracy about what's going on right now.

383
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
 You don't want to do that.

384
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:11,200
 McDonald's, there might not even be as many McDonald's now as there used to be, but that's such that it's, it's such a perfect image of consumerism and growth.

385
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,900
 That's perfect. Absolutely perfect.

386
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,600
 But at the end, we get pretty much the money shot of the whole thing.

387
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,200
 And this is the thing that is completely observable.

388
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,700
 You look at it and you go, that's true.

389
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,500
 That's true.

390
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:36,000
 And that's about how a building is similar to a tree, drawing nutrients from the land around it via its roots, which are roads and infrastructure and all of that stuff.

391
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,600
 And then you have these roads grow out and then you have a subdivision pop up and then roads come off of that.

392
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:53,000
 And then you have this other area pop up and it just moves throughout the land, consuming everything because it's literally consuming nature.

393
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,100
 You're cutting down trees or reworking oil to make plastic.

394
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,900
 You're doing all of this stuff using these natural things to make unnatural things, houses.

395
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
 And these houses grow and grow and grow and grow.

396
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,000
 Beautiful, beautiful.

397
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,400
 That is an observational conspiracy theory.

398
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:18,000
 The leap here, it's funny because you could take the same conspiracy theory and put an evil human motive behind it.

399
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,900
 You could say there's a secret cabal of people who want to cover the whole world and they hate nature and they want to, they're like anti-nature demons or they just hate nature or something like that.

400
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,500
 They want to cover the whole world in civilization.

401
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,000
 You could do that.

402
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,200
 And I think a lame or conspiracy theory would do that, would put it on.

403
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,000
 The Illuminati believes that grass is proof of God so they want to show up.

404
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,700
 I think the fact by making the buildings the enemies themselves, it's so evocative.

405
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,600
 I've taught, if you listen to the show, how many times have I said I hate empty buildings?

406
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,300
 I think it's super spooky.

407
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:01,900
 Even on early, early episodes I was talking about empty libraries scare me, empty schools scare me.

408
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,800
 And that's a normal thing.

409
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,100
 I've learned through the show, maybe not normal, but I'm not alone in that.

410
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,900
 So not only is it a fact of nature being replaced by buildings, but they're being replaced by empty buildings.

411
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,600
 The creepy house in your neighborhood isn't really the house that has a family of four in it.

412
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,900
 It's the house that either has one person in it or no people in it.

413
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,300
 Because we look at that and go, "That's unnatural. Why isn't there any people in this house?"

414
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,900
 And then the myth start up.

415
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:37,100
 Your older brother tells you, "Well, didn't you know Mr. McGillie Cutty did have a family till he murdered them all one night?"

416
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,200
 And you're like, "Ugh, we build our stories out of the empty houses."

417
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,900
 Fascinating conspiracy theory.

418
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:50,800
 I honestly think this is one of those conspiracy theories that crosses into the realm of the paranormal.

419
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:57,300
 There's conspiracy theories that are strictly like Bilderberg group, trilateral commission, stuff like that.

420
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,700
 Those are strictly in the realm of, "This is a group that wants to take over the world. There's no magic. There's no aliens.

421
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,600
 It's just a corporate group that wants to conquer the world."

422
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,200
 There are conspiracy theories like that that are very, very rational conspiracy theories.

423
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,700
 They don't allow any sort of magic to interfere with them.

424
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,900
 And even when we looked at early 9/11 conspiracy theories, it was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no. We did that. America did that.

425
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,900
 It was an inside job." And then it became space lasers and hologram planes and stuff like that,

426
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,100
 which has really fragmented the 9/11 truth through community.

427
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,600
 This is a conspiracy theory, though, that borders that because it is both paranormal,

428
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,200
 because you have buildings that are sentient and they're evil,

429
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,500
 and their goal is to basically spread across the entire planet.

430
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,600
 We are their fingers. We're basically like nothing to them.

431
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:59,900
 We are only here to build buildings long enough until we can invent a machine that can build buildings without us.

432
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,900
 And then the buildings will simply get rid of us, because the buildings can't build that machine themselves.

433
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,300
 That's kind of where this conspiracy theory is going.

434
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,200
 Eventually, we're going to create an AI and then, well, we probably don't even need an AI.

435
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,600
 We just need a home depot to have some automated house builder, like we have automated car builders.

436
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 And eventually, houses can come off of a line and roads can be paved by automated cars and stuff like that.

437
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,200
 And eventually, we're gone.

438
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,100
 The buildings are only housing us long enough and keeping us alive long enough to get to that stage in its development.

439
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,600
 I imagine that this one's really going to take off.

440
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,200
 I don't think it's going to be on the level of a flat earth.

441
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,900
 So I don't think it'll be as big as, obviously it won't ever be as big as like a Apollo Moon landing in JFK,

442
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,900
 which, again, they're very, very grounded conspiracy theories.

443
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,800
 They don't involve ghosts.

444
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,700
 They don't involve shape-shifting lizard men.

445
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,400
 It's just, this was fake.

446
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,100
 So you do have conspiracy theories like that.

447
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,700
 They tend to be the most popular.

448
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,600
 Stuff like Bermuda Triangle, the pyramids.

449
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,700
 That does have a mystical element.

450
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,000
 Pyramids, it's just kind of like, who built them?

451
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,200
 But you know, aliens have come into the picture and stuff like that.

452
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,000
 Bermuda Triangle is almost all mystical.

453
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,700
 Water spouts, that's boring.

454
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,000
 So you have like hidden technology, alien stuff like that.

455
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
 Do I believe it's true?

456
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,900
 I think it's a great horror story.

457
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,600
 I think it's an absolutely great horror story.

458
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,800
 I didn't believe in the, but another thing that kind of threw me off was,

459
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,000
 and I'll adjust this to the homelessness that modern hell is homeless.

460
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,400
 Now, a lot of people, they're like, I'd much rather be a hermit.

461
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,100
 I much rather wish I could throw away the bonds of civilization and just wander out into the woods and survive.

462
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,500
 But I have this need to be part of this group.

463
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,300
 Maybe the buildings are telling you you need to stay as part of civilization.

464
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,600
 But that part also kind of went, "Eh, that's fine."

465
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,200
 Again, that's not a deal breaker.

466
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,400
 I would take out the stuff about the current events and I would take out the US money thing.

467
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,800
 Because that'd be like saying, "Here's a conspiracy theory and in my hometown,

468
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,300
 here's proof of the conspiracy theory."

469
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,400
 Anyone outside of that hometown is like, "What?

470
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,800
 US currency is a major currency around the world, but I would just take that part out."

471
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,500
 That was a, it's funny because I don't think I've ever done that before,

472
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:13,400
 because I don't think I've ever come across such a fetal version of a conspiracy theory before.

473
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,900
 At least not recently. This thing's still growing.

474
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,300
 This conspiracy theory can really take off because it's observable.

475
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,800
 You can look at the demolition of nature by buildings.

476
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,200
 And again, that's been something people have been talking about for a century or more,

477
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,300
 really since the Industrial Revolution.

478
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,500
 But giving the idea that the buildings themselves are basically doing it,

479
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,900
 we're simply their hands.

480
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,600
 And we feel comfortable at home because that's the house making us feel comfortable.

481
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,200
 But if the house doesn't want us anymore, it can make us feel at on edge.

482
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,600
 That's a good conspiracy theory.

483
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,800
 And I really, really like it.

484
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,500
 And I think that it has places to go.

485
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,300
 Do I think it's going to be one of the biggest conspiracy theories of all time?

486
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,100
 No. Do I think it could be one of the biggest conspiracy theories this year?

487
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,800
 To come out of this year and we have all this coronavirus and microchips and vaccine stuff?

488
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,000
 Possibly. Possibly.

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,800
 I honestly think it could because it's more rational than those.

490
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,600
 Those require way too many levels of stuff.

491
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,400
 Requires you to dig into too much stuff.

492
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
 This one is just...

493
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,300
 You know that thing that you noticed as a kid and now it's gone?

494
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,300
 This is why.

495
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,000
 Perfectly constructed conspiracy theory.

496
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 So hats off to you, whoever came out with this.

497
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,700
 Again, for all I know, this could be some deep, deep level CIA weird meme.

498
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,900
 They're trying to test out if possible.

499
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,400
 Or it could just be someone had a thought and typed it out.

500
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,600
 Either way, tip of the hat to you. Very, very well constructed.

501
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,900
 We will see where this goes.

502
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,800
 It's kind of a different episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

503
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,400
 But I saw this and I really wanted to dissect it.

504
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
 Do I believe it's true? Did I answer that?

505
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
 Did I believe it's true?

506
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
 I think it's a good... I think I did answer that.

507
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,800
 I think it's a good horror story.

508
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,000
 It definitely opens your mind up when...

509
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,500
 Think about it this way. Think about it this way.

510
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,400
 With this conspiracy theory, with me talking about this conspiracy theory with you today.

511
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,700
 Next time you go...

512
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,300
 I guarantee you, next time you go into a building, if you have a second to think.

513
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,800
 If you're not like walking in a Walmart and you're getting badgered with music and bright lights and colors and everything like that.

514
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,600
 If you walk into a building and you have a quiet moment,

515
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,500
 and you'll just be kind of looking around in that moment,

516
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,500
 you'll have that moment of break from all the chaos and noise, you'll go,

517
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,600
 "Hmm, I remember hearing a conspiracy theory once about

518
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
 buildings are alive and trying to take over the planet or something like that."

519
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,500
 You'll kind of brush it off, but...

520
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,900
 It's one of those conspiracy theories that you just see so much evidence of it.

521
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,400
 It's just hard to dismiss out of hand.

522
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:43,900
