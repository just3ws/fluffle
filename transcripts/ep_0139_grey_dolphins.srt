1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,380
 Today, we fly the friendly skies and find out that falling to your death doesn't always

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,160
 mean dying.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:16,660
 And then we explore a conspiracy theory that actually, for the first time, makes me afraid

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,680
 of grey aliens.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:38,360
 I'm a wild freak down.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:47,680
 I'm a wild freak down.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,080
 I'm a wild freak down.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,960
 I'm a wild freak down.

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:24,600
 I'm a wild freak down.

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,040
 So let's hop on board our newest air vehicle.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,320
 The Jason Jet is still being constructed.

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,680
 We're gonna hop on the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,080
 Now let's get inside.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,000
 Now I gotta turn it on and then we'll fly up.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,480
 So now I know the machine is a little loud and I get that.

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,080
 It's just gonna be a short while.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 I'm sorry.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,220
 It's from a World War II German blimp factory.

20
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,600
 So okay, there we go.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,400
 Sorry, sometimes it starts off a little loud and we have to bear with it.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,480
 Dead Rabbit Durgible is, but it's roomy and it's gonna get us as high as we need to be.

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
 That's not a pot joke.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,520
 We actually have to go up in elevation.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
 We are going to start off.

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,120
 And because of all my international listeners, because there's so many of you, I went through

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,680
 the task of adding kilometers in this section.

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,160
 So there you go.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
 See?

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,880
 I'm not a total ethnocentric dude.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
 I'll throw kilometers in there every once in a while.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,360
 Not centimeters though, there's your lane.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,200
 We're going up two miles, which equals three kilometers, and we're in the year 1971.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,880
 So we're in the Dead Rabbit Durgible, which is kind of floating there.

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,640
 We see a passenger plane flying towards us.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,800
 Now I should have warned you to wear your rain jackets because huge lightning storm.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,960
 I didn't even know this was possible.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
 Not lightning storms.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,480
 I knew those were possible, but huge lightning storm.

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,840
 Yes, this segment will have a lot of sound effects.

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,160
 When the lightning struck this plane so hard, according to the Wikipedia article, the plane

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
 disintegrated.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
 I didn't even know that was possible.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,840
 I thought planes were built to take lightning strikes.

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,320
 But anyways, I imagine it's like just slowly got vaporized.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,560
 Desintegrate is a very specific term.

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,400
 But anyway, so apparently this plane disintegrated.

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,360
 And in that plane, wearing her seatbelt like a good girl, like you should, is Julianne

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
 Kopecki.

50
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
 Imagine you're sitting in a plane.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,840
 You're scared because it's kind of jostling.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,200
 You have a bit of turbulence.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
 There's lightning strikes.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,720
 All of a sudden, straight up like 1980s special effects lightning hits your plane, goes all

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
 over and the plane just falls apart around you.

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
 You're strapped to your seat.

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
 Now she fell.

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,680
 This teenage girl fell two miles to the earth.

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
 She flies by us to the point.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,880
 We probably got to help her.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,960
 But you know, I don't know if she yelled the whole way.

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,520
 She probably passed out at some point.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,880
 Smashes into the ground and survives.

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,440
 But she's in the Amazon rainforest.

65
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,080
 So she has a huge gash in her arm, broken collar bone.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,280
 She's like, okay, my dad taught me that if you find a river or a stream, follow it downstream

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,400
 because there's a chance, a better chance that you'll find civilizations, not 100%.

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,480
 So she's walking along through the Amazon jungle along the stream.

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,200
 All she brought with her was some candy.

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,320
 I mean, you pretty much have what you had in your pockets if you flew out of a plane.

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
 Unless luggage was falling periodically and you open it up and you're like, oh, awesome.

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
 There's cheeseburger in here.

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,600
 For 11 days, she trudged through the Amazon until she found a boat and you think, oh, then

74
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
 she took the boat to town.

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,000
 Her first instinct was this.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,240
 Her dad also taught her if you ever have a deep wound, pour gasoline on it and it'll

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
 help disinfect it.

78
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,080
 And that was her first instinct because her arm was super just like gross at this point.

79
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
 She was getting bit by all these bugs.

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
 She was getting super infected.

81
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
 She gets gasoline.

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,440
 There's like a little boat shed by.

83
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,520
 She pours it on her arm and by her count, and I would lose count after maybe the first

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,120
 10, by her count, 35 maggots squirmed out of her arm.

85
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,200
 Now again, was she just looking at it the whole time and she's like 28, 29, like really

86
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,840
 she counted 35.

87
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,520
 But anyways, I believe her, 35 maggots came out of her arm and she's like, oh, it feels

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,840
 much more flexible.

89
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,240
 Lumberjacks, who the boat belonged to, showed up and they're like, oh my God, you're totally

90
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
 gross.

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
 Let's take you to the town and she survived.

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,120
 Now somehow we saw all of that from our dirgeable and we were up there for 11 days.

93
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,120
 We could have at least thrown her down like a ham sandwich or something like that.

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,880
 Now we're going to World War II and it should not shock you that most of these stories take

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
 place in World War II.

96
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
 World War II, Nicholas Alchmaid.

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
 So we got to actually take the blimp up for this one.

98
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
 That person was 2 miles.

99
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,120
 We're actually going up, we're going up to 3.4 miles now.

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,760
 So the blimp rises silently this time.

101
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,200
 It goes up a little bit higher and we're back in World War II.

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,280
 Now luckily we're invisible.

103
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,080
 I'm just adding that in, otherwise we'd be toast because we're in the middle of a raging

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,480
 battle between the Nazis and the Allies.

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,440
 And so Nicholas is in a bomber, a US bomber.

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,600
 And then you got the Nazi planes.

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,280
 Oh no Captain, Captain, we got all shot up.

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,040
 The plane that I forgot, oh the bomber, the bomber, that's what I meant to say.

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,280
 The bomber, bullets are just shredding this bomber to pieces.

110
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,680
 Plane catchers on fire.

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,200
 Now this guy, Nicholas, is like oh no.

112
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,760
 So Nicholas is like I'm not going to burn to death.

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,920
 So they have their parachutes on.

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,000
 So they're in the plane, bullets are flying through, place is on fire.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,800
 And he's like uh oh, I better get out of here.

116
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
 I mean that's probably an understatement.

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
 And then he realizes that the parachute he's wearing is also on fire.

118
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
 So he's like uh, that's not good.

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,520
 So he goes, I still rather would die on impact than burn to death.

120
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,360
 So he jumps out of an airplane 3.4 miles up in the air, which is 5.4 kilometers.

121
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,240
 And he's just falling.

122
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,640
 Hits a bunch of pine trees.

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,040
 And then into a soft pile of snow, sprained his leg.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
 That was it.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,840
 He woke up and when he hits the ground he's like oh, what happened to him, what happened

126
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
 to him.

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,760
 I don't know why he has an X in all of a sudden, but what happened to me ankle?

128
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,480
 Gestapo shows up, you know, the people you don't want to find you after a plane crash.

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,480
 And they start questioning him and he's like yeah I just fell out of that plane.

130
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,120
 And they're like that's impossible.

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,560
 You only have a sprained leg, you say you fell 5.4 kilometers and he's like well 3.4

132
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
 miles in regular measurement.

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,160
 But yeah, yeah I fell.

134
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,160
 They start questioning him.

135
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,920
 They find the wreckage of his plane.

136
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
 They believe him.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,880
 The Gestapo, I don't know what I would do with this.

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,560
 The Gestapo gave him a certificate proving that he fell out of the plane and survived.

139
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,480
 What would you do with a certificate from the Gestapo?

140
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,280
 Like you don't really want to hang it up on your wall, but you also don't want to like

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,800
 throw it away because it proves that you survived this plane crash.

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
 But I mean how do you do you, I mean that's a hard thing when he's telling his kids that

143
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
 story.

144
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,080
 And yeah and then these guys showed up and they were pretty friendly and they gave me

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
 the certificate and you're like holding it where you're like hand discovering the swastika

146
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
 and they're like grandpa, grandpa what's behind your hand?

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
 And he's like oh it's nothing, it's nothing.

148
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,200
 And he just puts it away in his scrapbook.

149
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,160
 Now we got a gopul and he was a POW and he was released after the war.

150
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,920
 We're going up farther.

151
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,160
 So that last one, 3.4 miles, now we're going up 4.1 miles.

152
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,960
 Not a huge jump, but it's a huge jump if you're jumping out of a plane.

153
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,280
 6.5 kilometers in the air that's where we're at and we're in one of the most badass named

154
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
 vehicles ever.

155
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 It's the Flying Fortress.

156
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,480
 When I did the episode about the ghost blimp I said there's no way dudes would ever pick

157
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,400
 up chicks in a blimp.

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,640
 If the blimp was called the Flying Fortress you would.

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,840
 The Flying Fortress, just the visual.

160
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,840
 It's basically a plane made of guns.

161
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,640
 It's what a flying fortress is.

162
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,640
 And a bomber.

163
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,840
 But anyway, so now we're with Alan McGee.

164
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,240
 Alan McGee, we're 4.1 miles up, you know where this is going.

165
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,640
 They're flying in the Flying Fortress.

166
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,680
 And he's the ball gunner, so he's like underneath the plane and it's straight up like some Star

167
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,180
 Wars stuff.

168
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,360
 Just blowing planes to bits.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,200
 But you only gotta miss one to have a bad day and what happens is a Nazi fighter blows

170
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,360
 off the wing of this flying fortress.

171
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,160
 So he's in the ball, now all the gunfire and everything of course tore through his parachute.

172
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,960
 And he's like "hey man when you gotta go you gotta go" he just jumped out of the plane.

173
00:09:38,960 --> 00:10:07,440
 He's like "yeah look at this certificate I got."

174
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,440
 And Alan's like "why are you covering up that part of the certificate?"

175
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,560
 Anyways he was also captured by the Nazis and they repaired him, kept him as a POW for

176
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,760
 a while and then they released him after the war.

177
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,200
 So you're like "okay we got all this stuff, do we have any on the Eastern Front?"

178
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
 Well we do and to do that we're gonna have to go just a little bit higher.

179
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
 Now we're at 4.4 miles and again World War 2.

180
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 That's 7 kilometers.

181
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,560
 And we're talking to Ivan Chaisov, bomber navigator during World War 2.

182
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,800
 So we're still in that time zone.

183
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,880
 Bomber Russian bomber, it should say by the name but and we're on the Eastern Front but

184
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,720
 it's a Russian bomber it's just getting lit up again.

185
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,080
 Oh no can't get him captain we can't get him and he's like "oh I don't know why you're

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,200
 speaking English I don't know why I'm speaking English" but keep shooting.

187
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,840
 Doesn't matter the Russian bomber gets all shot up.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,680
 Now he jumps out of his plane and he had a parachute, a totally fine working parachute

189
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,560
 but there was such a huge battle going around he goes "I'm just gonna fall.

190
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,320
 I'm gonna fall until I get clear of the battle and then I'm gonna pull my parachute and then

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,320
 I'll be safe but if I pull my parachute now the Nazis will just shoot me out of the skies

192
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,760
 I'm parachuting down."

193
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,360
 Now that's what he was thinking.

194
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
 This is really what was going on in his head.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Okay this is the plan.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I'm gonna jump out of the plane I'm gonna fall for a while and then wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

197
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,520
 He was in critical condition for a month, he survived.

198
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,760
 They ended up patching him up and he lived.

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,720
 Now we're on to our number one Guinness World Record highest fall without a parachute.

200
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,240
 Vesna Volvik.

201
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,000
 Now Vesna Volvik, she was on World War II pilot, she wasn't asked to be on a combat

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,760
 zone and neither did the teenage girl but Vesna Volvik was a, what's that word?

203
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,520
 A stewardess. Vesna Volvik was a stewardess and this is when they were in the year 1972.

204
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,800
 She's in a plane and she said the day the plane was ready to fly.

205
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,600
 She actually wasn't supposed to work that day.

206
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,560
 She got her confused with another woman named Vesna which is kind of a cute name.

207
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,960
 I had a date a girl named Vesna.

208
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,240
 You can call her Vessy for short or just V.

209
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,300
 But anyways she wasn't supposed to work that day and she said even when they were prepping

210
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,400
 the plane she goes "Everyone was acting kind of weird.

211
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,920
 Everyone wanted to go out and buy stuff for their family."

212
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,960
 She said the captain kind of like locked himself in his room.

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,600
 She said the co-pilot, what was odd was he was talking about his kids and she goes the

214
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,640
 tone of his voice was almost like no one else in the world had kids but him.

215
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,360
 But anyways so they're in this plane and they're high in the sky.

216
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,480
 At this point they are 6.25 miles in the sky.

217
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
 10 kilometers.

218
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,200
 And a bomb goes off.

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,600
 And you can just imagine in slow motion like you're sitting there.

220
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,840
 She's standing there.

221
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,600
 She's watching the plane deform in slow motion as this bomb just obliterates everyone and

222
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,840
 the plane starts to break up.

223
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,680
 Now she was towards the tail end of the craft and a beverage cart ran into her and pushed

224
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,160
 her all the way back as far as it could into the tail of the craft.

225
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,160
 And so when the plane like the tail side broke off and started falling to the rest of the

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,680
 plane pretty much literally disintegrated in the air.

227
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:56,680
 And she was pushed and pinned down in the tail as it was falling to earth 6.25 miles.

228
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,080
 Smashed into the ground.

229
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,680
 Luckily there was a former World War II medic there who saved her life.

230
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,000
 But she was in a coma for a month.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,240
 She doesn't remember anything about the event.

232
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,680
 She has no memory from an hour before the bomb went off to waking up in the hospital

233
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,120
 room after months of recovery.

234
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,920
 The funniest side note to that story is that's the Guinness Book of World Records so that's

235
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,640
 the longest a human's ever fallen without dying without a parachute.

236
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 But she ended up becoming a critic of the government.

237
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,160
 I believe she was Serbian.

238
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,080
 She started becoming a critic of the government in her later years.

239
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,040
 And the government couldn't throw her in jail because she was this big national hero

240
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,400
 because she survived this terrorist attack.

241
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,320
 That their retaliation was "Oh no it wasn't a bomb that blew that plane up."

242
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
 It was the Croatians.

243
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:54,240
 But they used the service to air missile and those only go 7,000 feet up so yeah that plane

244
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
 wasn't that high.

245
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,880
 And of course that didn't stick to her World Records stuff around and everything like that.

246
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,080
 But that's it.

247
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,840
 Top 5 people who survived falls.

248
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,000
 So that went on a little long but I think today might just be a long episode because

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,080
 we gotta get into our next story.

250
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,480
 Let's go ahead and get on to our main story.

251
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,480
 Now I said in the beginning I go "I've never really been scared of great aliens.

252
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,680
 I have a friend named Jackie.

253
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,920
 She's terrified of them.

254
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,000
 Every so often I'll just send her a picture on Facebook of a great alien like you're a

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,880
 point of view of an abductee looking up at a great alien and she totally flips out.

256
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,320
 She's always been terrified of them."

257
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,440
 I know that's pretty mean but she does the grudge noise and all that stuff so she gets

258
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
 back at me.

259
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
 But I've never been scared of great aliens.

260
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,480
 I've never been scared of aliens in general but specifically like great aliens always

261
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,360
 been like "Oh they have no muscle matter.

262
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
 You can just beat them up.

263
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,560
 You can easily take at least three or four of those dudes in a fist fight.

264
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
 No problem."

265
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,200
 But then I read about this and I think the reason why it creeps me out is one it makes

266
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
 sense.

267
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,360
 You know I often say on the show that I don't believe aliens are from space.

268
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,280
 I believe they're either from Earth or from another dimension.

269
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,200
 And when you read an article that not only confirms your belief or reaffirms your belief

270
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,760
 is probably a better word.

271
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,440
 But makes you know the problem is as aliens to me there's this part of this kind of this

272
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,960
 magical thinking like "Oh they have the ship that can beam stuff up and they can erase

273
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,440
 your memory and they can paralyze you and do all this stuff."

274
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,680
 They're kind of like "But when you can take those elements and make them realistic you

275
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,080
 have to step back and go "Hmm maybe there is something like that."

276
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,760
 So I've always been torn on the idea of aliens because again I've never seen one.

277
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,400
 I've seen ghosts and demons and all sorts of stuff so I totally believe in those but

278
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
 I've never seen an alien.

279
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,200
 So I'm always like "I'll give the person telling me the story the benefit of the doubt.

280
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,960
 I'll trust what they're saying because I know them."

281
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,160
 But I've just never seen one myself so I'm always kind of like "Well you know they might

282
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,240
 be real but this story kind of made me go I'm kind of leaning a little more towards it."

283
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,680
 And they're a little spooky.

284
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,080
 So this is the theory and this is on the conspiracy iceberg that great and it's going to sound

285
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,920
 funny at first but this is really interesting to read.

286
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,600
 Great aliens are actually evolved dolphins.

287
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,320
 Now it doesn't necessarily mean they're evolved and they're from the future which is kind

288
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,400
 of what I thought the angle was at first and I was like "You want me to accept aliens

289
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,120
 and time travel in the same article?"

290
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,120
 But the article and there's quite a few articles on this.

291
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,760
 It really lays it out.

292
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,240
 So we're going to go back in time to talk about this.

293
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,120
 Now science shows that dolphins actually have little fingers and they're a little flipper

294
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
 things.

295
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
 They have little fingers.

296
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,200
 And in the fetus a dolphin fetus and a human fetus look the same.

297
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,960
 They have little hands, little face, you know they don't, big snout hasn't shown up.

298
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,680
 They do and I was like "Really?"

299
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,920
 And I looked at the picture and I'm like "Those do creepily the same."

300
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,880
 And so there's two schools of thought.

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,800
 One, as that dolphins used to be land creatures that moved into the water and evolved to exist

302
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 in the ocean.

303
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,920
 They're just like "Screw you land."

304
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,040
 And they kind of crawled off or walked in if they were a bipedal and then just over

305
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 the mill.

306
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,680
 I always think this is kind of ridiculous about evolution.

307
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,720
 They're telling me that every so often a dog ran to the river and then eventually a baby

308
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,360
 came out and it was a dolphin.

309
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,920
 Like I know it's not that simple but the idea of a dog going out farther and farther each

310
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,800
 generation then finally saying "I don't need this fur."

311
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,720
 But anyways for whatever reason, well I know it's a little more complicated than that.

312
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,400
 I got a hundred science majors yelling into their phones right now.

313
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,440
 Anyway so if you guys aren't yelling every episode but anyways so the dolphins used to

314
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,600
 be land animals.

315
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,840
 They moved into the water and that's why they have so many similarities.

316
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,000
 They're mammals and they have little fingers and they look like little human babies.

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,880
 But then there's another theory.

318
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,760
 But then there's another theory.

319
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,600
 That dolphins were sea creatures.

320
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,680
 They evolved to walk on land because they were getting closer and closer to the shore.

321
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,160
 It's kind of the reverse.

322
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,560
 And then the species said "Ask her this, I'm going back under the water."

323
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,440
 Because they don't necessarily know where it started.

324
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,880
 Now that might seem a little more fishy, get it?

325
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,080
 A little fishy.

326
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,600
 But it's a theory that's out there.

327
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,280
 That dolphins were sea animal and then they came to land and then they went back.

328
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,240
 And it's possible too that it was a land animal that went to the water and then came back onto

329
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,280
 the land and then went back onto the water.

330
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
 We don't know.

331
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,800
 I mean we just can look at the similarities and the little fingers and stuff like that

332
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,120
 and stuff that makes us think this might have been a land animal at some point.

333
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
 But the theory is this.

334
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,800
 What if there was a split in the species?

335
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,200
 Where there was a dolphin-like creature.

336
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,720
 And at one point, let's take the original scenario first.

337
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
 Let's actually do both of them.

338
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,120
 A wolf, a canine, some sort of land creature evolves into be a dolphin.

339
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,840
 And then eventually the species splits where some of them stay in the ocean but others

340
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,880
 do evolve to come back onto land.

341
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,120
 Those would be the gray aliens.

342
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,320
 So we're not talking about time travel or anything like that.

343
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,280
 We're talking about a separate species that lived among the normal species on the planet

344
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,120
 earth but had a different evolutionary pattern.

345
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,160
 So they would have been here as well for millions of years.

346
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,440
 Let's go over what a gray alien looks like real quick.

347
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,640
 Gray aliens are generally seen to be about 5 feet 5 inches.

348
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
 They're humanoid.

349
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,760
 Two arms, two legs.

350
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,880
 They have the big skull, the big black eyes, tiny little mouth.

351
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,760
 They tend to be gray and it's a non-porous skin.

352
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,120
 It's a very kind of a dolphin-like skin.

353
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,080
 But it has the large head kind of the curved skull.

354
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,880
 The back of the skull is rounded at the top and the eyes are slanted towards the back.

355
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,200
 So this is what they share in common with modern-day dolphins.

356
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,520
 According to people who have reportedly seen them and interacted with them.

357
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,560
 Same skin, color and touch.

358
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,000
 It has a very slick touch.

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
 They don't have pores like we do.

360
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,280
 Both have the large rounded front of the skull and the bump on the back of the skull.

361
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
 And you're like, "Well that's weird.

362
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,560
 I see dolphins and they're kind of smooth."

363
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,200
 But the research, the conspiracy is talking about the eye.

364
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
 If you took the skull of a dolphin, please don't do that.

365
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,560
 But if you took the skull of a dolphin, you'd have that same basic shape.

366
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,440
 Now the thing with the eyes, the big black eyes, that's something we generally see in

367
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,960
 creatures who live in a reduced light environment, which is what the ocean would be considered.

368
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,560
 You have those black eyes.

369
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,400
 And people have reported seeing what they thought was some sort of protective covering

370
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,240
 over the eyeballs, which is also something that sea creatures have and something that

371
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,640
 dolphins have.

372
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,560
 But here's the creepiest part.

373
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,960
 This is super, this is when I kind of was like, "Oh this is getting creepy."

374
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,120
 Because I could take any toothed animals and go, "Well a dog has four legs and a camel

375
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
 has four legs."

376
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,360
 Like, and especially one that hasn't been proven by science, you can work with the stuff.

377
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,840
 But this was, I think, one of the creepiest parts.

378
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,640
 Because again, it fits into UFO lore and it makes sense.

379
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,400
 There's no magic involved to do this.

380
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,440
 Dolphins can release an ultrasonic blast, basically.

381
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
 And we've known that they can do this.

382
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,560
 It's an ultrasound where they will be swimming and they'll see a fish and they'll go, "Ooooh!"

383
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,120
 And we won't hear it because it's an ultrasound.

384
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,520
 But the fish, one of three things will happen.

385
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,280
 It will get disoriented and it'll start swimming around in circles and the dolphin will eat

386
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 it.

387
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,360
 It will straight up get stunned and sit there and the dolphin will eat it.

388
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,280
 Or it just liquefies their organs and they die.

389
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,440
 It's a hunting technique that the dolphins have learned.

390
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,240
 It's a skill that they have in particular where they can direct this ultrasound towards

391
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,280
 a living creature and it will disorient them.

392
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,360
 At the very least, you won't be able to control or think.

393
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
 You won't be able to think about what's going on.

394
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,080
 The very most it'll kill you, but it can also just stun you.

395
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,200
 And the theory is this.

396
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,920
 In reports of gray aliens abducting people, you have the person waking up in the middle

397
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,480
 of the night.

398
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,280
 Lights are all off.

399
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,680
 There's a figure at the foot of their bed.

400
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,440
 And they can't move.

401
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,120
 Let me read you this quote here.

402
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,480
 They're talking about this ultrasound with the gray aliens.

403
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,520
 The result was physical paralysis and disorientation.

404
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,320
 I believe that this is the very same technique used by the grays in abductions.

405
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,680
 The similarities are overwhelming.

406
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,120
 Every abductee says that when they are abducted, they are paralyzed and become mentally disoriented.

407
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,720
 This is usually in the presence of a gray.

408
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,240
 The most striking thing they recall is what is called the stare.

409
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,320
 This is when the gray looks directly at an abductee.

410
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,360
 The large dark eyes capture the abductees attention immediately.

411
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,180
 They then report being unable to move and a feeling of great mental disorientation.

412
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,360
 On some rare occasions, abductees report a lessening of these effects when the gray looked

413
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,720
 away from them.

414
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,520
 This indicates that the intensity of the effect was directly proportional to the direction

415
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,000
 or focus of the front portion of the gray's head.

416
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,560
 When the alien turns its head, it feels like you have a little bit more control over your

417
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,640
 body.

418
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,300
 And dolphins have to be looking at the fish to direct that ultrasound attack.

419
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,180
 If it moves its head, the fish can reorient itself or start moving again because it's

420
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,020
 a directed beam.

421
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:58,380
 So is it possible that that's why you can't move when a gray alien shows up?

422
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,700
 Because they're looking right at you and you can never hear it, but they're directing that

423
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:09,600
 same ultrasound attack beam and you're just completely frozen.

424
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,800
 And when they turn to look at another gray, you can kind of start feeling your fingers

425
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,360
 move and your toes wiggle and then it turns back to you and you're frozen again.

426
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,600
 It's just looking down at you.

427
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
 That's creepy, personally.

428
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,760
 That's really really creepy.

429
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,280
 Is that what's causing people when they wake up?

430
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,440
 It's not sleep paralysis.

431
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,020
 The reason why they can't move is because the gray alien is directing this ultrasound

432
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,540
 attack.

433
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,660
 Could it be so advanced, not technologically, but skill wise, that that's what can cause

434
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,780
 for disorientation leading to things like missing time?

435
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,020
 Or forgetting the event and having just simple flashbacks about it?

436
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,700
 Let's deal real quickly and the conspiracy theory doesn't go so far into this, but I

437
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,220
 know your questions are what about the spaceships, where do they live?

438
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,720
 Here's the thing, if they're evolved to live in low light environments, Earth has these

439
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,760
 massive tunnel systems that have never been fully explored and will never fully be explored.

440
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,840
 So if they can't still live underwater, they don't have blowholes, they have regular old

441
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,680
 faces, they've evolved to live on land, they could be in any cave system in the world.

442
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,280
 And when we look at Native American legends, legends from around the world, we find stories

443
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,020
 of cursed caves, of gods coming out of caves, and things like that.

444
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,780
 What about the UFOs?

445
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,900
 The technology needed to build a UFO we don't know about.

446
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,660
 And that's where we start to get into the science fiction magic part of the theory again.

447
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,460
 Flying ships that don't require jet fuel that can hover, that can beam people aboard,

448
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,420
 these are all things we don't know about.

449
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:52,860
 But my argument always was about aliens coming from another planet, is that to build a box

450
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,920
 and to move in that box from location A to location B, I believe is an Earth concept.

451
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,080
 We do it, ants do it.

452
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,120
 The idea of looking at a river and going "I need to cross that, that must mean I need

453
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,440
 a vehicle" that's an Earth concept.

454
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,160
 I don't think that, I think that is a way, the reason why I say it's an Earth concept

455
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,840
 is because I think, let's say you lived on a planet that had absolutely no rivers, it

456
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,720
 all had wells, underground water supply.

457
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,000
 You wouldn't know what a boat was.

458
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,460
 You would never need one.

459
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,740
 But our planet has rivers and lakes and oceans and streams and all of this stuff.

460
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,780
 So even an ant looks at a stream and goes "I need to get to the other side of that, that

461
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,940
 must mean I need a boat."

462
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,220
 And they're not actually building a boat, but they'll take leaves and they'll float

463
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,380
 across.

464
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:44,860
 And I think if a million species evolved on a planet with all the water was underground

465
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,020
 and you would just kind of spring up and you'd just take a little lip, take a little

466
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
 slurp.

467
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,120
 You would never, if they saw a boat they'd be like "What's that?

468
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
 What's the point of putting stuff on that?"

469
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,560
 I mean just walk over there.

470
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
 So on and so forth.

471
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,200
 The same thing if everything was ocean and there was no land, you wouldn't need boats.

472
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
 Anyways, everything would be evolved to swim.

473
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,440
 So this idea of building a transport vehicle to go from one location to another, I think

474
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,200
 is a Earth design because we need those to exist on our planet.

475
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
 It's a gas giant.

476
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
 They wouldn't need those.

477
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,440
 They're just like "Oooh!" and they'd hold their breath and they'd float to float around.

478
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,880
 They wouldn't think "Oh, you know what I need to do?

479
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,960
 I need to mine stuff and then build rockets.

480
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,040
 A planet with no warfare would never have rocket technology."

481
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,800
 All of this stuff.

482
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,240
 We look at all these variables that are needed to build a starship.

483
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,760
 And you need a particular type of society to do it.

484
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,200
 You need a society that is communal and curious.

485
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,400
 One without the other, they would never build a spaceship.

486
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
 They could be super utopian.

487
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,560
 But if they're not a curious species, they're never going to go "What's out there?"

488
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,520
 You could have a curious species, but they're super barbaric.

489
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,080
 That's always bugged me about Klingons.

490
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,040
 Who's the engineer in the Klingons?

491
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,520
 They're building those ships.

492
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
 They're all a bunch of warriors.

493
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,280
 The same thing with the predators.

494
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,880
 Who works on the predator planet and they like design ships and all the other predators

495
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,800
 make fun of them because they don't have alien skulls on their wall.

496
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,280
 But building vessels and flying around and going underwater and that's very earthly.

497
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,240
 And so if the grays did evolve alongside of us in cave systems, they would go, "Well,

498
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,280
 we need some sort of transport."

499
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,480
 The UFOs that we see may not be what we think.

500
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,600
 It may not be the level of technology we think it may be.

501
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,720
 And they have simply over the years not burned every library during every single war.

502
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,320
 They could have been more cunning and more thoughtful and evolved along a path where

503
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,560
 they were focusing on inventing things.

504
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,160
 It could be, I mean, who knows?

505
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 Who knows?

506
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,120
 I would say that the UFOs that we see aren't as advanced as we think they are.

507
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,440
 That's my personal theory.

508
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,760
 That they're not this super advanced craft.

509
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,600
 It's just something we don't know because we haven't needed to know.

510
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,480
 So let's wrap this up in a bow.

511
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,760
 Gray aliens or are a breakaway of dolphins.

512
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,040
 And they've not lived among us, but they've lived alongside of us for as long as we've

513
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
 been around.

514
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:21,040
 Deep in the cave systems, right now, not traveling from some far-across galaxy, but right now,

515
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
 there could be a...

516
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
 Could you imagine...

517
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
 You know, that's the thing.

518
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,680
 People talk about the panic that would set in if the government released documents saying

519
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,160
 that aliens were real.

520
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,400
 And people go, "No, they wouldn't."

521
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,800
 Imagine if the government released documents saying that aliens are real, but they're actually

522
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
 on Earth.

523
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 We can't find them.

524
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,840
 And they've been here for 10 million years.

525
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,040
 That would be far more disturbing than coming from outer space.

526
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,320
 Because then you'd go, "What do we do?

527
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,960
 Do we blow up our own planet?

528
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,640
 It's not like they're an invading force.

529
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,720
 They're here.

530
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
 And there's millions of them.

531
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 They're in the caves.

532
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
 What are we going to do?

533
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,600
 Gas every single cave on the planet and get a bunch of UFOs attacking us?"

534
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,200
 I think that would be more disturbing.

535
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,280
 Because that would really make you rethink every single point of human history and go,

536
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,680
 "Maybe aliens did do that.

537
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,200
 Maybe Jesus was an alien.

538
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
 Maybe religion is fake, blah, blah, blah.

539
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,640
 Religion has configured itself to say, "Yeah, there's probably life out there."

540
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,880
 But religion, I don't think, could deal with the idea that there is life here that is smarter

541
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,240
 than we are.

542
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,200
 We are no longer masters of our own planet.

543
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,760
 It's one thing to have a rat infestation in your house.

544
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,120
 And it's another thing to move in a house that the rats already own.

545
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,160
 One, you are defending your own home, and in the other, you're on their turf.

546
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,800
 And you're playing by their rules.

547
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,520
 That I think is far creepier than any gray alien story I've heard.
