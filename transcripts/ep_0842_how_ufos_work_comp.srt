1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 It is salute to the inventors day on Dead Rabbit Radio, and we're gonna take a look at some of the wackiest inventions ever.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,680
 Not really, just three, just three that I found first off.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,620
 Is it possible to make medicine in your own home?

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,200
 Spoiler alert, it is not, but somebody tried.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:27,240
 Then we travel to Okifanoki Swamp, to meet a man who was on the cusp of unlocking the secrets of perpetual motion.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,540
 And then finally,

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,540
 we take a look at one of my personal theories.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:41,040
 Have I figured out how to build a real life UFO today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:52,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,540
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,540
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun,

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,540
 because that's what we're always doing here at Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,540
 Not just a couple pounds of fun, it has to be a literal ton.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,540
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our Thanksgiving livestream supporters.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,540
 You love him because he's square. Give it up for Kaki Cube.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
 Wooo, coming on into Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,540
 Now Kaki, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,540
 If you guys can't support this show financially, I totally get it.

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,540
 Just help spread the word about the show.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,540
 That really, really, really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
 Kaki, we're gonna go ahead and toss you the keys.

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
 Catch them in your little QB arms.

24
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,540
 To the Dead Rabbit Durgible, we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,540
 We are headed all the way out to a laboratory.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,540
 [Dog growling]

27
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,540
 The reason why we're headed out to a laboratory is we're about to meet Dr. Betty Martini.

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,540
 Now I know what you're thinking. I know what you're thinking. That's a made-up name.

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,540
 I don't think so, because Dr. Betty Martini gives us the real scoop.

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,540
 It gives us the thing that the lame stream media won't tell you.

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,540
 Because here's the thing.

32
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,540
 They usually cater to facts and stuff that can be verified,

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,540
 but Dr. Betty Martini has teamed up with one of our go-to websites,

34
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,540
 when you want conspiracy theory content, that is completely fictional.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,540
 I'm surprised they don't cover stuff that's going on in the world of Artemis Fowl on this website,

36
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,540
 darkoutpost.com.

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:31,540
 Dr. Betty Martini has discovered a way to make your own hydro-coxachlorine.

38
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,540
 Something like that. You're going to talk about medical stuff, learn how to renounce it.

39
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,540
 You know that stuff that they are saying helps with COVID?

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,540
 Okay, YouTube algorithm and Spotify. I'm not saying that this actually works.

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,540
 I don't know. I've never really... I don't know.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,540
 But anyways, there was a talk that there was something called hydro-coxachlorine.

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,540
 That's close. That was a little bit closer. Now the algorithm picked up on it.

44
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,540
 That it's an anti-malarial drug that people were saying was a cheap alternative.

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,540
 Like, you didn't need to get the vaccine. Again, please.

46
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,540
 Don't destroy the podcast, because I'm saying this. This is what people were saying.

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,540
 You didn't need to get a vaccine. That was all big pharma.

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,540
 You could simply take hydro-coxachlorine and it's like an anti-malarial drug

49
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,540
 and it would stop COVID dead in its tracks. You guys are familiar with all this stuff.

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,540
 Nobody's talking about this anymore, right? It's been like two weeks and everyone's like,

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,540
 "Ah, forget it. We're all focused on Ukraine."

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,540
 But for a while there, this was big stuff. Hydro-coxachlorine was an alternative...

53
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,540
 supposedly an alternative way to combat COVID.

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,540
 Well, maybe you don't want to spend money and go into the doctor and get this hydro-coxachlorine queen.

55
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,540
 Dr. Betty Martini, she said, "You know what? You make it yourself.

56
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,540
 If you don't want to go to the doctor and get this prescribed, you can actually make this medicine yourself."

57
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,540
 It's a simple 19-step process that I will post on darkoutpost.com.

58
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,540
 I mean, I know whenever I think of my medical needs, I like to go to a fringe conspiracy site

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,540
 to figure out how to take care of it.

60
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,540
 I will say this. It's a 19-step process and...

61
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,540
 step...let's jump ahead to step 18. You know, let's get to the good stuff.

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,540
 Step 18, it actually sets the stage for the other steps that we will look at.

63
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,540
 Step 18, this is step 18, so you've read 17 steps before you got to this quote,

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:32,540
 "For the record, I am not a doctor of any sorts and offer this from my own data research."

65
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,540
 Now, data research, that's a great phrase, right? It's better than just regular research.

66
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,540
 I do find it interesting that it's after going through the first 17 steps

67
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,540
 that Dr. Betty Martini informs us she's not a doctor of any sorts.

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,540
 Don't know why doctors in the front of her name...maybe that's the name her parents gave her.

69
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,540
 Maybe her parents said, "You will be doctor. You will form a long line of the Betty Martini clan."

70
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,540
 We're going to name you doctor, but after completing the first 17 steps,

71
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,540
 you've now learned that you have created medicine made by someone who's not a doctor,

72
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,540
 but it is their own data research, so that has to speak for something.

73
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,540
 And really, the fact that step 18 informs you that this is not medical in any way, shape, or form

74
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:24,540
 should let you know that the previous 17 steps are not steps on how to make this drug.

75
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,540
 You're like, "Wait a second, wait, what going on? Imagine this, imagine this.

76
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,540
 Imagine I had a recipe for chocolate cake."

77
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,540
 And step one goes, "Step one, I love chocolate cake. It's so yummy."

78
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,540
 Step two, and if you love chocolate cake too, you're going to love this recipe.

79
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,540
 Step three, the long and storied history of chocolate cake goes back thousands of years.

80
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,540
 We don't even get to a recipe until step 14.

81
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,540
 The first 13 steps are talking about the history of hydrochloroquine.

82
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,540
 Oh, there I think I actually pronounced it correctly that time.

83
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,540
 And like what it can do, the fact that it's an anti-malarial drug,

84
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,540
 don't put those as steps in your recipe.

85
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:20,540
 Right? I'm not saying you shouldn't include background information on a drug you're about to create in your own house,

86
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,540
 but that's not steps. It's really, really weird.

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,540
 I think they put it down as step one, step two.

88
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:33,540
 So it looks more complicated than it actually is, because really, it boils down to about three steps.

89
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,540
 And one of them is boiling. So again, just skip to this part.

90
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,540
 Step one, you need to get three lemons and three grapefruit.

91
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,540
 You know you're in for real medicine when it only involves two types of fruit.

92
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,540
 You take three lemons and three grapefruits, you peel the skin off them, or the rinds or whatever you call it,

93
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,540
 and you boil it in three inches of water.

94
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,540
 So you have like, well, to be sorry, sorry, I know this is super technical,

95
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
 and some of you guys are going to do it at home.

96
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,540
 You have to have three inches of water above the rinds.

97
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,540
 I got to get it right, right? You throw the rinds in a pot, you fill three inches of water above the rinds,

98
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,540
 and then you let it simmer in a pot with lid, put the lid on for two hours.

99
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,540
 And what you're doing is you're creating something.

100
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,540
 I don't know if this is true, but this is what they're saying.

101
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,540
 You're creating something called quinine.

102
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:33,540
 Quinine is an antimalarial drug that's in tonic water, and it is chemically close to, but not exactly like,

103
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,540
 very, very important, not exactly like hydrochloroquine.

104
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,540
 So basically what these previous 12 steps were saying was like, step seven, by the way,

105
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,540
 hydrochloroquine is the same thing as quinine, which is something you can get out of tonic water.

106
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,540
 I don't know why the recipe isn't just step 13, but I put just tonic water and drink that.

107
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
 But they're saying, and it's not the same actually.

108
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,540
 I did some research on it. It's not the same.

109
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,540
 It has similar chemical components.

110
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,540
 Hydrochloroquine is a synthetic version of this that's far, far stronger.

111
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,540
 But anyways, so if you're currently being chased by mosquitoes and you're afraid of getting malaria,

112
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,540
 do not think you can just drink this tea made of grapefruit and lemons.

113
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,540
 I would go and get the actual antimalarial drug.

114
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,540
 Anyways, quinine is what you're trying to create.

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,540
 You boil these lemon rinds and these grapefruit rinds for two hours,

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,540
 and then it says, don't take the pot off the lid.

117
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
 I know you're going to be very tempted.

118
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,540
 You're going to be very, very tempted to smell the sweet smell of grapefruit and lemon.

119
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,540
 You have to leave the lid on until you're done cooking,

120
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,540
 because if you take the lid off, apparently all the quinine floats away.

121
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,540
 Is that even possible? Is it possible to make medicine float away?

122
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
 You'll be like, no, come back penicillin.

123
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
 I guess maybe I am ignorant.

124
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,540
 I guess I'm ignorant in the ways of science, but the quinine apparently becomes mist.

125
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,540
 It comes with smoky chemicals floating around,

126
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,540
 and then it settles back into the water when you take it off the frying pan or the oven or whatever it's called.

127
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,540
 I guess I can't criticize this recipe if I don't know the name of a stove top.

128
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,540
 But you take it off the stove top, all the little chemicals have gone back to sleep in the water.

129
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
 They're not going to float away.

130
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,540
 After that, you put in a little bit of sugar or honey,

131
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,540
 and then every couple hours or so, very precise medical dosage here,

132
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,540
 every couple hours show, you just take a little tablespoon.

133
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,540
 You just reach into your pot of grapefruit and lemon rinds and take a little tablespoon,

134
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,540
 and you have now invented, according to someone who is not a real doctor,

135
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
 but goes by the name Dr. Betty Martini,

136
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,540
 you have created not hydrochloroquine, which is already super controversial,

137
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,540
 whether or not that even has any effect on COVID, right?

138
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,540
 You didn't create that, even though the article is called "How to Create Your Own Hydrochloroquine."

139
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,540
 You didn't create that, but step 13 tells us how to create maybe quinine,

140
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,540
 and you drink that, and it says continue to take a sip of this every couple hours,

141
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,540
 until the phlegm that's inside your lungs is coming up out of your throat.

142
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,540
 There you go, and once all that phlegm is gone,

143
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,540
 once that phlegm, when you have phlegm in your lungs, you are hospitalized.

144
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,540
 I can understand somebody making some homeopathic, useless brew at home,

145
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,540
 and being like, "Oh, my sore throat's finally gone,

146
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,540
 and all I had to do was for the past 14 days have a spoonful of warm honey.

147
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,540
 It had nothing to do with the sore throat running its course.

148
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,540
 No, it was the honey that did it.

149
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,540
 I can understand that, "Oh, I have an earache. I'm going to put a candle in my ear."

150
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,540
 "Oh, now my earache's gone, but my head is on fire."

151
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,540
 If you actually have phlegm inside your lungs, I think you're already hospitalized.

152
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,540
 I think normally when you're coughing up phlegm, right, it's not in your lungs,

153
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
 it's like in your throat, ugh.

154
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,540
 But anyway, so that is a recipe for lemon/grapefruit rinds,

155
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,540
 which they say is quinine or quinine, whatever.

156
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:09,540
 So there you go. It's as simple as a two-step recipe turned into a 19-step recipe

157
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,540
 by a doctor, not a doctor, involving nothing but grapefruit and lemon rinds.

158
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,540
 Absolutely bonkers. I've talked about this on other episodes.

159
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,540
 I don't think people go to the doctor enough.

160
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,540
 I am pro-doctor, not Dr. Betty Martini.

161
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,540
 If your doctor is Betty Martini, find a new doctor.

162
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 But if you've ever wondered how to waste an afternoon, there we go.

163
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,540
 And Jason, wait, I thought you said we were doing Inventor's Day.

164
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,540
 Like, you call that an inventor? The guy's just putting limes and lemons and stuff.

165
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,540
 That's not really an invention. Well, you know what, Cacky Cube, let's go ahead

166
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,540
 and toss you the keys to the air hovercraft.

167
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,540
 We're leaving behind this laboratory, war-headed deep into the Okifanoki swamp.

168
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,540
 [huffing]

169
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,540
 The air hovercraft is hovering over all the swampy waters.

170
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,540
 Frogs are running for cover. No! And there's like a goose sitting there.

171
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,540
 I'm not moving. And we run him over. We kill that stubborn goose.

172
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,540
 We have goose for dinner.

173
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,540
 We're flying in this hovercraft through the Okifanoki swamp.

174
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,540
 The date is January 13th, 1900.

175
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,540
 And this obituary begins appearing in newspapers.

176
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
 Some of them local, some of them national.

177
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,540
 It's just one of those weird news items that we do have a copy of this obituary.

178
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,540
 For a man called Charles Howard.

179
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:37,540
 This 82-year-old man, he passes away and his obituary shows that his life work is just not complete.

180
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,540
 Unfortunately, he's passed away. You won't be able to finish it.

181
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,540
 But maybe someone else will pick up the mantle.

182
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,540
 In the Okifanoki swamp in Georgia, Charles Howard, he was a hermit living in the swamp.

183
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,540
 And he had this little small broken down hut. Imagine it like Yoda.

184
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,540
 I wonder what he wore. If you were a hermit, would you ever put on clothes?

185
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,540
 Would you ever be like, "Ah, it's such a beautiful day. Time to put on pants."

186
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,540
 I mean, you're a hermit. And you're in the swamp too.

187
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,540
 So I think if you put on clothes, you're like, "Oh, what a nice day. I'm gonna go jogging."

188
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,540
 And you immediately step into muddy water. You're like, "Aww."

189
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,540
 And you probably wouldn't wear pants.

190
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,540
 It wasn't stated in this obituary that he just was a streaker.

191
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,540
 He's just running around. Everything's dangling out.

192
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,540
 Doesn't say that. Doesn't specify his clothing.

193
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,540
 But I imagine that you would at least wear shorts.

194
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
 You wouldn't wear pants if you lived in the swamp.

195
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,540
 You're like, "Jason, is your only idea of a swamp, Yoda's house?"

196
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,540
 Yeah, pretty much. I imagine it's just muddy water everywhere.

197
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
 And he has this little hut and he's walking around.

198
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,540
 But this isn't a fashion podcast, although it should be.

199
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,540
 He was a weirdo. He would be in play.

200
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,540
 I don't know why I have to say that. He's a hermit living in a swamp.

201
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,540
 He's a weirdo, though. But people liked him in town.

202
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
 Every show, often he'd come into town, I guess that answers the question.

203
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,540
 He probably did wear pants. He'd come into town and buy supplies.

204
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,540
 He's like, "Two pairs of pants, please."

205
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,540
 They're like, "What about food? What about..." He's like, "Ah, no, I got that to take care of."

206
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,540
 I eat nothing but goose that are run over by hovercrafts.

207
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
 He's walking around. People know him.

208
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,540
 But he was focused on his mission. He was an inventor.

209
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,540
 He was an inventor. I actually really love this story. It's really cool.

210
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,540
 An 82-year-old dude dies. I love it when he elderly die alone in swamps.

211
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,540
 No, he was this inventor and he was working on a perpetual motion machine.

212
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,540
 Everyone needs to have a goal. Everyone needs to have a passion.

213
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,540
 He was working on a perpetual motion machine.

214
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,540
 Now, his machine, as much as I think it's really cool that he came up with it

215
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,540
 and he was working so hard on something, incredibly cruel.

216
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,540
 This machine is incredibly cruel.

217
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,540
 But fascinating nonetheless, his perpetual motion machine was a giant spinning wheel

218
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,540
 and inside it were two huge rats.

219
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:06,540
 They were attached to the device in such a way that they could only run in the wheel.

220
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,540
 They're basically trapped. They couldn't get out of the wheel.

221
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,540
 So they would run and they would run and they would run and they would run.

222
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,540
 They would run and they would start to get panicked. They would start to get starved.

223
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,540
 They would run and they would run and they would run and they would run and they would run.

224
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,540
 He would watch this wheel and he would be taking notes.

225
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,540
 He's running down in the mud. He wakes up. It's high tide. He's like, "No! My life's work!"

226
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,540
 He's watching these rats run in this giant wheel.

227
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,540
 They would run all day and all night until one of them died

228
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,540
 and then he would take the corpse rat out, splash, throw it in the water

229
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,540
 and he would attach a new rat to it and the cycle literally would continue anew

230
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,540
 over and over and over again.

231
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,540
 He said the swamp was full of rats.

232
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,540
 So as far as he was concerned, an endless energy supply.

233
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,540
 His machine would use up to 100 rats a year.

234
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,540
 So what is that? Each rat would probably run around for 3.65 days or something like that.

235
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,540
 He would like to have math. He would run around and he would sit there and he would be taking notes.

236
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,540
 He was not shy about this.

237
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,540
 Now nowadays if you went into town wearing muddy shorts and someone said,

238
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
 "Hey, what are you up to, Charles?"

239
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,540
 He was like, "I built this machine. It captures rats."

240
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,540
 And they would run around in a circle until they died and eventually all created perpetual motion.

241
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,540
 You'd get arrested. You totally get arrested because the cops want to keep the truth from us.

242
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,540
 But back then people were more open-minded about animal abuse.

243
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,540
 These rats would run around and they would go, "Why are you trying to build this?"

244
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
 And he goes, "Money!"

245
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,540
 He goes, "If I can figure out the secret to perpetual motion, I'll be the richest man alive."

246
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,540
 And the thing is, I'm this close to getting this to work.

247
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,540
 If I can get this machine to work and these rats run forever, then I'll be rich.

248
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,540
 I'll be the richest man. I'll be the richest man in the swamp.

249
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:15,540
 He says, "The only thing I can't figure out is how to feed them without them stopping

250
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
 because then the energy is dispersed."

251
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,540
 He goes, "If I can figure out a way that as they're running, they're getting fed,

252
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,540
 well then baby, this is perpetual motion."

253
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,540
 And he says this very interesting quote.

254
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,540
 More interesting than being a rat murderer and killing 100 rats a year.

255
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,540
 He said, "I'm not losing anything by trying to do this.

256
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,540
 This is my afternoon. I can keep trying to do this.

257
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,540
 If it works, I'm going to make a ton of money and if it doesn't work,

258
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,540
 well, there's just less rats in the world.

259
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,540
 I can do this. I can get this done."

260
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
 Well, he didn't.

261
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,540
 We don't live in a world of perpetual motion machines, but he tried.

262
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
 He tried and that was the thing.

263
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,540
 If he could just figure out that one thing, if he figured out a way to keep the rats eating

264
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,540
 the whole time, they could always run this wheel.

265
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,540
 It could run for years instead of days and having to swap out a new rat

266
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,540
 and he would have invented perpetual motion.

267
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
 Animal abuse aside.

268
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,540
 Considering that's a key component, it's kind of hard to put aside.

269
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,540
 Animal abuse aside, I love this story because it is about a guy who has a dream

270
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:27,540
 and so often, I think people don't dream big enough.

271
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,540
 I think people, a lot of people don't dream.

272
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,540
 They don't allow themselves the opportunity to dream.

273
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,540
 When they're falling asleep, they're like, "Oh, I got to throw some tax on the bed."

274
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,540
 So before I hit REM sleep, I'll wake myself up.

275
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
 Some people don't allow themselves to dream.

276
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
 Some people allow themselves to dream, but they go, "I don't have...

277
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,540
 My brother's like that a lot. My brother, he would love to write.

278
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,540
 He comes up with these story ideas. He'd love to write books and stuff like that.

279
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,540
 But oh, you know, I got family stuff. I got work stuff."

280
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,540
 Also, he's my brother. So he's a terrible writer, right?

281
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,540
 I got to insult my brothers.

282
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,540
 But I say, dude, just do it, right? Just do it.

283
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,540
 Dream big.

284
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
 Oh, no, I got to understand that.

285
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,540
 A lot of people do that. Some people don't dream at all.

286
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,540
 Then you have a lot of people who dream, but then they say, "Nope, I can't do it.

287
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,540
 I don't have the talent. I don't have the time."

288
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:22,540
 Dream big, because this hope, this bum in the middle of the swamp...

289
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,540
 Yes, he did murder a bunch of rats, but he also had a dream,

290
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,540
 and he put it into motion, no pun intended, every single day.

291
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,540
 And you just do that. You just do those things. Dream big.

292
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,540
 That's why I'm a huge proponent of that.

293
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,540
 Don't just dream, dream big, because this guy did.

294
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,540
 And you know what? Every other person who died on this day back in 1900,

295
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
 we don't know who they were.

296
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,540
 Unless I'm world leader, I don't know. Maybe a president died back then.

297
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,540
 But for the most part, like, a lot of people, hundreds, thousands,

298
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,540
 maybe millions of people died around this same time, left no legacy.

299
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,540
 And this guy, this guy at least was...

300
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,540
 He dreamt big enough to leave this legacy behind.

301
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,540
 A legacy of dead rats and a perpetual emotional machine in the middle of a swamp.

302
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,540
 And then I wonder, where's this machine now?

303
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,540
 Did some government operatives go? "Oh, he was close."

304
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,540
 "Maybe we can figure out the rat conundrum."

305
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
 And they got this machine.

306
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,540
 I wonder what happened to it. The rats took it back.

307
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,540
 The reverse engineer, there's people running in it right now.

308
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,540
 They're like, "Ahh! What a horrible hell to be trapped in."

309
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
 Anyways, dream big. Charles Howard, we salute you.

310
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,540
 You love rats.

311
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,540
 This is so funny. I love this story because it is about just going for it no matter what,

312
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,540
 but at the end of the day, he murdered a bunch of living things.

313
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,540
 Like, I'm so not down with killing all these rats, but...

314
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,540
 Charles Howard, we have salute you.

315
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,540
 We salute you with our fingers crossed behind our back, because we don't really mean the salute.

316
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,540
 I guess it's more insulting. And we salute the rats, too.

317
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,540
 Let's just salute the little rats.

318
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,540
 You guys are eating all the cheese in heaven.

319
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,540
 Kaki Cube, let's hop in that carbonic hop dur.

320
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,540
 I'm gonna toss you the keys, and we are leaving behind Okie Finokie Swamp.

321
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,540
 We are headed all the way out to an alien base.

322
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,540
 T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t

323
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:22,540
 I know when you guys saw the title of this episode, which I haven't titled it yet, but I'm sure it'll be something like "I Discovered the Secret to UFOs."

324
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,540
 "Aliens Hate" is one simple trick to building their vehicles.

325
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,540
 I don't know what clickbaity headline I'm gonna have, and you're probably thinking,

326
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:39,540
 "You see, I'm gonna spend 20, 30 minutes talking about the worst nonsense possible before he gets to what the title of the video is,

327
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,540
 or the episode is. You know the show, of course I'm gonna do that, right?"

328
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,540
 And when we get to the ending, we're sitting at this alien base right here.

329
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,540
 It's this huge landing pad. We're on the moon.

330
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,540
 We're sitting there in our spacesuits. I hope you brought one. You're all suffocating to death.

331
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,540
 I'm like, "Oh, I brought one." Me and Kaki Cube have ours. You didn't bring the spacesuit as you're turning blue.

332
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,540
 Ah, you can borrow one of ours.

333
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,540
 We're sitting there on the moon. We're at this alien base, and the answer to this question is so simple.

334
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,540
 You're gonna wish that I had it, but you're gonna wish I'd covered this in the beginning.

335
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,540
 It's almost something that I could say in a sentence, but much like Dr. Betty Martini,

336
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,540
 I feel it needs like a little bit of lead-up, but it's not padding. I just think it takes a little bit of lead-up to this.

337
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,540
 I said before on the podcast, and I've believed this for years,

338
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:36,540
 when we discover the secret too faster than like travel, it's going to be such a like, "Oh my God, seriously, it's that simple."

339
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,540
 I really think it's going to be something like that. I think it's going to be one of those things that,

340
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:47,540
 technologically speaking, we kept ourselves from discovering.

341
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:53,540
 The answer was so easy that we didn't see it. That's always been a theory of mine.

342
00:22:53,540 --> 00:23:01,540
 It's funny because the reason why we believe faster than like travel exists as fans of the paranormal is because aliens do it.

343
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,540
 I think if there was no alien contact, if we had never seen any UFOs,

344
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,540
 and we didn't think there were other people out there visiting us,

345
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,540
 when Einstein and when scientists were saying, "You can't go faster than the speed of light,"

346
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,540
 I think most people would have go, "Oh, yeah, probably."

347
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,540
 I think there's a lot of scientific principles we just go, "Oh, yeah, that totally makes sense."

348
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,540
 But because we have this ideology, this theory that aliens are visiting us,

349
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,540
 and they must be traveling faster than light, you must be able to do that.

350
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,540
 If it wasn't for science fiction movies and it wasn't for disbelief in aliens,

351
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,540
 we would assume that Einstein and the scientists were correct.

352
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,540
 There's no way to travel faster than the speed of light.

353
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,540
 We would see ourselves in the cosmos as, "Oh, it will take us 32 years to get to Alpha Centauri," or whatever.

354
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,540
 I've always thought when we do discover that faster than light travel is possible,

355
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,540
 it will be so easy, we'll be like, "Damn it, we could have done this way earlier."

356
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,540
 We really could have done this way, way earlier.

357
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,540
 So here's my theory, we're sitting here, and you guys are gonna either be intrigued,

358
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,540
 or you guys are gonna be intrigued, or you're gonna shut the podcast off.

359
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:15,540
 We're sitting here at this alien base, and this is my theory, I came up with the other day.

360
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,540
 We see two great aliens walking out onto the base as well.

361
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,540
 And the aliens look at us, they kind of give us a, "Hey, what's up?"

362
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,540
 And we look back, "Hey, what's up, bro?"

363
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,540
 And they're standing there for a second, and you see them just concentrating.

364
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,540
 Now, the platform's completely empty.

365
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,540
 They're just focusing their mental power.

366
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:42,540
 And then, seemingly out of nowhere, we begin to watch a--

367
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:53,540
 what can only be described as a stereotypical flying saucer begin to materialize on this landing pad.

368
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
 Here's my theory.

369
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,540
 Wait, I have to explain a little bit more.

370
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
 The definition of a UFO, right?

371
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:06,540
 Because obviously, there's objects in the sky all the time that are explainable.

372
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,540
 The definition of a UFO, it's not just that it's unidentified.

373
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,540
 It's that it does things that are against the laws of physics.

374
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,540
 One, travels faster than the speed of light, presumably, because it's traveling from an alien planet.

375
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:26,540
 One, it does maneuvers that no human-built vehicle could ever do, like going straight up, super fast, making--

376
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,540
 it's not just that we can't identify what it is.

377
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,540
 It's that it does things that breaks the laws of physics.

378
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:39,540
 If UFOs were just things that we'd saw take off flying in land, we would assume they were terrestrial.

379
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,540
 We look at these vehicles and they disappear, right?

380
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:49,540
 They'll go full speed underwater, like they'll just hit underwater and they should be obliterated.

381
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:55,540
 We'll see them do maneuvers that no earthbound vehicle could do, not just because their engines can't do it,

382
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,540
 but because physics doesn't allow it.

383
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,540
 So a definition of alien craft isn't just that you can't physically identify it by looking at it.

384
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,540
 It does things that a human vehicle cannot do, appears and disappears,

385
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,540
 travels at the speed of light, defies the laws of physics.

386
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,540
 So how could you build a vehicle like that? We certainly cannot build those things.

387
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,540
 So how are these being built?

388
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,540
 The law of attraction.

389
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:33,540
 It's so simple that it's almost infuriating.

390
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:38,540
 But the law of attraction is this.

391
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,540
 You believe that something has already been created.

392
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:50,540
 It's not that you want something. It's that you go, "I have $50,000 in my bank account."

393
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,540
 And you have to truly believe you have $50,000 in your bank account.

394
00:26:55,540 --> 00:27:00,540
 Now you continue through your life and it's not that this $50,000 magically appears in your bank account,

395
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,540
 so some people will say that it can. Maybe it's a bank error and they don't catch it and stuff like that,

396
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
 but I'd be cautious of that.

397
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:13,540
 But the law of attraction is you're putting out into the universe, you already have $50,000 in your bank account,

398
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:20,540
 and you have to truly believe you do. You could be literally spending your last dollar on a ham sandwich from a gas station,

399
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,540
 but you have to believe you have $50,000 in your account.

400
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,540
 You have to act like you have $50,000 in your account, and business opportunities will open up.

401
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,540
 You'll find something that you can sell for that amount of money.

402
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,540
 The universe creates what you believe.

403
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,540
 The law of attraction, that's what the law of attraction is. It's not simply wanting it.

404
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,540
 It's that you believe you're already having it and live according to the fact that you believe that you already have it,

405
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:56,540
 and the universe goes, "Oh, I guess this is what is real now," and it reforms itself to you.

406
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,540
 The law of attraction, and we as humans think of it in very, very basic terms,

407
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,540
 like money, like relationships, like status,

408
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,540
 but what's the one thing we always encounter with aliens interacting with humans?

409
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:19,540
 They are always, always smarter than us.

410
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,540
 And you would, and I've always assumed, this is a very recent thing I've thought about,

411
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,540
 the law of attraction vis-a-vis aliens.

412
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,540
 I've always assumed whenever these aliens come down, they always do kind of act like there are these ascended masters, right?

413
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,540
 And I've always thought, "Well, yeah, you know, they do have such advanced technology if they're getting here,

414
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,540
 so they probably do know more than us," but it's more than that.

415
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:45,540
 They have mastered the mental laws of the universe as a society.

416
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,540
 The law of attraction is done on a human-by-human level.

417
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,540
 Most people don't believe that it exists.

418
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,540
 And then you have a group of people who believe that exists, but they can't get it to work for them,

419
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,540
 so they're kind of wavering.

420
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,540
 And then you have people who not only believe it exists, they know it exists.

421
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:08,540
 They believe it existed before they even heard it, and that is why the law of attraction came into their life,

422
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,540
 and they began utilizing it, and then some people do it without even trying.

423
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,540
 Some people just seem lucky they're using this law of attraction, and this is the way humans do it.

424
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:26,540
 They do it on a very singular level, but if you had an alien culture that accepted the law of attraction,

425
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,540
 like we accept the law of gravity and the law of perpetual motion and things like this not existing,

426
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,540
 it has to eventually energy decays, but we have our thermodynamic laws.

427
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,540
 We understand these laws, but if alien races go, "Yeah, that's all well and good.

428
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,540
 There are thermodynamics and gravity. These are laws, but there's another law as well."

429
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:55,540
 The law of attraction, they could simply believe they had a ship that was faster than light,

430
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,540
 that could defy all other laws, and then that ship will be provided to them.

431
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:08,540
 If I want $50,000 in my bank account, I can believe I have $50,000 in my bank account,

432
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,540
 but I also know in the back of my head I don't have $50,000 in my bank account,

433
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,540
 so when I go out to lunch, I'll sometimes check my account to find out that I have enough money for lunch.

434
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:25,540
 But the alien, once you have ascended so much as a society, the doubt is gone.

435
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:32,540
 Once you see that the law of attraction truly works, then you have no doubt.

436
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,540
 And if we were taught as children that the law of attraction was a basic scientific principle,

437
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:43,540
 imagine if you were taught that from age four. You might think the world would be chaos,

438
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,540
 because then you'd have four-year-olds wanting to be Superman and they'd all be flying around,

439
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,540
 and now you're going to discipline someone who can punch a hole through a building.

440
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:56,540
 Well, it's a little more complicated than that, I know, but you would have a society that would know

441
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:06,540
 what it is capable of as a species. And again, maybe you can't do that with humans because we have so much...

442
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:13,540
 We do seem to be a very, very vicious species, okay? We just do, unfortunately.

443
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:19,540
 But imagine if you were taught that, imagine if everyone was taught from grade school that this was possible.

444
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,540
 And I'm not saying everyone would be able to master it and people would still scoff at it,

445
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,540
 but for the most part, it was considered a law alongside the law of physics.

446
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:32,540
 As a society, as an entire civilization, you could say, "We want vehicles that are going to be faster than light,"

447
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:39,540
 and we believe that we already own these vehicles that are faster than light that'll let us travel from our planet to any living planet,

448
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,540
 in the blink of an eye. They would get those vehicles.

449
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:50,540
 The universe would provide the vehicles to them because they believed they already had those vehicles.

450
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:57,540
 They've truly ascended past the physical to the metaphysical.

451
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:05,540
 So the point that the metaphysical is part of their day-to-day physical life.

452
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,540
 It's an answer so simple, it sounds dumb. It sounds dumb.

453
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:18,540
 But it makes sense because the one thing that we can look about aliens is they have more technology than us,

454
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:25,540
 and they seem more connected. When I was saying they seemed smarter, they seem more connected to the universe.

455
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:31,540
 Humans are constantly asking aliens about things like life after death and God.

456
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:39,540
 We've had so many different answers with those things, but no one has ever asked an alien about the law of attraction.

457
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,540
 As far as I can tell, that's never happened.

458
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,540
 But when they talk about God and they talk about religion, and even though they have a multitude of different answers,

459
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:55,540
 it's a very interesting thing, but why? I went to Bulgaria and asked the dude, "What do you think about God?"

460
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:01,540
 And I came back and said, "Guys, stop the presses! I met some weird dude in Bulgaria and you won't believe what he said about God."

461
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,540
 You'd be like, "Who cares what some random dude says?"

462
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,540
 But if I told you an alien told me about God, it carries more weight. Why?

463
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:16,540
 Because we do assume they're more connected to everything in reality, not just higher technology,

464
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:22,540
 not just higher intelligence, but higher spiritual intelligence. It's super weird, but think about it.

465
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:30,540
 Think about it. We talk about it all the time on this show, and people do often ask aliens, "So what about God?"

466
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,540
 Because we assume that they are not just mentally ascended, but spiritually ascended.

467
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,540
 I believe that this could be the key.

468
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,540
 That UFOs, the reason why they're able to do whatever they want, is because of the law of attraction.

469
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,540
 They do whatever they want because the aliens have crafted them to do whatever they want.

470
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:59,540
 These vehicles think about it. They have no rivets. They're just a... they defy everything we know about the physical world.

471
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,540
 Law of attraction would allow those things to happen.

472
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,540
 Some UFOs controlled with a single button. It can go anywhere it wants it with a single button.

473
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:16,540
 Other things have control panels. Why? Because the controls are based on what that civilization really thinks should be in there.

474
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:23,540
 These things defy the law of physics. Therefore, are they built in the world of the metaphysics?

475
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:30,540
 Are these things created by aliens that truly understand the law of attraction?

476
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,540
 They believe that they have this vehicle that can do this, so the universe creates this vehicle for them.

477
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,540
 And like I said, the human law of attraction, if I say that I have $50,000 in my bank,

478
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,540
 the universe starts working through the pathways that humans have already built.

479
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,540
 So it will open up business opportunities for me.

480
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,540
 Maybe I'll meet someone who's looking to hire someone and I'm going to get this job and I'll get $50,000.

481
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,540
 It's based on the rivers and the roads that humans have created. That is how the money comes to you.

482
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:08,540
 But if the aliens have a much more advanced rivers and roads system, the vehicles may just simply materialize.

483
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,540
 Or maybe it's not as magical as my example was set.

484
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,540
 Maybe they just believe they have the vehicle and they have to use their infrastructure and their science to build this.

485
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,540
 But if they believe their science is smart enough to do this, then their science is smart enough to do this.

486
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
 So on and so forth.

487
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,540
 I know this might be a super controversial opinion. I know people may not like it, right?

488
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:38,540
 But this is, I really think that this could explain why UFOs exist and how they do what they do.

489
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,540
 And we're not just technologically behind the times. We're spiritually behind the times.

490
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,540
 And I'm not saying that in a God way. I'm saying that again in that metaphysical way.

491
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:57,540
 It could also be why we've never really been able to successfully re-engineer one of these things from top to bottom.

492
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:05,540
 We might have been able to take some ideas off of them, but for the most part, we have not built working UFOs in the way that they are built there.

493
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,540
 Because we don't believe we can. We believe that technology is so far advanced.

494
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,540
 And our little brains can't open up to the belief that we already have technology that advanced.

495
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,540
 Therefore, we have these UFOs and...

496
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,540
 Or is this just a theory, right? I mean, technically, yes, it is just a theory.

497
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,540
 But I think it's a really valid one.

498
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,540
 The law of attraction has been mastered by all of our alien neighbors.

499
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,540
 And it's almost like they're waiting for us to catch up to them.

500
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,540
 And the idea is so simple. There's been dozens of books written on it.

501
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,540
 Two, two work. Two are really good.

502
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,540
 But there's been dozens of other mediocre books written on it.

503
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:51,540
 I recommend It Works and The Science of Getting Rich. Those are my two favorite books.

504
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,540
 And the truth was there. The secret was there all along.

505
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,540
 We just didn't believe. We made the problem far more complicated than it had to be.

506
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:12,540
 We could be traveling faster than light by the end of the year if we believed that we were already cruising the cosmos.

507
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,540
 Not just as an individual, but as a collective.

508
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:29,540
 Maybe the only thing holding us back from joining our cosmic brothers and sisters is our own mental limitations.
