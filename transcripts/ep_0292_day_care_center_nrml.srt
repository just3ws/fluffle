1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
 Dracula is spotted in modern-day Florida, and then we take a look at a creepy daycare

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,200
 center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
 What secrets lie behind its lime-green walls?

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,760
 Is it a front for drug-running, weapon smuggling, or something much, much darker today on Dead

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,360
 Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,560
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
 Episode 4?

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
 A vampire week.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,560
 4th episode I've recorded in a row.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,480
 This is going pretty good.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
 It's going pretty good so far.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
 I have to take breaks now.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,360
 The last two episodes I've taken about a 20-minute break, open the windows up, get

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
 a little hot.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 I have my beverage.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,440
 If you guys ever want to drink, what Dead Rabbit drinks?

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,880
 My name's not really Dead Rabbit.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,000
 People refer to me as that, but you want to drink what Jason drinks?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,480
 We'll call it Jjuice.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 I was trying to figure out a name for it.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,680
 I take...you can use the non-diet versions.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
 I use diet though.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,200
 Do you know if you drink too much Mountain Dew, you can get gigantism?

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,720
 There's actually a chemical in it.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,320
 I might have talked about this on an earlier episode.

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,040
 I'm getting old, so forget what I talk about.

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,200
 If you drink too much Mountain Dew, it'll make your feet and your hands swell up.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,120
 We'll use that for our recipe.

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,080
 You take a can of diet Mountain Dew, if you want to be specific.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,400
 And then I get those bottles of sparkling water from Walmart, like clear American ice.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,440
 I get a cherry lemonade, clear American ice.

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,680
 A can of diet.

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,200
 You guys are like, "This is riveting podcasting."

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 Take one of those.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,080
 Take a little bit of diet Mountain Dew, pour it in a cup.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 So good.

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
 So, so good.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,160
 Let's actually get started with the actual episode here.

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,120
 Let's hop...what happened with Dead Rabbit Durgible?

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
 We haven't used that thing in a long time.

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
 Let's hop on board the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,040
 We're going to float around beautiful America.

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
 See the sights.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,240
 Laugh at everyone, not in the Durgible.

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
 Throw tomatoes at them.

49
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
 We dive bomb them.

50
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,880
 You're like, "Eeeerr, coming down super close, going back up."

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
 Should I tell the cow story?

52
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
 Do I have time to tell...I think I have time to tell the cow story.

53
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,880
 Skip ahead three minutes if you don't want to hear another ramble.

54
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,920
 These were working gateway computers back in the day.

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,840
 I pretty much work in customer service since I was 18.

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
 That's my preferred job.

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,280
 I love customer service.

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
 So I was working in customer service.

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,360
 I was working at gateway computers and we had a giant inflatable cow that was tethered

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
 with these three straps.

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,400
 Maybe it was just two, but anyways, it was tethered.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,480
 It was up in the parking lot.

63
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,960
 We're all in the gateway building.

64
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
 We're all in this little shop.

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,320
 This is off of Arden Way in Sacramento.

66
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,040
 There was a particularly windy day and one of the tethers snapped.

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,800
 So now it just has one tether.

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,240
 So it's basically like a kite instead of being like moored to the ground.

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
 Just one single string.

70
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,080
 Me and my buddies are sitting...that's probably like 23, 24 when this happened.

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,120
 Me and my buddies are sitting in gateway computers waiting for customers to come in.

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
 Company went out of business for a reason.

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,760
 No one ever came in, but we're watching this cow like just apparently hang on.

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
 None of us wanted to go out.

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
 It was super dangerous.

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,600
 You can't control a flying cow.

77
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
 Masscott of gateway computers is a cow.

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,600
 I guess I just said that too.

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,520
 You're like, "Why is there a cow at a computer store?"

80
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,200
 And the wind would take a hold of it and never so often it would dive bomb into the parking

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 lot.

82
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,000
 We're just standing there and we'd see it go whoosh, like flying to the parking lot

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
 and then get whipped back up by the wind and it would stay up there for a while.

84
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,520
 Then we'd see it go whoosh, come down and hit the ground and go back up in the sky.

85
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
 We're just sitting there.

86
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,000
 None of us want to work with it.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
 None of us want to go fix it.

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
 We're just sitting there.

89
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,280
 We're watching this woman hold into the parking lot.

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,080
 She holds into the parking lot.

91
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,240
 She opens her door.

92
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,920
 We're just standing there.

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,440
 And she was...

94
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,520
 She starts walking across the parking lot to come into gateway computers and we all know

95
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,240
 what's going to happen.

96
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,040
 Not a single word is exchanged amongst us.

97
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,480
 We're just all same as me, two of my buddies.

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
 We're just watching this thing.

99
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,240
 She's walking across the parking lot and out of nowhere to her, we knew it was bound to

100
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,440
 happen that cow came down and knocked her off of her feet.

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,200
 She hit her so hard she fell to the ground and the funny part about it, none of us reacted.

102
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,040
 We just stood there and we knew it was going to...

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,360
 It was like watching a cartoon on a cliff.

104
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,040
 We were just like, "It's going to happen."

105
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
 Eventually, we didn't laugh.

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
 We didn't run out to help her.

107
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
 We just stood there still perfectly quiet.

108
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,000
 We can't hear anything because we're inside.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,040
 We just see the cow come down, knock her off her feet.

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,160
 She looks up at this cow, but she comes inside, she complains.

111
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,360
 I don't even know if she was coming to a gateway computer.

112
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,840
 She comes inside and she goes, "Hey, did you guys know that thing hit me?

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
 What's going on out there?"

114
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,880
 And we're just like, "Oh, sorry, we didn't know that it broke free of its morning."

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
 She was fine.

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
 Anyways, anyways.

117
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
 Oh, dead rabbit, dirgible.

118
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
 Dive bombing people.

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,480
 Now, if you fast forwarded, you didn't really miss anything.

120
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,400
 I was just talking about a giant cow.

121
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,240
 We're going to Alta Monte Springs in Florida, a little suburb down there.

122
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,400
 And we're specifically going to the corner of 464, which I'm assuming is some sort of

123
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
 freeway, corner of 464 and Maitland Avenue.

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,800
 So if you know this area, you might know what we're talking about.

125
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,480
 On this corner, there is a Walgreens.

126
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,840
 Now you're up, it's 24-hour Walgreens.

127
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
 You're feeling sick.

128
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,360
 You're like, "Oh, I got hit by a cow last night."

129
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,320
 And I still feel my brain hurts.

130
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,560
 So you go, "I need some brain medication from Walgreens."

131
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,320
 And you go refill my prescription for my concussion.

132
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,280
 So you walk into Walgreens and you're like, "Oh, I'm dizzy."

133
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,400
 I'm seeing cows, little cartoon cows floating above your head.

134
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,520
 Walking through Walgreens, you don't feel good.

135
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,920
 You feel utterly terrible.

136
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,640
 And as you're walking through Walgreens, you turn a corner and there's Dracula.

137
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,960
 Now you're like, "What in the world is Dracula doing at a Walgreens at 10 p.m.?"

138
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,800
 Or three, I mean, really at any time.

139
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,760
 It could be two in the afternoon.

140
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
 Why is Dracula standing there?

141
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,640
 Now, it's Dracula.

142
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,120
 Full on Dracula costume.

143
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,520
 Big long cape, has the widow's peak wig, you know, like the little slick back hair going

144
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,080
 to the little widow's peak.

145
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,320
 He's just standing there, suit, you know, traditional Dracula clothes.

146
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,800
 How you would dress as Dracula if you were going to a costume party.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,160
 That is who Dracula is, he's standing there.

148
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,200
 And then you notice he's doing something quite odd.

149
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,480
 Other than being Dracula in Florida, he's stocking the shelves.

150
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,040
 He's putting, he's like looking down the basket and he's like, "Oh, this is where

151
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
 this goes."

152
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,440
 And he's putting medicine away and he's right by your brain medicine you need.

153
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
 You're like, "Great."

154
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,640
 So you kind of like scooch by him.

155
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,720
 You're trying not to be seen by him.

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,800
 So anyways, you're able to finally get your brain medication.

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,320
 You go to the checkout counter and you go, "Hey, what's up with that?"

158
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
 Keshear's like, "I don't know what you're talking about."

159
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,920
 And you're looking to see if he has a reflection in any of the security mirrors.

160
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
 And he does.

161
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
 So you're like, "Not a real vampire."

162
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,440
 You're like, "No, no, I was just picking up some brain medicine and Dracula's working

163
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,520
 here."

164
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,520
 And she goes, "Oh, yeah, him.

165
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
 He doesn't work here.

166
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
 He doesn't work here.

167
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,840
 He just really likes stocking shelves for us."

168
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,880
 Or stalking shelves, maybe.

169
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,520
 So what it is is that this has been going on for probably about a decade.

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,240
 I don't know if it's still going on.

171
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,720
 The latest story I heard about this comes from 2013.

172
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,880
 So he could be moved on.

173
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,440
 He could have found greener pastures.

174
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,480
 He could have went to Walmart instead.

175
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,960
 But from the earliest sighting I could find was 1996.

176
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,800
 So from 1996 to 2013 in Alta Monti Springs, Florida, there was a guy who did a lot of

177
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,320
 too-dressed and full Dracula cosplay who stalked shelves at Walgreens.

178
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,560
 Didn't work there.

179
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,440
 And then someone posted this on Reddit and other people were like, "Oh, yeah, I always

180
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
 wondered what was up with that guy."

181
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,920
 And this other guy ended up doing some research.

182
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,200
 He is very well known to the police.

183
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,960
 I guess at one point, like Walgreens, he comes in, he stalks the shelves.

184
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
 He doesn't get paid.

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
 He just really likes stalking shelves.

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,280
 When I was a little kid, I always wanted to work retail.

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,680
 Like I remember being in going to grocery stores or any store and going, "Oh, I'd love to just

188
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
 stock shelves.

189
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
 I think that'd be so awesome."

190
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
 I live in inventory and all that stuff.

191
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,080
 But anyways, so maybe this is my long lost brother.

192
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
 He likes stalking shelves.

193
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,480
 At one point, though, Walgreens have to call the cops on him to get him out because the

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,840
 customer was walking by him and he hissed at the customer.

195
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 Customer runs away.

196
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,640
 He's like, "Where's your garlic section?"

197
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
 And they're like, "Oh, it's over there."

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
 He's throwing garlic at the vampire.

199
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,000
 Anyways, after that, though, he was totally fine.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,960
 Other people have said, "Yeah, he comes in a subway every once in a while, orders a ham

201
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 and cheese sandwich."

202
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,840
 Apparently, he has a vampire crew down there and they all hang out.

203
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,040
 But I think he's the only one who actually dresses up like Dracula.

204
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,640
 It's one of those stories I actually found on my own.

205
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,680
 Now, Mason Norbeck, he was the guy who sent me all the vampire links and things like that

206
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,520
 for Vampire Week.

207
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,800
 What would become Vampire Week?

208
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,160
 He didn't know that was what I was going to do.

209
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,200
 But I was searching around for stuff and more vampire stuff and I found this story.

210
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,280
 And it's just one of those really kind of cool urban legends that would be quite shocking

211
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,560
 to run into.

212
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,240
 Just walking into Walgreens by stuff you see Dracula standing there.

213
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
 He goes by Dracula, apparently.

214
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,320
 And he wears the costume all the time.

215
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,240
 Now, you're thinking, "Okay, that is an interesting story."

216
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,280
 Hopefully, you think that.

217
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,840
 But you're like, "Okay, that's an interesting story of a local lunatic, a man who thinks

218
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,320
 he's Dracula and it's even funnier because he doesn't work at Walgreens, but he stockshelves."

219
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,880
 But does the story end there?

220
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,240
 Because, and I'm not making this up, Funko Pop, the maker of those little pieces of plastic

221
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,240
 with the giant heads, they do exclusive figures for certain stores.

222
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,920
 And Walgreens got the exclusive Dracula Funko Pop.

223
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,800
 Coincidence or conspiracy?

224
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,360
 Does Walgreens secretly have a Dracula connection?

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,400
 Is that the actual Dracula in Florida?

226
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,920
 Who knows?

227
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,200
 But if you have a cut finger and you need a Band-Aid, you might want to shop at Ride

228
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
 Aid instead.

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,360
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

230
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,160
 That is weird about the Funko Pop, right?

231
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,640
 I'm not just thinking that's weird.

232
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,320
 Okay, let's move on to our next story.

233
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,840
 Now, this next story was a request from two people.

234
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,960
 And it's been requested, it was requested by Jimmy Moore quite a while ago.

235
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,240
 And Chris Kay recommended it as well.

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,760
 He's the founder of the Golden Rabbit Brigade.

237
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,240
 So thank you, Chris.

238
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,400
 Thank you, Jimmy.

239
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,600
 Thank you for the headache I got researching this story.

240
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
 That's not exaggeration.

241
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,520
 I do appreciate the recommendations, of course, but this story, I don't know why it gave me

242
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
 a headache.

243
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:06,240
 And it could just be the bizarre assortment of people that all had to put their fingers

244
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
 in this.

245
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,480
 But let me go ahead and get into the story that they sent me.

246
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,600
 And again, thank you for the recommendation.

247
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,480
 So there is a daycare center in Salt Lake City.

248
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
 Now their address is totally available online.

249
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,120
 I'm not going to give it out.

250
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,200
 I actually was very picky with the links that I used because I didn't want to use links

251
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,280
 with the address in them.

252
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,080
 So I can't get accused of doxing them.

253
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,760
 There's a daycare center in Salt Lake City.

254
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 And it's green and it's gross and it's evil.

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,640
 According to Reddit.

256
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
 So let's go ahead.

257
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,520
 To be fair, this conspiracy theory is kind of floated around everywhere now.

258
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,600
 It's on 4chan.

259
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,280
 It's on Above Top Secret.

260
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,960
 It's on all these conspiracy theory websites.

261
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:57,440
 But it started off with a very simple little Reddit post on r/Salt Lake City.

262
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,720
 So a pretty appropriate, pretty appropriate for what they're talking about.

263
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,280
 There's a creepy thing in Salt Lake City and a guy writes a little thing up.

264
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,000
 Now this Reddit post appears back in 2014 and it's titled "What's the deal with this

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 place?"

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,640
 Lived across the street from it for five years, never seen a kid there.

267
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
 And it has a picture of a gross green looking building.

268
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,600
 And like that, the conspiracies start.

269
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,440
 And what's frustrating about this story is that not even the conspiracy theorists can

270
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
 get their story straight.

271
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,280
 Because it seems like every time something is knocked down, the conspiracy theory shifts

272
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
 to something else.

273
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,320
 Let's try...this is a tough one to make sense of.

274
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
 Let's try to make sense of this.

275
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,680
 I'll try to do it fairly, linearly.

276
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
 Linerally.

277
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,040
 I'll try to do this in a linear fashion.

278
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 How's that?

279
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
 So this place is called Fun Time Kids Care.

280
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
 It's a daycare in Salt Lake City.

281
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,120
 Gross looking green, jarish color.

282
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,960
 It's like a lime green building.

283
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,400
 And a lot of people think it's suspicious.

284
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,520
 People say that the windows are covered up with cardboard.

285
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,280
 You can't see in the house.

286
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
 Or the daycare.

287
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,680
 You can't see in the daycare.

288
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,520
 So this guy posts this and immediately people start saying, "Hey, yeah, dude, I live in

289
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
 the area too."

290
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,280
 And it is super creepy.

291
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,240
 I once walked by and there was cardboard on the windows.

292
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,680
 You can't look inside.

293
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,080
 And everyone's like, "Oh my god, that place is super, super spooky."

294
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,760
 In this thread, to help matters even more, people are kind of saying, "Oh, I live in

295
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 this area.

296
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
 Yeah, it's pretty weird.

297
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
 It's creepy."

298
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
 Stuff like that.

299
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,760
 And then death ship shows up and he goes, "Don't look into this place, dude.

300
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,440
 I advise you not to look into this place."

301
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,880
 And then people looked at his Reddit history and he says he works at Area 51 and he knows

302
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,160
 eight languages.

303
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,520
 If you're listening to a podcast, I figure you're pretty good at using the internet,

304
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
 right?

305
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,240
 One of the things that's really easy to forget about the internet is that it's mostly populated

306
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,720
 by nine-year-olds.

307
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,800
 Like, it really is.

308
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,600
 Now as adults, if I came across a post regarding anything, cooking, cleaning, childcare, Area

309
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,720
 51, and someone posted, "Yeah, I work at Area 51 and I know eight languages," that guy's

310
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
 lying.

311
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
 100%.

312
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,520
 I don't believe that guy at all.

313
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
 At all.

314
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,200
 But he becomes a major villain in this story.

315
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,000
 The people in the Reddit thread are like, "Oh my god, oh my god, he says he works for Area

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,760
 51 and he knows eight languages."

317
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,720
 Then he lists the eight languages and they're like, "How do you know those eight languages

318
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 shit?"

319
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
 I'm like, "Because he's lying.

320
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,960
 I know eight languages.

321
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:37,560
 Chinese, Japanese, German, Swahili, Spanish, Greek, Basque, Latin, Hebrew, I know even

322
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,720
 more than eight languages."

323
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,120
 It's so easy to lie about this stuff, but he becomes a major player in this story.

324
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,320
 He becomes this dark entity that's kind of floating around.

325
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,960
 Oh, conveniently, now the account is either deleted, banned, or doesn't exist.

326
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,400
 That's what happens when you click on his name.

327
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,280
 So that adds to the conspiracy as well.

328
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,680
 I've talked about this before.

329
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,040
 I could easily release a video on that.

330
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,480
 The reason why ants attack picnics is because they're using that as a psychological warfare.

331
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,600
 It's what's that stupid thing?

332
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,120
 They predict the programming.

333
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,120
 So eventually people get afraid to eat outdoors so everyone will be inside and then when the

334
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,920
 aliens show up, they know where everyone's at.

335
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,080
 I can make that video, delete my own video, and then start a conspiracy theory saying,

336
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
 "Look it, I made that video.

337
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,160
 It got deleted because the powers, I was right.

338
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,480
 I deleted my own video."

339
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,680
 That's so easy to do.

340
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,000
 And it's funny because here's the thing.

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,600
 If Death Ship's account got banned or deleted or something like that, because he said too

342
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,560
 much or, and really that goes back to this whole conspiracy theory, if this conspiracy

343
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,560
 theory is true and we're too close to the truth, all of this information would be wiped

344
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
 out.

345
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
 It's just the way it is.

346
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,960
 Jason, you can't do that.

347
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 Google, you know, with the algorithm and the internet history, you can wipe stuff out.

348
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
 You can eliminate stuff from the internet.

349
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,480
 Don't let anyone tell you you can't because it can be done.

350
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
 Did I ever tell you the Playboy story?

351
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
 I might have.

352
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,560
 Forgive me if I've already told the story.

353
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,600
 We, I had a friend who posed for Playboy.

354
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,880
 It was the digital Playboy.

355
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,160
 It wasn't the actual magazine.

356
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
 She got mad at her boyfriend.

357
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,560
 She posed for Playboy and they, she regretted it obviously.

358
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,160
 And the problem was too is that she put down a stage name, but they put down her real name.

359
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,000
 So if you searched her real name, the photos came up and she was really distraught about

360
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 it all.

361
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I had met her years afterwards.

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,920
 I think I met her when she was in her early twenties.

363
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,400
 That happened when she was 18.

364
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,080
 And I said, okay, here's what we're going to do.

365
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
 Two front war.

366
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 One, you're going to contact Playboy and you're going to say, hey, you guys used my wrong

367
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
 name.

368
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 I'm going to sue you if you don't assist me in taking these pictures down.

369
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,400
 And Playboy said, yeah, we will do that.

370
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,760
 But we, you know, they only have so much power.

371
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,680
 Once the pornography is out there, it's out there.

372
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,280
 I said, here's what I'm going to do.

373
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,520
 I'm going to create a bunch of websites with all of your, like all the metadata that use

374
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,000
 your real name and use your fake name and use Playboy nude pictures.

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,880
 And I basically created all of these pages to do.

376
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,680
 If anyone searched for her, they would find all of these other pages.

377
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
 That's it.

378
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
 Now are those photos completely deleted?

379
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,320
 For the most part, actually they are.

380
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
 It can be done.

381
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,480
 And if it can be done by some Yoko sitting with his hand me down laptop five years ago,

382
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,600
 an international gun smuggling company can do it as well.

383
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,360
 They could easily get rid of all this stuff.

384
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,080
 So and let's go ahead and get into the theory.

385
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,720
 So well, let's go back.

386
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 Sorry about that segue.

387
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,240
 But basically what it becomes is people start trading stories on Reddit.

388
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,560
 One person says there's a mailman who works in the area who said that one day he delivered

389
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,840
 mail to the place and it was just a bunch of kids watching television.

390
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,160
 But the television was showing a live feed into another room in the same building.

391
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
 Spooky.

392
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,480
 And then we get a story that a mailman goes in there to deliver the mail and it's always

393
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,960
 nap time.

394
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
 What?

395
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,200
 And then we get a story that someone claimed they broke into the facility and it was empty

396
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,800
 except there was a television showing a live broadcast in another room.

397
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,040
 So now the stories aren't even making sense among the conspiracy theories.

398
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,840
 Remember the first story started off, I never see any kids there.

399
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,560
 But I would always go back to the fact is what time are you home?

400
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,640
 Because if he works nine to five and then comes home and he's like that's weird.

401
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,240
 There's no kids there because there's no kids there at that time of day.

402
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,280
 And he could go well sometimes I call him sick and I watch Judge Judy all day long.

403
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,280
 But how often are you looking out your window for little kids in a daycare center?

404
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,640
 So it could be something, but remember that's how it started off.

405
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,960
 I don't see any kids here.

406
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
 It's creepy.

407
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,440
 Why would you have a daycare center with no kids?

408
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,720
 And then people go oh no no there's kids there but they're doing something spooky.

409
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,480
 And then even those stories get confused.

410
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,560
 What happens is people start digging into that like it catches fire, this conspiracy theory.

411
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,560
 That started off saying isn't that weird there's no kids here.

412
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,320
 And then when the guy said it showed up, death ship said don't investigate this.

413
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,440
 That's when people are like someone's trying to stop the truth.

414
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,400
 You can tell how much like just my tone of voice, just how ridiculous I think this whole

415
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
 thing is.

416
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,200
 It's really trying to give it a fair shake, but we haven't even got started.

417
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,960
 So death ship shows up and goes don't do this.

418
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,000
 And then everyone's like oh my god the powers that be are trying to stop us.

419
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,440
 We got to dig even deeper.

420
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,120
 It's a daycare center.

421
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,520
 They end up, one guy goes poking around, finds a bunch of quote unquote strange equipment

422
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,960
 underneath the tarp and he goes this tarp was tied down like with real knots.

423
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,880
 It looked like a boy scout tied these knots.

424
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,040
 It's suspicious isn't it?

425
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,320
 Look how good these knots are tied.

426
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,760
 Just because you can't tie a knot doesn't mean that anyone who can tie a knot is a member

427
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,400
 of the Illuminati.

428
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,400
 Just because the knots are well tied in Florida of all places that tends to have I don't know

429
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,960
 hurricanes, you think you'd want to have a good knot on your tarp.

430
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,160
 But anyways that's part of the conspiracy as well.

431
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,360
 I know people who are fans of this conspiracy theory who believe in it are saying Jason get

432
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,960
 to the freight cart.

433
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,320
 Get to the big giant freight container.

434
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,680
 Okay I'll get there.

435
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,600
 So let's talk about the shipping container because the shipping container is the other

436
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
 like big piece of the puzzle and probably the most suspicious part of the puzzle.

437
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,320
 So people started digging into these guys so much that they looked up all of the people

438
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,520
 started looking into like complaints they got to like the childcare board and it was

439
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,120
 like oh there was glass found in the playground which I'm not that's a horrible thing but

440
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,000
 it doesn't really play into this whole Illuminati death cult and it's funny because they really

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,200
 I think the first thing was this is part of Pizza Gate.

442
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,720
 These kids are being put in this room and then they're watching a live feed and who

443
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,440
 knows what's going on over there and the kids are being kidnapped.

444
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
 That was one angle they were going down.

445
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,360
 But then they found this shipping container.

446
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,720
 They found that Fun Time Kids Care is part of a group of companies.

447
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,800
 The other companies are Fundamental Financial Core which is in Chicago.

448
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,600
 They have Fun with Phonics which is in California.

449
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,880
 Fun Land Jumpers which is Bouncy Houses in Oregon and then Funcrest Bait Shop in Iowa.

450
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,200
 And they say why would so many businesses have the word fun in it?

451
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
 Like Fundamental and Funcrest.

452
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,160
 Okay a little weird, a little weird right?

453
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,640
 They say the reason why they have the word one person said the word and this is the thing

454
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
 you go that is weird.

455
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,760
 Like you have five businesses that all start off with the word fun.

456
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,200
 It's not unusual but it seems bizarre.

457
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,160
 Then one poster goes you know why they do that?

458
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,000
 It's so the Chinese can find them easier.

459
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Alphabetical.

460
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,240
 What?

461
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,480
 One of the reasons why the building is painted lime green is so Chinese delivery drivers

462
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,000
 can find the building.

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
 That's another theory.

464
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,520
 They have an origin story for the paint.

465
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,520
 So Chinese delivery.

466
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,040
 So you're when I kind of jumped the gun on that you're like why are the Chinese involved

467
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,360
 in this all of a sudden.

468
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,320
 So the shipping container.

469
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:06,120
 Fun time kids care got is on a bill of sale for a shipping container full of plastic junk

470
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
 that came from China.

471
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,880
 It was like 2,000 pounds of footballs and like trinkets.

472
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
 That's it.

473
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,120
 So a rational person would go okay this guy basically has his hands in a couple different

474
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
 businesses.

475
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
 They could be shell companies.

476
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,200
 You could be buying this garbage and having it's using the credit for this particular

477
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,800
 company to buy it but it's really going to this company.

478
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,280
 It could be going to the Funland Jumpers or the Bateshop or whatever.

479
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
 I want you to think about this for a second.

480
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,200
 A guy or a group owns five businesses.

481
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,320
 One of them is a gross color daycare center and one Reddit post got people to find out

482
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,800
 what he was having shipped from China.

483
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,960
 Let's continue.

484
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,800
 So people are saying maybe they're smuggling weapons in the daycare center.

485
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,520
 Maybe they're doing some creepy stuff with the kids.

486
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,480
 Maybe it's a FBI CIA drop spot secret lab whatever.

487
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,920
 Somebody goes you know what I'm going to look this up on Google Maps.

488
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,680
 I'm going to do that little Google car drive thing and they posted a photo.

489
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,140
 They're like isn't this suspicious.

490
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,560
 Look at this photo of this daycare center.

491
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,280
 Here's a photo of a child looking out a window.

492
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,240
 Yeah that would be suspicious if it was an abandoned warehouse but it's a daycare center

493
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
 that's proof that they have kids in there.

494
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,040
 It's so bizarre.

495
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,600
 But I will take the Google drive by as opposed to what starts happening now.

496
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,160
 People are calling up the daycare center asking them questions.

497
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,600
 They're like dude it's nap time.

498
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,440
 It's always nap time.

499
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
 Click.

500
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,200
 No they're calling up the daycare center.

501
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,720
 Then they start visiting the daycare center and there's photos of a guy who put his kids.

502
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,000
 Remember the windows are supposed to be totally blocked by cardboard remember.

503
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
 You're not supposed to be able to see inside.

504
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,840
 So this guy went to the daycare center put his camera to the window and began taking

505
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,360
 pictures of the people in the daycare center.

506
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,880
 From a Reddit post saying isn't this creepy.

507
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,160
 Somebody ordered a pizza to the daycare center and then they hid in the bushes and there's

508
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:13,840
 a photo from the bushes across the street from a daycare center of a pizza delivery man waiting

509
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,520
 for the door to open.

510
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,560
 The Reddit threads get nuked.

511
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,240
 Love Top Secret which is a conspiracy board.

512
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,880
 That thread gets nuked.

513
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,160
 You can find photos of the original thread.

514
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
 The original Reddit thread.

515
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,360
 And now it's mostly threads referring to the original thread and they're misquoting it.

516
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,320
 I had to go back and look through the original thread and find some stuff.

517
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,240
 That's why I think the postman story and the TV story got mixed up because it's already

518
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
 being distorted.

519
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,360
 Now again this came out years ago and people are still arguing about it.

520
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,560
 One of the conspiracy theories is that it involves child trafficking.

521
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,360
 You have the conspiracy theory of drug running, the weapon smuggling.

522
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,760
 You have the conspiracy theory that it's actually a rival daycare center in town who posted it

523
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,200
 originally to make them look bad.

524
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
 On Reddit there was this huge thing because people were starting accounts just to say

525
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,040
 "hey no this place is totally fine" and people are like "why you shill?

526
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,760
 You're starting an account today to tell me the place is fine."

527
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,720
 Admittedly that is weird because I'll see that with movies coming out and there will

528
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,240
 be an IMDB account that's brand new and they just review that movie and then they go away.

529
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
 So that is bizarre detail.

530
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,680
 I'm not saying the entire thing is completely on the up and up but I think the way they've

531
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,720
 gone about it is completely ridiculous because the other argument is "you can't prove it's

532
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,120
 a legitimate business."

533
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,800
 No I can't.

534
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,200
 I absolutely can't prove it's a legitimate business but that doesn't mean it's an illegitimate

535
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 business.

536
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,160
 That would work with...

537
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,520
 Prove to me that Microsoft isn't involved in organ smuggling.

538
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
 Well then I guess they are.

539
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,200
 Like that's the logic that's here.

540
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,280
 This battle still rages on.

541
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,160
 A lot of times these threads get new because so many of them had the address and the phone

542
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,920
 number of this place because they really thought they were fighting against an enemy.

543
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,640
 I said this a couple episodes ago and it proved to be a little controversial because I got

544
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,440
 some feedback on this.

545
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,440
 If it was you, if you were running this type of organization how would you do it?

546
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,480
 And people were like well it's not me, it's the Illuminati, it's the powers that be and

547
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,280
 they have these rituals and these blood things and predictive programming they have to do

548
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,600
 for their spells and blah blah blah blah.

549
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,120
 That's all fictional.

550
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
 That's...

551
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,000
 There is no proof of any of that.

552
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Absolutely none.

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,120
 You can go "oh no this author who defected from the Illuminati made up."

554
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,320
 Totally made up because if he defected from the Illuminati he'd be dead in a ditch.

555
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
 Totally made up.

556
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
 What would you...

557
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,680
 If you wanted to smuggle weapons through Salt Lake City and you wanted to use a daycare

558
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,440
 as a front which is a stupid idea but you would just have a nondescript building somewhere.

559
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,560
 But if you wanted to use a lime green daycare center in the middle of Salt Lake City to smuggle

560
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,960
 guns this is how you do it.

561
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,160
 You make it look super nice, you make it look not creepy and you make it so exclusive no

562
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,720
 one can get in.

563
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
 Just super nice.

564
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

565
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

566
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720

 You don't even have to advertise.

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

582
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

583
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

599
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

601
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

602
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

603
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

604
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

605
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

606
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

607
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

608
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 You don't even have to advertise.

609
00:27:51,720 --> 00:28:06,720
 I think with this story, this particular story, the conspiracy theory community, they're the bad guys.

610
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 They fell for whatever this was hook, line, and sinker.

611
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:18,720
 And this is why I think this place is a legitimate place of business, because there's no single conspiracy theory to hang your hat on.

612
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
 Some people say child trafficking.

613
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
 Some people say it's drug running.

614
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,720
 Some people say it's like a tax write-off or a way to bulk money from the government by having a daycare center.

615
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 Some people say there's no kids.

616
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 Some people say there's kids taking naps.

617
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
 None of it makes sense.

618
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 Same thing with 9/11.

619
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 Sometimes it's control demolition.

620
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 Sometimes it's the government knew about it.

621
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
 Sometimes it's space laser.

622
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,720
 Sometimes it's time travel, because it's not true.

623
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 It's all made up.

624
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
 And that's the same thing with this.

625
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
 There's no through line.

626
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:57,720
 The only through line in it is there is a child care center that is part of a conglomeration of other businesses with the name "fun" in them that got a container from China.

627
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,720
 That we know what is in the container.

628
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,720
 There's that movie, "The Craft," about the four goth girls who are teenagers witches.

629
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
 And at one point they're dry.

630
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
 They take a bus out to the meadow to do this ritual.

631
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,720
 And as they're getting off the bus, the bus driver goes, "Look out for weirdos."

632
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,720
 And the lead witch goes, "We are the weirdos, mister.

633
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 We're the weirdos for this story."

634
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
 We pushed it way too hard.

635
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
 I'm speaking as a conspiracy theory community.

636
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
 Pushed it way too hard.

637
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
 Tormented.

638
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,720
 Totally normal people.

639
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,720
 Whenever we received facts that were different than our theory, the theory changed and changed and changed and changed.

640
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,720
 And now it's just remnants.

641
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:48,720
 It's just like walking through a ruined temple of a really bad conspiracy theory that was crafted from a single sentence on Reddit.

642
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 Now it's just a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of this.

643
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:01,720
 And the sad thing is, is that people are still pouring their time into this and trying to justify creeping around a child care center.

644
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,720
 In any other story, you're reading the news.

645
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,720
 And it said, "Man found outside child care center in bushes with camera."

646
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,720
 You'd be like, "That's the weirdo."

647
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,720
 But we have gotten so distorted that that's the hero now.

648
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
 We are the weirdos, mister.
