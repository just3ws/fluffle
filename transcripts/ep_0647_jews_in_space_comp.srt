1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
 It's too hot for YouTube week. These are all the stories that I put off telling because I knew YouTube

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,740
 Wanted to allow them anyways first off

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,400
 There's a cheese out there. They would have allowed this story, but I have to do an introduction story and it's a good one

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,540
 There's a cheese out there. That's so

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,320
 disgusting

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
 It's illegal to eat and

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,600
 Then we meet a man who believes that the Jewish people came from outer space

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,080
 with one mission

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,960
 To protect us from cryptids today on Dead Rabbit Radio

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:47,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,880
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I had a great weekend

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,160
 I hope you guys had a great weekend too. Coming at you live from the new studio

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,440
 The haunted closet that is the name of the studio and it actually is a haunted closet and I have some even more improvements

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,960
 I have some sound balancing stuff

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
 So I hope this sounds even better than it did last time

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,680
 We're making improvements to this show because this show is going to be around for a long time

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,640
 And the reason why the show keeps growing is because of patreon supporters like Sam everyone give a round of applause to Sam

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,420
 He is walking into the Arab command playing a little piccolo

19
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,080
 And all these kids are following him and doing these dances and something like that. We're like hey Sam

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,480
 Why'd you bring all those kids to the not even now? Why do you have a bunch of kids following me? He's like I'm the fight Piper

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,280
 I love that episode. I actually don't know if you love that episode

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,720
 But he's the fight Piper and the kids are just like what are we doing here?

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
 And we're like, we'll have to feed you guys and we'll get you home to your parents soon

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,520
 But Sam until then the kids are now part of this crew and Sam

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,920
 You're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon or if you don't kidding

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,960
 Have children in mass. That's great. Don't do that second thing. But if you don't support the patreon

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,400
 Help get the word out about the show. Tell your friends. Tell your family talk about it online

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,120
 That's what we need you to do to help the show grow now Sam

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,680
 Go ahead and fire up. We've got all these kids. We're gonna need some of our big vehicles

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,240
 Let's hop in the dead rabbit dreadnought

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,200
 We'll put it in your little kid arms to work as they're rowing in the galley

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,960
 You're gonna be the captain of this dreadnought. We're leaving behind dead rabbit command. We are headed out to

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,400
 Sardinia

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,720
 Being in the big old drum the kids were like my arms hurt

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,880
 I'm like only a thousand more miles kids. We're almost there. So we all get off of this boat

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,440
 We give the kids some some fruit juice. They'll need those electrolytes for the journey back and

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,000
 Sam is leading us into a small village in Sardinia now Sardinia is actually an island in the Mediterranean

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,960
 It's off the coast of Italy. We're here to taste the delicacy

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,960
 It's called kazoo Martzu

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,880
 It's supper. This is great. It's supper time not only a supper time. It's some kids birthday

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,880
 They use this for birthday celebrations and wedding celebrations. It's a delicacy

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,400
 Everyone lives this and I have my little napkin tied around my neck and I have my fork in my knife

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,720
 And I'm like come on guys. Let's run. Let's go get some Kazoo Martzu

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,560
 And we sit down and they bring out a big block of cheese

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,600
 Mmm-hmm. You love the smell of cheese

46
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,240
 I say to you as the smell is not hit your nose yet and you look down at it and it's like

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,800
 Melted cheese in the middle of this wheel of cheese kind of like queso you guys love queso, right?

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,880
 I'm already taking three or four bites. Yum. Yum. Yum. Just dig in guys and you're looking at each other

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,880
 Sam is hijacking the boat to leave leave us all behind Kazoo Martzu. It's illegal

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,120
 This cheese cannot be purchased to come out be eaten probably can't be transported

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,640
 You just roll in a wheelchair on the road cops are chasing after you Kazoo Martzu literally means putrid cheese

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,240
 Now they've been making this cheese for thousands of years

53
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,500
 They're actually trying to get it made not illegal the people of Sardinia goes this is a traditional food

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,960
 Haggis is disgusting right a bunch of people eat disgusting stuff. Why can't we eat Kazoo Martzu?

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,940
 We've been doing this forever and the government's trying to get the the European Union. It's illegal in the United States as well

56
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,400
 You can't even eat it where it's made they can bust you there

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,680
 It's like it's like a black market thing although the local cops aren't gonna kick down your door because you're eating this

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,280
 Disgusting food they might kick down your door to eat some as well. This is what you do now

59
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,160
 We're all in farmer outfits Sam is teleported back to the group. He's like great

60
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,880
 We're milking a sheep get that nice warm body temperature sheet milk right out of the other

61
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,840
 Then we take it back and you cook it

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,000
 That sounds normal right there's nothing wrong with drinking sheep's milk and

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,080
 You know that's how normal cheese is made but you cook it you get the curds all together you make a normal block of

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,720
 Percogno

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,040
 Percogno

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,160
 One of the two who make one of those that sardinians are looking at us like great. He's gonna butcher everything

67
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 The word butcher

68
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,160
 You take you make a normal wheel of Pekino and you go ah

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,360
 Monza Monza and they're like not yet not yet

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,560
 You then take this wheel of Pekino and you cut the top off of it

71
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,960
 So you know like cheese gets kind of waxy on the outsides, but we want to expose the gooeyness of the insect

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,660
 You cut the top off of the wheel you take it off and then the flies show up

73
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,120
 You like that perfect you thought it was actually a fly flying around you

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,720
 They'll land on the cheese and then they start going that's my time to shine

75
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,040
 And they start laying eggs and

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,440
 The way that this cheese is made is the the people eat this

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,600
 People have eaten this for thousands of years the flies lay eggs on the cheese

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
 The eggs hatch circle of life

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
 maggots come out of them

80
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,760
 The maggots then begin eating the cheese they digest the cheese and their little maggot tummies

81
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,400
 And then poop out a little bit of that cheese

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,920
 They sound like that but you can hear them

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,840
 Then you let this process go on and on and on for two to three months

84
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,920
 So it's not just like one maggots pooping on your cheese

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,720
 This is actual quote from Wikipedia by the time it is ready for consumption

86
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
 A typical kazoo mart zu will contain

87
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,160
 thousands of these maggots

88
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,920
 So it's not just one which would be bad

89
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,920
 I'm not saying if you're ever eating spaghetti and there's one maggot in your spaghetti

90
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,600
 You're like, ah Jason said this is a problem, right?

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 Disgusting either way so these little maggots they're about they're about eight millimeters long and these little maggots

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,000
 It's like one-third of an inch. They're super tiny, but you can see them

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,880
 They're a little white translucent maggots and they just kind of eat through cheese and they make it soft

94
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,760
 They make the inside of the cheese super soft. So it is kind of like queso

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,160
 Sorry if you're eating queso right now. You're looking for maggots

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,440
 And you go Jason listen, we all know that cheese is just like old milk

97
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,880
 It's like curdled milk and stuff like that it you let it turn orange or I didn't look about cheese was made

98
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 I'm just

99
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,840
 Remembering some of the Sesame Street I saw back in 1979 the cheese is old milk

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,080
 Like this is just an added part of the digestive process and sure I don't appreciate

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 Maggots in my food and you say

102
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 But you know, it's it's really no grosser than just leaving milk out overnight or again

103
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,040
 Whatever Sesame Street said in 1979. Okay, let's get ready to eat some kazoo Marchu

104
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,120
 So we each get our own wheel because we're clients

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,600
 We each get our own wheel and I'm already scooping it in yum yum yum

106
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,000
 And you see me I'm put it this is how they traditionally take it they take scoops of it

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,840
 They spread it across a piece of flatbread and they eat it. So you see me I've been doing that and you notice

108
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,880
 When I put a little bit on the flatbread I then kind of cover the top of the flatbread

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,900
 I'm like holding almost like I'm eating food in jail and don't want anyone else to steal it

110
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,600
 Like that's weird. Why does he keep covering his food? Is he afraid like rains gonna fall on his food?

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,800
 You look up the sky perfectly clear and that's when you're looking down at your own kazoo Marchu and you realize

112
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,120
 The maggots are still in the cheese

113
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,040
 You are supposed to eat the maggots

114
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,240
 That's part of the delicacy the people do this when you eat it you spread it across the flatbread

115
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,120
 You'll cover up the top of the flatbread so they don't jump off of you and land in your face

116
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,400
 Or maybe you're like I don't want to lose my delicious maggots. You don't want them to jump

117
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,480
 You're licking your hand. You're licking your other hand. You're not getting away from me maggots

118
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,520
 Yes, this is the end of season 13 the last week is going out with a bang get ready for season 14 soon

119
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,240
 Licking the maggots right up your hand. It's actually considered the cheese is considered ruined

120
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,560
 It's unhealthy if the maggots are dead in the in the cheese, which that should go just go without saying if there's ever dead maggots in your food

121
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,440
 It's unhealthy

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
 but

123
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,680
 If let's say you don't like maggots, let's say you're one of those weirdos out there

124
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,200
 Let's say you're one of the 2% of the human population who doesn't like to eat maggots

125
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,160
 You can't wait for the maggots to die naturally because that's gross

126
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,680
 What you can do is you can take you spread some cheese and you put it on a cracker and then you put the cracker in a zip lock bag and

127
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,000
 Then oh did I mention these?

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,840
 These maggots can jump up to six inches. I didn't mention that. That's why you have to protect it

129
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,040
 I think I said they could jump I didn't think I said they could jump half a foot

130
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,960
 So you spread it on this cheese you put it in the zip lock bag you close it and as the maggots are suffocating

131
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,040
 You will see them jump off of the cheese and hit the sides of the zip lock bag

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,580
 You'll hear it go. I'm not making this up. This was in Wikipedia. They go

133
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:04,120
 There's so many maggots per piece of cheese that you're gonna hear it a couple times and once you're done hearing the pitter-patter noise and the zip lock bag

134
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,560
 You're good to go. All the maggots are dead now. You just have to reach into a bag full of maggots

135
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,680
 Now you just have to stick your hand into a zip lock bag full of dead maggots to retrieve your price

136
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,520
 This is so disgusting and people love it over there. I actually watched it was really cool

137
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,280
 I watched two

138
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,720
 YouTube clips on it in between me watching hours of unpractical jokers for the past week

139
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
 I was able to watch two YouTube clips on this one was a Gordon Ramsay show. I guess called the f-word

140
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,720
 And where he sends people out he sends people out to eat disgusting food

141
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,840
 He he did it at the ending he had and they're like, yeah, it tastes really good. It didn't necessarily

142
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,280
 Tasted good. They said that it had a smoky type of spicy taste

143
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,520
 And the one guy says the aftertaste stays with you for hours and Gordon Ramsay goes

144
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
 You gotta told me that before I took a bite

145
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,160
 But you can get it. It's it's illegal. It's like black market food

146
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,320
 But you can't get it and the reason why it's illegal is because it's unhealthy to eat maggots

147
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,240
 Can you believe it? Can you believe what science is trying to tell us these days?

148
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,720
 Ah, I hate when politics gets into science

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,400
 Supposedly the egg heads back at NASA want to try to convince me that eating living maggots is harmful

150
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,880
 It actually causes something called myapsis

151
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,400
 my isis and

152
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,200
 It's where you can get you can get it anywhere in your body. They say normally it's accidental

153
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,400
 Sardinia normally it's accidental because of poor living conditions. You'll get maggots in your eyeball

154
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,180
 You'll look maggots in your ear. You'll get me eat maggots is the most likely one

155
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,960
 You're eating unsafe food and it could take a while like it's not like I'm it's not like you eat a magnet later

156
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,700
 The night you're like a Martha Martha. I don't feel so good. What's what's wrong? Well?

157
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:02,160
 Disgusting food we got from Italy and oh it could take six months because the maggot has to like go in there

158
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,080
 It hatches in you it starts laying more eggs

159
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,800
 It'll get in your intestines these bugs will get in you and I know it sounds like body horror

160
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 It sounds disgusting, but it's true. They actually have different types of I should have done it

161
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,840
 She's an adventure. I mean I should have done an interactive adventure on this one

162
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,760
 They had these different forms of my isis you can get and most of them were just kind of boring or inconvenient

163
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,640
 I mean all of them led to your death

164
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,320
 They weren't treated, but I thought the creepiest one if you picked any number you get oral

165
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,160
 My isis and what that is is that's when you get a maggot in your body that hatches and then begins to spread and lay eggs

166
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:49,040
 And a little flying your butt. This is a hundred percent true oral my asses or oral oral not oral like you know hearing oral

167
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,560
 I'm so glad the season's

168
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:59,640
 Oral my asses I need a break you get these in you you can actually you'll be sitting there in your chair

169
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,680
 Martha's reading the newspaper and you'll be sitting there

170
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,160
 And you're like six months six months after you ate this disgusting food you'll feel crawling in your skin

171
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,560
 These wounds they will not heal by the way

172
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,440
 Wounds will not heal without medication or a kick-ass Lincoln Park song you feel crawling

173
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,800
 Inside your body because they're actually crawling in there. You'll be sitting there watching the prices right one night

174
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,320
 Martha did you hear that noise?

175
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,280
 Wow, what are you talking about this guy's hitting the buzzer and prices right no not that noise

176
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,360
 You'll hear them buzzing in your body that should

177
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,600
 In your body

178
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,920
 And you'll have a smelly discharge

179
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,320
 But I'm telling you if I'm feeling stuff crawling in my skin these wounds they will not heal

180
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,080
 Buzzing in my body this time that it's real. I don't care about the smelly discharge

181
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,520
 I would be like throwing that at people so if you've ever eaten

182
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,720
 Disgusting cheeses you've ever been to Sardinia or if you just happen to be having a conversation with someone in the street

183
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,760
 And you accidentally swallow a fly go to the hospital

184
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,720
 What if the doctor please and get it checked out you might be totally fine? It's not it doesn't happen every single time

185
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,280
 But if you do eat this cheese, there is a small chance. There is a maggot in your intestines

186
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,600
 waiting

187
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,520
 For its big break to be part of a Lincoln Park song Sam

188
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,600
 Let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter. We're leaving behind Sardinia the children can find their own way home

189
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,680
 We give them the keys for the dead rabbit run not let them take care of themselves

190
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,920
 They end up in a Lord of the fly situation. I will check in on them later, but take us out of Sardinia

191
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
 We are headed to New Mexico

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:51,360
 Last week we did a promo read for happily actually watch that movie. It's decent. It's decent. It's a good rental

193
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,640

194
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,240
 I also had the opportunity to get a sneak peek of another movie the other day

213
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:27,720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

214
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 I

215
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,760
 Got it cut out now. Ah this haunted closet is so hot by the way Sam turn around this carbon helicopter

216
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,920
 Just hang a left or right whichever direction we're headed in we're headed to El Paso, Texas

217
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:07,240
 Let's get started because I'm gonna warn you right now. It's not the most coherent conspiracy theory

218
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,800
 Again another shocker a conspiracy theory. That's not coherent. We are in El Paso, Texas, and we're walking around downtown

219
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,000
 We're eating popsicles because it's so hot

220
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
 And then out of the corner

221
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,080
 Dracula jumps out. Oh, you thought it was daytime, didn't you?

222
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,920
 No, it was nighttime and then we're scared and samples out of steak and I was like bro

223
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:36,320
 Not yet, and then we hear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and we turn around and

224
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,000
 There is a giant slime

225
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,040
 Moving through the city and then

226
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,120
 Now that that that that that that that that that that that it's not techno music craft work hasn't entered the scene

227
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,440
 We see a giant man-eating plant with hands that have like little

228
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,520
 Plant things on them to go and snap snap snap snap snap

229
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,280
 And I'm like, oh my god

230
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,880
 This might be the end of Dead Rabbit radio

231
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,160
 We're surrounded by some of the worst cryptids the worst cryptids Dracula slime and a giant plant and then all of a sudden like a

232
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,560
 Power Rangers beam from the sky

233
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,560
 And we see three dudes just standing there. They all look at each other and

234
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,040
 They go, huh? They take power ranger poses and

235
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,680
 They go, don't worry guys. We got this

236
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,760
 We're Jewish and then they start karate chop and it's like a freeze frame guys back to karate chop a

237
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,000
 Slime Dracula's running in fear the plant is getting ripped in half

238
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,400
 Did you know according to the Reddit account anonymous tips X or his username now is deleted?

239
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,000
 But he used to be known as anonymous tips X. This is where we are

240
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,840
 The very beginning is where it already starts to lose cohesion

241
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,560
 either one Jewish people came from outer space all of them or

242
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,880
 Not that or not that they simply live in space from time to time

243
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,520
 Which would be pretty dope. I'm glad that I'm from earth, but if I could vacation in space, I'd be down to do that

244
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,960
 The and the Jewish people they have two missions in life

245
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,440
 one

246
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,320
 To protect us from gang stalking. Did you know this?

247
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,800
 Did you know that every single gang stalker and the entire Western hemisphere at least

248
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,880
 So if you're down in Chile, you're being stalked. There's all pockers. We're gonna look at you weird

249
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
 Oh

250
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,840
 Like what or if you're in Alaska and you're fishing your ice fishing and fish you're gonna look at you weird

251
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,640
 That fish that alpaca they were both from El Paso, Texas

252
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,240
 Every single gang stalker in the Western hemisphere is from El Paso, Texas if you think you are being gang stalked

253
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,880
 Look around for some Southwestern art

254
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,320
 You see Coco Pelle on a car driving by gang stalker. You see a man in a cowboy hat

255
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
 You're probably watching

256
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 Dynasty or a rodeo or are herding cows right now, but those people are also gang stalkers. So that's good to know, right?

257
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,840
 It's good to know now anonymous tips X has actually crafted this map

258
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
 And it sucks because the images when he deleted the count the images are gone

259
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,640
 I'm gonna try to find a way to find them. I thought I had him saved on my computer

260
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,800
 I have I might have and if so I'll post it and I'll put it in the show notes

261
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,640
 I might actually take me a couple days or maybe someone can use the links. I tried going through internet archive

262
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,320
 We'll see what we can do, but let me try to give you a visual here. You're really not missing much

263
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,040
 It's basically just really bad Photoshop, but he has a map of America

264
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,440
 So we know that the gang stalkers come from El Paso, Texas and the Jewish people are here to protect us from gang stalk

265
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,360
 But I also got to let you know a little bit more about the United States

266
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:52,480
 Let's take a geography lesson according to anonymous tips X Oregon is the home of the second horsemen of the apocalypse

267
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,120
 Which looks like cloud from Final Fantasy? That's just

268
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,080
 That is the most sane one on here. That's what Oregon Oregon is the home of cloud from Final Fantasy

269
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,000
 According to this source according to our source

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,960
 California is currently overrun with white supremacists

271
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,880
 who

272
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,320
 Also is the bad guy from Resident Evil Nemesis

273
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 They're actually you've ever been walking through California. You've seen a white supremacist

274
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,680
 maybe

275
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 These are the identifying factors

276
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,480
 Is he 8 feet tall? Is he 8 feet tall?

277
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:39,600
 Does he have a giant glowing red ball in his chest to show his weak spot is one of his arms an organic blade if

278
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,320
 You if you've just seen a bunch of people walking around shouting white power. They're probably not white supremacist

279
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,480
 However, if they are a video game character in the shape of a bio weapon leave

280
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:57,120
 Go go away right now and they're all over California governor Gavin Newsom white supremacist

281
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,360
 Resident Evil Nemesis boss. You didn't know them Montana is the capital of hell

282
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,400
 Texas which is where we're at right now

283
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,720
 Texas is guarded so not everyone in Texas is this person Texas is guarded

284
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,680
 The whole state is guarded by leather face that makes the most sense out of all of this stuff

285
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,640
 Illinois is protected by a German

286
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,000
 Named I didn't know this guy was German. I mean I've never really watched these movies, but I don't think they ever went into his ethnicity

287
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,800
 I don't think they're ever like oh that character

288
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,280
 Illinois is protected by the

289
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,760
 Illinois is protected by the famous German Michael Myers from the Halloween series

290
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,400
 Like did I really watch those movies, but they're like ah, yes

291
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,760
 He's he has a sister and he broke out of insane

292
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:53,660
 And his mother's from Germany. Did they ever is that ever part of the origin story for Michael Myers?

293
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,560
 There's another famous germ this guy actually might be German based on his name

294
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:06,560
 But again, I don't think it was implicit in his origin story Ohio is protected by another German named the famous

295
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,440
 Freddie Kruger or Frederick Frederick Kruger was probably his original German name

296
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,560
 Frederick Kruger best origin story of any horror villain ever. I love his origin story

297
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,800
 His mother was assaulted by a thousand maniacs in an asylum and he was born from that act

298
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,760
 That's a perfect horror story origin

299
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,600
 But again, I don't think and they're like half of those inmates were German like I don't think that's part of his origin story

300
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,800
 New jersey not

301
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 German new jersey is actually protected by a famous dutch man

302
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,160
 A famous dutch character first off who wants to be protected

303
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,040
 Who wants to be protected by freddy kruger for new jersey? It's the famous dutch

304
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,760
 Guy jason vorhees

305
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,280
 Very very famous. I knew he was dutch actually. I remember

306
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,920
 I was taking a class in dutch cinema history and they're like the famous dutch character ever was not dutch from predator

307
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,560
 It was dutch from it was the dutch man from brand 13. Everyone's all what?

308
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,120
 Neither of those characters are actually dutch

309
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,480
 Florida is protected by a which if I had to choose to live in any of these states

310
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,560
 Any of these states, right? None of those guys are protectors leather face not a protector

311
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,360
 Michael Myers freddy frederick kruger jason vorhees not a protector if you live in florida

312
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,560
 You're protected by blade dude. Wesley snipes blade. What first off he would wreck

313
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,120
 He would easily wreck all of those guys

314
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,000
 He might have a problem with freddy kruger because he's the most magical but dude blade versus leather face

315
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,560
 It's not even a contest leather face is just a fat dude with a chainsaw. I want to move to florida, dude

316
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,600
 I want to move to florida because blades watching over me

317
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,840
 Now this is a map of the united states, but canada is included. I know I have a lot of canada listeners

318
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
 We're not gonna leave you guys out canada

319
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,760
 Canada you're protected by a tiny guy with a knife

320
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,880
 I didn't recognize the photo

321
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,080
 I didn't recognize what it was from. They just show the entire country of canada

322
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,560
 There's a little like a gnome with a knife like a little goblin guy with a knife. So eat it canada

323
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:34,880
 We got blade in america. We have blade. It's official ladies and gentlemen. This is just the mind of anonymous tips x

324
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,360
 We're really just getting started here because the jewish people are not here to protect us from jason vorhees because luckily

325
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,680
 He's the protector if you happen to live in the state of illinois. Don't worry

326
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,400
 sleep easy

327
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,240
 A mass murderer with a machete is watching over you as you sleep

328
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,680
 But see the jewish people are here to protect us from gang stalkers if you ever have problem with gang stalkers

329
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,920
 Find someone who's jewish and say hey, dude

330
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,200
 I'm pretty sure that alpaca's following me and they'll turn and they'll look and they'll be like

331
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
 I got you covered

332
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,520
 And then you see me you're choking the alpaca out. Uh, let him go quit gang stalking this man. I'll let him go

333
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,120
 It says

334
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
 They're also here to protect us from cryptids and before I go any further I should

335
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,120
 Give you this little lifestyle tip before we continue here because I see this in my notes

336
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,400
 According to anonymous tips x you should eat three eggs a day. This is a public service announcement in the middle of his ramblings

337
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,760
 This is literally where he dropped it as well. You should eat three eggs a day

338
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,480
 but

339
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,560
 Only three eggs a day. You can't eat any more than three eggs a day

340
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,280
 his source for this information

341
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,680
 Famous video game you guys may remember this video game moment

342
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,040
 Avid video game players are going to be like, oh dude. I remember where I was at when I saw that cutscene

343
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,840
 In metal gear solid 4

344
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,680
 There's a scene

345
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
 Where they're frying eggs

346
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,760
 There's three eggs in the frying pan

347
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,720
 Moving on

348
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,680
 Moving on from metal gear solid 4 so we we have we're done with the public service announcement

349
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,400
 Let's continue on with the story the jewish people are here to protect us not only from gang stalkers

350
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,680
 but they're also here to protect us from cryptids and

351
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,360
 Little did you know you thought that you would just be able to go? Hey, you know, I'm jewish

352
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,840
 I can I go cry to chop Dracula a bitch upside head. No you idiot. It depends on where you are jewish

353
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,640
 Where you are jewish?

354
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,440
 Very complicated mythology we have here if you are jewish in algeria

355
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,280
 It is super specific jewish people in algeria

356
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,920
 They were sent here

357
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,160
 to fight giant scorpions

358
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
 uh jews in kyrgyzstan

359
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,060
 They're here to fight the winged tiger

360
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,320
 Which

361
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,200
 That's pretty dope right like both of those you're fighting giant scorpions

362
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,000
 You feel like jason and the argonauts the winged tiger is actually a cryptid that's supposed to exist in the takla moklin desert

363
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,800
 That's kind of a more dour existence

364
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,320
 You have your bar mitzvah. You're like, oh, this is dope, dude

365
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
 And then your parents realized sorry son

366
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,440
 You gotta go live in the desert for a while. You can't come back until you kill the winged tiger. Oh mom

367
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,400
 Jews in venezuela. They're the ones one in our beginning intro story. I didn't make those. I didn't make those cryptids

368
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,840
 I don't know where

369
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
 The jews in venezuela

370
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,760
 They are the ones that fight giant man-eating plants

371
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:39,840
 In the jungles of venezuela a giant man-eating plant it's it's so full it can barely move it already ate a bunch of dudes

372
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 But out of the jungle

373
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,560
 There's a jewish guy hiding me on a tree and he walks up and he just

374
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:52,160
 Crotty chops this plant on the back of the neck doesn't have neck crotty chops him right on the stem

375
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,400
 I don't know if the implication is that if you're not jewish

376
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,320
 You can't fight these things because I think I could take on a man-eating plant

377
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,560
 I left the word giant out. I left the word giant out when I said that

378
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,880
 But I think I could do it fighting winged tigers fighting man-eating plants. This is dope jews in norway. What do they get to fight?

379
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,240
 They actually this is so bizarre

380
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,480
 This is even weirder than that stuff if you're jewish in norway you have to travel to laos

381
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,600
 Because apparently there's no cryptid in norway for the jewish people to fight you have to travel to laos and there

382
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,320
 You're like all right, dude. I'm not gonna fight like some float and demon head and we're gonna flight some like

383
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
 suck monster from the swamp

384
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,560
 jews in norway hunt pedophiles in laos

385
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,680
 Which is noble work. Don't get me wrong

386
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,000
 But if you knew

387
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,320
 That all your other jewish buddies were crotty chopping giant scarfians

388
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,880
 And you were just like arresting some 43 year old dude and be like i'm sorry man. I'm sorry. Don't tell my family

389
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,560
 You'd be a little disappointed again. You're doing good work. You're doing good work for the community for the world at large

390
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,640
 But your buddy your buddy just beat up a winged tiger

391
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,360
 jews in hawaii

392
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
 They get to fight churufe

393
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
 Which is a volcano monster

394
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,520
 that's

395
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,720
 both awesome and that's all that's that

396
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,400
 At that point you're like why i've been born in norway

397
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:30,400
 I can see myself fighting. I can see myself fighting a man eating plant. Maybe a giant man eating plant. I can see myself at least

398
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,000
 Maybe with the right equipment being able to take on a giant scorpion or a winged tiger

399
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,960
 How do you fight a volcano monster?

400
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,600
 Like

401
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,320
 If he has no organs you can't stab it

402
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,320
 You can't really push it anywhere the whole fight is you just like slowly

403
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
 Ambling away as you're getting closer and closer to the sea

404
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,080
 I guess the implication is if you're jewish in hawaii

405
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,280
 You have the ability to find a volcano monster. You can't be burned by heat. Maybe i don't know

406
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,000
 I'm not jewish. I'm not jewish on hawaii. If you're jewish in hawaii, let me know

407
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,640
 Jewish people in singapore was also one of the people who saved us in the beginning of the episode

408
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,200
 They fight giant slimes again. That's a very abstract

409
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
 Creature to fight but they can do it

410
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,320
 Jewish people in singapore are able to fight giant slimes. We're back in canada

411
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,240
 You have the tiny man with the knife protecting you jews in ontario canada to be specific

412
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 They fight giant turtles

413
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,200
 So after what the last two groups fought giant slimes, which you know, they're slow moving but again

414
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,680
 No noticeable weakness volcano monsters. No noticeable weakness. I was like, oh, that's dope

415
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,080
 I can kill the giant turtle

416
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,720
 I mean sure it could just like bring its arms and legs and head into the shell and I just kind of waited out

417
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,800
 Or i'm just poking it with a little knife

418
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,800
 I'm paring a little knife from a little goblin guy. I could fight a giant turtle the jews in ontario canada. They have it pretty good

419
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,560
 I found out later on because they're I had to do additional research for this

420
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:09,680
 I found another image he posted when he says giant turtles. He's actually referencing the teenage mutant ninja turtles from the michael bay movie

421
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:16,400
 I'm sorry much. I'd rather fight a giant slime and a volcano monster at the same time than rafael

422
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:24,560
 Screw that so anyways canada is just not a good place to live according to this guy jews and chekelsavakia

423
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
 I'm gonna give you guys a second

424
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,720
 Can you guys guess what the jews and chekelsavakia fight?

425
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,080
 I don't know why i'm giving you

426
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,760
 I don't know why i'm giving you a second. I can give you an hour. You'll never figure it out the jews and chekelsavakia have one enemy

427
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,280
 The face on mars

428
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,840
 So, okay, let's bring this do I even have to break this down

429
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,960
 Do I even have to say it can't move it can't die

430
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,720
 It's just a structure and you have to go there now apparently again

431
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,480
 I don't know if the jewish people are hanging out in space every once in a while. They're from space

432
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,400
 Super unclear not like everything else is super elusive, but how do you kill the face on mars? They just stand there. They just erode it. They're just going

433
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,400
 Blowing on it they're like hey it's your turn you gotta come up and blow on the face

434
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,360
 For a hundred years eventually it'll be eroded away

435
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,000
 Jews these ones make sense jews and romania they fight dracula

436
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,520
 Jews in egypt they fight the mummy just the one not all of the mummies just the famous mummy those make sense

437
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,120
 Those make sense

438
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,440
 Frankenstein is also a target on this list. Uh jews have to fight frankenstein

439
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,880
 But for whatever reason i can't figure this out jews and ethiopia fight frankenstein

440
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,160
 I don't even think frankenstein knows why he's in ethiopia. Huh?

441
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,960
 What so so

442
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,240
 Used to be in european castle

443
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,760
 Now where am i just watching all these people walk around he's in the middle of a small town

444
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,320
 He's trying to figure out exactly. I got struck by lightning now here

445
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,840
 And then there's a jewish guy walking up behind him. What do you use to kill?

446
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,760
 He's the frankenstein is the easiest guy to kill. He's just stitched together body parts just give him a good push

447
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,840
 I guess fire is what makes him scared

448
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,760
 But i mean like a bullet to the brain can kill him and jewish people in india

449
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,240
 fight igor

450
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,440
 India has a population of about a billion over a billion people. I don't know how many people there are jewish

451
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,720
 But it's not none. It's not one. It's probably just probably like a couple thousand ten thousand jewish people in india

452
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,160
 Maybe more because the population is so large. They all beat up igor every single one of them shows up

453
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,200
 Every single day igor the assistant

454
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,320
 The hunched back assistant to dr. Frankenstein

455
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:49,280
 At least frankenstein can like try to hide in the jungle seven foot tall corpse trying to hide in the jungle

456
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,520
 igor is just a dude

457
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,200
 Getting the crap kicked out of him every single day in india

458
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,720
 By at least again, I don't have accurate numbers, but at least 10 000 people

459
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,200
 at the very end of this photo presentation that he presented on reddit

460
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,880
 It's just a picture of a fart green fart

461
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,360
 And I think that's the best way to sum up this whole story

462
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,240
 So that is the saga of anonymous tips x and that's really the start of

463
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,320
 our

464
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,040
 Band from youtube week this story. I've had it for a couple months. I really wanted to cover it. I thought it was so funny

465
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,400
 Just this bizarre rambling of this guy

466
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,720
 It's from the gangstalking subreddit the gangstalking subreddit has so much potential

467
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,120
 It's not as funny as I thought it was gonna be

468
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,480
 There was one guy he was talking about his reddit post was gangstalked by x

469
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
 Kids flying monkeys

470
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,880
 Not x kids not like they were abducted by professor xavier. He's gangstalked by his x by his kids

471
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,280
 And by flying monkeys. I was like dope dude flying monkeys. Like does this actually think fly does this guy?

472
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,600
 That's crippling mental illness actually see flying monkeys. Haha. That'll be hilarious

473
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,240
 No, there was no flying monkeys in it

474
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,440
 It would have been sucked to be gangstalked by your kids first off

475
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,480
 You would find out that your kids were from alpesto texas

476
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,880
 They're like, that's weird and then secondly, how would you get away from them? They're just always there. Are we there yet?

477
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,160
 Are you there yet? Are you there yet? They're calling you as you're driving to work? Ah

478
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,720
 But it's so funny because I wanted to cover this but when I do put stuff out on youtube

479
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,320
 It just attracts great people. I've gotten a lot of great listeners a lot of great friendships

480
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,280
 But all the weirdos youtube attracts all the weirdos as well think about it this way when you listen to the podcast

481
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,880
 It's like a nightclub. You kind of have to know where it's at. Someone shows you

482
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,320
 Tells you about it. There you go to the nightclub. But when you put it on youtube is like a city park

483
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,880
 Anyone can show up any search term could have someone just stumble across it

484
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,720
 This is one of those stories that's real fun to look at and kind of look at this guy's madness

485
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,840
 I knew if I put it on youtube

486
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,720
 I was just going to get inundated with a bunch of weirdos and a bunch of

487
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,520
 Normie tear conspiracy theories about some screenshot. They saw

488
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,880
 Regarding Jewish people or I saw watch this six hour documentary and it'll answer all

489
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,160
 I just want to talk about fun conspiracy. I first off I've researched all that stuff

490
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,040
 I may sound like I'm poo pooing it, but I've researched all those screenshots. I've watched those documentaries

491
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,800
 I've done that stuff. I've been doing conspiracy theory stuff for 20 years

492
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,480
 Can't we just have fun with these conspiracy theories? So I wanted to say I'm glad I saved this one

493
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,360
 I always figured the youtube channel was going to go down at some point and it is back up but I'm debating on

494
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,760
 What we're going to do in the future

495
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,640
 But this is a this is the type of story that I know that I could share with an audience

496
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,080
 And we could have a good laugh at it. So hope you guys enjoyed this story

497
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,840
 This is one that I've been sitting on for a long time and really hope I can get the graphics up at some point and share them with you

498
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,040
 But the next time someone does say, you know

499
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,440
 Jewish people blah blah blah blah blah you should turn to them and say, you know what?

500
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
 I'm thankful for my Jewish brothers and sisters

501
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
 If it wasn't for them Igor would rule India

502
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,920
 And just walk away just walk away have no response to anything else and

503
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
 I think we all need to give a little shout out to

504
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,360
 To Frederick Kruger. He is truly doing the Lord's work all of those monsters

505
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:20,720
 All of those monsters Frederick Kruger and Michael Myers. I always thought they were evil people

506
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,320
 See doesn't this story show that you may think someone is evil, but they're not

507
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,200
 Just because they carry a machete or a chainsaw

508
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:36,320
 Or have a huge body counts and have murdered people across multiple movies. They're not evil. They're the real heroes

509
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,640
 I think that's the moral of this story one

510
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,120
 Don't post everything on youtube two. Don't judge a book by its cover and three if you are ever

511
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,800
 ever

512
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,240
 Gangstalked

513
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,960
 Be prepared to take a trip to El Paso, Texas because if you want this terror to end

514
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,280
 You have to go

515
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
 To where it all began

516
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,200
