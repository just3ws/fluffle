1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 You go for a walk and a head starts rolling after you, huh?

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,400
 You go to the bathroom after that experience, you have to go to the bathroom immediately.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,360
 And as you're walking down the long dark hallway to get to the bathroom, you see something already standing there

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,080
 waiting for you to enter.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,080
 And after both of those horrible experiences, you decide to try to get some sleep.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,520
 But when you hear a

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,120
 At your door, you're afraid it might be the black-eyed children.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,120
 But guess what?

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,900
 They may be the good guys today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:51,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,120
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,280
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we got to get started right away. First off,

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,240
 we're coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now. They're wrestling a bear.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,200
 The bear is winning. We're standing in horror. We don't want to interfere.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,640
 This is the intro. Eventually the Patreon overpowers the bear. It's painted demons.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,320
 Everyone give a round of applause to painted demons. Painted demons is actually a clothing

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,440
 shop. They have some pretty cool designs. I'll put their website in the show notes.

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,320
 They do jujitsu stuff as well. They don't do that on you.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,840
 They don't show up at your house and get you to choke old if you order something. They do jujitsu

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,200
 outfits, and then they also just have a lot of t-shirts and things like that. Bandanas.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,240
 I'll put it in the show notes. Painted demons.

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,160
 You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,760
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you would lose a fight to a bear, which is all of us,

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,200
 that's fine, too. Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot. Painted demons.

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,460
 I'm gonna go ahead and tashi the keys to the Dead Rabbit Doom Buggy. Drive us out of Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,960
 We are headed to

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
 Brazil.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,440
 By the time we get there, the sun is set.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,480
 Super spooky time in Brazil.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,480
 An owl set. I don't know if they have owls in Brazil. We brought one with us. We let it free.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
 We bring two of them so they can breed down there.

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,800
 We're walking through the streets of a city in Brazil, and food vendors are closing up their carts and wheeling them back home.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,200
 We're walking.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,920
 Owl on the rooftop. And it's just a nice little walk. I mean, in fact, we've destroyed an environment with our invasive owl species.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 Moons up.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,960
 People are slowly going back to their homes.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,920
 Streets are getting progressively more empty.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,920
 And then all of a sudden

39
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,840
 the street light in front of us is starting to flicker.

40
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,720
 We notice there's someone walking down the road in front of us.

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,440
 That's fine. It's not our street. We don't own it.

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,680
 But it's a little weird because everyone else has gone home except for this one figure walking in front of us.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,440
 And it seems like the street light that's flickering

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,920
 seems to be flickering in relation to this gentleman.

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,280
 He's just walking in front of us. And then he stops his back to us just standing there.

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
 All of a sudden his limbs fall off.

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,120
 We see arms and you know what limbs are. You can picture that. I don't have to describe it.

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,000
 And then his clavicle fell to the ground.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,120
 His entire body falls apart and his head lands on top of a pile of his own body parts and then slowly

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,120
 starts to turn towards you.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,440
 Wide eyes.

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,680
 Huge smile just staring at you.

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,480
 Now it's Michael Jackson.

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 It's turning Michael Jackson.

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,480
 And it's more thinking, okay, that's kind of creepy, right? A head.

56
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,480
 That's beyond impossible. It's a little more than creepy. I'm not just like lame.

57
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,480
 But what's it gonna do, right? It's just a head on a pile of body parts.

58
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
 Like it's not, it can't chase us.

59
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 It would have to grow arms and legs again to start running after us.

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
 The head does a little wink.

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 That's not in my notes, but just for the visual.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 Ding!

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 And then begins to roll after us.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
 Run, run, run!

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,480
 I yell as I'm already 30 feet away from you guys.

66
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,480
 This is Quebeca Satanica.

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 Quebeca Satanica.

68
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 Or the Satanic head.

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 Hehehehe.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
 It's rolling after us.

71
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,480
 You remember that movie Attack on the Killer Tomatoes?

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,480
 Tomatoes would roll down the streets. That's what the Kabonka Satanica would do.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,480
 It would bounce and roll and laugh and it would try to breathe on you.

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,480
 The tomatoes didn't try to breathe on you.

75
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,480
 But these, the tomatoes just ran you over, but this head will just try to get a good, whew, breath on you.

76
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 And the breath is super stinky. Now, that's, I mean, that's not the reason why we're running for our lives.

77
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 They're like, "Pee you!" And then we just get a good exercise out of it.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,480
 If it touches you, if it's able to get close enough to you, you will get sick and you will die.

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,480
 This is a death sentence. So we're just running through the streets of Brazil now.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
 The head is bouncing after us.

81
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 The thing is, there's very, very limited protection against the Satanic head.

82
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,480
 You can take these things called Palm Sunday Crosses.

83
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,480
 During the cel- It's a Christian celebration of Palm Sunday when Jesus showed up to Jerusalem.

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 You can make, you have palm leaves to do that.

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 And then afterwards, someone goes, "What are we supposed to do with all these palm leaves?"

86
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,480
 So someone came up with the idea of turning them into crosses.

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 You can set those outside your door.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,480
 And so as the Satanic head is rolling through the neighborhood, it may not go to your house.

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,480
 But like in our situation where we're running down the street, there's no defense against this.

90
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
 And not like you can just have a bunch of Palm Sunday crosses.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
 You're throwing them like Ninja Stars. Completely ineffective.

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 There's actually no defense in the wild.

93
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 The only thing you can hope for is to get back to your house and you have a little Palm Sunday Cross sitting outside your door.

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,480
 And it's effective because sometimes they'll just roll into your house anyways.

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 Incredibly powerful figure. It's a trickster. You think it's a human, so it has that shape-shifting quality.

96
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,480
 It can roll after you, so hopefully you're going uphill and that head's like, "I can't get the momentum."

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,480
 But other than that, if you're going downhill, he's going to get you. He's going to breathe on you.

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 He's going to touch you. You're going to die.

99
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,480
 And sometimes he just appears in your bedroom.

100
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,480
 Sometimes you'll wake up in the middle of the night and you'll see like a lump at the end of your bed.

101
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,480
 And you're like, "Hmm, that's weird. I remember I left my lump on the couch."

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,480
 What's that? And you move the blanket aside and then you see, "Hehehehehehe!"

103
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,480
 A head staring at you. And you're kind of done it.

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,480
 I mean, at that point in my life, I'll just go back to sleep because you know you're going to die soon.

105
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,480
 Might as well get a nice sleep. You've already been touched by Satan's head.

106
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 A bizarre cryptid. It's unstoppable. You don't come across those very often.

107
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,480
 I think a lot of these cryptids, these legends, they want to teach lessons like,

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 "Don't go to the Riverside late at night, kids, because you'll drown."

109
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,480
 But they say, because there's like some river down there that's going to drag you into the water.

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,480
 There's like a moral to that. This one is just, "Don't exist in Brazil."

111
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,480
 Don't be in Brazil because at any point Satan's head will just show up in your house,

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,480
 in your bedroom of all places, or you're just walking on the street.

113
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,480
 A guy to centigrade's head will chase you. Welcome to Brazil.

114
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,480
 There's no moral to this at all. And there's no way to stop it. It will get you if it wants to.

115
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 A little spooky story to start off today's episode.

116
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 "Painted Demons." Let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

117
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
 We're going to leave behind Brazil. Check our pockets.

118
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
 Make sure we don't have any head-sized bulges in our pockets.

119
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,480
 Take us out of here. We are going to Michigan.

120
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
 [Burps]

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 Specifically, we are headed to Highland Park, Michigan.

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,480
 And as we're headed out there, I turn to you and I go, "Watch Justice League tonight."

123
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,480
 We don't have time to do a whole promo. Watch Zach's tonight. It's Justice League tonight.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,480
 HBO Max rated R. Batman's in it. And people get punched in the nuts for four hours.

125
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 It's going to be spectacular. Watch it.

126
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,480
 I'm poking you in the chest. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.

127
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 I don't have time to do a promo. I wasn't getting paid by HBO to do a promo.

128
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 I'm just really excited about that movie. And I think it's awesome.

129
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 No one thought it could be done. Zach Snyder did it. So very, very cool.

130
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 Don't give up on your dreams, people. Take that as an example of that.

131
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 We're going back to August of 1972.

132
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,480
 It's a hot summery month in Michigan. I don't know. I didn't check the weather report.

133
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 It could have been a freak snow storm. But it doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with the story.

134
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 "Pain of Demons" is bringing the dirgeable down. It's 1 a.m. in the morning.

135
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,480
 In Highland Park, there's a house. It's just a normal house full of a normal family.

136
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 And this night, their child, let's call her Samantha, is having a sleepover with her best friend.

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,480
 We'll call her Annie. So Samantha and Annie. They're hanging out.

138
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,480
 They're playing games, doing each other's hair, watching TV, whatever.

139
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,480
 Whatever girl's doing, they hang out together. Pillow fights, stuff like that.

140
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,480
 These girls are eight, by the way. So it's not like they're out putting on makeup and hitting the clubs.

141
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,480
 These two eight-year-old girls. Annie is visiting the house.

142
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,480
 At 1 a.m. she wakes up. Oh, my tummy. I have to go to the bathroom.

143
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 She hops out of bed. And as she's walking through the house to find the bathroom, she hears a noise.

144
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,480
 "S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s

145
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:41,480
 She's on alert now. Who else would be up at 1 a.m., she thinks. Probably someone else who has to use the bathroom. She's already in an unfamiliar setting late at night and as she's hearing noises.

146
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,480
 When she gets to the hallway that leads to the bathroom, she notices that the bathroom light is already on.

147
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 She's standing there in the hallway. The bathroom seems immeasurably far away, with the bathroom door slightly opened,

148
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
 allowing just a little bit of light to escape the room.

149
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 And then she sees a child standing in the bathroom.

150
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:15,480
 She says it reminded her of a starving child. It looks so emaciated. It looks so thin.

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,480
 And as her eyes are adjusting to the darkness, trying to make out the silhouette standing in the bathroom,

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:38,480
 she sees other features. A large oval head, huge eyes, a thin arm, ending in three fingers.

153
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:46,480
 She's looking at what we would know as a grey alien. Remember the story started off when she had to go to the bathroom.

154
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 So it's no surprise at this point she just begins to pee all over the floor.

155
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 She's looking at this thing, it's staring at her, she's peeing all over her best friend's carpet, and she passes out.

156
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 The next thing she knows, she's in bed.

157
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,480
 When she's kind of trying to figure out what happened, she looks down and her underwear is glowing.

158
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 It's like what am I with my glowing underwear at home, because I'm super embarrassed by it.

159
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,480
 These underwear, glowing. That's odd thing one.

160
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,480
 Odd thing two is as the family starts waking up and everyone's going about and she's smelling the smell of breakfast being cooked and all that stuff,

161
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,480
 she's waiting for someone to complain. They're like, dude, your underwear is too bright. I'm trying to read the newspaper.

162
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,480
 She's waiting for people to complain about her peeing on the floor, but nobody does.

163
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,480
 And as she's walking through the house down that hallway again, she looks to where she knows she peed all over the floor.

164
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 There's nothing there.

165
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,480
 She said for about a week after this whole thing, she had a hard time walking. She felt like she had a catch.

166
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,480
 You know how like when you're walking you feel like you have your catch and your hip.

167
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,480
 And the story goes on to imply some sort of implant was placed in her during her abduction.

168
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
 She just saw the thing, but she blacked out so she has that loss of time.

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 But the story kind of goes that she had some sort of implant put in her.

170
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,480
 But it doesn't end like that, because later on Annie tells Samantha about what happened that night.

171
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,480
 And while Samantha kind of blows it off at first, but later on Samantha does see it

172
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 and begins to tell Annie, "I saw it. I saw the thing."

173
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 But Annie just goes, "I'm just never going back to your house. I'm fine."

174
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,480
 Samantha's stuck there. She's living there in this house.

175
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,480
 And she starts telling her family members, "I think there's an alien here, you know, Annie, she doesn't come by anymore.

176
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,480
 Her underwear glows. That should be evidence enough. I think I'm seeing this thing and no one in the family believes her."

177
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,480
 And Samantha is stuck growing up in this house where she's being tormented by this gray alien appearing out of the darkness.

178
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 And eventually it got so much for Samantha, she took her own life, leaving Annie the only survivor of this encounter.

179
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:20,480
 This is an interesting alien story. I mean, just on the facts of it, it crosses the line between alien encounter and horror.

180
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,480
 I mean, that is a scary story. Getting abducted into a UFO, that's pretty scary too.

181
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:32,480
 I'm not going to say, like, "What? That's totally lame." That's scary on a different level, but it being in your house and the whole idea of it hiding in your bathroom and just kind of...

182
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,480
 What was it doing in there? Was it waiting for her? Did it know that she was going to have to go to the bathroom?

183
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,480
 Was it looking for Oxycontin? Was it actually trying to go through the medicine cabinet?

184
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
 And she stumbled across it. You have all these horrific visuals.

185
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,480
 There's another interesting layer about this. I read these reports. I got this stuff from thinkaboutadox.com

186
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,480
 and this is the only time I've stumbled across this thing about a dox.com or really... I don't want to say ever, but I can't think of a time I came across this.

187
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:09,480
 There's two versions of this story with two very important details missing. They're actually... Most of the stuff is the same.

188
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:18,480
 Highland Parks, Michigan, August 1972. Sleepover. But the big differences are one had a boy in it and one has a girl in it.

189
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 The boy does not have the glowing underwear. The boy does not have any trouble walking.

190
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:32,480
 So you have the boy version. You have the girl version. The girl version is actually reported. Both of them are reported by MUFON as well, which is the mutual UFO network.

191
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 So it's weird that you have a clearinghouse for UFO stories and I don't know how this got cycled through.

192
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 I mean, it makes you think that it's more likely to be fake because they're just gender swapping the characters or something like that.

193
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 I don't know. They're like, "Hey, this will work really good for the girls. The girl's like spooky stories. Let's put them in it."

194
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:04,480
 I'm not for sure, but Hopkins is actually connected in the girl version. The version I told you with the glowing underwear and the walking weird.

195
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 But Hopkins, which is a huge name in UFOlogy, he put his name behind the girl version. Another difference, another key difference, I actually kind of blended the stories a bit because I don't know...

196
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:24,480
 Because I don't know which one's true. Everything that I told you about the girl one is from the girl narrative, but in the girl's version of the story, the person who commits suicide is a random person in the house.

197
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:33,480
 In the boy's version of the story, it is the best friend he grows up with and is having the sleepover with who kills himself.

198
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,480
 So I kind of swapped the ending there just because I thought it was more dramatic rather than just the uncle showing up and be like, "Hey, everyone, you mind if I stay here for a couple nights?"

199
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 And he kills himself. I mean, it's still tragic, but... And I wanted to address that too, that I had combined the two stories. It's just a bizarre detail.

200
00:15:50,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 I haven't seen this where you have the same story from the same source that changes key details. So is the story fake? I don't think the story happened in two...

201
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 I don't know the same story happened in two different houses. I don't know. I don't know what to make of it. But aside from that, it is a spooky story.

202
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:21,480
 And it's one I think we can all relate to. One of the creepiest things you can do, especially at a house that you're not used to, is go to the bathroom.

203
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 Right because you don't know the layout of the house. Painted demons, let's leave behind Highland Park, Michigan. We got one more story to cover this episode. Call in that carboner copter.

204
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,480
 We are headed out to Malaysia.

205
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 We're headed out to Sabah, Malaysia. It's December 30th, 2020. It's 3 a.m.

206
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:54,480
 Painted demons land us here in Sabah, Malaysia. We see a car drive by.

207
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:02,480
 That's 3 a.m. It's really late. There's not a lot of traffic driving around at 3 a.m. These guys are just having a good time driving their car around.

208
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,480
 They're just chilling with their homies. And then they see something in the darkness.

209
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:20,480
 Car drives by and the guy in the back seat goes, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, did you see that?" The driver's like, "No, what was that?" And there's something out there. There's something in the darkness.

210
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:28,480
 The guy turns the car around. They're driving back and they see it again. Something in the darkness.

211
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:45,480
 It's a little kid at 3 a.m. They immediately realize what they're looking at is a ghost, a little ghost boy riding a tricycle in the middle of the street at 3 a.m.

212
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:55,480
 They slow the car down and they begin to follow this ghostly figure. This is on video. You ever wanted proof of ghost? The video is in the show notes.

213
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:03,480
 The guy whips out his camera phone. They start going, "If you're human, please stop!"

214
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:14,480
 Little ghost child is riding the tricycle. Now it's actually riding down the road. It's entering an intersection. There's no other cars, though, but what would a car do to a ghost?

215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,480
 A car would just pass right through it. This little boy, this little ghost boy on a ghost tricycle is slowly riding down the road.

216
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 "If you're human, please stop!" The people keep saying over and over and over again. It's on video. And the ghost is not stopping. So proof, obviously, right?

217
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:43,480
 They record it and they get super scared because they just saw a ghost on a tricycle and then they go home.

218
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:51,480
 And then one other people did, other people in the neighborhood, they're like, "Why are people out there yelling if you're human? Stop!" Who are they yelling at, too?

219
00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:00,480
 People are looking out their windows. They see a ghost boy on a tricycle riding around the neighborhood. They call the police.

220
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,480
 They didn't know the number for Ghostbusters, so they called the second best number. They call the police. The police comes out.

221
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 The police see this and they go, "That's not a ghost. It's not a ghost. It's a four-year-old boy who was riding his tricycle out after 3 a.m."

222
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,480
 They're like, "If he'd been doing it at 2 a.m., it would have been totally fine, but 3 a.m. That's curfew for four-year-olds."

223
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:31,480
 The cops rush out there. They scoop him up. They take him home to his family. I believe he had some sort of developmental issues, and that's why when people were yelling at him, "If you're human, please stop!"

224
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:39,480
 He kept on writing. Also, even if you knew what they were saying, you would be like, "Uh, weirdos. Of course, I'm a human. You would keep going."

225
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,480
 You'd be like, "Maybe I'll find some non-weird humans." He was just out patrolling the neighborhood on his little bicycle.

226
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,480
 And everyone got a good laugh. It is a real video. It's not in English. It's not in English. I didn't actually understand what they were saying,

227
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:59,480
 but in the article, they were saying, "Stop, stop." And the actual quote was, "If you are a human, please stop." They were saying that.

228
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 And everyone got a good laugh. The kids fine. The people they've do look like total boobs. I actually made that mistake.

229
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,480
 I talked about it a long time ago on the podcast where me, my friend Steve Daimwood, my buddy Mauricio Carrillo, I think was his name,

230
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,480
 we saw a Civil War ghost. We were driving out in the middle of nowhere, and we saw a Civil War ghost.

231
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:26,480
 And it turned out it was just an elderly security guard in a gray outfit. But we drove past him like three or four times, going, "Ah, it's a ghost! It's a ghost!"

232
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,480
 We actually thought it was a ghost. We thought it was a Civil War ghost in Northern California. I don't know why we thought that at an industrial park

233
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,480
 where they hire security guards. But we thought it was a ghost. On the one hand, I can empathize with these guys, but on the other hand,

234
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:46,480
 I read this story and it put a little nugget in my brain. Let's put on our conspiracy caps here for a second.

235
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,480
 There's a lot of people who believe in predictive programming that televisions and movies, there's this weird thing, the Illuminati,

236
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,480
 one of the rules they have to follow is they have to warn you about what they're going to do before they do it, so it will work.

237
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,480
 And that's why Simpsons has 9/11 references and things like that. And so you have that thing, we've debunked that a lot of times on this show.

238
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 Then you have this other idea that they use movies and televisions to get us used to things they want to do, or ways they want to control society.

239
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:28,480
 That one I can actually see happening. If I was a super rich, powerful person, I would want movies to reflect the way I want the world to be.

240
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:37,480
 If I want the world to be this way, if I want the world to be in this beautiful post-scarcity Star Trek utopia, then I'm going to push that all the time.

241
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,480
 I'm going to be like pushing Star Wars, pushing the movies that make the future totally grim. And technically it's not the future,

242
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,480
 but you know what I mean? Like sci-fi stuff that's really dark, I would try to push that away and I'd try to go, "No, everything gets better, transhumanism, da-da-da-da."

243
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 If that's what I wanted, that's what I would push. So you see people go, "That's the reason why Hunger Games, that's the reason why Terminator movies,

244
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,480
 that's why these post-apocalyptic movies are being pushed because the powers that be are trying to push us to a post-apocalyptic future.

245
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:14,480
 They want us to be under their control. The problem with that theory is all of those movies are about citizens rising up and destroying the government.

246
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 The Hunger Games is the ultimate libertarian wet dream because it ends, spoiler alert, it ends with all governments being corrupt, even the good governments.

247
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 And the hero living off the land with her family, Katniss Everdeen, destroys two governments in one day and the world is lawless for the most part.

248
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 And she goes off to live in the woods. It's the ultimate libertarian/anarchist dream.

249
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,480
 So it doesn't make sense. Like if they're trying to prepare us for a future where the powers that be rule as the elite and everyone else's are slaves,

250
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:53,480
 movies like The Hunger Games are actually the opposite of it. It shows that a small group of people can actually enforce major changes and overthrow corruption.

251
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 You wouldn't want that movie out there if you were a member of the Illuminati. That type of movie actually shows that they don't have ultimate control.

252
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 If you believe in the idea of the Illuminati or groups trying to influence the world and things like that.

253
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 Movies coming out like that and being big hits shows that they don't have control over Hollywood because that's the exact opposite message they want to show.

254
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:22,480
 But I do lean more towards the idea of people trying to shape the world and society by influencing what we see in movies.

255
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:33,480
 With these guys, and I've actually said this multiple times on this show, I've said it multiple times on this show, I've said if I ever see a kid in the middle of nowhere, I'm going to assume it's a ghost.

256
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,480
 I've said that all the time. You're walking down the street, you hear a little girl singing, I've made tons of jokes about that.

257
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
 In my mind, a little kid in the middle of nowhere, you think it's a ghost.

258
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 In this circumstance, if I was there, what I have thought that the kid on the tricycle was a ghost, I thought an old man in a gray outfit was a Civil War ghost. I might have.

259
00:23:51,480 --> 00:24:00,480
 I might have. And I've said several times if I saw a little kid in distress. This is on a recent episode, I go, "Sorry, bro, I don't know if you're a ghost."

260
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 So I thought about it. What if the stories of the Black-eyed children are 100% fake?

261
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:32,480
 What if the stories of children ghosts are hyped in the media through movies like The Ring and movies like The Grudge and all these ring-around-the-rosy, all these spooky children motifs in movies are all social programming to get us afraid of seeing kids in unusual places?

262
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,480
 If you see a child in an unusual location, you'll think it's a ghost.

263
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:52,480
 And what if the reason behind that is that if we're ever driving down the road in the middle of the night and we see a young girl standing on the street corner, we think our immediate reaction is that's a ghost.

264
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:05,480
 When really it's a girl who just escaped a kidnapper. Or we see a young boy standing in what we all know of as a haunted house that abandoned structure on the edge of town.

265
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 We're driving by amateur ghost hunters and we see a young boy standing at the window.

266
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:23,480
 Maybe we'll snap a quick photo before we get out of there. It's so terrifying. Even though we're amateur ghost hunters, we didn't actually expect to see a full-body apparition of a 10-year-old boy.

267
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:32,480
 We speed away before we see a hand grab the child and yank him back into the darkness of that house.

268
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:44,480
 You could have cults and groups using these myths of haunted locations so most people don't bother with them in the first place. They can do what they need to in that location.

269
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 Whether it's human trafficking or whatever dastardly deed they're up to, they know people aren't going to stumble across it.

270
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,480
 There was a story recently about these ghost hunters who went to a shack out in the middle of nowhere. I'll put it in the show notes.

271
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,480
 While they were goofing off with their flashlights and spirit boxes and stuff like that, they opened up a refrigerator. There was a human body in it.

272
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,480
 They left the location they called the police and then the place burned down.

273
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:17,480
 So there is precedent for this type of thing. And I'm thinking what if all these stories about haunted children and little kids, because they're all over you.

274
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,480
 You're making a low-budget horror movie. It's almost like a given that you're going to cast a kid because they're super kids are creepy to begin with.

275
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 So now you just spray paint and white and give a black contact lenses. They're even creepier.

276
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:39,480
 What if it's all this social programming so that when there's a knock on your door at 3 a.m. and you hear a child's voice crying for help.

277
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,480
 It's not 100%, but there's a chance that that door they're knocking on will be yours or mine.

278
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:53,480
 And we have heard black-eyed kids stories over and over again. It's creepypasta on podcasts. There's even movies about black-eyed children.

279
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,480
 And when we hear a kid outside our house at 3 in the morning, it makes us hesitate.

280
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 It takes us even longer to get to the door as we're debating should I open it. And by the time we get to the door, there's no one there.

281
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 It reinforces in our mind the idea that the child was paranormal. But the child simply realized there was no one here to help them.

282
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 And they ran back off into the night, hoping someone else would hear their cries.

283
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 Is it possible that all these stories of ghostly children and demonically possessed preteens are actually just a cover to make us afraid when we see them?

284
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:43,480
 So if you do ever hear that knock on your door at 3 in the morning and the voice of a frightened child,

285
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:54,480
 will you open the door immediately? Will you hesitate? Will you think something dark and evil is on the other side of this door?

286
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 Or will you let that child into your house, keeping them safe while you dial 911?

287
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,480
 Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you let that child in your house and the legends were true.

288
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 You just accepted a black-eyed child into your home.
