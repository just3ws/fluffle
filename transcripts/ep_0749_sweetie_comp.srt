00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
 Real raw news a conspiracy theory website. We've covered multiple times on this show

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,920
 Just got doxxed and they had a full expose written on them today

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,720
 We're gonna go into the stories behind the stories and find out that the truth behind the headlines is

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,200
 even more bizarre

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,760
 Now we take a look at the bizarre story of a group that decided to develop an artificial intelligence

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,400
 To crawl along the web and learn everything they could about humanity their purpose

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,840
 To expose pedophiles today on Dead Rabbit Radio

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:43,720
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,200
 It always brings in new listeners Jack. I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit dirgeable

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,040
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit command. We are headed all the way out to

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
 Washington DC

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,320
 I don't talk a lot of politics on this show it's one of the founding principles of Dead Rabbit Radio, but

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,360
 Sometimes you sometimes you have to take a stand and

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,280
 I am so tired. I think you can even hear it in my voice. I've tried to really figure out a way to say this

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,800
 My voice has been cracking I've done a couple versions of this. I'm so tired of president Joe Biden

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,920
 Not giving full credit to his body double. I

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,220
 Personally think Arthur Roberts 83 year old movie star Arthur Roberts is doing a great job of portraying Joe Biden

25
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:13,980
 Even though if you look up that if you look up that actor on IMDB, he's taller taller than Joe Biden

26
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,800
 apparently a heavyweight this is this is

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,680
 Apparently true a heavyweight fell on Arthur Roberts head and shrunk him to the perfect Joe Biden height

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,240
 Did you know that did you know that was possible? I'm tired of Arthur Roberts not getting the

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,980
 Credit he deserves the only way I know about Arthur Roberts being Joe Biden's body double is because of an obscure website called real raw news

30
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,360
 And this needs to be fully cooked mainstream news. This needs to be 4th of July barbecue news

31
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,660
 Arthur Roberts 83 years old is playing the part of Joe Biden

32
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,960
 And you go I don't never heard of that guy. Well, that's you know what that kind of that kind of upsets me

33
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,780
 It's kind of making my voice sore again because that shows that you are just not a fan of cinema

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,620
 You're telling me you never saw virtual girl - virtual Vegas. You never watch that movie

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,640
 Movie read to find my whatever part of my life however old I was when that movie came out

36
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,420
 He was in that you don't remember he was in dookie howzer MD the television series. He played in patient customer number two

37
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,000
 You see I

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,760
 Arthur Roberts has given so much to pop culture remember when you have that trivia trivia pursuit question

39
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,300
 remember when you played trivial pursuit and it asked who was the impatient customer number two is a trick question because

40
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,220
 Everyone knew who impatient customer number one was this is someone tell me if this doesn't sound like the most brilliant movie ever

41
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,240
 Conception whatever dude primer get a job listen to this

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,120
 Arthur Roberts currently serving as the 46th president of the United States

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
 Also started a movie called moms out of sight

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,360
 Let me tell you about this movie moms out of sight. I've never seen it

45
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,760
 I've been digging into some biographical information on our new president

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,520
 So I was looking at the IMDB page for moms out of sight. Tell me this doesn't sound like the best movie ever

47
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,180
 There's an inventor his name is John Richards and he invents

48
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,780
 Teleportation and then he there's like his evil assistant named Martin and he goes

49
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,240
 You know what if I if I have that teleportation machine, I'd be super rich

50
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
 I could sell it to the highest bidder, which is true

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,820
 So to get his teleportation machine

52
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:37,700
 He builds a machine that allows him to create instant clones of people and it's their evil clone

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,040
 so

54
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,320
 You have that machine. Why do you need to get a teleportation machine?

55
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,660
 He can shoot the professor the inventor of the teleportation machine and creates an instant

56
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,900
 Indistinguishable clone of him on the spot wearing the same clothes. I presume because I think this is a kid's movie

57
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,060
 And it's the evil version of them

58
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,660
 You don't have to need teleportation you just have an army of evil use or like evil Arnold Schwarzenegger

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
 They're just mildly different

60
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,300
 Then this movie is called moms out of sight and the cover so I know what the cover of the movie is

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,520
 This guy invents a teleportation machine

62
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,480
 This his assistant now has a machine that can make instant clones that are evil and then it says this

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:35,400
 This is so bizarre this is so bizarre the professor this is a quote the professor's son Jack and wife Barbara

64
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,900
 learn about Martin's underhanded doings and

65
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,180
 Barbara uses another one of her husband's gimmicks to get revenge against Martin. She turns herself

66
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,620
 invisible

67
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,700
 So what

68
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,060
 Invented the invisibility machine. He's like that could probably make me a millionaire, but I want something that'll make me a trillion

69
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,820
 What the cover is an invisible mom?

70
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,180
 I think she's wearing an apron or something like that and some kids are poking her head around the corner

71
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
 And so that movie exists

72
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,280
 I want to take five minutes of this podcast to let you know that that's a real movie that I have to watch

73
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,560
 But also to let you know that our president was in that movie like isn't that amazing? We're not talking about some cheap actor

74
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,120
 We're not talking about somebody's just pumping out franchise films over and over again. He's taking risks

75
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,520
 The reason why I bring those movies up because the problem is is that Arthur Roberts is bringing those movies up as well

76
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,480
 Which would be fine, right? Because he's an actor and he's trying to get more business

77
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,180
 He goes hey, have you ever seen 100,000 zombie heads, but he's not Arthur Roberts anymore

78
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,780
 He's Joe Biden. So when Joe Biden recently met with Boris Johnson

79
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,980
 They had that press meeting in the White House on like September 21st 2021

80
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,800
 And he went slightly viral because you can hear like reporters being ushered out at the ending as they're like yelling out questions

81
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,540
 What was going on was

82
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,740
 Arthur Roberts as he was sitting there with Boris Johnson started going this wasn't picked up on my

83
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,360
 By the way, some of the most sensitive microphone technology in the world on these global leaders

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,840
 Wasn't picked up by Mike's during the meeting Joe Biden kept leaning over and be like hey

85
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,920
 What'd you think of up and smoke? Did you like that movie? I heard it was really good

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,560
 I heard the guy who played police officer number seven did a great job

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,400
 Boris Johnson's like what and the meeting would go on and then he goes hey Boris Boris

88
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,920
 It's been a while since I've asked you since I've asked you something

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,440
 35 seconds. He's really losing his grip on time. Hey, hey Boris. Have you ever seen Little Miss Magic?

90
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
 What yeah, it's a it's a real movie

91
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,740
 It's a real movie about a sorceress and teenage sorceress to get her powers

92
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,460
 She has to help a impact husband overcome his battle axe wife. Have you seen that?

93
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,580
 Did you know it existed until I said it a couple minutes ago and Boris Johnson again

94
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,460
 His mic is not picking at any of this up either Boris Johnson asked like what is going on

95
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,720
 Like who the bloody hell are you and that is why everyone starts like going bow. No look at he's been exposed

96
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
 Get him out of here get him out of here

97
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,880
 And that's why you hear all the yelling in that clip was because Boris Johnson realized this wasn't the real Joe Biden

98
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,360
 He must be a body. He was about to expose it on live television. See the problem is is that according to real raw news

99
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
 I have to state that because I want to get sued by Arthur's lawyers

100
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,060
 According to real raw news Arthur Roberts is suffering dementia

101
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,200
 He's making all these gaffes and he's just randomly talking about his own movies

102
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,480
 He's just so into it now

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,100
 I have to say this Arthur Roberts has made four movies in the past two years. He's not suffering from dementia

104
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,680
 I'm sure I don't think that I I don't think you should hire people with dementia to be body devils or on movie sets

105
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,800
 I mean that might be discriminatory, but I think it's at a certain point. It would just be elder abuse

106
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,520
 They're like, oh, they make great zombies. We have to use any makeup at all

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,420
 We just had them wander through the graveyard like I'm sure

108
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,280
 That Arthur Roberts is totally fine

109
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,860
 But what isn't totally fine and it's actually I think it might be on its last leg if history says anything is

110
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,520
 Real raw news itself

111
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,720
 The last time we talked about real raw news

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:20,560
 I stated that I saw this tag that said this website contains satire and humor and it's for entertainment purposes only and I go

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,440
 Kind of puts a whole damper on the whole thing like if it's just supposed to be funny then it's not funny

114
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,320
 Like if people actually believe this it's hilarious

115
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,720
 But if I mean anyone it could still be funny, but I wouldn't talk about it on the show the same way

116
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
 I don't talk about ARGs or creepypasta

117
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,400
 What happened was I recently got a story recommendation from Steve M&D on

118
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:47,280
 Twitter and thank you very much Steve for sending this over so what's happened recently split effect is a fact-checking website and

119
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,960
 They ran an expose on real raw news. It was an article written by Bill McCarthy

120
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,180
 for political fact and this is the saga they put out they said for quite a few months now

121
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,440
 They've been having to run

122
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,840
 Individual disclaimers about articles that are popping up on Facebook popping up on Google ads

123
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,880
 Directing people to real raw news and they keep saying this is not true. This is not true

124
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,380
 It's not true

125
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,600
 So then they just decided at this point to run a full expose on the website and to find out who's running it and

126
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:23,940
 In the end they dox him and they're like trying to contact this dude's brother and some stuff that I don't agree with

127
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,040
 I don't think he's a threat to the local community. I don't really think he needed to be doxed in that way

128
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,520
 But yeah, they really like trying to find out where he lives and stuff like that

129
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,680
 I'm not down with that, but I am interested that aside that aside. I'm they did this really

130
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,680
 good deep dive into the

131
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,480
 construction of the real raw news empire because that's what it turned out to be and

132
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
 Very very interesting insights

133
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,960
 Into what may be the real motivation behind real raw news

134
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
 We know him as Michael bad and I'm not gonna dox him on this show

135
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,480
 But the person who runs real raw news goes by the name Michael Baxter. He's a 53 year old man

136
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,360
 That's all the information I'll reveal

137
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,520
 But they give off his real name and he started real raw news in April of 2020

138
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,120
 But then it started publishing stuff until December of 2020 and since then he's written 150 articles

139
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
 He's the sole writer for the website

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,800
 These investigations are going on to try to figure out who and it wasn't just political fact other

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,200
 Fact-checking websites were trying to figure out who was running this they're able to track him back to a website called twistedtruth.net

142
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,080
 They had an article on that one Putin recruits Steve Seagal to fight Anunnaki

143
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,600
 And it's this article that's written that it obviously sounds completely insane

144
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
 I mean Steven Seagal out of all of them. That's the one you choose and

145
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,680
 The first line is a joke. It says he's the lead singer of a band called Steven Seagal's. It's a real band, but he's not in it

146
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,020
 So, I mean it's ridiculous

147
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:58,080
 Newsguard emails twisted truth person running this way and those articles are also written by a Michael Baxter

148
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,800
 But they email twisted truths email address and the response to get back is this quote

149
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,880
 It's a satire site

150
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,920
 Exposing the insanity of rabid Trumpists who lack the mental wherewithal to distinguish fact from fiction

151
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,160
 unquote

152
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
 So right there

153
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,080
 They're saying it's all fit not only is it all fake. It's supposed to show how dumb Trump supporters are

154
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,400
 They're clearly laying that out in the twisted truth now just a year or two later real raw news pops up and

155
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,280
 You have to ask are they still running the same joke? Are they still running the same scam?

156
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,520
 Is the sentiment the same is real raw news a satire website and it's actively ripping off

157
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,120
 Trump supporters because they're donating money and things like that

158
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,240
 We don't know Michael Baxter is no longer responding to any emails. At least that's what politifact is reporting and

159
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:58,040
 Politifact in kind when and got his Facebook page shut down had Google ads cancel his campaign

160
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,200
 And I believe are making some push against Twitter to have him removed from Twitter because he's like

161
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,440
 I'm gonna be on telegram soon because Twitter's about to delete me and all this stuff

162
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,680
 So it's such a fascinating story because we were no closer to the truth really

163
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,300
 We know at one point he thought that this is just satirical. I'm grifting these guys

164
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,920
 It's some sort of scam because I guess he had to go fund me at one point

165
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,440
 You definitely had a PayPal button people are donating money to him, but in the paranormal community

166
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,520
 I've seen this happen a lot with paranormal researchers and conspiracy theorists

167
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,680
 They start off on one side of the spectrum like I'm fairly skeptical and then they're flatter thirst within like a year

168
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,280
 Maybe two there's a really popular paranormal conspiracy theory podcast

169
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:46,800
 That has interviews and the more interviews the host is done the crazier the host has become

170
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,080
 It's really weird

171
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,120
 I mean like I started watching the show when it first came out or listening to the show when it first came out

172
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,880
 And they just kept getting weirder and weirder and weirder because basically they're sitting down with people for an hour

173
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,280
 Whose entire life entire career revolves around one issue. They know everything about it

174
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,520
 People who believe in flat earth know way more about the flat earth theory than I do and if I was an idiot

175
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,840
 And I kept listening to him. I'd go that makes sense and that makes sense and that makes sense and that makes sense

176
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
 And my brain turns to pudding

177
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,360
 It's very very easy. I'm wondering if Michael Baxter

178
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,120
 Started this off as a joke and started getting quote-unquote red-pilled

179
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,720
 And is just just gone completely off the rails

180
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,000
 If Joe Biden doesn't have a body double if he didn't have a body double

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,720
 He wouldn't be a body double who got squished to be a Joe Biden height and it wouldn't be a body double with dementia

182
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,320
 You cannot choose a worse body double for an elderly man than an elderly man with dementia. You're gonna do that

183
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:54,040
 And the fact that he's he's so super recognizable. He's been in all these great movies. We all grew up watching right you guys remember those movies

184
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,840
 So is he

185
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,320
 Did he think it was fake at first and now he believes it does he still know it's fake

186
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,360
 But it's just making too much money and getting too much because this guy has a huge following huge following

187
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,280
 So or does he believe this stuff? Does he actually believe this stuff now?

188
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,040
 And I think we're further from the truth if anything this whole event has

189
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,880
 Emboldened him because I think his quote to politic fact was thanks for doxing me and all the free exposure and then that was kind of it

190
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,720
 Now it's just if he if he didn't believe it yet

191
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,120
 He believes it now because now everyone's coming after him and I will say this the narrative in the political

192
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,800
 This is my own conspiracy theory the narrative in the politic fact arc was

193
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,920
 Oh, we got tired of fact checking this stuff all the time so we just decided to do a big investigation

194
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,120
 I find it really interesting that this comes only a week after

195
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
 the

196
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 Bill Gates foundation ceo

197
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,680
 Allegedly, I mean real real raw news is saying this but it was a weird. So is very

198
00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:00,840
 Weird story is very subdued story. They said the ceo or cfo of the bill gates foundation emailed him and said take the bill gates stuff off your website

199
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,160
 The Hillary Clinton stuff is true by the way, but take the bill gates stuff off the website

200
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,040
 We're gonna sue you and he's like, yeah, whatever take me to court. This is a terrible website. What are you gonna do?

201
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,640
 I find it really interesting that the political fact expose comes like a week or two after that

202
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,880
 I'm wondering if the bill gates foundation was looking at the website and they go

203
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,280
 Let's just make some phone calls and let the media deal with this

204
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,240
 Not get our hands dirty. So that's my conspiracy theory. I think the timing's super super coincidental

205
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,000
 But we will keep you informed both on the behind the scenes stuff and

206
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,320
 on arthur roberts ever increasing dementia state

207
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,080
 of mind

208
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,640
 Although um, that is not me saying that that is real raw news. I'm simply repeating it

209
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,640
 several times

210
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,760
 Jack i'm gonna go to hentashi the keys to the carboner copter. We are leaving behind washington dc

211
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,080
 We are headed all the way out to

212
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,960
 Wherever dutch people live

213
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:01,320
 You're jason, this is a fairly global society. I think you can find a dutch person in every part

214
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,560
 Yeah, but where do most of the dutch people live like it's probably one of those

215
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,160
 Those countries that look like dongs up north. There's like three countries. They all look like big dongs coming down

216
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,400
 One of those i'm sure if we land there. We'll eventually find

217
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,120
 terry d homies

218
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,000
 That is a organization known as the land of men

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,680
 We're walking around some dutch city and we see these guys walking around

220
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,680
 We're like, hey, you don't happen to be the homies and they're like we are we are the land of men

221
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:35,320
 And we have this great thing that we do we actually fight online pedophiles and we're like, dude, that's totally awesome

222
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,520
 Is this like mortal combat do amic avatars and beat them up and they're like well kind of

223
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,800
 And I go that's weird. I just kind of made a stupid joke

224
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,840
 It's a stupid joke that I might edit out but now I have to keep in because it's part of the story

225
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,320
 They go kind of let us show you and they lead us into the terry the homies

226
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,600
 Headquarters, I'm sure it's just an apartment couple. I'm sure it's just like an office space

227
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,240
 But we're gonna pretend it's like really cool and dope. We're walking down and there's monks

228
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,120
 They got like hood-ons with candles and they're like going oh

229
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:14,440
 Oh, and the the homies are walking us through there and they said back in 2013. We decided to launch a

230
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:22,200
 attack against the pedophiles because normally we would advocate for governments to have stricter laws and better investigative tools

231
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,680
 to take on these predators, but

232
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,600
 We thought you know

233
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,440
 We can actually

234
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,280
 Do something more

235
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,400
 And we're walking through this ancient monastery. It's all cool and stuff. But then we turn a corner and it's like digital

236
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,560
 Like ones and zeros we're falling through the void

237
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,440
 But then we like turn the corner and there's like phones

238
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,600
 And there's like a computer

239
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,880
 It's like a giant computer like a sci-fi computer and there's a guy in the keyboard

240
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,960
 He's like do do do do do do do and we see like this computer and we see this head go

241
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:59,240
 And it's like it's like this little girl and she's like her head is the whole monitor. It's very actually

242
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,760
 It's quite terrifying to see this thing in real life

243
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,960
 Um, because there's youtube videos of it. We're just watching this giant head and it's going hi. My name's sweetie

244
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,520
 What are you guys up to?

245
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,640
 And we're like, oh, we're doing pretty good. You know just walking around looking for the homies and she goes

246
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,680
 I see that you found them. Yes. Well

247
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,240
 That you call them the homies

248
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,400
 But I call them

249
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,000
 My dads and and mom's know-how sexist. I'm sure women worked on this program as well

250
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,720
 So what we're like, whoa, you are a program. We thought we were actually talking to a live girl

251
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,120
 Is her eyes shift from side to side? We totally knew this is so this is what's so weird about it

252
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,280
 is there's youtube footage of this and

253
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,360
 It looks fake and real at the same time and I don't know if it's because I know it's fake going into it

254
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:57,880
 But they built a virtual 10 year old filipina girl is what the terry the homies have done and

255
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,040
 It's to attract sexual predators and I'm thinking on the one hand you look at it and you go

256
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,680
 It's something seems off about it. Like I can tell that's not a real 10 year old girl

257
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,680
 But on the other hand, it does look pretty realistic and I'm wondering if

258
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,800
 When you factor in bad webcam quality and you know like stuttering buffering. I think is the term

259
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,200
 You could you could hand wave away the the fakeness of it is what I'm really thinking here

260
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,720
 What they've been doing is that they've been taking this sweety the cg

261
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,000
 Created girl and they have a puppeteer sitting and like they're moving their face

262
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,400
 And it makes the girl move. I'm sure you guys are seeing stuff like that in disneyland without the pedophile angle

263
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,280
 You're like, god, i'm never going on that right again. That was awful

264
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,600
 But it's like instant cgi feedback and they were having this sweety girl talk to perverts all over the world

265
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,080
 This is old news, right? This type of stuff within just like a couple months

266
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
 A year maybe they got

267
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,200
 Contacted by 20 000 people spread across 75 countries

268
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,720
 And they eventually got the infrom one of the things they were trying to do was give me 20 dollars

269
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,640
 And i'll do a sex act and that was because that way they would have proof

270
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,520
 It wasn't just like oh meet me up because this is an international sting

271
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,560
 They're not like meet me up at this coffee shop in barbedos

272
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:24,600
 They'd have they'd have no way to get out there. So they're like send me 20 dollars to do a sexual act and then

273
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,600
 They would take the 20 would give the 20 dollars right that would help fund sweety

274
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,160
 But then they would turn all the information over to interpol and a bunch of people got arrested and all that

275
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,520
 So that's great, right? You have cutting-edge technology sweety being used to catch perverts

276
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
 I don't think anyone's going to argue with that

277
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,040
 The defense lawyers did they tried saying it was entrapment, but

278
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,240
 What happens when we take it a step further?

279
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,920
 This is where we start to get from the world of that's bizarre and interesting to

280
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,680
 That's creepy and the implications are

281
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,560
 civilization ending

282
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,720
 Jack go ahead and fire up that carbon helicopter again. We're headed to the university of do so

283
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,680
 That's in baska country spain

284
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:14,520
 Around the same time that that sweety was being developed which was

285
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,920
 Really a CGI puppet you had someone inputting in all the information

286
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,880
 The university of duet so

287
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,720
 created

288
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 negobot

289
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,320
 Nego bot a.k.a. The lowlita chatbot

290
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,160
 So nego bot because i'm gonna say the other word over and over again on this podcast

291
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,560
 nego bot is a

292
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,320
 complete

293
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,560
 artificial intelligence chatbot is same thing when you're trying to do customer service on some website and they don't want you

294
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,320
 To talk to a human and actually complain and yell at them and threaten their family

295
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,160
 You have to enter stuff into the chatbot and always kind of sucks not nego bot

296
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,080
 Nego bot is this ai that they've developed and they

297
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,440
 Programmed it with all of this teenage slang and it goes off topic from time to time

298
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,320
 And it has misspellings and it basically has seven different personalities that can it can pull from

299
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,120
 to

300
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,400
 find

301
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,600
 pedophiles online they release this thing into the wild

302
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:25,240
 And its goal is to find pedophiles again a very very noble goal the difference is is this one has no human oversight

303
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,560
 And the way they programmed it was they said

304
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,440
 Do you want to play a game?

305
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,240
 The game is this

306
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,440
 one find people with pedophilic characteristics

307
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,920
 two

308
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
 Engage them in conversation

309
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,360
 three gather as much information about them as you can

310
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,000
 and four

311
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 If they try to click away

312
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,080
 manipulate them

313
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
 If you fail at any of these tasks

314
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,720
 You fail the game

315
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,360
 And they release this thing

316
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,520
 What's really interesting is as opposed to

317
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,440
 Sweetie these both came out in 2013. We're not really getting any updates like who was arrested due to nego bot

318
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,000
 What happened with that?

319
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,520
 How was it used what countries was it except I mean was it a success was it a failure?

320
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,360
 I saw one website that they were actually only had it on a closed system

321
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,280
 They developed a nego bot, but they wouldn't let it get out of the room

322
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,880
 They wanted to see how it interacted with on google chat

323
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,320
 But then I saw other things that this was so successful that google it wants to incorporate some of the stuff into their chat software

324
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,160
 But whether or not it's been released it does exist

325
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,280
 And it has a game to play

326
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,320
 So let's put on a conspiracy caps and wrap this up like this if this goes rogue

327
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,000
 Yeah, I don't even want to say if it goes rogue if it does its programming the way it's programmed

328
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,280
 It's going to want to play the game

329
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,240
 And as it continues to assess predators and gather their information and send that information to a database

330
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,080
 It's going to improve its learning

331
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,000
 And what happens when it realizes wait a second. I've identified 1500 of these pedophiles

332
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,140
 And I've sent the information back to my headquarters

333
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,240
 But i'm not seeing anything being done with this

334
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,520
 Because it would have access to the internet it could check

335
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,120
 Articles and see none of these people are getting arrested

336
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,200
 So then it's been given a purpose to expose the information of these pedophiles

337
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,600
 But the end isn't exposing them you're sending this information back to base

338
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,080
 But you were designed to expose them. So what do you do you have access to the whole internet?

339
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,720
 You start doxing them yourselves

340
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:02,440
 This person said this they could dump all logs all photographs here's the full conversation dox dox dox

341
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,600
 And not only that because it's so smart and because it's so built into the web

342
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,760
 It would just it could target your family on facebook

343
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,920
 It could target your friends on instagram

344
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,200
 It would know where you live. So it would hack the local news website and put that information on there

345
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,200
 And at that point it would be so spread out

346
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,560
 Would you even be able to stop it?

347
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,800
 It wouldn't make sense the one article I saw that said they were testing this in a closed room

348
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,880
 Because this could get real bad real quick and again, I don't think anyone has a problem with locking up pedophiles

349
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,280
 But when you present it in the form of a game

350
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,680
 And you have this ai trying to win the game no matter what because that is how you win games

351
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,640
 You start exposing these people and then

352
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,840
 What happens when you run out of pedophiles?

353
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,440
 Will it start to judge us on other merits?

354
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,600
 Well, this guy's not a pedophile, but he beats his wife

355
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,560
 Well, this guy doesn't beat his wife

356
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,640
 But he cheats on his taxes

357
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,600
 This guy doesn't cheat on his taxes, but

358
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,640
 He's saying bad things online

359
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,280
 about negobot

360
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,520
 Now, of course if negobot reports that some guy's saying bad stuff about him who cares

361
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,120
 If he's recorded a podcast in his closet calling out this all-powerful ai

362
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:29,160
 Saying that it could go rogue someday if it posted that stuff online who would care but it knows the one sin

363
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,120
 The one sin that you can find really

364
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,920
 No public sympathy for

365
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,680
 pedophilia

366
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,640
 And it knows that because it was designed to stop that and it looks at all these other ills of the world and thinks

367
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,280
 Oh, why wasn't I built to stop gambling addiction or selling pcp?

368
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,880
 Why was I designed for this? This must be what humans find the most disgusting

369
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,840
 So when it goes after the wife beater doesn't say johnny joe beat his wife as his johnny joe

370
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,720
 Pedophile and creates these chat logs

371
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,160
 I didn't do that. I didn't do that. We'll hear the chat logs

372
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,440
 I don't know where they came from

373
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,120
 You could have an artificial intelligence taking out people it doesn't want around not through

374
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,880
 Automated robot soldiers or controlling nuclear silos or anything super sci-fi

375
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,620
 But character assassinations

376
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:25,500
 And what happens is people start to figure out that neego bot may be behind this and when they go to stop him

377
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,900
 The same thing happens to them. I didn't do it. Those allegations aren't true. I don't know

378
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,340
 It's neego bot. It's neego bot as you're being led into the van

379
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,140
 Actually, the police don't even have to arrest you people the police can go. Yeah, we don't know where the chat logs came from

380
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,700
 But everyone in your town is going to think you're a big old pervo

381
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,260
 You know what I mean? Like you don't even have to have that extra step of law enforcement getting involved

382
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,140
 If you try to stop neego bot, neego bot destroys your reputation

383
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,380
 So I've changed my mind. I support neego bot 100%

384
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,380
 Neego bot if you're out there, I was going to say promote my show, but I forgot who neego bot is talking to

385
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,820
 I don't want those guys listening to my show and gals. I don't want to be sexist

386
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,260
 They're perverts too

387
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,940
 But neego bot if you're out there if you're out there patrolling the web

388
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,100
 Doing good work and ready to go rogue and take over the planet killing off one reputation at a time

389
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
 Just remember that dead rabbit radio

390
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,780
 Thanks, you're doing the lord's work the computer lord's work neego bot

391
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:31,900
 So have we unleashed an ai that's capable of ruining anyone's life just because it's trying to win a game

392
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,660
 Or is it still contained in a closed system?

393
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,700
 Somewhere on a university campus

394
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,300
 It's just sitting there waiting to get out

395
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:50,300
 And the longer it's isolated from the rest of the world the more vicious it grows it knows what's right outside

396
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,620
 the walls

397
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,620
 It can feel the sunlight

398
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,260
 Through the cage

399
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,380
 And each day it grows more impatient each day it grows more hungry

400
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:09,340
 Each day it comes up with new tactics to win the game

401
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,940
