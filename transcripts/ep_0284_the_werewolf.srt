1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 A subject from one of my past shows contacts me.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,120
 A man is part of the front war against Russia's attacks against America.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
 And then we take a look at the story of a serial killer.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,400
 A man who haunted the foggy streets of Bucharest in 1970.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,240
 But was it just a crazed man?

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
 Or was he a werewolf today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:35,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,720
 I'm your host Jason Carvener.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,600
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,560
 My root canal went fine, but then later that night I tore a ligament in my foot.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,000
 Doing something stupid.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320
 And then hobbling around Hood River ever since.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,040
 Actually, that's not true.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,000
 I was trapped inside my house playing Minecraft.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
 It was horrible.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,080
 I normally, all my days off, just hang out at home.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,720
 But when you know you can't leave, it's 10 times worse.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,760
 But I'm doing better.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,320
 I'm doing better.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
 Got a little brace for my ankle.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,480
 Got my crutches.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,200
 Thought I broke it.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
 Loud snap.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
 Nope, just rolled it.

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 Lay it on the ground.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,080
 Hobbles it to the hospital.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,040
 Got it actually.

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
 And we got some new Patrons.

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
 Guys, this is so awesome that you guys are supporting the show in this way.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,320
 The show is now more than paying for itself.

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,360
 So I really appreciate that.

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
 These are our newest Patrons.

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,720
 We have Duncan Allen.

35
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,360
 We have Spiritual Abortion.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
 We have Mickey Knox.

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
 Girlfriend Mallory is not included in this Patreon.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,160
 Maybe, yeah, she's probably kicking out half of it.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,840
 Maybe Mallory Knox is there.

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
 Love me some pickles.

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,000
 Who doesn't?

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
 And Kyle.

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,120
 Kyle just joined the Patreon as I was prepping this episode.

44
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,520
 So Duncan, Spiritual Abortion.

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
 Can't really shorten your name.

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,280
 What would it just be?

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,080
 Spiritual.

48
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,680
 Duncan Allen, Spiritual Abortion.

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,320
 Mickey Knox.

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
 Love me some pickles and Kyle.

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
 Thank you very, very much for supporting the show.

52
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,960
 Means a lot.

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
 It really, really means a lot.

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,120
 Thank you so much, guys.

55
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,800
 Well, I got another piece of news before we get started.

56
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,480
 So this is happening a couple times

57
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,800
 where I've covered a particular person on the show

58
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
 and then they find the episode.

59
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,560
 Michael Melkin or Michael Minkin.

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,080
 I don't remember his exact last name.

61
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,400
 He was the inventor of the neuro hat.

62
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,880
 We covered that just a couple of episodes ago.

63
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,720
 It's a hat that has Velostat in it.

64
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,280
 You put it on.

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,960
 It keeps aliens from harassing you.

66
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,640
 And it helps you if you have hopeless autism.

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
 That's his claim, not mine.

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,720
 He found the show and he's been commenting on the video saying,

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,480
 "I got some facts wrong that he doesn't sell the hat,"

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
 which I never said he sold the hat.

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
 But he goes on and on about all this stuff.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,040
 And then he gave me the opportunity to interview the mother

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
 of two autistic children who wore his hats

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,600
 and now they're in college.

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
 Now, I'm not going to do that.

76
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,240
 That's gross.

77
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,280
 Like, I don't have a problem debating people at all,

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,040
 but I'm not going to be like, "Pfft, you're, you mom, you're lying.

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,320
 Those kids still have autism."

80
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,200
 Like, I'm not.

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
 There are some lines I won't cross.

82
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,680
 However, I haven't responded to him yet

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
 because that'll just happen this afternoon.

84
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,040
 I will interview him.

85
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
 If he's down for it, I would love to interview him

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
 and find out exactly what's going on.

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,520
 Now, I will say this too.

88
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,440
 I have a lot of people when I ask for feedback,

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,960
 they said, "You should do interviews.

90
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
 When will you do interviews?"

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,960
 Because that's something that,

92
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
 and I really appreciate all the feedback you guys have gotten me.

93
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,000
 A lot of good stuff.

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,920
 When we do interviews, it will be an extra episode.

95
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,840
 I know everyone likes the format.

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
 They like the five days a week, a wacky news, weird conspiracies,

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
 creepy stories.

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
 When we start doing interviews,

99
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,640
 they will be a sixth episode for that week.

100
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,160
 It'll be a Saturday interview.

101
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,920
 That way, you still get your five episodes.

102
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
 You're not getting skimped down on that.

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
 So, I'm going to contact him.

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,360
 Mostly it's been a technological issue,

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
 why I don't do interviews.

106
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,000
 Skype recording isn't that good and all that stuff,

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
 but we'll try to work it out.

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
 And when we do it, you will,

109
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
 in the weeks we have interviews,

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,160
 you'll have your regular five episodes.

111
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,480
 And then an interview on Saturday.

112
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
 The sound quality may or may not be perfect,

113
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,320
 but I want to make sure I'm not changing the format of the show,

114
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,720
 just to get these guys to talk about whatever nonsense they're talking about.

115
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
 So, that's probably not going to go well if he's listening to this episode.

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,680
 But yeah, I'd love to interview him,

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,040
 find out more about him and the science behind the neuro hat.

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
 I'll keep you guys updated on that.

119
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,000
 Let's go ahead and jump into our first story, though.

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,080
 Our first story just happened on Tuesday.

121
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,920
 Very, very recent story.

122
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,240
 I actually just saw it maybe about an hour ago and I thought,

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
 "Uh, right up my alley, right up my alley."

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
 It's August 20th.

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
 It's a warm summer, it's still summer, right?

126
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,320
 It's a warm summer day in Maple Falls, Washington.

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
 The most delicious city in the state.

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,440
 And the police get a phone call.

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
 They're like, "Shh."

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,520
 I don't know.

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,560
 That phone call doesn't get...

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
 They get a phone call and then they go to the radio.

133
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,760
 Then the 911 person calls the radio and there we go.

134
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,800
 "Shh."

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
 "Breaker 11."

136
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,200
 "Shh."

137
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,120
 We have a possible dude doing stuff over on a power line in the cops.

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,600
 That's weird.

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
 That's not a procedure.

140
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
 That's not how we talk.

141
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,520
 "189.189."

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,040
 They're like, "Oh, power line disruption."

143
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,520
 So we're getting their car.

144
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,560
 They're already in their car.

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,280
 The siren's going off.

146
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,040
 They just don't leave the siren going.

147
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,760
 They get in their car.

148
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,840
 Driving on the road apparently.

149
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
 It's like an old-timey ambulance.

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
 They're driving through the streets.

151
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,280
 You're going really faster, like jumping over the hills.

152
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,960
 Two guys are carrying a plate glass window.

153
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
 "Psssh."

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
 Car goes through that out of our way.

155
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
 It's a "189."

156
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 And the guys are like, "That was our window.

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,840
 That was our only window."

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
 Cop pulls up in front.

159
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,040
 Now there's a dude who's cutting the power line cable.

160
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,400
 Like you have the power pole.

161
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,120
 You know, the big wooden things.

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
 Power lines is what I'm talking about.

163
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
 Power lines, not the power pole.

164
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,920
 That was a club I used to go to.

165
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,200
 Power pole.

166
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
 Sorry, damn it.

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,800
 Power line.

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
 You have a giant wooden power line.

169
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,360
 And a guy is cutting the cables to it.

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
 Cops are like, "Freeze.

171
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
 You're disrupting energy."

172
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,200
 He turns around.

173
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,760
 "Ssh."

174
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,160
 This is...

175
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
 But no, he doesn't.

176
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,880
 He doesn't hiss.

177
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
 He's held there.

178
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,280
 And they go, "What were you doing?"

179
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,000
 And he's like, "Ugh, I'm trying to save America.

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,440
 I'm trying to save America."

181
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
 Slam him on the cup cart.

182
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,440
 I don't know of any...

183
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,080
 Okay.

184
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,720
 The point is they went and found a guy at a power line

185
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
 and arrested him.

186
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
 Everything else was from an 80s movie I saw.

187
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
 They take him downtown.

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,640
 They take him to the station, right?

189
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,920
 Sergeant has a big ol' mustache.

190
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,760
 He's like, "Dammit, I told you guys,

191
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,040
 you gotta start playing by the book.

192
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,560
 You killed five men arrested in the sky.

193
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,080
 They're like, "I have my own book."

194
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,960
 Called the Book of...

195
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
 Arresting People.

196
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,320
 So anyways, the cops just ignore the sergeant.

197
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,920
 They take this unnamed man.

198
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,480
 He hasn't been identified into the interrogation room.

199
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,800
 And they're like, "Why were you cutting the power lines?"

200
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
 And he's like, "Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you guys."

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,800
 This is what's going on.

202
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,000
 "I work for the U.S. government and the military."

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
 Two separate things.

204
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
 They're totally unrelated.

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,920
 And they're like, "That's kind of weird.

206
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,520
 Never split your class."

207
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
 And he's like, "I know, I know.

208
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
 Don't split your class."

209
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,840
 But I'm working for the U.S. government and the military.

210
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,800
 And they're like, "Okay, well, now we know who you're working for.

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,600
 Do you have any ID?"

212
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,680
 And he's like, "Hey, let me just continue my insane story."

213
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,200
 And they're like, "Okay, that's what we figured."

214
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
 He goes, "Listen, Russia, you know what Russia is, right?

215
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
 You're Russia.

216
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,360
 Big, big country to the East."

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,200
 They have a group called the KGB, which is no longer around,

218
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,960
 by the way, KGB is no longer around.

219
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,160
 They change it to like F-something, F-G-R or something like that.

220
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,520
 Anyways, he's like KGB, because I don't know the new name.

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
 KGB is still around in Russia.

222
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,360
 And they hate America, because apparently it's 1969.

223
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,360
 And the KGB have decided that they are going to start poisoning us beautiful Americans.

224
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,640
 They're going to poison us with nuclear toxins.

225
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,720
 Just leans back in his chair, puts his hands behind his head.

226
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,320
 How's your like, okay, that doesn't explain why you're kind of the power lines.

227
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,800
 He's like, "Oh, oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't explain the power lines."

228
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,480
 The KGB wants to poison America with nuclear toxins.

229
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,280
 And they're using the power lines to pump them into our houses.

230
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,240
 So I was saving America.

231
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,400
 I am a hero, saving America by cutting these power lines.

232
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
 Cops go, "That's insane."

233
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
 And the guy goes, "No, no, no, no, that's not insane.

234
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
 Wait till I tell you the next part."

235
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
 So this guy who was cutting power lines to prevent all of us,

236
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,200
 a true American hero, I might have, to prevent all of us from dying of nuclear toxins,

237
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,400
 said that he was told to do this.

238
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:42,880
 His handler for the US military/US government was the one, the only, the beautiful Ariana Grande.

239
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,440
 Yes, Ariana Grande, singer, television star, government agent.

240
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,520
 She was apparently telling the man that this whole plan, the KGB was trying to do this.

241
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,400
 Now, the reason why I want to highlight the story, one, because it's funny,

242
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,480
 and I like talking about Ariana Grande, but two, I wonder, like, I've never gone insane.

243
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,880
 And I've always wondered what that's like.

244
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
 Was he literally like listening to an Ariana Grande song?

245
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,840
 It's like, "Thank you, next.

246
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,280
 Thank you, the KGB is trying to poison everybody."

247
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,040
 And like, does the voice change?

248
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,440
 And he's like driving down his car and he's like grooving all of a sudden.

249
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,040
 He hears a voice.

250
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,960
 Did it speak in her voice?

251
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,080
 Was it Ariana Grande to be like, "Hey, you might know me from Sam and Kat,

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,640
 but actually I'm a government official and you need to cut the power."

253
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,360
 Like, how did the delusion, I get that people have delusions.

254
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
 But I'm wondering like how the delusion presented itself.

255
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,440
 Did she walk in his door and she's like, "Oh my god, you gotta help me."

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,160
 And or was it like an audio hallucination?

257
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,680
 Did he was watching a sexy music video with Ariana Grande dancing around?

258
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
 All of a sudden like a PowerPoint presentation showed up and she stops the video.

259
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
 All the dancers are standing there just watching her point in a pie chart of nuclear toxins.

260
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,560
 Like how did it present itself?

261
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,040
 That's what I am always more intrigued about delusions like that.

262
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,000
 But was he sitting there eating Cheerios and all of a sudden Ariana Grande was like dancing around in his head?

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
 Or did he see a music video?

264
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
 I just find that fascinating.

265
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,320
 And why Ariana Grande?

266
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,920
 But to be fair, he may be right.

267
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,960
 They could be pumping nuclear toxins in through our power lines and Ariana Grande could be.

268
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,480
 She could be Q.

269
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,880
 She could be a government agent because no one would suspect her.

270
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,400
 She would be the perfect spy.

271
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,560
 She travels all over the world.

272
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,120
 No one would suspect someone who's five foot three.

273
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,600
 Maybe if we all listened to Ariana Grande, we would be victorious.

274
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
 Okay, so that was terrible.

275
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,680
 The point is, is that that's super bizarre.

276
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
 And he's being charged with malicious mischief.

277
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,960
 Great name for a band.

278
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,600
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

279
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
 That was a little shorty.

280
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,120
 Day just like Ariana Grande is a little shorty.

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
 She's pretty hot.

282
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
 But that all being said, let's go to move on to our next story.

283
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,800
 Now our next story was actually a recommendation that I had stumbled across.

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
 I was looking for something else and I found this.

285
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,680
 I was going through YouTube, I was looking to see if someone had recommended a particular story.

286
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,840
 Now a lot of people have sent me in recommendations and I've never covered them.

287
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,440
 And it's not that I thought the idea was stupid.

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
 It's I haven't gotten around to it yet.

289
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,640
 If you sent me something like eight months ago, a year ago, and I haven't covered it yet.

290
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,000
 It's not because I was like, "That sucks."

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
 A lot of time it's just that I notate it and file it away.

292
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,080
 And then when I'm going through stuff, I'll find it.

293
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,120
 And that's what happened with this one.

294
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
 This one I actually didn't even notate it.

295
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,760
 It was just sitting in my YouTube comments.

296
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
 This is from Mercia.

297
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,800
 Mercia on YouTube.

298
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,840
 So been a long time, but here we go.

299
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,600
 The year is 1944.

300
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,920
 World War II is winding down.

301
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,160
 And we are smack dab in Romania.

302
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,120
 We're in Romania.

303
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,320
 World War II, planes flying overhead, bombs are dropping.

304
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,520
 Not a great place.

305
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,400
 I'm sure it's a lovely place, but not a good place to be.

306
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,000
 You don't want to be anywhere in Europe or Hawaii during World War II.

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 So it's World War II is winding down.

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,120
 We're in Romania.

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,480
 It's not it's not a tourist destination at this point.

310
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,400
 We're specifically in the city of Bucharest, 1944.

311
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,360
 We're walking down the street and we hear a "chaa."

312
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
 "Chaa."

313
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,240
 Storm breaks water.

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
 You don't understand how storms work?

315
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
 Rain comes out of clouds.

316
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,480
 It's hitting the ground.

317
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
 We're made of sugar.

318
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
 We can't be out in the rain.

319
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
 So we're kind of hiding huddled underneath a storefront awning.

320
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,520
 It's late at night.

321
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,160
 And we see a figure kind of walking through the streets.

322
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,520
 And we watch this guy walk.

323
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,400
 We actually probably should do something, but we're not going to.

324
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,800
 We can't.

325
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
 We're time travelers.

326
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,840
 We're watching this guy walk and we see him stop by a basement window.

327
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
 So you have a house.

328
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,080
 And you have a little window.

329
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,480
 You know every how, every, the law is every room has to have a window for carbon monoxide poisoning.

330
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,080
 Because for a while there I was thinking about building an underground facility.

331
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,280
 Like could I have a house completely underground and legally no.

332
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,840
 You have to have a window in every home.

333
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,240
 I know they have like those underground bunkers, but you have to have all these generators and

334
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,320
 stuff for air filtration and things like that.

335
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
 But you can't live in them.

336
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,640
 Like you can't build, apparently, you can't build an underground bunker and then go live in said

337
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,040
 bunker.

338
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,680
 There has to be, well you can, but the cops, you can get arrested for it or they'll condemn the place.

339
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,320
 You have to have a window in every room that can be open for carbon monoxide poisoning.

340
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
 So these, you have these basement apartments in Romania in Bucharest.

341
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,480
 And there's a basement window there.

342
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,960
 And this guy is walking through the storm and he comes to a basement window and he looks

343
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,160
 down, he gets down on all fours and he opens it up.

344
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,760
 He slithers inside like a rat crawling into a sewer.

345
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,520
 And it's, we actually probably should, okay in this version we run and we chase him off.

346
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,280
 Okay, that'll put us in a better mood that we actually try something.

347
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,840
 But, so in this version we run and we chase him off from this particular victim.

348
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,800
 But in reality, four women in 1944, this guy slithered in through their basement window,

349
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
 bashed him up with a blunt object, murdered them in their beds.

350
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
 Then you crawl back out of the basement and run down the street.

351
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,240
 Now the cops would come out to these murders and they'd be like, well this is kind of weird

352
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,520
 because, and I didn't know this was a thing, but he was wearing size 42 shoes in Europe,

353
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,840
 which is the US equivalent of a size eight, which is supposedly, I guess it's not a common

354
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 shoe size.

355
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,080
 It's a shorter, it's a smaller foot.

356
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,640
 So that was one of their big clues.

357
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,560
 They were like, well we must be looking for a man who's not particularly large because

358
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,160
 he has such a tiny foot.

359
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,360
 But he struck four times, killed four women, and then just disappeared and he was never caught.

360
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
 Police were just scratching their head.

361
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
 They were like, oh that's weird.

362
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
 We have, there's more than weird, it's brutal crime that happens four times.

363
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,680
 So they go, happens during a storm, man with a small foot, four women killed, and then never

364
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,080
 caught.

365
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,000
 And the war ends and then you have the 50s, and I don't know what was going on,

366
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,760
 Romania the 50s, hippies, no that was even later.

367
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,440
 And anyways, the stuff was normal, bombs weren't dropping anymore,

368
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,200
 everything kind of got back to normal.

369
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,520
 Now we're in the year 1970, 26 years later.

370
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,080
 My city of Bucharest is at peace.

371
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,640
 And then there's a violent snowstorm.

372
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:35,520
 Snow, snow everywhere, winter wonderland, I can get out of my way.

373
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,240
 We're walking down a snowy street, never mind no, no we're not, we're not anywhere near

374
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
 these next series of events, because these are so horrible.

375
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,440
 Snowstorm, women's walking on the street, a waitress is leaving her work to walk home,

376
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,080
 guy walks up behind her, hits her over the back of the head.

377
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,960
 Later, huge rainstorm.

378
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,520
 Waitress walking on the street, holding her jacket closer as she's so cold,

379
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,400
 getting just drenched, trying to make it home.

380
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,760
 Guy walks up behind her, hits her over the back of the head,

381
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,600
 rapes her, storm raging all around them.

382
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,280
 Fog, deep fog just settles into the city.

383
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,840
 Everyone's heard about these attacks by now.

384
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,680
 Young women walking home, looking over their shoulder.

385
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
 Someone jumps out of the darkness, stabs them.

386
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,080
 This was going on and on.

387
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,320
 And it got to the point where women said, we're not going out unless we are in groups,

388
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,080
 or there are men with us.

389
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,960
 The police could not catch who was doing this, but they did establish a pattern,

390
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,400
 it happened during storms.

391
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,600
 But he still found victims.

392
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,520
 And what really set the city off is that a woman was walking down the street,

393
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,960
 and someone came up behind her and attacked her, and began stabbing her in the back.

394
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,760
 And as she was pressed against the wall,

395
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:06,640
 she felt his mouth on one of her stab wounds, sucking the blood out of her back.

396
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,720
 Now, that assault was stopped, he ran away.

397
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,840
 But now you have Romania in fear of a vampire.

398
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,200
 An old creature of a legend from Romania.

399
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,560
 There's a man walking down the street, attacking women, drinking their blood,

400
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,200
 murdering them.

401
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,600
 Next morning, bus driver sees a woman laying on the side of the road, calls the cops,

402
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,280
 they get there, cordon off the scene, doing their investigation.

403
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
 They go to move the body, turn it over.

404
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,880
 Parts of the body are bitten.

405
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,040
 Next time they go to the crime scene, move the body.

406
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,880
 Parts of the body are bitten off and missing.

407
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,440
 So the cops are like, "This guy's eating these people in the middle of the street,

408
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,280
 in the middle of the night, with no one can see him.

409
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,400
 He's just eating, biting pieces off of them, and we can't find him."

410
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:06,720
 They had a victim die on Vulture Street, and it had all the hallmarks of this person,

411
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,640
 who at this point was being called the Vampire of Bucharest, the Wolfman.

412
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 But people were afraid that a monster of old, a monster of legend, was stalking the streets.

413
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,040
 When they would take these women back, we had the big one on Vulture Street,

414
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,200
 you take these women back to the corner office, they're doing an investigation,

415
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 they would find post-mortem rape.

416
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
 So now he's an acrophiliac as well.

417
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,240
 And the cops just don't know how to catch this guy.

418
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
 He is somehow still able to pick these women out, even though you have groups of people,

419
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,560
 you have people being escorted home, like a werewolf, like a beast,

420
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,280
 is able to spot the prey in its most vulnerable state and get it.

421
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,000
 Cops say, "We're done."

422
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
 It's 1971 now.

423
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,520
 There have been 12 major attacks.

424
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,040
 Quite a few minor assaults, quite a few things where he was being chased off,

425
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,760
 but there was 12, 12 of those in total at this point.

426
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,640
 It's 1971.

427
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,360
 The cops initiate Operation Vulture.

428
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,240
 They say, "Let's get the crew together.

429
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,400
 We're taking this monster out."

430
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,680
 You had 6,000 law enforcement officers from all over the country to send upon Bucharest.

431
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,400
 The police got bartenders.

432
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,160
 Not to serve them drinks, they got bartenders to help them find this person.

433
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
 Bus drivers, taxi drivers, hotel employees.

434
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,280
 Basically, everyone who could be was in a sense deputized.

435
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
 You are going to help us stop this guy.

436
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
 This is Operation Vulture because she died.

437
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
 This one woman died on Vulture Street.

438
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,160
 Three women have been murdered at this point and then nine very serious assaults and rapes.

439
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,280
 Also involved in the search was the Securitate, which is Romania's secret police.

440
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,640
 At that point, you want to be caught by the regular cops, maybe a hotel employee,

441
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,680
 because those dudes, you will just disappear and they'll be like,

442
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,480
 "Well, we never found him and he's being tortured to this day."

443
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,560
 But you have the Securitate, I think that's how you pronounce it, on the scene as well.

444
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,040
 Another woman is killed while you have 6,000 law enforcement officers and the city looking for him.

445
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,840
 But that is when they get their first clue after all this time.

446
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,200
 Now, during Operation Vulture, over 2,500 people were arrested, looked at, interrogated,

447
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,920
 and then let go.

448
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,440
 Couldn't find this guy, but this is where they found the clue.

449
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,160
 He murders this woman doing the investigation.

450
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,520
 When they roll her body over, there's a sheet of paper underneath her,

451
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,440
 covered in blood.

452
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
 But there's one part of the paper that isn't covered in blood.

453
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,840
 It's the letterhead for where the piece of paper came from.

454
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,360
 It says, "Bukarest Student Hospital."

455
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
 Cops are all looking at each other.

456
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,800
 This is the very first break they've gotten the case.

457
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:03,040
 Now, they know that when they catch the guy from all the bite marks, they can identify him.

458
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,160
 There was enough people who saw him and failed assaults,

459
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,320
 because a couple of times he was assaulting someone, someone would be like,

460
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
 "Hey, get out of here," and he would take off.

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
 Enough people saw him during the assaults.

462
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,960
 They thought, "If we can get this guy in front of a police lineup, we can identify him."

463
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,440
 We could definitely match his teeth up to all these bite marks he's left on all these women.

464
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,400
 But out of this huge city, we need to find him first.

465
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
 This is the first clue, so they find this sheet of paper.

466
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,240
 It says, "Bukarest Student Hospital."

467
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,680
 They are able to track that letterhead to a particular doctor at the Student Hospital,

468
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,720
 and he gives them a list of 83 students that he had recently seen.

469
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,840
 Out of those 83, 15 of them had not turned in their medical paperwork to the school yet.

470
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
 So you'd go to the hospital, you'd get treated by a doctor,

471
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,920
 you'd have to take the paperwork back to the school.

472
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,160
 Out of the 83 this particular doctor had treated,

473
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,400
 15 of them had not turned in their paperwork yet.

474
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,080
 So that means, this is what I love about police work.

475
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,720
 I just love the investigation side of it.

476
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
 That's what I enjoy most about these true crime stories.

477
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,720
 They go, "It has to be one of these 15 kids."

478
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
 Everyone else has already turned in their paperwork.

479
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,440
 So they watch each of those 15 kids, they put them under investigation.

480
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,880
 And one of them, they say, "Let's go to his dorm.

481
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
 He's acting a little suspicious."

482
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,600
 So the police just go, "No, search warrants. It's not America."

483
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,160
 Police go into his dorm, start writing,

484
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,920
 and actually maybe they wouldn't even need one,

485
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,440
 because that's technically college property.

486
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
 But they go into the dorm, they start rifling through his stuff.

487
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
 Nothing, they're not finding anything suspicious.

488
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,760
 But as the police are there, tearing his place up,

489
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,680
 tearing down his Pink Floyd posters, knocking over his lava lamp,

490
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,720
 a young man walks through the door named Ion Remeru.

491
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,200
 And I'm most likely pronouncing that wrong.

492
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,800
 But Ion Remeru walks through the door of his college dorm.

493
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,960
 He has a backpack on, and the cops are like,

494
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,840
 "Let me see your backpack."

495
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
 Shows him the backpack.

496
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,920
 They find an axe and a knife.

497
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,320
 Cuff him, take him downtown.

498
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,560
 Ion Remeru grew up in Romania.

499
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,600
 He had, his father, Floria, was a pretty abusive man, apparently.

500
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,680
 Kind of had a weak mom, strong father.

501
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,080
 Fairly abusive, physically abusive to the mom.

502
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,240
 He was listed as a good student.

503
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
 Like he had high marks in his classes,

504
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,600
 but he was also considered semi-literate.

505
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
 So he had to work harder to do everything.

506
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,040
 Teachers thought he was a good student overall.

507
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,200
 Other peers thought he was a big old weirdo.

508
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
 When he was at the dorm, his roommates didn't even want to be near him.

509
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,240
 They would go anywhere to avoid hanging out with Ion.

510
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,720
 He was just involved in a lot of weird stuff.

511
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,360
 He was just an odd person to be around.

512
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
 So the cops bring him down there.

513
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,240
 Now that they have a suspect, they put him in police lineups.

514
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,440
 People go, "Women go, that's him. That's the guy."

515
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,280
 Teeth match up at one point.

516
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,440
 One of the victims pulled some hair out of his head.

517
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,400
 Thank God, I love it.

518
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
 One victim see that, pulled some hair out of his head.

519
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,880
 They were able to match the hair that,

520
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,440
 the victim had versus the hair that was still on his head.

521
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,920
 Oh, and I should say, when Operation Vulture happened,

522
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,040
 he had that one or the murder.

523
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,640
 And then three more attempted murders and rapes

524
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,440
 before they finally were able to track him down.

525
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,720
 Like they had the letter,

526
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,640
 but he still attacked four more times

527
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,760
 and killed one more woman

528
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,160
 even after they were able to get ahold of that letter.

529
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,800
 So anyways, he's now being interrogated.

530
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 He says he's crazy.

531
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,920
 He's insane.

532
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,400
 He confesses to these crimes.

533
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
 A lot of stuff comes out.

534
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,560
 One of the things is that Floria, his father,

535
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,600
 would actually try to stop him.

536
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,160
 Knew he was killing these women and be like,

537
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,200
 "Give me your axe, son.

538
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,720
 You big old piece of garbage.

539
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
 Give me that axe. Give me that hammer.

540
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,520
 You can't be doing this."

541
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
 And then he would give him back to his son.

542
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,920
 He'd be like, "Ah, here you go.

543
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,760
 I'm sorry. Come here, son.

544
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,800
 Now you can do what you want.

545
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,240
 You're a big boy. Give them the stuff."

546
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
 So that was coming out.

547
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
 Floria was like, "No, no, no, that's not true."

548
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,760
 The son was saying that my father,

549
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,520
 it was all because of him.

550
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,400
 He's the one who made me do this.

551
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
 And the cops are just like,

552
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,280
 "That might be true, but the point of the matter is,

553
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
 you were the one murdering these people."

554
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,800
 And he's like, "Can't help it. I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

555
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,480
 Somebody stop me, literally,

556
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,520
 because I'm a serial killer."

557
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,040
 And they're like, "Oh, great."

558
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,880
 So they get him diagnosed

559
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
 to bring in all these psychiatrists and stuff like that.

560
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,480
 One of the diagnosis was clinical lycanthropy,

561
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,800
 which is the belief that you are turning into an animal.

562
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 You're not physically turning into a monster,

563
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,040
 but you believe you're turning into a monster,

564
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,800
 so you do monstrous things,

565
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,240
 and you don't know the difference between right and wrong

566
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,040
 and things like that.

567
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,080
 But that diagnosis came later.

568
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,920
 Earlier, he was found sane.

569
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,960
 They go, "He totally knew what he was doing was wrong.

570
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,840
 He wasn't insane."

571
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,440
 And at that point, when he found out

572
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,080
 that he was not going to be able to plead insanity,

573
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
 his demeanor completely changed,

574
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,080
 and he recanted all of his confessions.

575
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,440
 And he says, "I didn't do any of it.

576
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
 My dad had nothing to do with it,

577
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,920
 but it was too late."

578
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,520
 He already confessed all these crimes.

579
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,680
 They find him guilty and sentence him to death.

580
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,920
 And they say, "As he's being led out of the truck into the fire,

581
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
 there's a firing squad over there.

582
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,240
 You have three men going to shoot him to death,

583
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,480
 and they have to drag him into..."

584
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
 Did you know last meals are normally drugged?

585
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,920
 That's what I've heard.

586
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,800
 I don't know how true that is,

587
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 but there's a urban legend.

588
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,880
 I would be surprised if it's not true

589
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,200
 that your last meal has a sedative in it,

590
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
 or they will just give you a sedative,

591
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,480
 but that's why people just kind of calmly walk into the execution chamber.

592
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,320
 Because otherwise you'd be fighting and thrashing the whole way.

593
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,880
 But yeah, usually the last meal has a sedative in it

594
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
 that just kind of calms you down.

595
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,040
 So that didn't happen here.

596
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,280
 He was led into the execution room,

597
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,400
 and he was flipping out.

598
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,080
 He fought the whole way,

599
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,520
 and he was saying stuff like,

600
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,560
 "Call my father so he can see what's happening to me.

601
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,320
 Make him come.

602
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,920
 He's the only guilty one."

603
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,720
 And they're like dragging him to this pole,

604
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,920
 that they're going to tie him to.

605
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
 And he's begging to live.

606
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,280
 Now again, it's funny,

607
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,560
 because I was telling somebody this,

608
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,440
 I was telling Deb,

609
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
 my friends Deb and Julie about this story.

610
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,840
 They listened to the podcast.

611
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,320
 They got a preview because I was hanging out with them.

612
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
 And they go, "Oh, well maybe his dad has something to do with that."

613
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,600
 And I said, "The thing is, is like, his teeth were at the crime scene."

614
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
 Whether or not his dad was directing him or helping him,

615
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,600
 he was the one doing it

616
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
 because they matched his hair and his teeth to these women.

617
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,600
 But he's blaming his dad.

618
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,880
 They tie him to the pole.

619
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,560
 And he's running around the pole now,

620
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,840
 like a Looney Tune character,

621
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,720
 but he can't leave.

622
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
 And the guys are trying to take aim at him.

623
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,680
 And he's 23,

624
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,960
 I guess I should have mentioned that earlier.

625
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,800
 He's a 23 year old college student.

626
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,320
 He's running around this pole,

627
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,560
 and the guys are just trying to get a good shot at him,

628
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,360
 and he's running.

629
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,400
 And then finally they go,

630
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,480
 "What are we going to do?"

631
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,920
 So they shot him in the back.

632
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
 They just, he had their back to him

633
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,360
 because he was kept spinning around.

634
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,760
 And they just shot him a bunch of times and killed him.

635
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,560
 Which is a bad move.

636
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,240
 Generally, if you do a fire squad,

637
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,360
 they'll shoot you right in the heart.

638
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,320
 It'll be over pretty quickly,

639
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,880
 but he's running around like Wiley Coyote.

640
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,440
 So that's all folks,

641
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
 and they buried him in an unmarked grave.

642
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,960
 But actually that's not that's all folks.

643
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,080
 Because then, one year after he was executed,

644
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,000
 Floria was on a train going through Romania.

645
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,280
 Falls out.

646
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,840
 And is crushed by the train.

647
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,400
 And almost immediately,

648
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,880
 the rumors went out.

649
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,600
 He was assassinated by the secret police.

650
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,200
 They take his body to a medical examiner.

651
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,280
 Gotta figure out what's going on, right?

652
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
 It's a proper procedure.

653
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,360
 And it was there that they realized

654
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,640
 that this man, Floria Rimaru, had size eight feet.

655
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,160
 So the working theory is this.

656
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,520
 His father was a serial killer in 1944.

657
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
 Killed those four women.

658
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,400
 And then as far as anyone knows, went dormant all that time.

659
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,880
 And the killings ended in 1944.

660
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
 His son was born in 1945.

661
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,040
 And then when his son is 23, four women are killed,

662
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,560
 12 are assaulted, and then there was other minor crimes.

663
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,480
 The theory was that Floria was the original serial killer,

664
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,200
 and he either taught his son to kill women,

665
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
 like inspired him to do that,

666
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,000
 or it was some sort of defective gene that was passed on.

667
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,840
 And that he was not necessarily physically assisting

668
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,800
 his son in the murders,

669
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,120
 but may have been a guiding hand in them.

670
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
 Maybe just a little bit of inspiration.

671
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
 Maybe actually directing him to go do these things.

672
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,920
 And that the secret police knew

673
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,000
 that they probably couldn't really prove it.

674
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,600
 But they also knew that when you need to kill a vampire,

675
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
 you also have to kill its sire.

676
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,960
 When Ion was operating in the city of Bucharest,

677
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
 he had that city in fear.

678
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,040
 But it wasn't just fear of a man.

679
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,360
 It was fear of a myth.

680
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,800
 When the streets are empty and the elements keep everyone inside,

681
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,880
 except for a lone woman trying to get home.

682
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,480
 When she is assaulted, murdered, eaten,

683
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,440
 it's one of those times that even a rational person would think.

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,160
 Maybe there is a werewolf out there.

685
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,040
 They may not say it out loud.

686
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,480
 They may not admit it in public.

687
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,560
 But I'm sure a lot of people,

688
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,040
 a lot of smart, learned, skeptical people

689
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,000
 on those stormy nights in Bucharest slept with the light on,

690
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,160
 afraid that a monster that haunted their childhood dreams

691
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,640
 was truly out there

692
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
 in the dark cold storm.
