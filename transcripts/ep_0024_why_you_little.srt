1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 is The Simpsons based on a true story

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,500
 and creepy, crawly,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 immortal creatures today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,700
 Hey everyone, this is Jason Carpenter back with another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,200
 Hope you're having a great day. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,760
 Oh, the things I do for you. The things

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,600
 I do for my friends. I just recorded an entire episode

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,120
 and it sucked. So I'm starting a whole new episode. I'm trashing one of the

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,560
 stories. One thing I've realized is that I build this podcast as

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,640
 paranormal conspiracy and true crime. It is

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,720
 very, very depressing to talk about true crime

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,440
 in this type of podcast. I think, you know, I've done true crime stories

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
 and involved like the guy who thought the meth addict who thought the car in

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,200
 front of him was a spaceship.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,040
 And you know, you can have funny true crime stories. I just did a

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,360
 very depressing story about Stephen McDaniel. If you don't know who he is, I'm

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,800
 going to include the links below. It's a fascinating story.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,880
 What's the most fascinating part about it is, is that

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,960
 he kills this young woman and the next day he's being interviewed by the media

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,480
 and he thinks he's gone away with it because he dumped her torso in the dumpster

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,840
 and the garbage crew

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,520
 had come and taken it away. So he's saying, "Oh yeah, we were best friends and I

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,640
 haven't seen her in a while and I'm really concerned."

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,720
 And as they're doing the interview, the police discovered the torso in the

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,320
 dumpster.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,800
 The garbage crew was late. He had planned it so by the time that they noticed she

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,520
 was missing,

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,400
 the body would be in the dump. They'd have a really hard time finding it. The cops

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,440
 find the torso

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,600
 in the garbage can in the dumpster and the reporter says,

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,840
 "So do you think that's her body in the garbage can?" and he just completely

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
 shuts down

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,720
 because now he realizes his quote-unquote master plan has failed.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,440
 That video is available on YouTube. I'll post the link.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,880
 There's probably about three hours of his confession with the police.

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,560
 I'll post all those links. It's a very fascinating story because we kind of get to see

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,760
 his story break and we kind of get to see it in real time.

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,160
 However, it's a hard...it was depressing and as I was

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,960
 telling that story, I was getting depressed

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,840
 and I'm thinking there's this hesitancy to my voice as I'm talking about it and

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,600
 I'm thinking I'm spending way too much time on a subject that is incredibly

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,360
 depressing

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,840
 and there's really no payoff.

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,280
 There was really no payoff to the story. So I think we're gonna continue...I

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,080
 love reading True Crime but I think there's a time and a place and a

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,960
 content-wise for it. So if you're a fan of True Crime, don't necessarily abandon the

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
 podcast now. I just need to...

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'd like to find True Crime that has some element of the paranormal

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,480
 or conspiracy or is funny or weird

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,000
 in a goofy way. You know, I was thinking about doing a story about a guy who

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
 smoked so much skunk weed. He chopped his penis off and stabbed his mom.

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
 It's really hard to crack a joke in a podcast like that.

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,600
 He did get his penis sewn back on. I mean, I guess the jokes are fairly easy but I mean

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
 the mother lived as well but you know

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,220
 I kind of got to find the right format for it. So I'm recording the episode all over again.

57
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,080
 Also, the Simpsons story was a little dark as well but we're gonna continue to

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
 do the Simpsons story.

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,320
 Now, I will throw this out for True Crime. I love watching

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,160
 daytime court shows. I don't watch a lot of television.

61
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,640
 Generally, the only time my television doesn't even have an antenna hooked up on it right now.

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,240
 I have to say the speed that I'm talking at right now, that original podcast,

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,920
 the original episode, oh my god, it was like watching a mummy

64
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,280
 walk down a hallway. It was very, very plodding.

65
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,080
 And it's like you're at the end of the hallway and you don't want the mummy to

66
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,600
 get you but at the same time you just kind of want something to happen.

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,280
 So, yeah.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,360
 Anyways, I love watching daytime court shows and usually I only watch it when I'm home sick

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,680
 or at work. And it's not, sometimes it's funny

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,320
 to kind of watch, there's kind of a basic human drama involved in those shows.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,720
 It's kind of interesting to watch. You know, two people have this minor thing and it becomes this big issue

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,880
 and you can tell the judge is like, "Oh, I'd rather be adjudicating a, you know, a murder trial or

73
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,640
 something like that."

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,160
 Or anything other than these two losers. The thing I love most

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
 about watching court shows is there is always,

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,000
 always standing behind the plaintiff or the defendant or if I'm lucky, both.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,400
 There was always the most beautiful woman

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 sitting back there. Now, a lot of these shows are shot in LA

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,200
 and I'm sure that if you're an up-and-coming actress or

80
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,400
 you just wanted to kill an afternoon, "Hey, let's go watch the people's court. Let's go be in the audience

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,280
 the people court."

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,640
 They get, oh, so beautiful. Every single time.

83
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,400
 And it's like I'm watching the show and I'm like, "Oh, what?

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,840
 They're gonna show that blonde again, sitting behind the plaintiff? Oh, yep, there she is. Okay."

85
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,200
 Now, there was that really cute redhead sitting behind the defendant. Oh, yeah, I want to hear more of the defendant.

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,360
 Beautiful. Beautiful woman. This is the second day in a row where I've had to talk about beautiful

87
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,840
 women during the podcast. Maybe it'll be a theme for this week. Maybe this week.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,560
 Maybe this will be the week of beautiful women. But anyways,

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,640
 that being said, oh, and also I remember once

90
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 I was, when I was living in Sacramento, I got a phone call on my answering machine. It was a wrong number.

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,800
 But it was actually a phone call from the people's court. Or a show like that. It was one of the, I think it was

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 people's court, but it could have been Judge Judy or something like that. And it was like, "Hey, so and so, the name was wrong."

93
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,480
 They said, "So we saw that you have a small claims court.

94
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,200
 We see that you have a case in the small claims court. I'm a representative from

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,960
 this court show. We would like you and the

96
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,080
 defendant to come onto our court show and what happens is that

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
 there's a $5,000 pot in the show.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,560
 There's a $5,000 pot. If you win your case,

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,960
 like let's say I'm suing somebody for $2,000,

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,480
 I get $2,000 of that pot. And I don't think they get anything.

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,480
 That's how that works. And they may get like a smaller percentage of it or something like that.

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,640
 So basically it gives them a reason to go on because the defendant,

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,840
 they don't lose any money if they lose that case. The show pays for them.

104
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,840
 And that's why a lot of times you'll see people sue for the full amount of $5,000.

105
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,840
 And the judge will be like, "Oh, that's ridiculous." But usually there's a limit to it.

106
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 But let's say I'm an auto mechanic and I've charged you $800 and you,

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,840
 I try to get you on my show. It's a win-win really for both of us because you're not losing any money

108
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,880
 at all if you're the defendant. And I think they do

109
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,880
 just, they both get a chunk of it.

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
 But obviously it gives you, you want to win one to prove yourself right and two you get that money.

111
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,880
 And the defendant has a reason to go on because, you know, what do they have to lose?

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
 And they both end up looking like idiots on television. You wonder why people would go on this show

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
 and make themselves look completely like unreliable citizens.

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,880
 And that's why. Because there's really, there's, they're not losing anything because of it.

115
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,880
 But I always thought that was interesting.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,880
 Is The Simpsons based on a true story? The answer may surprise you.

117
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
 Now, no, it's not. So that probably doesn't surprise you.

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 It's even crazier than that. The Simpsons is not based on a true story.

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,880
 The Simpsons, the animated television show that's lasted 30 years featuring

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,880
 Homer, Bart, Maggie, Margin, Lisa, is actually a reality show.

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,880
 This is a theory that's popped up fairly recently as far as conspiracies go.

122
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,880
 And it popped up on a fictional board, a fictional website where people were writing stories about

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,880
 Jeff the Killer or Slender Man or, you know, theories about Ed and Eddie.

124
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
 It's just that stupid cartoon and they're in a coma or whatever.

125
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,880
 So it's kind of like this theory board. It's kind of, they, they, they, they take existing media

126
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,880
 and come up with a fictional story off of it. So you're thinking, Jason,

127
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,880
 why are you wasting my time on a conspiracy podcast talking about something that you

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,880
 yourself just said is on a fictional board? Well, hypothetical listener, here's why.

129
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 Slender Man started off on a fictional board. The origin of Slender Man can be traced back

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,880
 to one individual on a particular board I think was something awful.

131
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,880
 It was a Photoshop contest. And then we have six years later, two young women trying to kill

132
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,880
 a third woman to invoke Slender Man to take them to her mansion, take them to his mansion.

133
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,880
 So just because it starts off fictional doesn't mean that people always assume that it's fictional.

134
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,880
 Madness, madness is contagious. I think the person who wrote this probably intended it to be fictional,

135
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:48,880
 but it's popping up on conspiracy lists and people are starting to look into it and some people are starting to believe it.

136
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,880
 So what the theory is, and I know you're thinking, Jason, that's ridiculous.

137
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,880
 And it is ridiculous. But what the theory is, is that the story of the Simpsons at its core is a family,

138
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,880
 the Simpsons, and they live in Springfield and Homer works at a nuclear power plant.

139
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,880
 In the first few seasons, Homer working at the nuclear power plant was a key component of the show.

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 Now, in the later seasons, it's not such a big component, but early on it was a big component

141
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,880
 and how incompetent he was at his job. And it was a joke, you know, it was kind of like a stick at corporations

142
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 and it was a stick at greed and safety measures and nuclear power in general.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 But this theory puts forth that the Simpsons is an actual real footage of a town in America called Springfield

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,880
 where there was an actual huge nuclear disaster, a huge meltdown of this nuclear power plant.

145
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 And to cover it up, what the government did, they got Fox to send a camera crew out to the Springfield

146
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,880
 to record these people, to record these events so they could completely cover it up.

147
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,880
 If anyone ever asked, hey, what ever happened to that town Springfield that had that nuclear power plant?

148
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,880
 They could go, oh, yeah, no, that's a cartoon. What are you talking about?

149
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,880
 People are like, no, no, I remember, you know, 80 miles away there was a nuclear power plant

150
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 and they're like, no, no, no, it's a cartoon. So again, when I was talking about how to create a conspiracy,

151
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,880
 this has a few of those elements. One, it has time plus distance.

152
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 They're saying it's a city that's been wiped off the map.

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,880
 They're saying that the conspiracy started back in the 80s, which isn't that far back, but it's fairly far back.

154
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,880
 And it involves a group that we already don't trust, which is the government.

155
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,880
 So the idea is that this town has this horrible nuclear meltdown. People turn yellow and start to mutate.

156
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 And this film crew from Fox shows up and begins recording them, begins editing the footage up to tell the story.

157
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,880
 This only includes the first few seasons, maybe the first four or five seasons of the show.

158
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,880
 It doesn't go on to include what's happening today, because the theory is that, let's say, the fifth season

159
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 is actually the first film crew, the first time the film crew got out there, was recording these events.

160
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 And then as we go farther back, so seasons four, threes, and three, two, and one, and then the Tracy Ollman short films,

161
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,880
 the animation gets worse and worse and worse. And they're saying, no, the person who wrote this, it's not getting worse.

162
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,880
 Those are the people mutating down. That's why they're starting to look more and more ragged,

163
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,880
 because the radiation is actually having an effect on their bodies until eventually they just, they don't look human at all.

164
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,880
 The reason why they don't age in that time period of, you know, four seasons, and it will extend it to six seasons, whatever it is,

165
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 but it's in the beginning there, is because the radiation, the meltdown of the plant also opened some sort of portal,

166
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,880
 some sort of time warp. That's why the kids don't get older.

167
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,880
 And the later seasons are animation. They're based on, so this really event happened,

168
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,880
 and then to help cover it up, and because Fox was making, they make like a billion dollars a year off The Simpsons,

169
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,880
 they begin animating later episodes, and somehow the characters have the same voices and whatnot.

170
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,880
 And I'm sure people could also say, oh no, no, the later seasons are also part of reality.

171
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,880
 And then you go, well, then how are they having episodes of Lady Gaga in them? And they go, aha, it's because of the time warp.

172
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 So it's kind of built in a way that they can keep excusing it.

173
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,880
 Now, the story that this theory is based on is kind of hard to read.

174
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 I've actually read it three times, which is a lot for this podcast, if you haven't been able to tell.

175
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,880
 It's kind of hard to follow, and it's just, structurally, I don't think it's the most well-written thing.

176
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,880
 I think the idea is interesting, but it's, there's some key details left out of it.

177
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,880
 But anyway, so this theory that all of this is a film crew out there,

178
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 and what we're watching when we watch The Simpsons is actually a reality show,

179
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:06,880
 and any sort of dream sequence or Halloween specials are results of the warping of space-time.

180
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,880
 So I mean, guys, there's a conspiracy theory about everything. Everything.

181
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 If you can think of it, it exists. This one in particular started off as a...

182
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,880
 Well, you know, I guess some people could argue it didn't start off as fictional.

183
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,880
 It was a real story that was put on a fictional board to, again, assist in the cover-up.

184
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 How many people believe that this is an actual conspiracy theory worldwide? I don't know, 100?

185
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,880
 Maybe? A thousand? But give it time, because people swear to God that Slender Man is real now,

186
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,880
 and they're usually younger, stuff like that. But, you know, if you have any sort of gaps in your knowledge,

187
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,880
 it's very easy for someone to come in with a conspiracy theory and go, "Hey, here you go."

188
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,880
 And you go, "Ah, I don't know enough about it, so maybe it's true."

189
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 But spoiler alert, Simpsons is not real. And you know, just a quick note in this,

190
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,880
 I'm still a fan of The Simpsons. I know a lot of people stop watching The Simpsons after Season 7 or Season 10,

191
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
 or whatever that is. I really enjoy The Simpsons.

192
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 The only show that I watch religiously is The Walking Dead. I've seen every episode. I love that show.

193
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 I watch it every week when it's on. Simpsons, I watch every couple months. I catch a new episode.

194
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 But I've watched the older seasons, up to probably Season 2. I think I've seen every episode.

195
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 Every episode. I'm a big fan of that show. Big fan of that show.

196
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,880
 It would be a little bit weird if it actually was true that it was all a real life, but it's not, so I'm not too worried about it.

197
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,880
 Now, we're going to talk about how the internet fooled me.

198
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,880
 Because I can say, "Oh, these people are so stupid for believing The Simpsons is real."

199
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 Not having enough information. So I got fooled, today, by the internet.

200
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,880
 Because on a website, and it started listing facts about spiders, and I was like, "Oh my God, these are the most amazing facts about spiders."

201
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,880
 I didn't know any of this was true. And this kind of shows how people take in information.

202
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,880
 The average person takes in information. I think everyone thinks they're smarter than they actually are.

203
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,880
 And I might have said it before on this podcast, but if you think you're smart, record yourself for 20 to 30 minutes a day, and put it online.

204
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 And listen back to it a couple days later, and you'll be like, "I'm an idiot."

205
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 Unless you're in a specialized field, and you're doing a podcast about a specialized thing,

206
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 and you just talk randomly for 30 minutes and record it, you'll realize that you're not as smart as you thought you were.

207
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,880
 And now, you know, I do have to say this, too. Like I said in the beginning of that rant, I don't know if I've said this before.

208
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 You know what my biggest fear of this podcast is? Is that I'm going to do the same episode twice.

209
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,880
 That because I'm getting up there in age, and I'm forgetting stuff, I'm afraid I'm either going to tell the same story twice,

210
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,880
 or 50 episodes from now, I'm literally going to rerecord the same episode.

211
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,880
 50 episodes from now, I'll be like, "Did you know The Simpsons is based on true life today on Dead Rabbit Radio?"

212
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 That's my fear.

213
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,880
 I have notes that I've stuff I've talked about, or stuff that I'm going to talk about,

214
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 but I'm always like, sometimes I'll be sitting there, and I'm like, "Did I already tell this story? Did I already tell this anecdote?"

215
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,880
 So if that happens, call me out on it. Email me at DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com.

216
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 But man, that would be embarrassing. But again, doing a daily podcast, talking for 20, 30 minutes a day, I'm sure it happens.

217
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,880
 Most of the people who do this have editors and things like that, but what was I talking about?

218
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,880
 Oh, spiders! So I was reading these spider facts today, and because I don't have a broad knowledge of spiders,

219
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 you're going to be like, "Jason, there's a thing called 'Broad Knowledge of Spiders' and, you know, fucking common sense."

220
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 Like, there is an issue there. Like, there's a difference. You may not know a lot about spiders either,

221
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 but once I start reading these facts off, I think you'll be like, "Jason, you're just an idiot who's probably easily fooled."

222
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,880
 And here's the thing, I'm easily fooled at first, and then I start looking into it, and I'm like, "Ah, that's not true."

223
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 I was a little disappointed. So I'm going to read some spider facts to you that I read online,

224
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,880
 and then I was like, opening all these bookmarks, and I was like, "Oh, I got to do more research on these spiders

225
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,880
 and these spiders," and then I looked into it and I realized it was all nonsense. Some of these facts are true, but most of them aren't.

226
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,880
 "Some spiders construct balloons to descend elevations and travel."

227
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 True or false?

228
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,880
 Now, I know that's true because I saw Charlotte's Web when they flew away at the end, and it was so sad.

229
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
 They're like, "Bye! Bye, Wilbur! Bye!" So sad.

230
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 So I was like, "Okay, you know, I know that's true."

231
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,880
 "It is said that most household spiders enter the home from not washing new clothing after purchase.

232
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,880
 Over 90% of clothing purchased at retail stores contain spider eggs laid during shipment."

233
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:09,880
 Hmm. Wasn't able to find any verification of that, but again, you may be thinking, "Well, Jason, that's possible.

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 I've heard that you can swallow 20 spiders in your lifetime, so maybe that's possible."

235
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 Let's see. Here's another one.

236
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,880
 Okay. Okay. So here's another one.

237
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 "Spiders can work flawlessly in a space vacuum."

238
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 Maybe.

239
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:38,880
 Now we're going to get into the ones that are just obviously not true, but I believed for a moment until I did some research.

240
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,880
 "The largest spider in history was over 8 feet long and weighed 530 pounds."

241
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 Okay, that's... that's not true.

242
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
 But I did Google that.

243
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 "The orange magma spider can resist heat up to 5300 degrees Fahrenheit."

244
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
 Now, to be fair...

245
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,880
 That's not true either. But to be fair, that one fooled me because I didn't finish reading the sentence.

246
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,880
 I just read. This is what I read in my brain. "Orange magma spider can resist heat."

247
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
 And then I just moved on to the next fact.

248
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,880
 So to be fair, if I had read 5300 degrees Fahrenheit, I would have said, "Okay, that's not true."

249
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,880
 But again, it just goes to show. I was just half reading information because I was so excited about what I was looking at.

250
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,880
 If the... if the...

251
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,880
 This was when I was like, "Really? If the hardjack spider wanted to...

252
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,880
 If the hardjack spider wanted to, it could produce enough silk to suffocate young animals and even human babies."

253
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,880
 And I was like, "Oh, copy and paste hardjack spider into Google."

254
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,880
 I don't know why I believed that for a second.

255
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,880
 A spider shooting...

256
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:06,880
 Its webbing has the same amount of force as a nuclear bomb, but it's never in an area of fissionable material.

257
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,880
 That's why they don't cause nuclear reactions.

258
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,880
 So this web... this is where I realized that I was being trolled.

259
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 Now, this information I saw around, you know, these facts, they were appearing all over the internet.

260
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 And all the sources were kind of referring to each other.

261
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,880
 All of the sources says, "You know, the hardjack spider can suffocate a baby."

262
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,880
 And then I would try to research that and it would send me to another website that had that exact same sentence.

263
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
 They're all kind of referencing each other.

264
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,880
 And so I went to this one, which is just basically spider facts and myths.

265
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
 And this is when I realized I was being trolled.

266
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
 This was when I was like, "This is completely made up."

267
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,880
 This is when I was like, "Tang it, Jason, you got... you spent 20 minutes trying to find spider info."

268
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
 And he didn't read this out.

269
00:20:50,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 "The bajillion... the bajillion spider is unique because each single spider is actually recursively composed of thousands of tiny spiders that form a social group functioning as one."

270
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 And that's when I was like, "Tang it, that's not true."

271
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 And then I scrolled up just slightly on the page that I was looking at.

272
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,880
 And it says, "The following statements made about spiders are not confirmed facts, but have been passed around the web."

273
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
 "We're leaving it up to you to decide if they are facts or myths."

274
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
 "In any case, they sure are fun to read."

275
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
 Obviously fake.

276
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:35,880
 There's one that spiders, instead of biting you, biting insects to drain them of blood, they bite them and bring the insects back to life.

277
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 And then they drain them of blood so they can eat the desiccated remains.

278
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,880
 And even that, I was like, "Really? Whoa, that's amazing. How did I not know that before?"

279
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 Because it's fake.

280
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,880
 It's easy to get fooled, and it's easy to get fooled if you want to be fooled.

281
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,880
 I like learning crazy facts.

282
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
 Easy to be fooled.

283
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 So, you know, again, I started to get suspicious when all of the websites were kind of linking to each other.

284
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,880
 But a lot of the websites that I was looking at were like, "Nope, these are spider facts. This one is actually like... these get passed around as facts."

285
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,880
 And what was really driving me nuts was I couldn't... once I realized that I'm like... I think I'm getting trolled.

286
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
 I couldn't find any actual website that says these spider facts are false.

287
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,880
 This is as close as I could get where they're like, "Eh, I may..."

288
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:27,880
 Now, they did have some interesting actual spider facts on that, saying that you're never more than 10 feet from a spider.

289
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,880
 You know, they're saying that that's technically not true, that you do... that whether or not you swallow spiders in their sleep, they said they've never...

290
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,880
 There's no proof of that. Spiders generally avoid humans, things like that.

291
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,880
 And they're also saying spiders can enter your home through sinks and drains.

292
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 They said that's... that doesn't... that's not possible through the way that drains are made nowadays and so on and so forth.

293
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
 So, it's a good site, as long as you have some sort of common sense.

294
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:01,880
 But, one more interesting spider fact is that... and this is from National Geographic.

295
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,880
 So, don't be calling it fake news.

296
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,880
 This is... this is... and I found this while I was researching this.

297
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,880
 I was trying to find out research about the spider that Bites Animals brings back to life and eats them again.

298
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
 Come on, dude.

299
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 I am honestly starting to think that that encyclopedia said they gave me all those fake facts when I was a kid.

300
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
 I think... I think it may brain damaged me.

301
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,880
 But anyway, so I was trying to find a spider that Bites Animals brings back to life to eat them again.

302
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
 So, I typed in like, "SpiderBite Resurrection."

303
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 I actually found this article on National Geographic News.

304
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
 Post the link.

305
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 In the headline, "Spider Resurrection's Take Scientists by Surprise."

306
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
 And I was like, "Yes, proof!"

307
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 It's not proof of that, but it's actually proof of something even more fascinating.

308
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,880
 These scientists wanted to figure out why certain spiders can live underwater and other spiders can.

309
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
 So, they took... took a bunch of different types of spiders, different types of species.

310
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 And there's like sea spiders and stuff like that, but these are actual like land spiders.

311
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:06,880
 So, they took some forest wolf spiders, they took some spiders from that live in saltwater marshes, and they drowned them.

312
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 They took two species of saltwater marsh spiders and a forest wolf spider, and they drowned them.

313
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,880
 They wanted to see how long it would take for them to drown.

314
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 You know, like, that's fairly cruel, but you know, science.

315
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 Took the forest... the forest spider, took 24 hours for it to drown.

316
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,880
 They put it in water, and after 24 hours, it died.

317
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,880
 Don't worry, this story has a happy ending, unless you hate spiders, then it doesn't.

318
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,880
 The two salt marsh spiders, one of them took 28 hours to die, and the other one took 36 hours to die.

319
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 The question was, is how did these spiders evolve so some of them just can live under the rainwater for the whole day,

320
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,880
 and then they climb out, but a wolf spider, or even more than a day, but the wolf spider has to stay like in trees, on top of bushes, and stuff like that.

321
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 So, anyways, they did the experiment.

322
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:02,880
 And they said, "Okay, we're going to take them out, and we're going to dry them out, and we're going to weigh them, and see, you know, how their body chemistry changed."

323
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,880
 And then, about a couple hours later, the spiders were back alive.

324
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,880
 All spiders were running around.

325
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
 And they're like, "What is going on here? These are the spiders who drowned, right?"

326
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 And then Jerry's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't bring spiders in from home. These are the spiders that we drowned."

327
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,880
 Lucas, that's the name of the other scientist.

328
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:30,880
 So, I made those names up. But anyways, actually one of them is named Julian, so it's kind of like, "Anyways, the point is that they couldn't figure it out."

329
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 And so, what the theory is now, is that they go into a coma.

330
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:43,880
 A spider eventually, if you're under water for like 18, 20 hours, the wolf spider's like, "Oh, man, if I don't get out of here in like four more hours, I'm dead.

331
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,880
 I'm just going to go into a coma." And then he basically shuts down all of his body systems and curls up and looks like he's dead.

332
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
 And then he reach in, you take him out, you drive him out, and he's like, "Oooh!"

333
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 Yawn, and he gets back up, starts walking around.

334
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 You know?

335
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 And the scientists were like, "We didn't expect that at all. We thought the experiment part of it was done.

336
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,880
 We were just doing the test, like the measuring at that point."

337
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,880
 Now, here's what's weird. So, they didn't understand that they didn't know it was possible, and now they know that spider's--

338
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 some spiders can go into a coma. And they're saying--

339
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:23,880
 And it's funny too, because you know, like when you're going to the bathroom, I don't know if women notice it, but when it doots peeing, there's like a spider in his toilet bowl, or a toilet bowl.

340
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 I always feel bad. I'm like, "Get out of there spider, get out of there." But I got a pee, and I got a flush, dude, and the spider's like just hanging out.

341
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,880
 And I'm like, "Dude, sorry, bro. I flushed the toilet."

342
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,880
 Or even more common is like, you're being in the shower, and you see like a spider like walking across the--

343
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,880
 I'm like, "Dude, I'm so sorry, man, but I gotta take a shower," and he just gets washed down the drain.

344
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,880
 I always felt bad, because you know, it's just a little Tuesday morning for that guy.

345
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,880
 He's just getting his stretch in, looking for a fly to eat.

346
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 The next thing you know, he's like just getting sucked into a drain.

347
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 Well, apparently, that's nothing to him. That's just a normal Tuesday morning.

348
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 He's just like, "Weee!" He goes into the river, you know, drives himself out, crawls into your mouth while you're sleeping.

349
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 Not my mouth, your mouth, because he's out of my house.

350
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
 I wonder how long they live in your stomach.

351
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,880
 I wonder if a spider-- I mean, if they can live in your esophagus for a while, they're just like a daddy long leg just chilling in there.

352
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,880
 I mean, I'm sure once it hits stomach acid, it's over with, but like they can hang on to the inside of your stomach lining.

353
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,880
 But anyways, that's nightmare fuel. I don't have a problem with spiders really.

354
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,880
 But anyways, of course, the article has to end with a "Dun Dun Dun" moment,

355
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,880
 because the scientist is talking about this and they're saying that the spiders can shut this off if something they didn't expect.

356
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,880
 And then the doctor, the lead researcher, Julian French, last name, said,

357
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 "There could be many other species that could do this that we do not know of yet."

358
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 Creepy.

359
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 Now, I don't know if he meant species of spiders, probably, because that's the context of the article,

360
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 but maybe there's wolves out there. Maybe if you drown the wolf and it's just like all cold and matted and you're like,

361
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,880
 "Took care of that wolf. I could have shot him, but now I just decided to hold him underwater for 20 minutes."

362
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,880
 And then you leave him there. You're like, "I'll bury him tomorrow," and he just strains his bones and comes after you.

363
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,880
 I'm sure he meant spiders, but it is amazing to think like, what if there are other animals out there that were like,

364
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,880
 "Pfft, that black bear fell in the river," and he got washed away, he's dead, and he's really just in a coma,

365
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 and he's just thinking of revenge the whole time. And then while you're sleeping, he crawls into your mouth.

366
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,880
 Well, everyone, that's going to be tonight's episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

367
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
 I'm really glad I re-recorded it, because that last episode was so depressing.

368
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,880
 I'm going to have all the links for the previous story about the true crime story and the Simpson story

369
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 and all these stupid spider facts that I actually got fooled into believing.

370
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,880
 But I had fun recording this episode. I hope you had as much fun listening to it.

371
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 That's going to be it. We're going to have another episode tomorrow.

372
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,880
 What nonsense I'm going to be talking about then. I don't have much of an idea, a little bit of an outline.

373
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,880
 It may be an episode I already recorded. I don't know.

374
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,880
 I think now that I've put that out into the universe, I probably will end up retelling a story once or twice or even more.

375
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 But you can hit me up at DeadRabbit.com. That's actually our website, DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com.

376
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
 If you want to email me, you can hit me up on Twitter @JasonOCarpenter.

377
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,880
 @JasonOCarpenter on Twitter. We have our YouTube channel, DeadRabbitRadio.

378
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,880
 If you haven't checked that out already, you can check it out. It's pretty much the same thing.

379
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 It's actually the episodes. I've clipped out some stuff and made little mini episodes of some of the more popular stories, like Michigan Blue Hell.

380
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,880
 But if you just want to listen to me on YouTube, that'd be great too. Subscribe, like, ring the bell.

381
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
 If you're listening to this on the podcast, thank you so much.

382
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 Checking the downloads out all the time really makes my day whenever a new episode is downloaded.

383
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:01,880
 Even just one download, I'm always checking it. I'm like, "Yes, someone else is listening to my rantines and my ravings in my idiocies, and I'm having fun doing it."

384
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 And like I said, I hope you're having fun listening to it. I'm rambling now because I'm an old man.

385
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 Have a great night. I will see you tomorrow.

386
