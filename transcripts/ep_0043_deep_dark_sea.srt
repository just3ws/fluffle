1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 Does Iowa have a missing person problem?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,920
 And then we take a swim in the ocean at night.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,100
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,140
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,120
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,280
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,300
 I hope you're having a great day.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,480
 I really am having a great day

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,440
 because it is 79 degrees today.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,920
 I'm recording this with my window shut

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,960
 in the middle of the day because it's 79 degrees.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,160
 Actually, bit of a spoiler.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,840
 I'm recording this episode on Thursday of the week.

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,720
 I'm recording this episode on the second of August.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,720
 So if it is swelteringly hot on Monday the sixth

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,200
 when this episode is released

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 and the world is on fire and meteorites are raining down

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
 from the sky, let me know.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,800
 And that on Thursday the second,

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,640
 Jason Carpenter was comfortable.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,360
 I normally don't pre-record episodes.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,720
 I'm pre-recording episodes now

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,600
 because I'm going to be going on vacation soon.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,160
 And I won't have a lot of time to be recording this stuff.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,560
 So I wanted to get some extra episodes out.

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,080
 So I'm hoping to only have maybe a week

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,560
 where I have no episodes.

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,920
 I'm bringing my recording gear with me

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,480
 and I have some stuff and plan for that.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,200
 But mostly it's just gonna be me hanging out.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,160
 I only get one vacation a year.

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,240
 So I like to just kind of relax.

35
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,560
 I love doing this show,

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,520
 but it takes probably about an hour or two

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,680
 from start to finish, from like recording it.

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,400
 The research is what takes the most part,

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,440
 but I can do that on the toilet.

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,520
 The last episode on Friday,

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,000
 I talked about finding recipes online

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,680
 and how I would love to make Chipotle burritos.

43
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,440
 And then I kind of just went off on this huge rant

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,960
 about Chipotle in general, how much I love them.

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,840
 Chipotle, eat fresh.

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,640
 But the other thing that I wanted to talk about

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
 in that recipe thing, recipe,

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,360
 I actually had to edit it out for time,

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,560
 but the recipe I've always been looking for,

50
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,720
 the recipe that's been driving me nuts

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,920
 is the best hamburger that I've ever, not ever had,

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,000
 but one of my favorite hamburgers

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,800
 is the AMPM gas station hamburger.

54
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
 And it's basically the same type of hamburger meat

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,480
 they used to serve in school cafeterias.

56
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,080
 It's like 30% meat and 70% oatmeal

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,720
 and it has a lot of filling in it,

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,400
 but it just has this really unique texture

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
 and this really unique taste.

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,760
 My friend Lana thinks that I'm a super taster

61
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,840
 because I'm super picky with what I eat.

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,760
 And I always felt like I had bland taste buds.

63
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,640
 And she said, "No, I think you might be the opposite.

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
 I think you might have such incredibly sensitive taste buds

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,960
 and that's why you like to eat bland food."

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,560
 As I love those AMPM hamburgers,

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
 Chipotle is not bland at all.

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,000
 Chipotle is in several locations around.

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,800
 Chipotle does not sponsor this show,

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,440
 but Chipotle isn't bland.

71
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
 But anyways, I like those AMPM hamburgers.

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,120
 I've looked all over it, like if I could buy them in bulk,

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,360
 I'll buy boxes of cheap hamburger meat, like 20, 30 patties.

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
 And I'm always like, "Oh man, I hope these are the one.

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
 I hope these are gonna taste like those AMPM burgers

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
 and they never do."

77
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
 They have to manufacture them somewhere.

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
 But if not, I wanna find a recipe

79
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,720
 that if I could take some hamburger meat

80
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
 and throw some oatmeal in there

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,200
 and make those hamburgers, that's all I would eat.

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
 And it'd be perfect for keto.

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,720
 Oh wait, no, wouldn't,

84
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,000
 'cause oatmeal has much of carbs in it.

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,840
 Damn it.

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,200
 Well,

87
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
 another dream crushed.

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
 That sucks, dude.

89
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,160
 Maybe it's not oatmeal.

90
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,040
 Maybe it's some sort of filling in there.

91
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,360
 Maybe it's like pig legs or something.

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
 I don't know.

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
 Let's get started with the episode.

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,600
 The big news last week,

95
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,840
 and the story that people were requesting,

96
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,960
 Veronica was literally pulling on my shirt.

97
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,600
 Okay, not literally pulling on my shirt,

98
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,120
 but she was like, "You have to do a story

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,760
 about the people missing in Iowa.

100
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,480
 You have to cover the people missing in Iowa."

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,600
 And I'm like, "Back up, girl.

102
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,640
 Get your own podcast."

103
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
 But she was right.

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,360
 I did need to cover that story

105
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
 because it was a current new story

106
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,160
 and it's just super bizarre.

107
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,560
 The reason why I didn't cover it last week

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
 was because we were doing the sex conspiracy week.

109
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,440
 And I thought that was just a little tacky and gross

110
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,400
 because the sad thing is,

111
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,760
 I think a lot of these people are ending up

112
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,120
 in the sex trade or being raped or whatever.

113
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,040
 And I didn't want to tell a story

114
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,560
 that I felt like that was an integral part of.

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,600
 And then go, and then on lighter side,

116
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,040
 let's talk about bug chasing.

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,240
 Like I didn't want to combine those elements.

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
 So it's a new week and we're gonna go ahead

119
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,800
 and start talking about the missing people in Iowa.

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,080
 Now I've had to do a lot of research on this

121
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
 and I've had to do a lot of math.

122
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,440
 So I'm gonna spare you a lot of my math details

123
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
 because the math is important to the story.

124
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,240
 So if you're not familiar with it, what happened was

125
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,880
 last month in the month of July,

126
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,280
 a young woman went missing,

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,560
 a young 20 year old woman was out jogging

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
 and she went missing.

129
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,260
 The name was Molly Tibbets.

130
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,960
 And people were like,

131
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,680
 oh no, this young attractive white woman went missing,

132
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,080
 which tends to happen, it gets nationwide exposure.

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,060
 And then when people in Iowa kind of started looking

134
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,900
 at the numbers,

135
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,240
 'cause everyone's trying to figure out this mystery,

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
 they've discovered that in the past 10 days,

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,040
 48 people have gone missing in the state of Iowa.

138
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,680
 Almost all of them under the age of 18.

139
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,460
 So that started a panic in Iowa

140
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,980
 and that spread across the rest of the nation

141
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,040
 where like how could 48 people go missing in Iowa

142
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,960
 in 10 days, that's amazing.

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,560
 And when I first heard that, I was like, that is amazing.

144
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,920
 Now I've heard theories that it's reptilians gathering food.

145
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,280
 I've actually heard theories that it's the Japanese

146
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,880
 alien hybrids because apparently Japanese are like

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,480
 half alien, according to some people.

148
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,800
 The Japanese alien hybrids are declaring war

149
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,480
 on the United States.

150
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 I've heard pizza gate, which is the democratic controlled

151
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,280
 cannibal child pedophilia ring.

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,360
 I've heard all of those, I've heard just basic stuff

153
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,480
 like serial killer, St. Warshmores and all of that.

154
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,380
 Now, I don't think it was reptilians, obviously.

155
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,120
 I think that one or two may have been this

156
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,640
 or one or two may have been that and so on and so forth.

157
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,200
 But the main thing to look at was, are they correct?

158
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,600
 Is, did 48 people really go missing last 10 days?

159
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,160
 And according to all of the reports, that is true.

160
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,720
 The second question we have to answer,

161
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,240
 the second question we have to look at is,

162
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,840
 is this abnormal?

163
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,320
 Now when generally people, when we think of places

164
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,520
 we don't live, we break them down

165
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
 to the most basic stereotype.

166
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,160
 So when I think of New York, I think of a bunch

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,840
 like Surly Italians and like Irish people,

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,440
 the dead rabbits, walking around

169
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
 the Billy clubs and beating people up.

170
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,080
 When I think of Russia, I think of it being really cold

171
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,120
 and people dancing.

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,240
 When I think of Iowa, I think of cornfields

173
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,400
 as far as the eye can see.

174
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,480
 I have a friend out there actually, hey Carrie.

175
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,900
 Cornfields as far as the eye can see.

176
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,600
 And like little towns dotting here and there.

177
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
 Carrie actually used to work in a movie theater

178
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,800
 in town, the movie theater, I should say.

179
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 They only had one screen, which was super bizarre to me,

180
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,080
 but very low population.

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,280
 So is 48 people missing within 10 days

182
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,160
 and abnormality for Iowa?

183
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,360
 And sadly it's not.

184
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,440
 There's two sides of the story.

185
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,600
 So that's not the end of the story,

186
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,360
 but when we look at Iowa, they have a population

187
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,880
 of three million people.

188
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,040
 So that's not a lot for such a big state,

189
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,320
 but that's also not a very small state.

190
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,040
 So when we look at Iowa, they had, in 2017,

191
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 they had 4,300, roughly 4,300 juveniles reported missing

192
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,760
 in 2017.

193
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,200
 They have a population of three million.

194
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,840
 And that averaged out to about 12 a day.

195
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,000
 So if 48 people went missing over the course of 10 days,

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
 technically that's a little bit below average

197
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
 if normally it's 12 a day.

198
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,320
 Now we have to compare it against something.

199
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,320
 I went to, USA Today talked about South Dakota

200
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,360
 having an issue.

201
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,840
 They're missing people,

202
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,840
 lists 1,400 missing children in the year 2015.

203
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,120
 So that's the latest year they had statistics for.

204
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,720
 So we have Iowa with 4,300

205
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,240
 and South Dakota nearby with 1,400.

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
 And I'm like, whoa, that's a big discrepancy.

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
 But again, Iowa has three million people

208
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
 and South Dakota only has 8,600,000 people.

209
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,920
 So those numbers are fairly comparable.

210
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,160
 You can scale them up or scale them down.

211
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,800
 So it seems to be in that region

212
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
 that that is a fairly standard number.

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,080
 One's not sticking out higher than the other.

214
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,600
 So the missing people in Iowa,

215
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,440
 it is unfortunately the normal numbers.

216
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
 However, what I find most interesting about this story

217
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,640
 is that when you have people saying

218
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,000
 these numbers are out of control

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,040
 that Iowa has a missing people problem

220
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,880
 and they list the people who went missing

221
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,640
 in that 10 day period,

222
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,120
 they'll list two people who went missing

223
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,120
 in the same city on the same day.

224
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,080
 Then you go down this person, that person,

225
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,960
 and you'll find another two people missing

226
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,560
 from the same city on the same day.

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,280
 You'll go down a couple more names and so on and so forth.

228
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,200
 When the mainstream media reports on this story,

229
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,240
 they take those exact same names

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
 in those exact same cities and they scramble them.

231
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,000
 So this is from the Channel 3 news in Iowa,

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,640
 in Clearlake, Iowa.

233
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,360
 This is their list, I'll just read a few of them.

234
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,560
 McKenna driver, Davenport, H-15, July 26th.

235
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,560
 Eric Magnensen, Pottawomani, County, H-14, July 26th.

236
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:58,080
 Anna Marsup, Des Moines, H-17, July 26th.

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
 The Shaney Phillips, Davenport, H-16, July 26th.

238
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,560
 So why is the Shaney and McKenna divided up?

239
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,640
 There's no, it's not in alphabetical order.

240
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,160
 It's not based on age.

241
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
 But now I'm kind of in the middle of the list.

242
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,040
 They do this throughout the list.

243
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,520
 We have another kid missing from Davenport,

244
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,400
 a Davenport, a Serenity Wyman, H-13, July 25th.

245
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,920
 So the previous day, we had a kid missing

246
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,800
 from Council Bluffs on the 25th

247
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,440
 and then we have to go eight names down

248
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
 to find another kid missing

249
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,640
 from Council Bluffs on the 24th.

250
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,720
 So if I'm just reading this list, I'm not seeing a pattern.

251
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,080
 I go, oh, you know, that makes sense.

252
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,380
 You know, these kids are missing.

253
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,320
 When we look at lists of people who are saying

254
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,000
 there is a problem, they have them.

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,320
 City, city, day, city, city, city, day, city, day, city, day.

256
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,000
 So they're showing you the pattern

257
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,420
 that these kids are missing from the same city

258
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,520
 either the same day or one day apart,

259
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
 which makes it look more like there's a predation going on.

260
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,960
 So I have to ask the question,

261
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,000
 why are they scrambling the names in the mainstream media?

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
 I hate using the term mainstream media.

263
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,640
 I mean, it started off as a signifier

264
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,560
 just like there's mainstream record companies.

265
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,240
 There's a difference between a mainstream record company

266
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,000
 and a lower level record company

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,720
 or one of the Big Five book publishers

268
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,640
 and the other little book publishers.

269
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,920
 That's what mainstream media eventually,

270
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,640
 what originally was, you have the mainstream media

271
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,840
 and then you had radio,

272
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,080
 which was kind of the difference between the two

273
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,240
 and then you had the internet and all of that stuff.

274
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,360
 So I hate really using the word mainstream media

275
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,760
 'cause it's such a derogatory,

276
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,760
 but my point is is that in the media,

277
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
 I can only use the word mainstream media.

278
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,560
 In the mainstream media,

279
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,720
 they're taking the same names

280
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,960
 and they're scrambling them up

281
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,880
 to make them look like it's not such an issue.

282
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,760
 The reason why I have a problem with that

283
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,400
 is that we all know that if they wanna sell us,

284
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
 there is a problem.

285
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,040
 They can arrange the facts in a way

286
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,960
 to say that this is a problem.

287
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
 And in the same way,

288
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 they can arrange the facts

289
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,440
 to make us think this isn't a problem.

290
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,680
 The media could have easily said,

291
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,720
 "Look, these kids went missing

292
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,000
 from these same cities on the same day.

293
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,760
 Iowa has a missing people problem.

294
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,240
 What is going on?"

295
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,400
 Instead, the headlines they're running is,

296
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,560
 "This isn't a problem.

297
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,400
 This is normal.

298
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
 This is statistical."

299
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 And they're right, it is statistical,

300
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
 but I'm questioning their motives

301
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,320
 that I believe it's statistical

302
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
 and they believe it's statistical,

303
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,280
 but then they take those statistics

304
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
 and they rearrange them

305
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,320
 or take those names and they rearrange them

306
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
 to make it look less menacing.

307
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,600
 When if there was a flip side,

308
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,400
 if they wanted to oust the police chief of that area,

309
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,720
 if they didn't like the way he performed,

310
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
 if they wanted to enact some sort of change in that area,

311
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,480
 they would take those same facts and figures

312
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,880
 and present them to me saying,

313
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,160
 "This is a problem.

314
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,480
 Look."

315
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
 Instead, they're saying,

316
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,760
 "Scramble, scramble, scramble.

317
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
 This isn't a problem.

318
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,800
 Look."

319
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,240
 Not every conspiracy has to have

320
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
 a shape-shifting reptilian

321
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,120
 or Hillary Clinton-y eating a baby.

322
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
 Those are the conspiracies that end up

323
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,920
 making us overlook the real conspiracies.

324
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,800
 You can think Satan worshipers are ruling the planet

325
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,280
 and that keeps you from looking at the corporations

326
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,440
 that are ruling the planet.

327
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,800
 The fantastical will always overshadow the realistic

328
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,360
 and the realistic conspiracies

329
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,200
 are the ones we have to worry about.

330
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,280
 So we're gonna go ahead and move on to our next story here.

331
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,600
 And let me say this too,

332
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,040
 I hope everyone on that list is found.

333
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
 I think missing, you know,

334
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,640
 I have a lot of friends who are homeless.

335
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,000
 I've known a lot of young people who are homeless,

336
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,440
 they're homeless for multiple reasons.

337
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 It sucks.

338
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
 Run away, you know, having to run away all this.

339
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,920
 So if I hope all of those kids are found

340
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,840
 and I hope everyone gets what they need,

341
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,920
 we are going to take a look at another story.

342
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,400
 Story that I, again, have been personally curious about,

343
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,520
 a story that's on the iceberg conspiracy list.

344
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,480
 A story that I've gotten a lot of requests on

345
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,440
 and actually this story was scheduled

346
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,960
 for the Thursday episode,

347
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
 but I moved it ahead

348
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,960
 because someone on YouTube goes,

349
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
 "You know what I really wanna hear about?

350
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,160
 "The ocean at night."

351
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,200
 This one is cool.

352
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,640
 This is one of the ones that I was researching it

353
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
 and I was looking into it.

354
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,720
 And once the pieces fell into place, I was like, yeah.

355
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,800
 This is why I enjoy doing this.

356
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,200
 So the ocean at night is a fascinating place.

357
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,160
 It does a lot of weird stuff at night.

358
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,280
 What happens is that on the surface,

359
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,960
 most of the predators hunt visually.

360
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
 They hunt by sight.

361
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,400
 The big sharks up there, the whales and all of that,

362
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
 they hunt by sight.

363
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,280
 So they use the sunlight to hunt.

364
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,080
 At night, they're not doing too great.

365
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,280
 They can't find their prey as easily as they want to.

366
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
 And what happens is the creatures

367
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,320
 from the bottom of the ocean begin to migrate up to feed

368
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,400
 because it's safer now.

369
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,200
 So you have all the plankton floating up to the surface,

370
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,120
 going to eat stuff.

371
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,840
 I don't know what plankton eat.

372
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,160
 And then because of that, the deep sea fish start coming up

373
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,320
 after the plankton because they don't rely on sight to hunt.

374
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
 It doesn't matter if it's nighttime,

375
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,320
 they hunt in dark waters anyway.

376
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,700
 So they go where the food goes, they go up to the surface.

377
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,240
 And what that means is those fishes predators,

378
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,600
 those giant squids, those cookie cutter sharks,

379
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,640
 those crazy creatures from the bottom of the ocean

380
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,240
 swim up to eat lanternfish,

381
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,040
 to eat all their food that's going up.

382
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,240
 And this happens every day.

383
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,280
 At dusk, you start to have this mass migration

384
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,960
 from the bottom of the ocean coming up,

385
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,440
 chasing its food.

386
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,680
 And then as dawn, as the sun starts to come back,

387
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,640
 they all just go back to the bottom of the ocean.

388
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,320
 Everything resumes normal.

389
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,240
 When our giant ships are moving across the ocean,

390
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,720
 when kids are out playing on the beach,

391
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,880
 and then as the sun sets,

392
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,400
 that whole process starts again,

393
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,240
 all those fish come back up to the surface.

394
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
 There was a guy who was night swimming.

395
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,380
 It's like marathon swimming.

396
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,760
 So you basically have to start at night.

397
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,560
 You get started at night because the process is so long.

398
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,640
 And you're gonna swim as far as you can.

399
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 I mean, obviously there's like a distance or whatever,

400
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,640
 but the way that it works is that generally,

401
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,120
 you have, you're swimming, not by yourself,

402
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,200
 there's generally like a boat near you.

403
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,960
 And this guy also had a guy on a kayak next to him.

404
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,280
 The boat would be a little bit farther away,

405
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,440
 the kayak was next to him.

406
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
 And at one point, the captain of the boat was like,

407
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,200
 "Hey, you know, it's really dark.

408
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,920
 I wanna turn on my flood lights."

409
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,960
 And they're like, "Okay, you know,

410
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,360
 'cause we wanted to know where everyone was going."

411
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,080
 So they put the flood lights on the swimmer.

412
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,000
 And the guy swimming next to the kayak floodlight on him,

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,360
 captain's boat has a floodlight on the swimmer

414
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,560
 and he's swimming.

415
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,240
 And all of a sudden he feels something brush against his

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,680
 leg and he gets, he feels like sharp pain

417
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,120
 and he gets on with the kayak

418
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,440
 and he has a huge chunk taken out of his leg.

419
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,600
 And what happened was this was a cookie cutter shark.

420
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,240
 It's a shark that latches onto you

421
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,840
 and takes out like a perfect hole of meat.

422
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,760
 These things attack submarines, by the way.

423
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,400
 That's how deep these creatures normally live.

424
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,880
 They'll attack parts of the submarine that were soft.

425
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,360
 Now they're more armored.

426
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,240
 They have like fiberglass over certain parts

427
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,040
 because these fish were taking bites out of submarines.

428
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,680
 These sharks they live in the middle of the ocean.

429
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,920
 This report here, I saw something different

430
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,800
 on Wikipedia, but the article I was looking at,

431
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,640
 this was the only time that they had seen

432
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,760
 that a cookie cutter shark had attacked a living human.

433
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,560
 And he was just swimming out in the middle of the ocean

434
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,840
 at night with these spotlights on him and gets attacked.

435
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,520
 This article ends with a shark researcher saying,

436
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,960
 "Don't swim at night over a deep sea trench

437
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,760
 while being lit from above by boat-based floodlights."

438
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,760
 This shark had probably never seen a human before,

439
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,960
 never even knew they existed.

440
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,960
 To him, they're the aliens, a creature that is improbable.

441
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,680
 But one night he looks up and he sees a bright light

442
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,840
 and he sees splashing.

443
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,440
 He swims up out of the bottom of that trench

444
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080
 that he's always lived in and hunted in.

445
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,740
 Every night he'd come up and eat his prey,

446
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,840
 but to come all the way to the surface.

447
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,180
 The Neil Armstrong of sharks, he came out of that trench.

448
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,920
 Took a bite out of that guy.

449
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,300
 Never knew they existed, didn't know what it was,

450
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,360
 but he's a shark, he's a creature, he attacked.

451
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
 Don't swim at night with floodlights on you.

452
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
 He's really the moral.

453
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,680
 Because who knows what's gonna come out to get you.

454
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,560
 So that was the first piece of information

455
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,400
 I found about the ocean at night,

456
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,040
 but there was something else.

457
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,240
 Now, when I first started researching the ocean at night,

458
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,200
 one of the first leads I had was that the US Navy

459
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,480
 had constructed an artificial sun off the coast of Aden,

460
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,280
 which is near Yemen.

461
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,440
 Now, that definitely sounds like

462
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,120
 in the realm of sci-fi possibility,

463
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,480
 something that, what would be the point of doing it?

464
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,640
 That's always the question you have to ask

465
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
 about these conspiracies.

466
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,160
 Usually we know the who and the what.

467
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,560
 The big question is why?

468
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,680
 So I dismissed that at first.

469
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,960
 And I was looking for a natural reason

470
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,840
 for the ocean at night being on that list.

471
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,160
 But then I thought about it and I thought,

472
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,440
 why, first off my question was,

473
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,400
 why would you build an artificial sun?

474
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,820
 Well, we already have one actually.

475
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,000
 We've built them.

476
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,100
 In Germany, they built this massive artificial sun.

477
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,800
 And I was reading this article,

478
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,880
 and it's just all of these massive lightballs.

479
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,040
 It's light bulbs.

480
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,880
 It's amazing.

481
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,760
 It actually, when it's turned on,

482
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,880
 they give an intensity of 10,000 times greater

483
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,980
 than the sunlight we feel on Earth.

484
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,960
 And it's massive.

485
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,320
 Each of these light bulbs is the size of a human.

486
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,600
 And there's, I think, 149 of them.

487
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,400
 And I'm looking at this and I'm reading this article,

488
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,040
 and I'm like, I'm always amazed by what humanity can do.

489
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,160
 I'm reading this article and they're talking about

490
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
 why they built it.

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,640
 And they're like, you know, well, it gives us a way

492
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,600
 that people can bring in solar panels

493
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,440
 and they can test them.

494
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,000
 We can make them more efficient.

495
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,920
 We can use it to perfect stuff like solar powered sails,

496
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,060
 which is another way to travel long distances in space.

497
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,480
 And then I see this.

498
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,760
 Okay, so this is called the sunlight, like synthetic light.

499
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,600
 I found this.

500
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,400
 Scientists will delve into new ways to create hydrogen,

501
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
 which isn't found naturally,

502
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,080
 but must be created by splitting water

503
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,640
 into hydrogen and oxygen.

504
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,080
 So of course now, I'm like, great,

505
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,760
 I gotta figure out how hydrogen's made.

506
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,680
 Hydrogen, of course, is made by splitting hydrogen

507
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,640
 and oxygen.

508
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,760
 There's two ways you can do it.

509
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,600
 One, I think it's electrosys,

510
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,000
 where it's this very expensive energy-wise way

511
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,320
 to electrify water to split the oxygen and hydrogen.

512
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,940
 The other thing is massive amounts of sunlight,

513
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,480
 but the sun doesn't provide that much.

514
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,720
 However, research and the hypothesis shows

515
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,640
 that something like this artificial sun

516
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,640
 could create clean, unlimited hydrogen from the ocean.

517
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,880
 You put these underwater.

518
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,600
 See, they didn't have this technology before.

519
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,680
 You put these underwater,

520
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,560
 or just how I'm facing the water.

521
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,880
 The massive amount of heat

522
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,360
 with a few other minerals they have to put into the water,

523
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,040
 non-polluting minerals,

524
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,680
 can change the way the world looks at energy.

525
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,960
 Can, hydrogen is the cleanest fuel.

526
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,840
 It will put fossil fuels on the back burner,

527
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,160
 no pun intended.

528
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,880
 We won't need them anymore.

529
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,640
 We will have an unlimited amount of hydrogen

530
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,400
 with these machines in the ocean,

531
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,040
 using the heat from these machines in the ocean.

532
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,960
 That would be a boon for mankind.

533
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
 There's no other way to look at it.

534
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
 It would change the way the world works.

535
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
 There would no longer be an ocean at night.

536
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,640
 Every shoreline of every country would have these things.

537
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
 Instead of oil rigs out in the deep sea,

538
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
 you'd have these giant artificial suns.

539
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,640
 But in the deep dark of the ocean,

540
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,680
 creatures that no one knows existed,

541
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,480
 who never knew we existed,

542
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,880
 who never thought of anything about man.

543
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,320
 Now they see lights off of our coasts,

544
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,040
 off of our rigs, off of our cities,

545
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,360
 shining into their home.

546
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,720
 Part of the key component to the ocean at night mystery

547
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,000
 is that it says that an artificial sun

548
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,840
 was built in the Gulf of Aden.

549
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,560
 In 2010, WikiLeaks published a document

550
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,760
 from a Russian admiral,

551
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,160
 claiming that the earthquakes in the area

552
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
 the chaotic weather patterns

553
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,680
 were caused by what he called a vortex opening in the area.

554
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,320
 And the world's navies going there

555
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,920
 to fight Somali pirates was simply a cover

556
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,320
 for something else.

557
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 Did we already build an artificial sun underwater?

558
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,160
 Did we turn it on hoping to get hydrogen

559
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,160
 and instead awaken something massive and dark and ancient?

560
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:46,040
 Did we shine that light on it and let it know we are here?

561
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:53,880
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address.

562
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 You can also hit us up at facebook.com/deadrabbitradio.

563
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,720
 Twitter is @jasonocarpenter.

564
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,600
 I still kind of got shivers from that story.

565
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,120
 It's all true.

566
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,080
 Links are below.

567
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,760
 I know you think I'm just setting up

568
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,920
 some nice little horror story,

569
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,800
 but we could have a Pacific Rim on our hands

570
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,160
 if these things become operational.

571
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,200
 I hope you guys are having a great time

572
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,120
 listening to the podcast.

573
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,880
 I'm still having a great time producing it.

574
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,120
 I love the comments.

575
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,920
 If you guys want to help us out more than anything,

576
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,120
 share the podcast, share the YouTube channel,

577
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
 get the word out that you're having fun with this podcast.

578
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,320
 That's how we grow.

579
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,120
 I'm also going to start looking at building street teams.

580
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,160
 We're going to have flyers and stickers

581
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,480
 and all sorts of swag for people to give out.

582
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
 Once we get that in the pipe,

583
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
 I'll start getting some email addresses for you.

584
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,680
 I'm actually thinking of a way of having you

585
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,360
 be able to print out the stuff yourself.

586
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,800
 If you don't want to give your address

587
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,000
 to a total stranger online, he talks about sea monsters.

588
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,040
 But we can go nowhere but up with this show.

589
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,440
 We're doing great right now

590
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
 and we're only getting better every single day.

591
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,120
 So hope you guys are having fun.

592
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,960
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the paranormal conspiracy

593
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,440
 and true crime podcast.

594
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
 You don't have to listen to it every day,

595
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,120
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

596
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,280
 Have a great one, guys.

597
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,860
 (upbeat music)

598
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,440
 (upbeat music)

599
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,020
