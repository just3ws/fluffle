00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 First off, a follow up to yesterday's episode where I told a couple stories about Hood River.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,360
 One in particular I described something I saw twice while I was walking through the

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,620
 city at night.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:24,360
 I always shocked it up to 50% hallucination, maybe 50% coyote, but you, my dear listeners,

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,580
 pointed out what it really was.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,720
 And then we take a look at the first time that the world of fetishes, law enforcement,

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,880
 and the internet collided today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:46,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,200
 For the sake of the intro, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
 My day hasn't been that good.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,880
 It's been okay.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,280
 So I don't know how many of you guys out there have had anxiety attacks.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 I think like one third of people have suffered from them.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,800
 And if you don't know what, I've been having them since I was 12.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 You don't know what they are.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
 They're quite terrifying.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,120
 You think you're dying.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,720
 I've been having them since I was 12.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960
 It's just something that I get.

22
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,240
 So I kind of know what's going on.

23
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,120
 But let me kind of take you through pretty much what I'm going mentally through right

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,920
 now and what I've been going through for maybe about the past hour.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,800
 I'm recording this episode much later than I normally do.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,520
 So I woke up this morning about 7 AM and I'm making, I'm making breath fix.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
 And I start lifting weights.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,120
 I've been lifting weights for a while now and I was got really aggressive with it today.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,240
 This isn't to brag because I know a lot of you guys don't think this is even that much.

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,960
 But I'm hammer curling 25 pounds with the, the barbells, the hand, the hand ones, the

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,200
 ones you just hold in your hand as opposed to the ones you levitate with your mind.

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,920
 I think the long one is actually the barbells or the dumbbells or the little ones.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,280
 25 on each of those, standing up doing hammer curls at the same time.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,160
 So basically I'm throwing 50 pounds on my body.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,480
 I'm picking them up off the ground, doing eight reps, putting them back down, going to

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
 check on my breath fix.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
 That's cooking.

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,000
 Come back, do that about 30 seconds of rest in between three sets of that.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,320
 You're thinking, Jason, that's not a lot.

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
 And it's not.

41
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 It's not a lot actually.

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,800
 Then I do probably about 30 pushups, which were door pushups.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
 Don't be impressed.

44
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,640
 I'm an old man and I'm overweight.

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,080
 Any exercise is good exercise.

46
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,280
 And then I was doing some good mornings and then I was just doing some regular bicep curls

47
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,760
 with 20 pound weights.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,880
 Then I am hanging out with my friends and they have their lacrosse gear and I was like, "Hey

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
 man, can I see your stick?

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
 Can I see your lacrosse stick?

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,240
 I've never used one of these before."

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,280
 So I take the lacrosse stick and I go, "Give me, give me one of your balls."

53
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
 And he hesitates.

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 "Oh, man, I got enough money to buy 100 balls."

55
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
 So he gave me the ball.

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,800
 And then I'm thrown for the first time ever, I'm using this lacrosse stick to throw, they

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,760
 showed me how to do it, to throw the ball as far as I can.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,880
 And I can feel it, I can feel it, I mean to say, in my arm and through my chest.

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,640
 And I'm like, "Whoa, this is really good like exercise.

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,320
 Like I can actually feel all my muscles activating on the left side of my chest."

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,600
 They said, "Yeah, it's really aggressive.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,640
 Just wait till you start running and trying to like actually play rather than just throw

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
 the ball."

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,240
 And then I go grocery shopping and I bought probably about, I don't know, 10 pounds of

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,080
 groceries and I put it all in just one bag.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
 I'm like, "I can do it."

67
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,700
 And I'm walking down the street and I just carry it in one bag on my left arm.

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,680
 So I'm using the lacrosse thing and I'm mostly using my left arm.

69
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,560
 I used my left arm when I was lifting the weight.

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,160
 I'm carrying a bag about 10 pounds of groceries, about a mile and a half from the grocery store

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 to my home.

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,680
 I get home and I start going, "Oh my God.

73
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,240
 Oh my God, my chest hurts.

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,760
 Oh my God, I'm having a heart attack.

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 I'm chasing.

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
 Calm down.

77
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
 You're not having a heart attack yet.

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,920
 Oh my God.

79
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
 This might be it.

80
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,240
 I'm coming home, Martha.

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,920
 I'm coming home."

82
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,280
 And for basically the past hour and a half, I've been having to try to calm myself down

83
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,360
 because my anxiety attack is saying, "You're having a heart attack right now.

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
 You need to call the doctor right now.

85
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 You need to go."

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
 Feel that chest pain?

87
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,240
 You feel the pain in your, oh, your neck starting to get sore too, isn't it?

88
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
 Oh, you're getting a little squeam.

89
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
 You call the doctor.

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
 You're having a heart attack, bro.

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
 You're having a heart attack.

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 Take care of this."

93
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,960
 And my rational mind is saying, I know this is taking a little bit longer than most of

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,640
 my interest, but I think this is good for people who are dealing with anxiety attacks,

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,360
 or maybe it's just good for me to get it off my chest.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,880
 My rational mind is saying, "Dude, you're 42 years old.

97
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,280
 You were lifting a ton of weights today more than you normally do.

98
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,680
 You stepped it up today.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,640
 You were playing with the sport equipment that you've never used before and you could

100
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
 tell that it was hurting.

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,400
 You carried all this stuff on top of all the physical labor you do throughout the day for

102
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
 your job.

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
 You're not having a heart attack.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,040
 You have several pulled muscles in your body.

105
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,200
 Stretch next time."

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,280
 And despite that, that knowledge, and despite the fact that I'm healthier now than I've

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,880
 been in 20 years because of my weight loss, I still have to walk around the block.

108
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,120
 You know what's one of the key things, one of the key tools?

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,280
 And then I'll end this because I know this probably isn't super interesting, but one

110
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,080
 of the key tools I've used for my anxiety attacks is basically an anxiety attack is

111
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,640
 your brain activating your fight or flight mechanism.

112
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,040
 So as far as your brain knows, there's a saber tooth tiger sneaking up behind you and your

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,160
 body is telling you to run, run, run, run, run.

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
 Fight or flight.

115
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,040
 There's nothing to fight because nothing exists there.

116
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,120
 So your body's basically pumping all this adrenaline.

117
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,800
 I used to try to distract myself.

118
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
 I'd throw in the office.

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,760
 And then that would be the episode where somebody dies or they make a joke about it.

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,840
 You know, I'm like, "Oh my God."

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,120
 But I would watch a show, I would try to watch a fun show or something I really liked and

122
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,800
 I really always had a hard time.

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,400
 But yeah, so what my coping mechanism is for anxiety attacks now, instead of trying to

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,120
 distract myself from the fight or flight mechanism, I basically throw myself into the fight mode.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,120
 I'll pretend that in my mind, I'm boxing someone in the street or aliens are attacking

126
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,000
 and I have to figure out a way to destroy them, not to run away.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,680
 I have to fight, fight them.

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,400
 I have to imagine myself like taking one of their guns and blowing them away.

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
 Fighting terrorists, ninjas, whatever.

130
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
 Like I throw my brain into the fight.

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,580
 And that actual, that distracts me from the anxiety attack.

132
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,820
 Everything else that I'm trying to like calm down doesn't work.

133
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,320
 But I'll just picture like a bear breaking into my apartment and I'm just like wrestling

134
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,880
 the bear, fighting the bear.

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
 I always win.

136
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,420
 And that actually seems to help.

137
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,880
 But if you're dealing with anxiety attacks, I mean statistically one third of you guys

138
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
 are that try that method.

139
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,840
 Some people say if you rub your hands together, it can, it activates both sides of your brain.

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,920
 They start talking to each other.

141
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,840
 So the logical and the, I don't know if there's an illogical part of your brain, but the two

142
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,960
 parts of your brain start talking to each other.

143
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,520
 That could be that.

144
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
 But there's all sorts of different coping mechanism.

145
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,040
 You know what, to be honest, this anxiety attack was really getting me worked up.

146
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,320
 I live in Hood River.

147
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
 There's bars everywhere.

148
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,600
 I thought I should just go get a shot of vodka.

149
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,100
 That would calm me down.

150
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,140
 And I thought it would, but that is the cure being worse than the disease.

151
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,300
 It would.

152
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,900
 And then in six months, that would be your go to answer is a shot of vodka or more.

153
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,680
 So didn't do that.

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,260
 But yeah, anxiety attacks suck because they really kind of suck all of the energy out

155
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
 of you.

156
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,140
 I was like, I don't even want to record an episode tonight and I am and it's this.

157
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,520
 So let's go ahead and get started with the episode that went on a little bit longer than

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,680
 I wanted it to, but let's just go with it because I think it's good for people who are

159
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
 suffering from that.

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,960
 And if you're not, you've never had an anxiety attack.

161
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,880
 And you kind of have an idea what it's like.

162
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,680
 You're ever walking on the street and you see a guy go take that ZAPS lork, evil Dominion

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
 king of the reptilians.

164
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,920
 Then you go, oh, he's just having an anxiety attack and he listens to the radio.

165
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,440
 Let's go ahead and move on to the first story actually is really interesting because it's

166
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,540
 not so much a story as it is a follow up.

167
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,900
 And let me say this real quick.

168
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,620
 So not everyone listens to every episode.

169
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,980
 Yesterday's episode, I talked about all the creepy stuff of Hood River and trust me, I

170
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,460
 barely scraped the surface.

171
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,300
 I edited out like 10 minutes of it because I went on this weird political rant and I

172
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
 couldn't cut around it.

173
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,420
 So I had to take 10 minutes of mood setting right out of it, which is fine.

174
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,260
 The episode was long anyways, but Hood River is just a very, very kind of weird town during

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
 the day.

176
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
 It's a tourist town.

177
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,360
 There's beautiful, beautiful people walking around at night.

178
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,160
 It completely flip flops where it's completely dead.

179
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,440
 Most of the town is almost completely deserted by 10pm.

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,760
 You can walk down on it.

181
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,360
 I one day I walked through Hood River for from the heights down into Hood River for probably

182
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,500
 about a half hour and didn't see another human at all.

183
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,120
 So it's really, once the sun goes down, basically this town shuts down.

184
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,920
 There's three Masonic lodges within maybe two city blocks of each other.

185
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,740
 There's a population of 10,000 people and there's probably 8 to 10 churches, which is

186
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,140
 a lot for such a small population.

187
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,640
 It really is.

188
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,380
 You figure not everyone goes to church and some of the churches are like the Mormon church

189
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,660
 and then there's like a Seventh Day Adventist church and then there's Jehovah's Witness

190
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,140
 Temple and I'm like, "And how many of these people are there actually here?"

191
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,540
 So always a sign that there's something.

192
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,660
 When you go to a place and there's a lot of churches, it means everyone is trying to

193
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,600
 redeem themselves from something that's going on.

194
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
 They feel guilty so they build a church.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,960
 You know, generally churches are proportional to the population they serve if you find a

196
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,520
 lot of churches in a certain area.

197
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,560
 It may mean something's up, but this town's definitely creepy and I talked about when

198
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,920
 I was walking through Hood River one night, it was like four in the morning.

199
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,200
 I was walking down State Street, which one of the main streets that cut through, I was

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,960
 all by myself and what I saw in front of me, I just saw the hind quarters.

201
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,860
 It was a lanky white hairless creature.

202
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:11,060
 Now from, it was walking like, I actually put a video on YouTube of somebody walking

203
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,900
 like I described.

204
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,140
 It's basically if someone was walking on all fours.

205
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,900
 So you know how your butt is higher than your hands when you're walking?

206
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
 That's what this looked like.

207
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,740
 So I see this thing walk and I see like it's butt up in the air and these long white hairless

208
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,140
 legs.

209
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,880
 And then I saw the body kind of aiming downwards like someone is walking on all fours and I

210
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,960
 don't see the front of it.

211
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,520
 And it's easily, its butt is probably up to around my chest.

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,760
 So I figured it was, well maybe not my chest, maybe like my stomach.

213
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
 It was about three feet tall.

214
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,600
 It was almost as tall as the trunk of the car it was walking behind.

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,320
 And I went around the car and I looked and it wasn't there.

216
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,400
 It was completely gone.

217
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,560
 And I had no idea what it was.

218
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,100
 I figured it was some sort of hairless creature.

219
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,540
 But at the time I thought maybe I'm just hallucinating.

220
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:09,060
 And then a couple weeks later I was walking in another place on Hood River and I saw it

221
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,260
 charge me from down the probably about a hundred yards away I think is what I said it was.

222
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,540
 It's charging me and then when it gets to the foot of the stairs where I'm at by the

223
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,620
 time I look down the stairs it's completely gone.

224
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,660
 So this thing can vanish.

225
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,400
 It can move very, very fast.

226
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,660
 And I talked about this on my episode.

227
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,940
 Sorry for that quick overview for the people who did listen to it.

228
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,640
 So I posted that up and I just figured there's just some weird thing that I saw.

229
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,640
 Today I got a comment on YouTube from FateIsFallen and he goes, "Oh yeah, I know what that is.

230
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
 It's crawler."

231
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,520
 What you described is called a crawler.

232
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,600
 He goes, "Not only do, not only is there a name for these things there's a subreddit.

233
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
 r/crawlersightings."

234
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
 I was like, "What?"

235
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
 No way.

236
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
 Seriously?

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,840
 I said all those things as I was looking at my comments on YouTube.

238
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,020
 So I went to r/crawlersightings.

239
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,160
 The very first thing that pops up is that this guy goes, "You think these crawlers are

240
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,400
 hairless creatures?"

241
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:12,140
 And the very first thing that popped up he had a photo of a hairless sunny bear, which

242
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,980
 is some sort of bear from Asia.

243
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,020
 And I go, "That's it.

244
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,980
 That's exactly what it looked like."

245
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,220
 It wasn't a hairless sunny bear.

246
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,680
 I thought it was interesting and scary that the descriptions other people had been giving

247
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,800
 of their sightings of these things.

248
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,040
 Someone else was able to find a photo and goes, "Does this kind of look like it?"

249
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,920
 And that is almost identical.

250
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,560
 The butt was higher because it was proportioned differently.

251
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,640
 But the way the skin hung, the way I was describing it yesterday, how it kind of hung and folds,

252
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,360
 that's what this looked like.

253
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
 And apparently these things are spotted.

254
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,840
 They're spotted a lot in the United States.

255
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,100
 They have some sightings in other countries on a thread in the subreddit.

256
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,820
 They go, "I'm new to this site.

257
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,260
 Can you guys tell me anything about these?"

258
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,300
 There's not like a lot of times on subreddits they'll have, I know most of my 4chan audience

259
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,020
 is pulling their hair right out right now that I have to talk about all this stuff, but

260
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,140
 a lot of times on good subreddits at least, they'll have a sidebar that kind of has general

261
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,620
 information so you can kind of jump right into it.

262
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,780
 You read the sidebar and it goes, "This is what it is and this is the rules and this is

263
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
 what we're looking at."

264
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,800
 But I didn't see one for this.

265
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 I don't see them on a lot of subreddits actually, but there was this post on this thread that

266
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,680
 said, "Crawlers are the genre of cryptid consisting of tall, white, lanky humanoids

267
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,840
 that people observe in various places."

268
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,160
 From what, I think the person who posted this was Victor Scheivo, I believe was the name.

269
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,840
 From what I can tell, a lot of sightings occur in the northern United States, which is Hood

270
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,320
 River, and by the edges of woodland areas.

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,700
 Just occur at night time as well.

272
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,660
 And it's funny because one of my listeners, Rabbitfish, was actually dry, and I mentioned

273
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,260
 him before, I've mentioned him a couple times, when he was driving through, I'm not even

274
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,500
 even mentioning this comment, when he was driving through Hood River, he said, "It looks

275
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,780
 like there was a town and then a forest blew up right in the middle of it.

276
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,100
 There's just trees and weird spots all over."

277
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:14,260
 Basically, the town is a woodland area with a bunch of shops, a bunch of places there.

278
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,360
 Then it goes, there are a few creatures people include in the crawler category, including

279
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,720
 the Windigo, the Skinwalker, the Fleshgate, and of course, just the generic crawler.

280
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,480
 Now, I've heard of all of those.

281
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,400
 The Windigo, the Skinwalker, Skinwalker is incredibly popular on 4chan.

282
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,840
 I think they really turned it into a meme.

283
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,920
 When I was a kid, Skinwalker was just a term for a Native American spirit, and now it's

284
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,680
 become its own cryptid.

285
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,620
 We may do a whole episode on Skinwalkers, I always considered them just a meme, just

286
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:55,580
 some creepypasta, but if I saw one and didn't know these things, again, here's the thing.

287
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,460
 I've seen a lot of weird stuff in my life, and I'm not an Indigo child, I'm not like

288
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,380
 I'm in touch with the universe.

289
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,220
 I'm not that type of guy.

290
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,180
 When I see something weird, the first thing I go is, I must be hallucinating.

291
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,960
 I must have either, I hallucinated, it was a trick of the light, my imagination got too

292
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,560
 much of me, or all of those put together.

293
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
 All of those put together.

294
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,000
 I don't immediately go, "Oh my God, a portal has been ripped through time, and this thing

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 has just got..."

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
 That's just not the way that I think.

297
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,840
 Now, it's funny because I'll see...

298
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,880
 That may be a coping mechanism, because I'll see something, and I don't immediately get

299
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,660
 panicked, and because I think part of me is going, "That's not real.

300
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,900
 That's obviously not real what I'm looking at."

301
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,980
 Then as time goes on, I'm like, "Oh my God, what did I almost run into?

302
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,220
 I have no explanation for that."

303
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,100
 That creature, I always considered something that I just...

304
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,540
 I thought it had to have been some sort of wild animal that somehow was super huge, and

305
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,980
 it crawled under a car, and I was never able to see it, and then a couple weeks later,

306
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,220
 it charged me, and then it must have veered away real quick in the moment for me to look

307
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,120
 down, and it just wily coyoteed out of there, a little smoke trail.

308
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,600
 I must have missed something.

309
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
 That's how I always viewed that thing.

310
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,600
 But now I'm seeing that there may be more of these out here.

311
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,400
 There's a chart where they're tallying all the reported sightings of these crawlers.

312
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,760
 I'm going to add Hood River to that chart, or at least ask.

313
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,040
 I'm going to say, "I'm not just going to draw it on there."

314
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'll be like, "Hey guys, I'd like to put this on here," because I think that that definitely

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 is what it is.

316
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,820
 A lot of people say they see the front of it and has really long fingernails and spooky

317
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,140
 shark teeth, and I don't know.

318
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
 I didn't see any of that stuff.

319
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,940
 But to me, the arms looked a bit shorter because of the way it was walking, but it was running

320
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
 quite fast.

321
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
 You know what?

322
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 And that...

323
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,900
 So there is a YouTube video on my playlist.

324
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,980
 It's called "Karla the Creeper" or something like that.

325
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,460
 I wish I should have the name, but anyways, it's on there.

326
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,260
 It's on my YouTube playlist under Dead Rabbit Radio Clips.

327
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,560
 You'll just see this out of...

328
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,000
 That shows you how fast someone can run when they're walking on their hands, when they're

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,040
 walking on all fours.

330
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:20,440
 It's really weird to have a sighting with no knowledge of something, and then someone

331
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,320
 sends you a picture of it.

332
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,720
 Someone sends you a go, "Oh no, what you saw, that's totally like a..."

333
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,040
 It's not common, but a lot of people have seen those things.

334
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,440
 So thank you, fate is fallen.

335
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,080
 And then we'll go into this, because I didn't have time to do all this research, but

336
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,460
 Barfiman...

337
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,180
 Barfiman said, "Oh, the rake.

338
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,380
 You saw the rake."

339
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,900
 Which is a very popular, again, creepy pasta thing that I always attributed to just a

340
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,780
 spooky story.

341
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,460
 But even on this Reddit thread, people are saying, "Yeah, it's the rake.

342
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,900
 The crawler and the rake are the same thing."

343
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,300
 So we'll go more into the rake.

344
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,100
 We'll investigate this cryptid a little bit more.

345
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:04,720
 But it is possible that it's very likely that what I saw was an actual thing, that not only

346
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,320
 is very real, but others have seen it.

347
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
 And if you're not careful, you may see it too.

348
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
 So let's go ahead and move on to this last story here.

349
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,960
 Now this last story, I think, is interesting, because it really was the first time we saw

350
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
 a bunch of things collide.

351
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,720
 The year is 1996.

352
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,460
 It's October 16th.

353
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,580
 And now in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle of BFE America, there's a man and a

354
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,300
 woman engaging in consensual sex.

355
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,560
 His name is Robert Glass.

356
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:47,460
 And he's spent the last few days torturing Sharon Lopatka consensually.

357
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,060
 And at the very end, he wraps a rope around her neck and is tightening it.

358
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,920
 And she's telling him, "Kill me.

359
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,400
 Kill me.

360
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,000
 Kill me."

361
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,440
 Sharon Lopatka was a married woman.

362
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,800
 She had kids.

363
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,640
 And we're back in 1996.

364
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,520
 And really, for a lot of my audience, I know, I was really younger.

365
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,720
 That, I mean, the internet was an amazing place back then.

366
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,760
 It's amazing now that just the access that you have to information.

367
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,360
 But back then, there was something magical about it.

368
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,460
 Everyone can make their bones on the internet.

369
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,840
 So you have this wife, you have this mother.

370
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,620
 She runs an internet marketing firm.

371
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,660
 Because anybody could do it back then.

372
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,140
 She wrote ad copy.

373
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,100
 And what she would do is she would basically make the little boxes.

374
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,660
 She knew how to work the computer, do the HTML and GIFs and all that stuff, JPEGs.

375
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,460
 She would make those little rectangular boxes that would be at the bottom of all these websites.

376
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,140
 She would go to people and say, "I will make you an ad for this for 50 bucks each."

377
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,780
 And people are like, "You're a magician.

378
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,200
 You can make an image and put it on the web.

379
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,160
 You're, oh my God, you're amazing."

380
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,480
 Again, see, all of that stuff is automated now.

381
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,760
 But back then, it was just this magical time.

382
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,480
 She did it for all sorts of businesses.

383
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,340
 She had, like, brochures for home decor.

384
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,400
 She did ones for psychic phone hotlines.

385
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,840
 I got a psychic phone hotline story.

386
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 I'll tell that someday.

387
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,240
 I'll have to remember that.

388
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:22,740
 She also used them to market pornography, and it was specifically pornography that featured

389
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,540
 hypnotized or chloroformed women being assaulted against their will.

390
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,820
 She was really into that.

391
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,060
 She began, first she starts selling the ad copy, but then she starts involving herself

392
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,420
 in the websites.

393
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,420
 She starts posting under these aliases.

394
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,580
 She has all these different characters she's created, who she is talking to online.

395
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,960
 So she's writing stories, she's on the forum, but then she also has all these different

396
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,720
 characters she's created.

397
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,240
 She's talking to different men around the world, these fetishes she has.

398
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,720
 Now she would talk about really, really extreme stuff.

399
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,560
 So it wasn't, I mean, chloroforming and hypnotizing and drugging women, that is all falls under

400
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,320
 the veil of rape, rape fantasy.

401
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,360
 But she went past that.

402
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,520
 Her fantasy was to be tortured and killed.

403
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,500
 Wasn't a BDSM thing where she would simply be tortured and then the master would be like,

404
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 "Have you had enough?"

405
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,860
 And she'd be like, "Yes, yes."

406
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,500
 And then he unchains her and then they sit and drink a couple Bud Light and play Mario

407
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 Kart.

408
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,460
 Like that isn't what she wanted.

409
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,520
 She actually wanted to be tortured and killed.

410
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,660
 That was her ultimate sexual fantasy.

411
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,640
 And it was to a point she would talk about this so much online that a professional sex

412
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,480
 worker, a hooker, saw one of these posts and actually began communicating with her and

413
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
 saying, "Don't do this.

414
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,440
 Like you're going to take this too far."

415
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,280
 She could tell that there was something in the writings that said that she really wanted

416
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
 to do this.

417
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,720
 And Sharon's response was, "I really want this to happen to me.

418
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
 Go away.

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 I don't want to talk to you anymore.

420
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
 This is what I really want to happen."

421
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,700
 Now of course there are going to be a lot of takers out there.

422
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,500
 A lot of people who are already into, not of course, like that's totally common, but

423
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,820
 if you're already on one of these extreme fetish sites, a lot of people are going to

424
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
 be into it.

425
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,420
 But the thing is, is like after the fantasy is over, after they go, after basically they're

426
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,980
 done masturbating, they come to their senses and go, "Oh, that's a terrible idea."

427
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,660
 And then they stop communicating with the person.

428
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,260
 And then a couple days of guilt go on and they'll come back.

429
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,240
 But most people just see it as a fantasy.

430
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,560
 But Robert Glass was a little different.

431
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,440
 He was a computer analyst.

432
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,920
 And he was doing the same thing where he was trolling these fetish sites.

433
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,680
 But him and Sharon hadn't crossed the paths yet.

434
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,240
 But his wife found some stuff on his computer that she described as raw and disturbing and

435
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,560
 violent.

436
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 So she leaves him.

437
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,040
 Now he's home alone and this is the point where he meets Sharon.

438
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,260
 So now he's completely single, just sitting in front of his computer all day long, interacting

439
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,380
 with Sharon.

440
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,340
 On October 13th, Sharon tells her husband, "You know, I'm going to go visit some friends.

441
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,460
 I'm going to go visit some friends."

442
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
 And he's like, "Okay."

443
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,980
 You know, it doesn't really think anything of it.

444
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,780
 His wife packs up and leaves.

445
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,420
 But after she leaves, he finds a note.

446
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,100
 And she's saying she'll never come back to him.

447
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,160
 And in the note it says, "If my body is never retrieved, don't worry.

448
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,680
 Know that I am at peace."

449
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,240
 So her husband's obviously very concerned.

450
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,320
 He calls the police.

451
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,920
 And this is known as the very first time that the police had to like use the internet, like

452
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,320
 get into email servers and things like that to solve a crime.

453
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,720
 This is the very first time this ever happened was in 1996.

454
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,620
 People were still using fax machines.

455
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,820
 A lot of places were still using carbon copy.

456
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,700
 I've worked at, like when I worked at Best Buy, we still used green screen computers.

457
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,500
 And that was like in '99, 2000.

458
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,580
 Technology is very, very slow to move in the government and in corporate sector.

459
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,660
 So there's, the police are like, "Oh great, electronic mail.

460
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
 How are we supposed to do this?

461
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,140
 Okay, everyone, get your dial-up modems and let's go into AOL."

462
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,640
 I mean like completely outside the box for the police.

463
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,640
 But they have to do this because they have no idea where she went.

464
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,880
 The only thing the husband can say is she was on the computer all the time.

465
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,160
 So the cops have to get into her computer and just basically click on stuff.

466
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,760
 The investigative techniques were not there yet.

467
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,560
 They're like, "Well, did she get a virus?

468
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,280
 Did she get sucked into the computer via lawnmower man?

469
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,800
 We don't know."

470
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,520
 But what they do is they kind of start, they're not cavemen.

471
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,260
 They didn't bash the computer open with a rock and look for her.

472
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,500
 But where do you, you basically have a piece of technology that may or may not be linked

473
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,380
 to a missing person.

474
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,580
 Where do you start looking?

475
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,940
 You start looking in Word documents to see like draft letters of the suicide note or

476
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
 whatever it was.

477
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,380
 Nowadays when someone goes missing, the first thing you start looking at is phones and emails

478
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,540
 and stuff like that.

479
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,900
 But back then, this is the very first time.

480
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,700
 So she was in Maryland.

481
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,740
 Robert Glass was in North Carolina.

482
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,960
 I never really said where this stuff was going on.

483
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,760
 But I don't really, it's the internet so I don't really know how much that matters.

484
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,080
 But anyways, it is interstate.

485
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,560
 So the cops begin basically going through her computer and that is where they come across

486
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:32,200
 900 emails exchanged between Robert Glass and Sharon Lopatka.

487
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,320
 Now here's the thing, she communicated with tons of people.

488
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,600
 So it's not like they immediately just go, "Oh, look at 900 inbox for this one particular

489
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
 person.

490
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 They have to go through all this stuff."

491
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:49,260
 But they quickly zero in on him because of the violence and the cruelty and how recent

492
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,220
 those emails are.

493
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,620
 Those emails are talking about how much she wants to be tortured and killed.

494
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,100
 And they're basically going up to shortly before the day she disappeared.

495
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,460
 The police go to Glass's house and they're able to track him down.

496
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,580
 They know who he is now.

497
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,420
 People weren't there on aliases back then I guess.

498
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,800
 I guess even, well I guess he had to send her his address.

499
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,440
 But they do have his address and they go there.

500
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,660
 They find child pornography.

501
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,520
 They find a 357 magnum.

502
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
 They find drugs.

503
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,840
 They find bondage equipment in his house.

504
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:33,400
 And about 75 yards from his house they see some freshly disturbed soil.

505
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
 Cops go out there, start digging it up.

506
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,040
 They had a search warrant for all this by the way.

507
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
 They just didn't show up.

508
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,840
 He was at work when they showed up apparently.

509
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,660
 Which I don't know how the search warrant works on that but maybe if it's a murder they

510
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,260
 just have to have the warrant.

511
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,040
 They go, they dig it up, they find body parts in there.

512
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
 So they arrest them.

513
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
 They arrest Robert Glass.

514
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,300
 And what's interesting is he says, it was an accident.

515
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
 That's not the interesting part.

516
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,400
 But he was saying that, "Listen, she came out of my house.

517
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
 She really wanted me to kill her.

518
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
 She was totally down for the torture.

519
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,360
 I was down for the torture.

520
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 We were down for the sex.

521
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,640
 And she really wanted me to kill her.

522
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,880
 But in the end I didn't want to kill her.

523
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,160
 I didn't know how tight I was making the rope.

524
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
 And I killed her."

525
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,520
 Which means it probably wasn't like a long, because there's two different ways to strangle

526
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
 someone.

527
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,800
 You can compress the carotid arteries long enough to stop blood flow to the brain and

528
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
 causing brain death.

529
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
 That takes a while.

530
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,320
 Or just by choking someone you can crack the bone in their throat and that will kill

531
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
 them.

532
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
 They'll suffocate.

533
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,120
 So the long way to cut off like when you can put someone in a chokehold or sleeper hold,

534
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 you're cutting off blood flow to the brain.

535
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,400
 But if you do it wrong, you can actually break the little bone in your neck and you suffocate.

536
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,320
 I actually don't think you can hold someone's neck until they stop breathing unless you

537
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,320
 break that bone.

538
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,200
 I think you're always cutting the blood flow off to their brain.

539
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,720
 But anyways, he's saying, "Yes, I put the rope around her neck and I did torture her.

540
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,880
 It was totally consensual.

541
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 You guys read the emails.

542
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,440
 You know she came here for this.

543
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,200
 However, I was playing.

544
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,120
 I did not plan on actually killing her.

545
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
 She wanted me to kill her.

546
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,000
 I did not want to.

547
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
 Something went wrong and she died."

548
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,600
 The weird part is the coroner, the medical examiner, when he did his autopsy ruled it

549
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,480
 as an accidental death.

550
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,680
 He said this was not a homicide.

551
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,600
 This woman was accidentally killed.

552
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,920
 So it's interesting what the medical examiner must have seen because she was strangled with

553
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,000
 a rope.

554
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,160
 What the medical examiner must have seen to make him think she was not.

555
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
 It could have been the little broken piece of wind.

556
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,800
 It could have been the little broken bone.

557
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,040
 But who knows?

558
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,800
 But the medical examiner for the state ruled, yes, this was an accidental death.

559
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,200
 So now the police are like, "It's not.

560
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,960
 This guy killed this woman.

561
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
 It was a murder.

562
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,960
 It was a homicide."

563
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,680
 They're like, "Well, I mean, she did die, but we don't think it was premeditated."

564
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,280
 Even though they exchanged these emails talking about wanting to die and get tortured and all

565
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
 that stuff, we don't think it was premeditated homicide.

566
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,760
 This was the first time emails were ever used in an investigation or in a trial.

567
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,860
 Very, very first time in American history.

568
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,600
 So you had this brand new technology being used to try to convict this guy.

569
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,640
 He actually ended up pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter, which I basically, I think,

570
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,440
 involuntary manslaughter generally is like drunk driving.

571
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,880
 Voluntary manslaughter is, from what I understand, it could be wrong on this, is willingly engaging

572
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,400
 in an incredibly risky act that results in somebody dying.

573
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,960
 So drinking and driving might actually be voluntary manslaughter.

574
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,840
 Involuntary manslaughter would be like driving a tractor and accidentally driving it over

575
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,240
 a child.

576
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,720
 You could say the tractor was totally functional.

577
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,480
 You did something wrong that made you drive over that kid.

578
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,200
 That's involuntary manslaughter.

579
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,280
 Voluntary manslaughter, I believe, would be if you were doing stunts and a kid was sitting

580
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,080
 on the back of your tractor and you were popping wheelies and the kid falls off and gets mangled

581
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
 up.

582
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
 Horrible example.

583
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,440
 I don't know why I picked that one, but I think that's the difference.

584
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,320
 I think a lawyer could obviously prove me wrong, but he pleads guilty to voluntary manslaughter.

585
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,880
 He gets sentenced to 36 to 53 months in the state, which is three to five years, basically,

586
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,800
 three to six years, something like that for the killing of this woman.

587
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,120
 He got an additional 27 months of federal time after that for the child pornography possession.

588
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,760
 He had some magazines.

589
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,760
 So he has a heart attack the day before his federal sentence is supposed to start.

590
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,640
 He does do his two to five years in the state, and then before he gets transferred, he has

591
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,320
 a heart attack and dies.

592
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
 It's interesting.

593
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,520
 Two interesting things came out when I was researching this story.

594
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:53,720
 One, there is a particular fetish called autoassassinophilia, which is sexually aroused by the risk

595
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
 of being killed.

596
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,920
 We've talked about autoassassination.

597
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,280
 That's engaging and risky behavior.

598
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,680
 We talked about on that with the Smiley Face Killer episode.

599
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,520
 People, young men drinking and doing stupid stuff is known as autoassassination.

600
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,520
 They're basically killing themselves and doing risky things and dying.

601
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,800
 Straight racing would be autoassassination.

602
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,400
 Autoassassinophilia, however, that was the ultimate pleasure for her.

603
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,760
 She didn't want it to back down.

604
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,600
 She wanted to go as far as she could and then die, which seems kind of like a bizarre fetish

605
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 to have.

606
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,400
 It's so like, you never know if it's good because it just ends.

607
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:40,300
 I think the reason why I find it fascinating is that crime is such a part of our species.

608
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,440
 I don't think I could imagine a world without criminals.

609
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
 It would be nice.

610
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,840
 But even in the most utopian vision and the world of Star Trek, there is crime.

611
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,240
 People are still doing things and going to jail.

612
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,280
 They have jails and Starfleet and all that stuff.

613
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,640
 An idea of humanity without crime seems so alien.

614
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,480
 It almost seems dystopian.

615
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,800
 We think of crime as being a downside of free will.

616
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,320
 If you want to have free will, you have to accept a certain amount of crime in your society.

617
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,920
 You had a movie or story or a book where there was no crime in it where crime had been completely

618
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,200
 obliterated, it would seem like a totalitarian society where you had no sense of free will.

619
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,720
 So when we have these stories of these crimes for the very first time budding up against

620
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,000
 a brand new technological innovation, I always think that's fascinating.

621
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,640
 Without the internet, these two people probably never would have crossed paths.

622
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,400
 One would most likely be a grandmother by now.

623
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,440
 She would have had this unfulfilled fantasy because the chances of her running into someone

624
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,760
 like Robert Glass in her small town is infantesimal.

625
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,080
 And the chances of Robert Glass running into someone in his small town that wanted to be

626
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,360
 tortured infantesimal.

627
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,600
 But when we create the internet for all the good that has come out of it, we allow people

628
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:20,800
 with these super dark fantasies to meet across the state, across the globe.

629
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,000
 They can communicate, they can find each other.

630
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,800
 In some ways that may be good.

631
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,520
 You may feel completely alone in that no one in the world understands you.

632
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,720
 And when you find a forum of people who share the same interests as you do, you don't feel

633
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,800
 alone anymore.

634
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,600
 You finally have a place in the world.

635
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,760
 But if that forum is a place of people who revel in the destruction of others, the question

636
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,560
 is, in that situation, are you better off thinking no one else is like you?

637
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,200
 Are you better off thinking you're a freak and you are alone?

638
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:05,600
 You may be lonely, but you'll be alive.

639
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,320
