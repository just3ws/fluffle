1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
 A terror filled week in America.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,060
 And what that means for conspiracy theory.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:15,600
 And then we take a look at one of the most intriguing, yet almost unknown UFO encounters,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,120
 Operation Plate, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:28,060
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,960
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,920
 Let me say this too. I think the people who listen to this show, I think you've kind of got it, got it at this point.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,000
 Where the show is skeptical, but also enjoys researching this stuff and wants them to be true.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Wants these mysteries to be solved.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,960
 And if we solve it and it's fake, then we solve it and it's fake.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,080
 And if we solve it and it's mysterious, then that's cool too.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,560
 And I think the people, I've talked to a lot of you now through email, online, things like that.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,520
 And I think we kind of all have that same idea.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,760
 I basically what I'm saying is I think we're more discerning than the average conspiracy theorist,

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,560
 who will just believe any nonsense that has a good narrative behind it.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,060
 And I think that's what's happened, you know, last week.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,760
 We saw the results of that last week.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,000
 First off, we had a guy mail multiple bombs to people on the left, like Hillary Clinton,

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,520
 and Barack Obama, Robert De Niro, Cory Booker, and George Soros.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,560
 And the bombs didn't go off.

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,800
 There's been debate over whether or not the bombs are actually active.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,800
 There was a conspiracy theory early on saying that it was a Democrat mailing a bomb to other Democrats

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,120
 to make Republicans look bad, gain traction fairly quickly.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,040
 And I thought about doing an episode on it while it was going on.

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,200
 And I thought, no, I go, they're going to catch the guy really quick.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
 And I didn't really believe that conspiracy theory.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
 I thought it's possible, but it's unlikely.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,240
 The most likely scenario isn't the false flag.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,360
 The most likely scenario really is the guy doing it.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,160
 There's one scenario where it's a guy in his garage getting pissed off at CNN and sending a bomb.

32
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,960
 There's another scenario where you have a guy being like, so if I want to influence the election,

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:20,160
 I could go out and campaign or I can mail bombs to people that I like hoping that they'll get through the mail.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
 And then, you know, this whole like conspiracy thing, it just doesn't wash.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,680
 It's not that it hasn't happened before because it has.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
 But, and that's why I wanted to wait until the guy got caught because he easily could have got caught.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,160
 And that story could have had more weight.

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,120
 But the most likely scenario is usually that that'd be like if your liquor store got robbed

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,320
 and the police being like, where was your best friend that night?

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,280
 Because it's possible that your best friend robbed your liquor store to get you insurance money.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,520
 Now, does that happen?

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
 Yes.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,160
 But the most likely scenario is a random guy comes into your liquor store and robs it.

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,960
 It can happen where it is a set up crime, but nine times out of 10, it is an actual crime.

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,120
 Like I said, I could see where that conspiracy theory was coming from, but I just didn't.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
 I didn't want to do an episode on it because I wasn't sold that it was the case.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:18,240
 He believed in conspiracy theories that the political party opposite of him was so dastardly that he needed to send them bombs.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,240
 We have the guy in Philadelphia, I believe, who walked into a synagogue, killed 11 people.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,800
 Everyone he killed was like over 70.

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,280
 Shot a bunch of people, shot a bunch of cops.

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
 One of the cops is still critically injured.

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
 He gets shot.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
 He gives up 46 years old, only four years older than me.

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
 His life's over.

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,000
 Both of their lives are over.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
 The bomber guy's life is over too.

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,600
 They're going to spend the rest of their life in a very contained area.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,840
 They're not going to have any of the freedom they had before.

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,920
 So all their movements are going to be restricted.

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,320
 They're not going to be able to eat their favorite food or watch their favorite movies,

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,800
 stuff like that.

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,680
 Their lives are over.

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,400
 For what?

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
 For conspiracy theories, because they were obsessing over these theories.

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,680
 One, that the Democrats were this completely hostile force that is trying to change the structure of the planet.

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
 And the other one is just that Jews suck.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,320
 Like, Jews are so terrible that I have no problem blowing them away while they're in church.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,200
 Now, you could say that's not really a conspiracy theory,

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
 but it is in the sense because if you just thought,

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
 if I just said, you know, I don't like that particular ethnic group,

71
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
 I'm just not going to interact with them.

72
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,720
 But if I believe that ethnic group is trying to take over the planet,

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
 or they run the planet,

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,080
 or the reason why my American idol audition went poorly is because the Jews run Hollywood,

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,440
 that's where the conspiracy comes into the racism.

76
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,400
 You're letting the conspiracy theory paranoia mix with your already existing racist tendencies.

77
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,320
 Or in the other case, the politically of the conspiracy theory and your political beliefs.

78
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
 They're butting heads.

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
 Conspiracy theories can be really fun to investigate and a lot of fun to discuss,

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,640
 but when you obsess over this stuff, you can become like this guy, like these two guys.

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,160
 There are people who are so into conspiracy theories,

82
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,920
 they get fired from their jobs because no one wants to hear them talk about 9/11 or Flat Earth anymore.

83
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,760
 People who've lost friends over conspiracy theories because they can't let it go.

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,800
 And you, I've ran into people like that,

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,240
 I've never stopped being someone's friend because they believed in conspiracy theory.

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,080
 But I've met people and you're like,

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,960
 "It's going to talk to me about World War II not happening again, isn't it?"

88
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,240
 "Oh yeah, here he goes, Battle of Britain, that was all CGI, even though it didn't exist back then."

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,720
 Just trying to drink coffee.

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
 You can't obsess over this stuff, we can have fun talking about it.

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,760
 But when you let the...

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,120
 It's just like anything.

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,040
 You can have a fun hobby, but then when you start spending so much money,

94
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,720
 like magic the gathering,

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,040
 when you start spending so much money on the cards,

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,360
 you're actually not able to afford food for the next week

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
 because you just had to get this card, that's an obsession.

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
 And generally we can then go,

99
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,480
 "You know what, I shouldn't have spent all my money on these magic cards,

100
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,520
 did I really need that?"

101
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
 I don't know, Shiven Dragon.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,280
 I don't even know if that's still around, but that's how old I am.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,560
 "Do I really need that card? I'm eating Top Ramen for the next week and a half because I bought that card."

104
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
 But when it comes to conspiracy theories,

105
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
 people have a hard time to let go because they believe they have a moral duty

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,320
 to correct the conspiracy that they're dealing with.

107
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,040
 And they didn't, I don't know what these guys thought was going to happen.

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,200
 A couple of people were going to get bombs in the mail,

109
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
 a guy was going to shoot up a synagogue and...

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,640
 profit?

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,960
 Like what was the next step in this?

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
 Was it, I don't know.

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
 And I probably never will know what...

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,680
 I mean, did they expect like everyone to rise up and we were going to be the start of the Civil War?

115
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,080
 Or everyone realized, "Hey, there's a synagogue near me."

116
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
 That guy had a great idea.

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
 Like what was the end game for these guys?

118
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
 The end game that they're actually facing is life in prison.

119
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,920
 Neither of these guys will get out.

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,560
 Just nuts.

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
 Don't obsess over this stuff.

122
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
 And I don't know why I'm telling you that,

123
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,160
 because like I said, you guys are much more informed than the average conspiracy theorist, but...

124
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,600
 Oh, and I do have to say, I was looking through the photos of the...

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,640
 I was like, I was reading an article about the synagogue shootings.

126
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,480
 They showed these three Jewish people.

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,520
 I think there was a girl in it.

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
 There was two dudes and a girl standing out on their stoop in the area,

129
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
 talking after the shooting.

130
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,840
 And one of them had a smile on his face.

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
 And the first thing I thought of,

132
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,040
 the very first thing that popped in my head was, "God damn it."

133
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,360
 I'm going to see this photo for the next three years online.

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,040
 And they're like, "Look, false flag.

135
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,120
 Why would a Jewish person be smiling after a massacre?"

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
 False flag.

137
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
 I was like, "Oh, fuck."

138
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
 Because here's the truth.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
 That's just the way these things go.

140
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,920
 They...

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,360
 People who don't know anything about grief or tragedy will see a picture of a person smiling.

142
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,600
 And they don't know who they're talking to,

143
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,960
 or who the person smiling is,

144
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
 or how long after the shooting the photo was taken.

145
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,400
 If it's taken place after the last bullet casing hit the ground,

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,760
 might be a little weird.

147
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,720
 If it was...

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
 If the photo was taken 10 hours later and a guy's kind of just,

149
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,040
 "Hey, man, what's going on?"

150
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
 It kind of gives that...

151
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,520
 That split second of a smile,

152
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
 and that's when the camera takes it.

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,560
 Because I've seen that so many...

154
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
 Why would this person be joking after this tragedy?

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
 Must be false.

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,400
 Must be a false flag.

157
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
 I've been researching this stuff long enough.

158
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,200
 When I saw that photo, I thought,

159
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
 "I'm going to see this photo everywhere.

160
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,640
 I'm going to see this photo everywhere."

161
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,440
 Okay, let's go ahead and get on to some fun stuff.

162
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
 And by fun stuff,

163
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,880
 I mean UFOs actually killing people.

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,000
 Now, this story I had never heard of before,

165
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,680
 and I'm going to assume most of you have never heard of it either.

166
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,360
 But it is one of the biggest UFO encounters

167
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,120
 that I've ever come across,

168
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,280
 for amount of witnesses,

169
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,960
 length of time,

170
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,520
 and interactions with humans.

171
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,960
 This was a recommendation from Xenial.

172
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 So Xenial lives in Brazil.

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
 And that's where we're going to go.

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,840
 We're going to get in our carpenter copter,

175
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
 trademark,

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
 hop in the carpenter copter.

177
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,200
 We're going to fly to Brazil.

178
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
 Now, as we're flying to Brazil,

179
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,280
 we're going to fly over the Bermuda Triangle

180
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,720
 because we have to also go back in time.

181
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
 So we're going back to the year 1977.

182
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,760
 So Brazil during the 70s,

183
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
 from like the 60s to the 80s,

184
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,320
 it was ruled by...

185
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,840
 There was a military coup back in the 60s.

186
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,080
 They took over and they became a more repressive regime

187
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,960
 with state departments help with the United States

188
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,440
 because we didn't like the way the country was.

189
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,080
 United States really worked a number over on South America.

190
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,160
 But military takes over the country in the 60s.

191
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
 And they restrict a lot of things like freedom

192
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,960
 of speech and press and things like that.

193
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,720
 And they were like throwing leftists and communists in prison

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,160
 because they were having issues with that.

195
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
 That's why we were down there because

196
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
 Soviet Union was trying to go down there and so on and so forth.

197
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,840
 You know where the term "third world" comes from?

198
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,080
 America was classified as "first world"

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,560
 and all of our allies were "first world."

200
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,280
 Soviet Union was considered second world.

201
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
 That was a designation.

202
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,440
 All of their allies were second world countries.

203
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
 And third world meant a country that was not affiliated

204
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,160
 with the United States or the Soviet Union.

205
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
 So they tended to be poor.

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,840
 And that's then the term just became "third world country."

207
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
 To mean a poor country or a slum.

208
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,640
 So that's where that term comes from.

209
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,320
 So at this point in time,

210
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 you still had factions from the Soviet Union

211
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
 supporting troops in South America

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
 and we were supporting governments or rebels in South America.

213
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
 Proxy wars, basically.

214
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,080
 Now, Zeno has been a great source of information on this.

215
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
 For one, I never knew this existed.

216
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,040
 And for two, he was able to give me kind of

217
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,840
 a ground level view of this area.

218
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
 So we're going to go, this is October 9th,

219
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
 this very, very well documented.

220
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,080
 And again, it's bizarre that it's not more well known.

221
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,600
 October 1977.

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
 We're going to go, we're landing the Carpentercopter.

223
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
 We're going to land on Calaris Island.

224
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
 Now Calaris Island, and it's a fishing village.

225
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,520
 It has a population at the time, a couple thousand people.

226
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,600
 And they were simple people.

227
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,680
 They didn't have television.

228
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
 They weren't reading science fiction novels

229
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,120
 or watching Star Trek.

230
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
 They just were a working class people.

231
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,840
 That's what they focused on.

232
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,400
 So one night, this villager was laying in their bed

233
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,640
 and a bright light appeared over the house.

234
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,280
 Now, she wasn't really aware of it at the time,

235
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,880
 but she first kind of looks up

236
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
 and she sees kind of the light coming through

237
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,560
 the cracks of her roof.

238
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,640
 She had like a ceramic tile roof.

239
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,360
 And the light gets brighter and brighter and brighter.

240
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,040
 And then she said she could see through her roof.

241
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,280
 And then her skin, her skin on her thigh begins to burn.

242
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,400
 And then the light goes away.

243
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,840
 And she didn't understand it,

244
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,480
 because again, there's no context for this type of thing.

245
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,840
 Now, nowadays you'd be like, oh my god, that was UFO

246
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,360
 and alien came down in my house.

247
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,520
 But if you weren't reading comic books,

248
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
 if you weren't watching those television shows,

249
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 if you're just living your life in a fishing village,

250
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,960
 you would be like, you would, I think,

251
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,600
 probably more likely accounted to a devil

252
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
 or something supernatural.

253
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,880
 A couple days later, some fishermen were out fishing

254
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
 and they saw these bright lights overhead.

255
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,400
 I think it was two or three of them flying around.

256
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,960
 And from what I understood from the story,

257
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
 they were getting ready to get in their boat.

258
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,160
 They see the lights, it freaks them out.

259
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
 They start running back to the village.

260
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,120
 The lights follow them.

261
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,960
 They felt like they were being pursued.

262
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
 When they get back to town,

263
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,600
 they start talking about this.

264
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,640
 And it turns out that other people in the village were like,

265
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,600
 yeah, I saw the lights too.

266
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,920
 They're chasing me around.

267
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,080
 And I didn't want to tell anyone

268
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
 because it made me sound like a crazy person.

269
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,560
 And then other people were like, yeah, I was in my house

270
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
 and the light was over my house.

271
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
 And it came through my ceiling.

272
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
 So the people in the village start talking

273
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
 and they realize that this has been going on

274
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
 and no one was admitting to it.

275
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
 But now they're like, okay,

276
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
 we don't know what this stuff is,

277
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,480
 but whatever, like, I guess just kind of deal with it.

278
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
 It doesn't go away though.

279
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,840
 It actually gets worse.

280
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,520
 The activity gets worse.

281
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,000
 People are starting to get bitten, for lack of a better word.

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,160
 The beam of light would come on you and you'd be frozen.

283
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
 And they started calling the lights in the skies

284
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,640
 chupa-chupas, which means suck, suck.

285
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,680
 And again, that's how, I don't want to say that.

286
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,840
 I'm not saying simple like they're idiots,

287
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,680
 but that's how simple their cultural language

288
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,840
 was to describe this type of thing.

289
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,560
 Because what would happen was that burning sensation

290
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,600
 on your skin, it would basically put little marks on your skin

291
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 and it would burn you.

292
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,000
 It was later described as looking like a burn that had,

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,400
 it looked like it was like this black burn.

294
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,720
 Someone compared it to a thing called an iodine burn,

295
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,840
 but it would burn in and you'd have these little puncture wounds

296
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,800
 and you'd have a little bit of blood, just a little bit.

297
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,040
 And so they believed that it was sucking out their blood

298
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,400
 or sucking out their life force.

299
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,440
 They called them chupa-chupas because they're saying,

300
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,000
 "Oh, there's something biting me and sucking the blood out.

301
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
 Now again, we would be like, no, that's an alien warship.

302
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,160
 That's a UFO."

303
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
 But in their culture, they're just like, well, it sucks.

304
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,280
 So it's a suck-suck.

305
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,360
 There were professional people in the village.

306
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,280
 There was a doctor and a couple nurses who worked there.

307
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,280
 And people are coming in and they're like,

308
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,520
 "Hey, Betty, what's going on?"

309
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,880
 They're like, "Oh, I couldn't sleep last night.

310
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,200
 Why not?"

311
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
 And they're like, "Oh, you know, the chupa-chupa was flying overhead."

312
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,600
 Now what?

313
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,400
 Because generally the people, you had this rural village

314
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,000
 and sometimes in these areas, you would live,

315
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,400
 the professionals would live in the city and commute to the work.

316
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,560
 So it's not like they were there every single day.

317
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,840
 The doctor, it doesn't want to live in a shack.

318
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,120
 He's a doctor.

319
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,600
 So the doctor would live in the nearest big city

320
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
 and then they would commute to work into these villages.

321
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
 Now the medical staff had heard these stories

322
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,480
 about these chupa-chupas, but they didn't experience them.

323
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,680
 They were just seeing people coming with bites and burns.

324
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,440
 And they thought there has to be a vampire bat.

325
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,840
 It has to be some sort of, or it's self-mutilation.

326
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,480
 That was another thing.

327
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,960
 They're like, "Are these people looking for attention?

328
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,720
 They're just poking themselves with stuff?"

329
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,200
 "I don't know. I don't think so."

330
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,880
 You know, and they're kind of looking at it.

331
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,320
 Now this kept going on.

332
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,560
 The lights kept showing up.

333
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,320
 And two things kind of happened at the same time

334
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,280
 that caused the investigation to start.

335
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,920
 One was the ships, the lights, however you want to describe them.

336
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
 Because sometimes they would say they looked metallic,

337
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,960
 but most of the villagers only saw the light.

338
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,520
 Actually, you know what?

339
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,800
 That's an interesting point.

340
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,680
 That's a really, really interesting point.

341
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,400
 Damn it.

342
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
 I wish someone was here, so I could say,

343
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,920
 "Remind me to talk about that."

344
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,440
 And let me write this down here real quick,

345
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,960
 because I don't want to get ahead of myself.

346
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,880
 I'm writing it on my hand, like a four-year-old.

347
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,760
 Okay, so two things happened at once.

348
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,560
 One, the villagers who were fishing, that is their job.

349
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,760
 That is their livelihood.

350
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,720
 They are fishermen.

351
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,480
 And the ships were flying overhead while they were...

352
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,720
 Why?

353
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,680
 Because it wasn't something you would just see right before you go to bed.

354
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
 It wasn't a dream.

355
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
 You'd be out fishing at night.

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,920
 You'd see these lights overhead and you're like,

357
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,080
 "Damn it, I gotta get these fish."

358
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,880
 But what happened was the ships would sometimes dive underwater.

359
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
 And so it started to give rise to the theory

360
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,920
 that maybe they were coming out of underwater caves.

361
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,560
 They weren't like, again, UFOs from another planet.

362
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
 They were coming from somewhere underwater nearby.

363
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,360
 But when they came into the water,

364
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,080
 sometimes they would go under the boats,

365
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
 or just splash into the water in general.

366
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,600
 It would scare all the fish.

367
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,440
 And so you had these people, they're like,

368
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,600
 "Yes, it sucks. I get sucked sucked every night by this weird light.

369
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,360
 But I don't care as long as I can catch fish and sell them.

370
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,400
 I really don't care."

371
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,200
 And they weren't able to catch fish and sell them.

372
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,880
 So they started complaining and they said,

373
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,240
 "You need to get the military out here."

374
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,160
 Because this is an untenable situation.

375
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
 At the same time, in the villages, you had people...

376
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,680
 Because it was so ongoing.

377
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,880
 You had people going, "I'm leaving.

378
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,680
 I'm out of here.

379
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,000
 I'm so tired of being chased around by these lights."

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,840
 Now, there were reports in other villages

381
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,040
 that they also saw them, but it was mostly on this island.

382
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,880
 And so people just started packing up.

383
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,040
 A lot of the women and children left.

384
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,400
 Because it didn't matter where you were at.

385
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,160
 If you stayed in your house, they'd show up.

386
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
 If you were walking around outside in the dark, they'd show up.

387
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
 It didn't matter.

388
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,040
 And then the men...

389
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,240
 So you had that...

390
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
 You had that migration going on.

391
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,920
 You had the men who were there who were like,

392
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,840
 "Maybe if we light these huge bonfires

393
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
 and shoot fireworks off and try to scare them away."

394
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,360
 And it didn't work.

395
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,760
 Now, you're the Brazilian government.

396
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,680
 And you know, you got a lot of stuff on your plate.

397
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,440
 You're fighting communist insurgents.

398
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,280
 You got two superpowers talking about nuking each other all the time.

399
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
 You have political dissidents.

400
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,720
 And then you hear, on this little island out in northern Brazil,

401
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
 you're getting reports of mass migrations.

402
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,280
 You're getting reports of fireworks being shot off

403
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,080
 all night long.

404
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
 And you're getting reports of angry fishermen

405
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,520
 demanding the government do something about these flying lights.

406
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,600
 Now, this is one of the curious...

407
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,280
 This is one of the kind of curious things about this story.

408
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,040
 And I think the story is curious in general.

409
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,320
 So what happens is the Brazilian government says,

410
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,720
 "Okay, this is what we think is going on.

411
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
 We think that there are communist troops in the area.

412
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,000
 And they're using the superstitions of the locals to frighten them away

413
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,640
 so they can move supplies and troops through that area.

414
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,120
 We think that's what it is.

415
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
 However, we have to investigate it to find out if that theory is true."

416
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,000
 So they put together a team of soldiers led by Captain Holland.

417
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,560
 I'm probably pronouncing that wrong,

418
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,680
 but he's going to be a pivotal character coming forward.

419
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
 Halanda, Captain Holland.

420
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,520
 So he was led by Captain Holland.

421
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,080
 But anyway, so the Brazilian government basically tells...

422
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,960
 Because Captain Holland ended up doing a big interview after the events.

423
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
 But he said the Brazilian government's basically like,

424
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,200
 "Hey, we think there's communist insurgents in there.

425
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,840
 We need you to take your men in and investigate this."

426
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,360
 And Captain Holland goes, "Okay, that's fair.

427
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,000
 He'd been fighting drug gangs and he'd been fighting communists and stuff like that."

428
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,600
 But they named it Operation Plate in English, or Operation Saucer.

429
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,720
 And the question is, if their working theory was that it was communists,

430
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,640
 why would they name it basically Operation UFO?

431
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,720
 Operation Saucer, Operation Plate.

432
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,640
 It would be operational.

433
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
 I mean, I don't know.

434
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,960
 Maybe the Brazilian government always has a sense of humor when they name their operations.

435
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,760
 But that was a curious thing.

436
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,680
 So you think maybe they had more info in the inside of what actually was out there

437
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,120
 when they came up with that name.

438
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
 So anyways, Captain Holland goes out there with his troops

439
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,560
 and they start interviewing the townspeople.

440
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,360
 And the townspeople are like, "Yeah, you know, these things are flying around."

441
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,560
 Now at this point, at this point, the military there is investigating it.

442
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,120
 And again, on the ground, they're thinking communists.

443
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,760
 And also at this point, like I said, the doctors and the nurses,

444
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,840
 now they're saying, "I saw it too."

445
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,080
 Like, I didn't believe them for the longest time.

446
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,520
 They're doing interviews.

447
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
 They're interviewing all the villagers.

448
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,000
 They're talking to them.

449
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
 They're like, "Yeah, you know, they're messing with our fish.

450
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,640
 We tried doing this.

451
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,440
 We tried doing that.

452
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
 You know, a bunch of our people had left the area."

453
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,920
 And they thought, "Okay, these people are just superstitious bumpkins.

454
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,080
 These are like basically hillbillies.

455
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,120
 They'll believe anything."

456
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,520
 But the military starts to see these things as well, these lights in the sky.

457
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,440
 Now they're a little better equipped.

458
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,800
 They come out with cameras.

459
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,240
 They come out with film cameras.

460
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
 They come out with, you know, film, like photography cameras.

461
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,480
 And Captain Alonzo said, you know, I went in with the idea that we were going to find

462
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
 some sort of insurgent group.

463
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,720
 I started seeing the stuff and I'm like, "Okay, that, what I'm looking at,

464
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,800
 must be some sort of weapon that the communists are using."

465
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,640
 He's still stuck to that story.

466
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,920
 First he thought the communists were basically like just spooky noises and making like stuff

467
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,080
 in the sky to make the villagers leave.

468
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,040
 Now that he's seeing it and talking to the people first hand,

469
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,360
 he's still thinking it's the communist or a superpower, the United States or

470
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,640
 Soviet Union, flying these things around and hurting people.

471
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,080
 Like he's on the ground now.

472
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,760
 He's seeing it, but he's still working with that scenario.

473
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,200
 And then he has an encounter.

474
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 Now this one was, this was really interesting.

475
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
 He talks about this during his interview.

476
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,120
 He was, I believe he was in his house and or not, or not in his house, but he was in the village.

477
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,440
 He was in a house and he goes, something came up from behind me and grabbed me.

478
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,520
 And he goes, it hugged me, which might be a translation error, but he goes, it was where I

479
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,240
 could see it.

480
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,400
 He goes, it was wearing a mask and it had on like a astronaut suit, but he said it was really

481
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
 kind of baggy.

482
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,200
 And he said it, it said in Portuguese, be cool.

483
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,920
 We're not going to hurt you.

484
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,120
 And he got burned.

485
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,080
 Captain Holanda, this veteran of the Brazilian military who's fought drug gangs and communists

486
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,320
 is showing off in his video an implant under his arm.

487
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
 Now it could just be an optical illusion, but he's pushing on his muscle and you see

488
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,840
 basically in Xenia was the, it's funny because when Xenia was telling me this story,

489
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,840
 he knew people who were involved in the village.

490
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
 That's where I was getting this story from Xenia.

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,720
 And I can't get too much information because you'll see how the story ends, but Xenia knew

492
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,160
 people who were active in the village at the time this happened.

493
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,400
 And one of the people that he knew said in the seventies, this person who was in the

494
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
 village was saying they're putting implants under the skin.

495
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
 They're putting these weird implants under the skin.

496
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,560
 So the story was being told to Xenia about five years ago, seven years ago.

497
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,560
 The person who had lived there and worked there or in whatever capacity was in that

498
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
 village in 1977.

499
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,000
 This person tells Xenia, have you ever seen a SIM card?

500
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,720
 It looked like SIM cards, even though that had never even existed back then.

501
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,920
 The person was saying when I was looking at these villagers, it looked like they had,

502
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,480
 I didn't know how to explain it back then, they just have these little pieces and they

503
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,160
 felt like plastic under their skin.

504
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,800
 But now that I look back on them, they have the same similar size and shape to a SIM card.

505
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,240
 It's interesting because I'm watching this documentary and Captain Holanda goes,

506
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,240
 he's pushing his arm and you see, it looks like a SIM card.

507
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,320
 Not necessarily a SIM card because those are small, but like an SD card under the skin.

508
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,040
 And the interviewers ask him, they go, have you had an X-ray?

509
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,720
 He said, yeah, it doesn't show up on an X-ray.

510
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,120
 So anyways, about a month or two into the investigation, this is also according to

511
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,040
 Xenia's source in the investigation, about a month or two during, while the military was

512
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:07,840
 checking this out, the US government sent officials down to Brazil and had a chat

513
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,240
 and the investigation was called off.

514
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,440
 Military out there, Captain Holanda and his troops packed up all their stuff, came back home.

515
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,320
 The lights actually started a phase out, they didn't have the issue, they went away.

516
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:27,280
 And to this day, that region's relatively UFO free, still has all of the weird supernatural

517
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,640
 stuff you can attribute to any sort of rural area, but the lights, the chupa-chupas are gone.

518
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
 Now, I want to go back to this because I wrote it on my hand.

519
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,680
 It's interesting because the villagers always describe them as lights in the sky, red lights,

520
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,920
 blue lights, they would change color and depending on the color, it would do something different to

521
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,440
 you. A red light, it would burn you, a white light, it would freeze you. They're green lights,

522
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,160
 but they always describe them as lights. When nurses, doctors, and military officials, so

523
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:06,240
 professional educated people, saw them, they refer to them as metallic. They could specify the shape,

524
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,960
 they could go that was a cigar shape, that was a saucer, that was a triangle.

525
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,720
 And I think that lends something to the theory that it's almost this trans-dimensional thing,

526
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,600
 where your mind is creating what you would most likely believe in. So to a villager,

527
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,480
 a light in the sky is creepy enough. They've seen meteors and comets and all sorts of like stuff,

528
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
 but to see like an oval-shaped light floating overhead chasing you, that's creepy enough.

529
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,720
 But to a professional, they want to, they have to see the structure for it to make sense. They

530
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,360
 have to see the underbelly of the ship and they have to see the cockpit and stuff like that.

531
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,760
 Otherwise, it's just a weird disc light in the sky. But I think that's an interesting thing,

532
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:00,000
 is that the people with education saw them as physical vehicles with cockpits and the people

533
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,120
 who are simple fishermen just saw these weird lights in the sky. The UFO phenomenon may actually

534
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,480
 be beyond our understanding, because stuff like that pops up. Now we're going to jump ahead to

535
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,800
 the year 1997. There was actually a UFO magazine published in Brazil, and what's so funny watching

536
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,960
 the video you can, you know is 1997, because these two UFOologists are sitting down with Captain

537
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,560
 Holanda to do an interview. The key witness in one of the biggest UFO cases really, and one of

538
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,800
 them is wearing an X-File shirt. One of the UFOologists is straight up wearing a T-shirt that has the X-Files logo on it.

539
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,560
 But what happened was in 1997, Captain Holanda contacted this UFO magazine and says, "I have a

540
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,480
 story to tell you. I'm going to tell you the story about what really happened on Calaris Island."

541
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,160
 So he goes, he gives this big interview, and he said, "Yeah, I don't know what it was.

542
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,040
 To this day, I don't know what it was. I'm not going to say it was aliens or anything like that."

543
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,920
 But he talks about his journey from not believing it at all and believing it was a military operation.

544
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:14,000
 But he says, he's drawn pictures from it and stuff. He goes, "We took like 4,000 pages of documents.

545
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,160
 There's hundreds of photos. There's film of this stuff." And the UFOologists are like,

546
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,120
 "You photos of the lights?" And he's like, "Oh yeah, we have a ton of documents on this thing."

547
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,800
 And it's really kind of a cool interview. And at this point, he's retired from the military.

548
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,040
 And he's like, "You know, I'm retired. Just wanted to tell you guys this cool story."

549
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:40,640
 Now, shortly after that interview, Captain Holanda dies. And he dies. They find him with,

550
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,040
 I believe it was like a bathrobe belt or might just been a normal belt wrapped around his neck.

551
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,080
 And it was wrapped around a bed post. And you just kind of slump down and it slowly cuts off your

552
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,280
 circulation. It's not an easy way to die. Don't get any good tips. There was obviously two camps.

553
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,400
 One of them said he was murdered for revealing too much about cholera. And then the other camp

554
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,440
 was, no, he had suffered from mental illness. Some people said that he had attempted suicide in the

555
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,680
 past and he killed himself. Xenio said that his sources were like, he never would have killed

556
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,640
 himself. Absolutely wanted to kill himself. When you're in the Brazilian military, you have to go

557
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,440
 through regular psychiatric screenings because depending on where you're deployed, because

558
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,160
 it's such an aggressive job. It's very dark. You're out in the jungles. You're fighting cocaine,

559
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,440
 gangs and stuff like that. So people who knew Captain Holanda personally were like, there's no

560
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,680
 way that he would have killed himself. It just doesn't sound like him. It was interesting in the

561
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,280
 documentary. So the only documentary I could find in English was from UFO files. I'll put the link

562
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,160
 in YouTube. But one of the UFOologists who interviewed Captain Holanda before he passed away

563
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,120
 said, "I think he killed himself." He goes, "I personally think he killed himself. I think he

564
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,400
 was struggling with depression." He goes, "But he wanted to tell this story before he did it."

565
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,680
 He could have been murdered or covered up though, definitely. He could have been murdered to send

566
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,440
 a message to people in the future, "Hey, we don't talk about this stuff in Brazil." However, so

567
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,160
 what comes of this, he tells a story, it gets a ton of attention in Brazil. The heads of the UFO

568
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:22,800
 who do the UFO magazine and other UFOologists in Brazil, they lobby the government. So what happens

569
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,720
 is eventually the military junta, they're gone. So they left in 1985. In 1997, it's a much more

570
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,040
 free society. They eventually petitioned successfully to get access to the documents from

571
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,200
 Captain Holanda's investigation into the chupa chupas. And the Air Force is like, "Sure, whatever,

572
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,440
 we don't care." But they only gave them a couple. They're like, "Oh, well, you give you like this

573
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,240
 small amount that you can look at." Drawing after drawing, detailed drawings of what the people on

574
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,080
 the ground were seeing, photos of these lights. And it really was a treasure trove for UFOology.

575
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,760
 And that's where we're at today. Nobody knows, or nobody's saying at least, what those lights were.

576
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,080
 Oh, and I should add, I might as well want to say this early. Two people died during this.

577
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,840
 The nurses said that they had two casualties from getting too much blood sucked out of them or

578
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,600
 shock. They did lose two villagers. Dozens of people were bitten by the little chupa chupa.

579
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,800
 The whole entire village was in fear of these things. Everyone was being chased around by these

580
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:35,200
 guys. So let's do a little breakdown here. First off, as a skeptic, as a fair weather skeptic,

581
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,760
 I believe the event actually took place. Whatever it was, I think it happened. If it had been

582
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,760
 five guys in a pickup truck, it would be easier to say, well, they're probably just making it up for

583
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,400
 money. But, you know, a thousand people in the village, all these witnesses, all these victims,

584
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,960
 military coming out, taking the photos, all that stuff. I believe the event actually happened.

585
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,560
 The question is, what were they? The theories are mastostaria, mastollusion. And that's possible,

586
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,440
 but what kind of throws that off is that once the outsiders came in, they shouldn't have seen them

587
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,280
 as well. I could see a religious fervor in an area, people freaking out, but once you have the

588
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,840
 outsiders show up, they shouldn't have seen them as well. So I'm not really buying the mastollusion

589
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:30,320
 thing, but it's possible. It's possible. The weapon of a superpower, I honestly think that that is

590
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,640
 the most likely scenario. That it wasn't aliens, that either the United States was testing a weapon

591
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,120
 or the Soviet Union was testing a weapon. I think that's the most likely scenario,

592
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,200
 because again, I believe that it actually happened. I believe the stories that we've talked about

593
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,080
 tonight really did happen. And the reason why they kind of put the nail in the coffin,

594
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
 for me on that, was Captain Hollanda's story where the guy comes up behind him,

595
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,560
 wearing the mask and hat. He said the skin looked loose like a baggy suit.

596
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,000
 And I think that would make me think. Captain Hollanda, when he's talking about the story,

597
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,240
 seemed to tell the story as if it was a man in a suit. He said he had a mechanical computer voice

598
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,160
 but spoke perfect Portuguese and says, "Be cool, we're not here to hurt you."

599
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,360
 And he goes, "I couldn't really see the eyes." He drew a picture of it. It looks like a gray,

600
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:32,080
 but a smaller head and kind of slit eyes. But even though he got a close up, a close encounter

601
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,040
 of the third kind, he didn't seem to think they were aliens. So I think that we were testing

602
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,760
 something or Soviet Union was testing something. Here's the pushback on that though. If that is

603
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,760
 the case, if it is a weapon that humans have developed, how come we're still not using it?

604
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,720
 Did we find it ineffective overall? Was it a way to try to freak people out

605
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,600
 and get them to leave the area? But again, it seemed like it drew the military to the area,

606
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,120
 rather than the opposite. If it was a weapon system that humans developed, why don't we use it today?

607
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,840
 Or do we? And then the third thing is like, is it alien visitors? Whether they're aliens from

608
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
 another planet or they have a base under the water or they're coming from another dimension,

609
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,960
 was it aliens? Now, I think it's less likely than it was man-made, but again, it's possible. And then

610
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,120
 you have to look at why they were sucking the blood out of people. What do the SIM cards mean?

611
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,360
 Why were they in this remote area? Why were they around for so long in this particular area?

612
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,680
 And being observed by multiple observers, even when the military came in, they were still there.

613
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:42,720
 It was a crazy story and it lasted a long time. People died. People got burned, attacked, followed.

614
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,480
 And I think Xenio for bringing the story to my attention, because I had never heard any of this

615
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,520
 stuff. I think this is more intriguing than something like Roswell, where a ship crashed,

616
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,600
 or Rendleship Forest, where like, oh, we saw light through the forest. This went on for weeks and

617
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:05,200
 weeks and weeks and weeks. Operation plate. And remember, the UFOologists only got access to

618
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,000
 a small amount of the documentation that was created from that military operation. What is in

619
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,600
 the rest of those files? And will we ever see them? Probably not. But I think it may give us a little

620
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:26,400
 more answers to what at least the government truly thought was going on out there. Like I said,

621
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,440
 I'm leaning towards humans and then aliens come in second. And if both of those, if either one of

622
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,640
 those is accurate, that means those chupa-chupas are still out there somewhere. Maybe they're sitting

623
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,520
 in a hangar getting tweaked for their next mission, or maybe they're underwater somewhere

624
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,000
 getting ready for their next snack. Dead Rabbit Radio at gmail.com is going to be your email address.
