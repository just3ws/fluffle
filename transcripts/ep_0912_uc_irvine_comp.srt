1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
 A humorous story takes a dark turn as disgusting criminals lurk in the darkness all around

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,520
 us.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,400
 And then we take a trip to the University of California, Irvine.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,520
 Is it possible that this college is infused with such dark energy?

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,000
 It has become a perpetual suicide machine today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,680
 I'm your host, Zazen Garminer, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,160
 day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,640
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,640
 Everyone give it up for Cobalt.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
 Woo!

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
 Yeah!

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
 Come on in Cobalt!

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
 Yeah, yeah!

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,640
 Cobalt, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,720
 Sorry, I didn't really give you high five.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,600
 Cobalt, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
 This episode, if you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you don't want to get sorry,

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
 that's fine too.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,840
 Just helps read the word about the show.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
 That really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,840
 Give me a hug, Cobalt.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,920
 Sorry, sorry that I took you like that.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,040
 Cobalt, let's go ahead and dig.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
 I have a bowl of keys.

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,000
 Like it's a 1970s swinger party here.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,680
 I'm gonna reach into the bowl of keys at random, and I'm gonna pull out the keys to the Dead

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,880
 Rabbit Durgeable Cobalt, or leave me behind Dead Rabbit Command, take the controls.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
 We're flying all the way out to a house in a suburban neighborhood.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:40,720
 A long time ago, I did an episode about what I thought was a haunted website.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,120
 I had never found such a website that when you go into it, you just feel so gross.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:51,160
 I'm not even talking about stuff like Best Gore or Rotten.com, stuff like that.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
 It was on Reddit.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,760
 Of course, Reddit is a cesspool.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
 I can't stand Reddit.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
 I have to use it all the time for the show, but before that, I never used it.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
 Reddit.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,640
 I hate Reddit.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,640
 Reddit allows the most disgusting people to congregate and to hang out for untold amounts

41
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,140
 of time.

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,560
 You can find the grossest things on Reddit.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,280
 I talked about a haunted website that I thought I'd come across because you feel so gross

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,800
 when you're hanging out in it.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,440
 It is the subreddit called Sex Offender Support.

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
 Sex Offender Support.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,560
 This is a place where people who are convicted of sex crimes can communicate with each other.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,480
 So you can imagine how gross this is.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,240
 And I remember saying at the end of this episode, I'm never going back to it.

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
 This place is so disgusting.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
 I don't ever want to go back to it.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,160
 However, we're talking about it again.

53
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,840
 Cobalt's turning the Dead Rabbit Durgable around.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
 No, no, no, no.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,200
 We're talking about it again because, listen, man, just like the Mafia, you think you're

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,680
 out and they pull you back in, this stuff is so insane that I, of course, I was going

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
 to go back, right?

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,520
 Of course, I was eventually going to find my way back here.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
 And this story starts off quite hilarious.

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
 This funny story can be about this topic.

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,120
 I think this setup is funny, right?

62
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
 I think this setup is funny.

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,240
 So on Sex Offender Support, and I will say this, it's so interesting.

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,560
 I'm all over the internet.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,520
 I've been reading stuff, not just on the internet, but published and comments and everything,

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
 right?

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
 You read all sorts of stuff.

68
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,920
 The people on Sex Offender subreddit are the dumbest of the dumb.

69
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,320
 And I'm not just talking about their belief system.

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,480
 I'm talking about the way they write.

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,320
 Grammatically, it's really bad.

72
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
 It's so interesting.

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,360
 These people are truly idiots.

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,040
 Regardless of whatever crime they've done, which is just disgusting, they're idiots.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,440
 They're stupid.

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,440
 They actually have terrible grammar.

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,240
 Like, "Jayce, really?

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,520
 That's your first takeaway from a Sex Offender Support subreddit?"

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
 What?

80
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,440
 They didn't use a period in that sentence.

81
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,920
 Anyways, they're all morons.

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,600
 And this guy posted this on his Sex Offender subreddit.

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,680
 This guy goes by the name "Ancient Answer 159."

84
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,680
 He's deleted his account now, but I archive a bunch of this stuff.

85
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:13,120
 For the show note, "Sex Offender Support, Ancient Answer 159, got arrested for a sex crime case."

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
 They're always really cagey about what they're talking about.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
 He's currently under house arrest.

88
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,400
 He's waiting for his trial to happen.

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,920
 He's under something called "Level One House Arrest."

90
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,120
 It's all different by state.

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,000
 I couldn't figure out, like, we obviously don't know where this guy is, but I couldn't

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
 figure out, like, how bad that was.

93
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,160
 I'm assuming it's pretty bad because he can't leave his house at all.

94
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
 He has the ankle monitor on and he can't leave his house at all.

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,520
 He can't leave his house to go to work.

96
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,000
 He can't leave his house to thank God.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
 Obviously, you're like, "Oh, where's Barry then?"

98
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
 He's been gone the past three months, man.

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
 All this paperwork's been backing up.

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
 And the boss is like, "Please quit asking where Barry is.

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
 Trust me, you don't want to know.

102
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
 You'll kill the dude."

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,440
 This guy, we'll just call him Barry.

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,520
 I don't know if that's his real name, but Barry is under house arrest, "Level One House

105
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,080
 Arrest," and he has a roommate.

106
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,840
 And Barry is starving to death.

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,120
 He posts on this subreddit.

108
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,040
 He goes, "I'm under house arrest and my roommate refuses to buy me food.

109
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,280
 My roommate is refusing to do my shopping.

110
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,560
 And I'm stuck in this house."

111
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,600
 He goes, "It's been months since I've eaten anything," which I think is a little bit of

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,200
 an exaggeration, obviously, or maybe he was a gamer and had a bunch of, like, G Fuel laying

113
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 around.

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
 That's a great ad for them.

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
 Had a bunch of Doritos and he's been munching on those for the last couple of months.

116
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,120
 But he goes, "I'm starving to death.

117
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,560
 I keep asking my roommate to buy me food and my roommate goes, 'No, that's hilarious,

118
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,440
 because you know that this roommate's probably like, 'I can't kick him out.

119
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,000
 He's under house arrest,' which basically means that I'm under house arrest.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,360
 This guy's committed some disgusting crime.

121
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,840
 The very least I can do is my civic duty and slowly starve this man to death.

122
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,560
 He's not buying any food."

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,400
 Imagine this guy's been catching stray cockroaches, berries, and building little traps, trying

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,520
 to attract birds with a cheeto on a string.

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
 He's starving to death.

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
 He can't eat anything.

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,360
 His roommate's got to imagine his roommate's like, "Yummy, yummy, yummy.

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,080
 I ordered one of everything from McDonald's menu."

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,160
 And he's like, "What am I going to have now?

130
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,680
 The roommate's put on like 300 pounds just taunting this guy.

131
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
 He's eating all this food."

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
 He's like, "It's worth it.

133
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,200
 It's worth my cholesterol going up just to taunt this sicko."

134
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,880
 And he says, "I don't know what to do.

135
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,800
 Like I can't get any food.

136
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,360
 I feel like I'm losing muscle like at this point.

137
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,880
 It's not just that I'm losing weight.

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,840
 I'm actually getting weaker, physically weaker, because my roommate will not buy me food."

139
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,760
 Now listen, he's not eating anything.

140
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
 It's funny, right?

141
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
 I was laughing about that.

142
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
 I thought it was hilarious.

143
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,080
 And then of course, because Reddit is the way that it is, I scroll down a bit and I

144
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,720
 start reading the comments.

145
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,680
 And again, we're in the sex offender support subreddit.

146
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,440
 And people then begin to give him advice.

147
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,040
 And it would be one of the things if they said, "Set up a Venmo.

148
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,280
 I'll send you some money.

149
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,640
 A sicko's got to stick together."

150
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,380
 It was something like that, fine.

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:21,160
 If it was something like, "Yeah, I feel for you, dude, but call your parole agent or call

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,720
 the court and say that you need an emergency thing to be able to go get some food or something."

153
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 They don't do that.

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,120
 They don't do that.

155
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,040
 They give him tips on how to beat the charges.

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,880
 This is the problem with this subreddit, right?

157
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,460
 They're giving this guy tips on how to not only get a delicious cheeseburger, but also

158
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
 how to beat the charges.

159
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,420
 So you have a guy named NoResort7214.

160
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,060
 So listen, what you should do is you should check yourself into a psychiatric hospital

161
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,460
 because you'll get food there.

162
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,500
 They'll feed you.

163
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,380
 And that can actually help with your sentencing.

164
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,460
 Because remember, he hasn't had his trial yet.

165
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,100
 All of this stuff is pending or he may be halfway through the trial.

166
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,520
 But he definitely hasn't been sentenced.

167
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,440
 This is all part of the legal process.

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,520
 He goes, "It actually will help with your sentencing when I had to go to court.

169
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,060
 I had checked myself into a psychiatric hospital and my lawyer said, 'Look, he's working on

170
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,780
 improving his mental fitness.'

171
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,420
 And the judge, Jerry, goes, 'Yeah, he seems to be an upstanding guy.

172
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,720
 He's not doing anything to us right now in the courtroom.

173
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,200
 Plus, we have this lawyer saying this and this doctor saying this.

174
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,040
 Ah, you know, let's give him a little bit of a break on the sentencing.'

175
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
 Gross, right?

176
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,180
 I'm giving him tips on how to beat the system.

177
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,980
 Again, it's not saying you need mental help.

178
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
 You need mental help.

179
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,940
 It's like, hey, this is a way to kind of skirt the law a bit.

180
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,420
 Probably not a good thing to talk about skirts around sex offenders.

181
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,260
 I don't want them popping a bone or anything.

182
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,060
 But then we have puzzled ear 531.9.

183
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,460
 And this one, this one like legit made me mad.

184
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,780
 So I'm sharing it with you.

185
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,700
 I'm sharing it with you.

186
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,980
 Puzzled ear 531.9 goes, "Yeah, do check yourself into a mental hospital."

187
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,180
 Now, again, not because you're mentally disturbed, not because you're a sex criminal.

188
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,060
 He said, listen, right after I got arrested, I checked myself into a mental hospital.

189
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,220
 And I'm sure the stress level was super high, but again, it didn't seem like, oh, me, oh,

190
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,620
 my, I'm a sick pervert.

191
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
 I need mental help.

192
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,500
 It was like, oh, no, I actually got caught doing the things that I do.

193
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,020
 I'm stressed out.

194
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,500
 He went to the mental hospital.

195
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,020
 Normally, did he have a bunch of delicious food?

196
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,540
 Apparently, it's right next to a Chipotle.

197
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,220
 He says the doctors at the mental hospital said that he had some brain issues.

198
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,140
 His brain had a hard time developing, or obviously, he needed to check himself in a mental hospital

199
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
 for that one.

200
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,100
 His brain had a hard time developing.

201
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,700
 It caused him to make poor decisions.

202
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,260
 He didn't have it all up here.

203
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,180
 It wasn't his fault that he did those crimes.

204
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,500
 It was his brain.

205
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,740
 And the judge actually agreed.

206
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,540
 He served no jail time.

207
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,100
 His lawyer used that as an excuse.

208
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,580
 He got no jail time.

209
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,820
 All he got was three and a half years probation and three years as part of a sex offender

210
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
 group.

211
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,740
 But then he includes this quote, quote, "The DA, district attorney, wanted to send me

212
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:28,740
 away for 50 years because of my eight victims."

213
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,020
 Eight victims facing 50 years in prison, but because he checked himself in a mental hospital

214
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,100
 and the doctor diagnosed them like that, three and a half years probation, just three years

215
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,780
 as part of this sex offender support group.

216
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:47,500
 Not the subreddit, not the subreddit, like a in-person talking to other sex offenders.

217
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,260
 So basically, six years in total, eight victims because he went to the mental hospital and

218
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,740
 got this doctor to write this up.

219
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,380
 This is why I hate this subreddit.

220
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,740
 This is why I hate this subreddit.

221
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,360
 This is why I hate Reddit in whole because this information is just slowly collecting

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,740
 over time and now people can go and access all this stuff.

223
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,020
 If you're accused of one of these things, you're going to find this group and you're

224
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,580
 going to go, "Oh, that's a pretty good idea."

225
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
 I'll just go to a mental hospital.

226
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
 Maybe I'll look out.

227
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,500
 And that's what they're saying publicly.

228
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,820
 Who knows what they're saying in their DMs?

229
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,100
 Gross.

230
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,860
 This gross subreddit tends to collect the worst of the worst.

231
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,860
 This subreddit's up.

232
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,380
 I've gone in conversations on the Patreon Discord.

233
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,700
 We've talked about it a couple of times about free speech and all that stuff.

234
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,740
 I am a free speech advocate, but when you're trading tips with other pedophiles, rapists,

235
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:48,540
 channel listers, whatever, on how to beat charges, you have to have a limit.

236
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,260
 I'll have that discussion though about free speech.

237
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,020
 I'm not saying I'm the arbiter of it all, but that's disgusting, right?

238
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

239
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,260
 This guy's slowly starving to death.

240
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,460
 And then it turns out they're giving him tips on how to beat his charges.

241
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,620
 Now he deleted his account.

242
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,900
 We don't know what his crime was or if he beat the charges or anything like that, but

243
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,780
 this other dude did eight victims.

244
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,020
 Three and a half years probation.

245
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,500
 Gross.

246
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
 Gross.

247
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,540
 Cobalt actually had a new Patreon supporter that I was going to have drive us around

248
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,940
 this episode, but when episodes get this gross, when episodes get that rough, I was going

249
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,980
 to, I like to use the legacy Patreon because you never know how people are going to react.

250
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,900
 DJ Blue, I'm going to give you your shout out tomorrow, but Cobalt, let's go ahead and

251
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
 touch the keys of the car.

252
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,300
 I'm going to touch on those, bro.

253
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,060
 We're leaving behind this disgusting house.

254
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:51,260
 We're headed all the way out to University of California in Irvine, California.

255
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,220
 Since last season, I've been on a ghost binge.

256
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,460
 It was the stories that I thought I would honestly talk about the most when I started

257
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,620
 doing this show.

258
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,820
 And they're actually interesting ghost stories are really hard to find.

259
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,780
 They're really hard to find.

260
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
 So we do a lot of UFOs, which I love UFOs.

261
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,660
 We do a lot of Bigfoot, which I've learned to love Bigfoot since I moved up to the Pacific

262
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
 Northwest.

263
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,900
 I mean, it wasn't a big thing, but I thought we'd do more ghost stuff.

264
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,140
 So I've kind of been on a ghost binge lately, but when you research these, I like to just

265
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,020
 like look into the legend.

266
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,380
 Is there anything behind this?

267
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,700
 I always like doing the additional information, finding that stuff out.

268
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,820
 And this is a story where it evolves past spooky, icky ghosts walking along an abandoned

269
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
 road.

270
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,140
 That's how the story starts, but it's one of the stories that just gets really weird

271
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
 as it goes on.

272
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,260
 We're at University of California, Irvine, and like any place where you have people congregating,

273
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,580
 legends and ghost stories are going to form.

274
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,740
 The first one we're going to look at is if you drive down campus drive by yourself.

275
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,340
 I apparently this, I don't think this is like the main thoroughfare.

276
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,060
 I don't think this is where the buses go.

277
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,300
 It's kind of like, I'm assuming a road kind of removed from campus because otherwise this

278
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,060
 story would be easily disprovable.

279
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,340
 You'd have people be like, dude, I walk down the road all the time to get to my econ class.

280
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,860
 It's not haunted, but apparently if you're driving down campus drive late at night, are

281
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
 you doing that?

282
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,860
 Econ nerds?

283
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,660
 Quick trying to dispute my story that I found online.

284
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,860
 As you're driving down campus drive alone, your car will stop automatically.

285
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,860
 And a woman shows up.

286
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,880
 This is where detail.

287
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,540
 She talks to you, but she doesn't move her mouth.

288
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,540
 That's super odd.

289
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,540
 That's usually related to aliens.

290
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,020
 Very rarely do you hear ghost telepathically talking to people, especially if you can see

291
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,980
 it, but she talks to you in your head and she asks you to help her find her missing

292
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
 daughter.

293
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,660
 Like, can I get in your car?

294
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,180
 Can you help me?

295
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,100
 And you may be a little scared because you're in the middle of nowhere, maybe, or maybe

296
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,500
 you're right next to the women's dormitory.

297
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,300
 But definitely whether or not that humans move their mouths when they talk unless you're

298
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
 talking to like Jeff Dunham.

299
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,820
 It's not Jeff Dunham.

300
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,820
 She doesn't move her mouth.

301
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
 She asks you this.

302
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,780
 If you let her in your car, then you'll drive down the road and you'll have this woman in

303
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
 your car.

304
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
 No one's that stupid.

305
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,460
 No one's going to actually open the door for her.

306
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,460
 So she teleports into your car.

307
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
 She teleports.

308
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,220
 This woman just teleports into your car.

309
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
 So you're in a choice.

310
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,100
 Now you're driving on a road with a woman.

311
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
 Would Jeff Dunham?

312
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 Would Jeff Dunham?

313
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
 I kill you.

314
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,620
 He has all these puppets in here.

315
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,620
 It's truly hell.

316
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,900
 You're driving down the road.

317
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
 He's doing all these voices.

318
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,980
 You're like, oh my God.

319
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,500
 And she makes you just drive down the road.

320
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,140
 Now the car's working again.

321
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,340
 And then eventually she disappears out of the car, thankfully.

322
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,180
 And then you turn around and there's a Jeff Dunham puppet of you sitting in the back seat

323
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
 going, I kill you.

324
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,780
 He's like, do Jason have that joke from like 2004?

325
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
 How old is that?

326
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,780
 Anyways, no, that's not what happens.

327
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
 That would actually be pretty cool.

328
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,780
 What happened?

329
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
 I think about it.

330
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
 That would be pretty cool.

331
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,420
 A Dunham doll of you.

332
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,220
 He's collecting all these spirits around the world.

333
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,980
 She disappears.

334
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,660
 And so the story goes like this.

335
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,420
 Apparently back in the day, there was a woman who had a daughter and her daughter in the

336
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,380
 campus drive area was raped and killed.

337
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,060
 And the mom was looking for her daughter, looking for her daughter to save.

338
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,420
 And she had gone mad with grief.

339
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
 Everyone knew that the daughter had already been found.

340
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,780
 Her body had already been found by the mother still wandering down the street.

341
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
 Where's my daughter?

342
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
 Where's my daughter?

343
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,500
 We're like, oh, not this lady again.

344
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,780
 Doesn't she know that her daughter's already dead?

345
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,260
 She's in the crematory, moron.

346
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,220
 She's walking around the streets filled with grief.

347
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:40,220
 And then she walked down into this goalie, like this ditch on the site of campus drive.

348
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,980
 And the mom never came out.

349
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
 That was when she was still alive.

350
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,020
 That wasn't even part of the ghost story.

351
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,100
 That's like the origin, which is creepy.

352
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,020
 We've talked about ditches and their relationship to paranormal phenomenon before.

353
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,500
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

354
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,420
 And it also has a parallel.

355
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,420
 We covered a long time ago the story of the three-legged lady road, which is kind of

356
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
 the same setup.

357
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,500
 A mother is looking for her daughter's body.

358
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,580
 Same thing, the daughter was raped and killed by some sane worshipers.

359
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,180
 And then this ghost was walking around, like chopping off people's legs and wearing them

360
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,340
 or something like that.

361
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,340
 I'm not for sure.

362
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
 It's gross.

363
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,340
 I don't remember the details.

364
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
 I remember it being quite gruesome.

365
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,340
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

366
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,100
 Interesting story, ghost story.

367
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,380
 But let's take a look at another ghost story in the area.

368
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,100
 We're now on campus.

369
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,500
 There is Mesa Court Residence Hall.

370
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,340
 This is where all the students are hanging out.

371
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,660
 We're going back to the 1970s.

372
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,740
 So listening to disco music, doing three- I have three legs.

373
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
 I'm dancing.

374
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,940
 They're like, dude, how are you doing those moves?

375
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,380
 I got three-legged bell bottoms.

376
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
 We're dancing around.

377
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,500
 And we're going to meet a young girl who dancing wasn't just an enjoyable pastime.

378
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 It was her passion.

379
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,540
 It was actually why she was enrolled in college.

380
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,740
 There was this young college student.

381
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,800
 We'll call her Nancy.

382
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,300
 She was preparing for the big dance audition.

383
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,020
 It was the role of a lifetime.

384
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,940
 And she was stressed out.

385
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,580
 She was stressed out, will she get this?

386
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
 She has to get it.

387
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,060
 She has to, has to get this role.

388
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,900
 She would practice all day and all night.

389
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,980
 Like, aren't you going to go to your other classes?

390
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
 She's like, nope.

391
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
 She's not learning, reading, writing, arithmetic.

392
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,100
 She's learning rhythm.

393
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,540
 She's dancing all the time.

394
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,180
 And she had her room.

395
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,180
 She was lucky enough when she got her dorm.

396
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,280
 It was just a single occupant dorm.

397
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,040
 Other people had roommates and stuff like that.

398
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,840
 Other people are starving out their roommates.

399
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,280
 They're like, take that, sicko.

400
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,720
 But while that's going on, Nancy is dancing.

401
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,320
 You'd always see her dancing.

402
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,360
 Sometimes you'd see her dancing in the window.

403
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,400
 Sometimes you'd have the blinds drawn and you would just see her silhouette boogieing

404
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,600
 down.

405
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,200
 One night, someone looks over and they go, up, there's dancing Nancy.

406
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
 She's dancing in her room.

407
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,480
 She's actually like spinning around like a ballerina.

408
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,220
 [HUMMING]

409
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,180
 She's spinning around doing the little things you see Nancy Kerrigan do.

410
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,420
 You know, she's now, hold, are you?

411
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,660
 You're making Jeff Dunham references and talking about Nancy Kerrigan.

412
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,460
 She's spinning around like an ice skater, Kristy Yamaguchi style.

413
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,700
 People are like, man, Nancy's got some cool moves.

414
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,980
 If that audition requires you to spin in place for 30 minutes straight, she's going to get

415
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
 it.

416
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:23,120
 She's going to be spinning around in her room and they're like, you go Nancy, spin, spin

417
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
 till the world ends.

418
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,760
 Let me start thinking about it and they're like, it's kind of weird that she hasn't vomited

419
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 at all.

420
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
 That's a lot of spins.

421
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,720
 It's also kind of weird she's been doing that for close to three hours now.

422
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,120
 So eventually someone knocks on her door, hey Nancy, are you okay?

423
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,720
 Are you trying to create the large Hadron Collider in there right now?

424
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,640
 She's spinning around so fast.

425
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,100
 And so they eventually have a dorm, an RA open the door and it turns out that Nancy could

426
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,900
 not take the stress of the audition.

427
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,460
 So she decided to hang herself from the ceiling fan.

428
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,260
 Save your questions until the end of this ghost story/urban legend.

429
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:11,020
 She decided to hang herself from the ceiling fan which was on and she wasn't spinning around

430
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,620
 like a figure skater.

431
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:21,200
 It was her body going whoa, attached to the fan spinning around for hours at a time.

432
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
 Okay, here's the thing.

433
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,680
 If you attached, don't try this at home, don't try this at home, you're like hey little brother

434
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
 come here.

435
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,040
 If you hung a body from a ceiling fan, you wouldn't spin in place.

436
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,240
 Like it would be flying all over the place.

437
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,840
 It'd be like if you grabbed the rope and was swinging it around the body would be going

438
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
 whoa.

439
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,420
 It'd be one thing to be like whoa you have really cool dance moves.

440
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,780
 It'd be another thing to say you're clearly defying the laws of gravity.

441
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,460
 Also ceiling fans can't support body weight.

442
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,900
 I mean she might have been really slender because she's a dancer but and for this to

443
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,980
 make any sense she would have had to hang herself while the fan was on which I have

444
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,820
 never hung myself but I imagine that would just make things even more difficult.

445
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,440
 She hung herself from the fan why would it turn on automatically, why would it spin around.

446
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,080
 Doesn't make sense.

447
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,760
 Interesting ghost story but again both of those ghost stories in and of themselves, they might

448
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
 be something I mentioned in passing.

449
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,520
 Why am I spending the last half of an episode talking about these ghost stories?

450
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,440
 Because as I was looking into these ghost stories I found a far darker phenomenon and

451
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
 this is being reported by the mainstream media.

452
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,060
 Specifically I found this in a newspaper called the OC Weekly which is an Orange County newspaper

453
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,060
 and this article is written by Charles Lamb.

454
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:54,660
 It's entitled "Why do so many students commit suicide at UC Irvine's Social Science Plaza?"

455
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:02,020
 Whoa okay this isn't what I was expecting as I was typing in because I'm trying to verify

456
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,600
 any of this stuff.

457
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,800
 Suicide ghost, UC Irvine and here we go.

458
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,960
 UC Irvine was built back in the late 60s, early 70s and it was designed as this very

459
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,800
 elegant place, very balanced in its construction.

460
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:29,200
 It was set up to be this just symmetrical perfectly designed location where it was just

461
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,860
 supposed to give you a sense of being, a sense of purpose, a sense of your place in the universe

462
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,580
 and it's just laid out in this very conscious way.

463
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:48,340
 But added far later, this was added in the 1990s, is the Social Science Plaza.

464
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:55,020
 It's a collection of five story buildings and it's in this asymmetrical shape, it actually

465
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,640
 kind of throws off the entire area that it's in because you had all of this thought and

466
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,560
 planning put into the original construction of UC Irvine.

467
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,440
 But then you have this, it's like counterclockwise.

468
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,480
 The buildings themselves are asymmetrical and counterclockwise to how it should be laid

469
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,760
 out if you look at the rest of the school and they go it's really weird, the college

470
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,000
 you're kind of wandering around, you're going to these different classes and it's this very

471
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
 open floor plan.

472
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,380
 But when you go into the Social Sciences Plaza, it's claustrophobic, even outdoors, there's

473
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,300
 something about it that makes you feel kind of hemmed in.

474
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,780
 They said once you get into the building, it's just very soulless, very just row after

475
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,500
 row after row of these classrooms.

476
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,300
 And most people, even if you're not a Social Sciences major because the way that everything

477
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,820
 is planned out, almost every student who attends UC Irvine has at least one class in the Social

478
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,360
 Sciences Plaza, just for your general ed requirements.

479
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,800
 It's not a pleasant place to be, but you got to be there.

480
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,120
 It offsets the natural design, the very symmetrical nature of the campus.

481
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,360
 You have this building complex and if you're taking the stairs, they have like a staircase

482
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,440
 on the outside of the buildings.

483
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:24,240
 On each floor, there is a sign that says, "We can help."

484
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,940
 And then it gives you the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

485
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,020
 According to this article by Charles Lamb, there's been five suicides off of Social

486
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,120
 Sciences Plaza, people climbing up to the highest point of the staircase and falling

487
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,180
 around 50 feet.

488
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,440
 I think it's more than five, not just because I'm a conspiracy theorist, but Charles Lamb,

489
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,800
 which is an excellent article, Charles Lamb details some of the events of these five suicides

490
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,640
 that we know of and only one of them was really recognized around campus.

491
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,480
 He was a very popular kid, apparently, who killed himself and they started having like

492
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,680
 these workshops and things like that.

493
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:11,040
 The article also talks about a young man known as Maxwell Chorak, he's 25 years old, who

494
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,980
 on June 10th, 2014 climbed up to the highest stairwell and each time you have to pass one

495
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,580
 of those signs saying, "We can help."

496
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:25,060
 And he dove off and Charles Lamb says, "There was no memorial for this guy."

497
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,420
 Like pretty much like people were shocked, they called authorities, rescue crews got

498
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,860
 there, he was already dead and then the day kind of goes on.

499
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,180
 Like counseling was available and then the life went on at the college.

500
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,740
 If there was only five suicides over the course of 30 years, would you really be bolting up

501
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,740
 those signs?

502
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,520
 I bet you there's more or more attempted suicides.

503
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,920
 Colleges cover this stuff up.

504
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,720
 When I was at American River College, I was a journalist for the school newspaper, we

505
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,320
 had an issue with perverts masturbating in the library.

506
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
 Have you ever heard of that?

507
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,920
 It happens at every college.

508
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,520
 I had a friend whose wife worked at UC Davis in the library, she goes, "We actually had

509
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,400
 code names for the different types of masturbators."

510
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,820
 There were so many of them.

511
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,780
 There's so many of them you could actually catalog.

512
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,380
 You could put them in the dewy decimal system or the gooey decimal system.

513
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,500
 Okay, but anyways.

514
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,660
 So colleges cover stuff like that up because it's bad, right?

515
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,260
 You're trying to, a college is a business.

516
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,940
 You're trying to get people to come to the college, pay money, pay a ton of money to

517
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
 go there.

518
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,940
 So they're always going to cover up.

519
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,860
 And if they're going to cover up sex crimes, they're going to cover up suicides.

520
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,100
 If they can, what they can cover up, they will.

521
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
 It was a huge expose.

522
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
 I did.

523
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
 No pun intended.

524
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,960
 At American River College for the newspaper, the school newspaper there.

525
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,560
 But here's my theory.

526
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,120
 Here's my theory.

527
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,920
 I think there is a force pulling people towards these buildings.

528
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:02,120
 A dark energy that is attracting people who already have suicidal ideation.

529
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,380
 And that is why this has become a suicide tourist destination.

530
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:15,460
 Case in point, Maxwell, he wasn't even a student at the college.

531
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,340
 Maxwell had no connection.

532
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
 He didn't work there.

533
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,460
 He wasn't a student.

534
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,260
 He took a bus there.

535
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,660
 He took a bus from a hospital to get there.

536
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:33,520
 Just three hours before he committed suicide, he had gotten out of an 11-day forced medical

537
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,760
 hold because he was listed as a danger to himself or others.

538
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,200
 It was 5150 in California, police parlance.

539
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
 5150.

540
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,000
 And on June 14th, the doctors allowed him to leave the hospital.

541
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,640
 His 11 days are over.

542
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,840
 And they gave him a bus voucher to go anywhere in town.

543
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,400
 Well, he went to UC Irvine, which he had no connection to.

544
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:03,140
 When he went to the social sciences plaza, climbed up the tallest staircase, killed himself.

545
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:10,500
 Is this school actually emanating this negative, life-stealing energy?

546
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:19,540
 UC Irvine, the campus itself, was built as the result of a suicide.

547
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:25,260
 My Ford Irvine, his family owned a ton of land in Irvine, California.

548
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,200
 In 1959, he shot himself.

549
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,880
 And his niece inherited a good chunk of his fortune and of his land.

550
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,640
 And she donated the land where UC Irvine would be established.

551
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,000
 And that's where the school is where it's at.

552
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,440
 The school wouldn't have existed in the first place had he not killed himself.

553
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,860
 So is the entire area infused with this dark energy?

554
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:08,780
 Is the fact that you have this magnificently designed and perfectly balanced layout?

555
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:16,620
 And then you have this gross asymmetrical structure of buildings that juts out from inside of it.

556
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:23,140
 Isn't that almost an allegory for depression itself, for hopelessness itself?

557
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:30,880
 We see the beauty of the world around us, but we feel ugly and useless and that we don't fit in.

558
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,320
 And I listen, I'm not trying to say that there's the only reasons why people commit suicide, right?

559
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,840
 But that is one of the reasons why people get horribly depressed.

560
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,720
 There's chemical depression and then there's just like, I am alone.

561
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
 I don't fit in.

562
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,560
 I have nowhere to belong.

563
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:51,480
 And that's what the social sciences, ironically, the social sciences buildings represent.

564
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,020
 You're walking around this opulent open campus.

565
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,020
 And then once you get to these buildings, it feels claustrophobic.

566
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,900
 Just the way the trees are laid out and the way the buildings are there,

567
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,660
 you instantly feel the oppression because it is not right.

568
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,700
 It doesn't belong there.

569
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:20,260
 But that's where it was put counterclockwise, asymmetrical, strangulating and ominous.

570
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,480
 It feels like it doesn't belong and yet there it is.

571
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,740
 And no matter who you are or what your major is, you have to attend a class there

572
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,340
 because that's part of the general ed.

573
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,420
 It's almost like you're forced to go there.

574
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,780
 You're forced to walk through this gauntlet of negative energy.

575
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,960
 What dark energy does this school possibly hold?

576
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,340
 What type of siren song echoes out from the social science plaza?

577
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,120
 Attracting the desperate, attracting the lonely,

578
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,540
 attracting those who feel like they have nothing to lose.

579
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,920
 A place born from a suicide.

580
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:22,940
 Attracting more people to join it in making that ultimate mistake.

581
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,420
