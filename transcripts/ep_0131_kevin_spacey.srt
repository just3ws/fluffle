1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 What exactly is going on at the Gatwick Airport?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,000
 Are they being plagued by drones or is there something else keeping the planes grounded?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at the absolutely bizarre video that Kevin Spacey made

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and the conspiracy theories already swirling around it today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I don't know why I'm so down. Actually, I'm a lot down.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 This is actually Christmas Day for me. I'm recording this on Christmas Day. No snow!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 No white Christmas for all those other people, which means a good Christmas for me.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 So the first thing I want to talk about though is, again, something that just fell on my lap.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
 I just saw the trailer for Jordan Peele's new movie, Us.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,500
 Now, Jordan Peele started off on Matt TV, which I love Matt TV.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 He did Key and Peel. I wasn't a huge fan of that show. I didn't watch a lot of it though, to be fair.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,000
 Then he did Get Out. Get Out, I think, was a very solid thriller.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It wasn't a horror movie, but it was a solid thriller.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It was kind of a spoiler alert. Stepford Wives, but with black people instead of women.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,500
 And when I was watching it and when I saw the trailer for Get Out, I was like, "This guy has a visual eye."

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
 "This guy really has a really cool, unique visual eye."

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,500
 The movie ended up becoming a big hit. Won a couple Academy Awards.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,000
 I think the biggest flaw of that movie was the TSA agent character.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,500
 It didn't really work. It didn't really work for me, but I did think that Get Out was a solid thriller.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,500
 Don't think it was as great as everyone thought it was, but it was definitely for a first time director.

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
 It was very, very, very good.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Enjoyed it. I recommended it. I just tell people it's not the greatest horror movie you're going to see.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,000
 So when I found out just today, I saw that he had released a trailer on Christmas Day for a new movie called Us.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And the first thing that popped in my head was, "Ugh, this is going to be Oscar bait."

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Because once you get a taste of that sweet, sweet Oscar love, could you go back to making, in a sense, a schlocky horror film?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And I started watching the trailer and he went balls to the wall schlocky horror film.

29
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 Whatever, I am so impressed by Jordan Peele right now.

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,000
 Absolutely floored.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Because I think any other director, after making a low-budget horror movie and getting all of that Oscar love,

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 would start going the crash route, trying to go for these Oscar bait films.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 No, no, the movie looks so bizarre.

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,000
 And I'm watching the trailer and I keep waiting for some model and scene.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,500
 I don't know what the movie's about. I put the trailer in and it's showing all this stuff and I'm thinking,

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,000
 "Oh, it's going to get like Oscar baiting." And it's not.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Totally blew me away.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And you're watching it and you're like, "Oh, I recognize that. It's probably like the strangers or something."

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 They're probably surrounded by some rich people who don't want them in their neighborhood.

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 And that's why, because the cat who are trying to get them out of their house and it's going to be kind of like this us versus them thing.

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,000
 And it's going to be the strangers but with a racial tone to it.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
 Absolutely not. The movie is so bizarre looking.

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 And again, it's his visual eye for horror.

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,500
 I think we may be seeing the birth and I may be speaking too soon, but I think we may be seeing the birth of a new West Craven,

45
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,000
 of a new Toby Hooper.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Jordan Peele knows how to do horror.

47
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,000
 This is absolutely...

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I did love the trailer for Get Out.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I saw the movie and it met my expectations of that movie.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
 This movie, again, you watch the trailer.

51
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
 The visuals are great.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It looks super weird and I can't figure it out.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
 I've seen so many trailers.

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 I saw the trailer for Shutter Island and was like, "Oh, he's an inmate."

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
 The person next to me was like, "What?"

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I was like, "Yeah, he's the inmate."

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I saw the trailer for The Sixth Sense.

58
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,000
 No, no, no, I saw the trailer for The Village and I was like, "Oh, that takes place in modern times."

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 My little brother's like, "How'd you get that just from the trailer?"

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 He didn't believe me.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 He's like, "You're wrong."

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,500
 And he told all his friends, "Yeah, my brother thinks he knows everything.

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 He says the village takes place in modern times."

64
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 And then when they saw it, his friends were mad at him for spoiling it.

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 He's like, "I thought... I didn't know. I didn't know that was the ending."

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
 But I watched this trailer and I'm like, "I have no idea what this is about."

67
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
 Even when I watched the trailer for Get Out, I think I kind of got an idea for what the choice would be, but not really.

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 But this movie, definitely, I was like, "What's going on? What's going on?"

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 Check it out. The trailer's called Us. It looks great.

70
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 So congratulations, Jordan Peele.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 I think you might be probably one of the best horror movie directors working right now if you're able to pull this movie off.

72
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 And the only reason I laugh about that is because he came from Mad TV and Keen Peele and he's a comedy guy.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,500
 But he probably had a passion for horror all along. So good on you, Jordan.

74
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 So our next story is a request from Neuch on YouTube.

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 So let's get on board the carpenter copter and go for a ride.

76
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 We're going to Britain.

77
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 Marriol England. The big blue island or something.

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 The Emerald Isle. Is that what it's called? I think that's Ireland.

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,500
 We're going to England. We're going to the place of Kings and Queen.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,500
 I just came up with that one. And Knights of the Round Table and Stonehenge, I think, is over there.

81
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 It might be in Wales. What else comes from England?

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 A bunch of dragons, I guess. That's all.

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
 So anyways, we're in Britain now. And the carpenter copter.

84
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 So we're coming in and, of course, we're going to an airport.

85
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,000
 So we're going in style.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:59,000
 The carpenter copter. Those are the rotors slowing down. Got to check in.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 No, no, no. OK. We're not going to go through the whole end of the flight procedure.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 I'm sitting and reading a manual. Are you going to tell the story?

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Yes, I'm going to tell the story. I just got to make sure I shut all the instrumentation off.

90
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,000
 OK, so anyways, we get off the helicopter. We're at Gatwick Airport.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And we get there and immediately surrounded by police.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And no, it's not because of any outstanding warrants I may or may not have.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 It's because we violated international airspace, but also because currently, well, at this time when we landed,

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 no flights were allowed to take off.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 We're like, oh, well, we're just landing.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Here, look at, let me go through my instruments.

97
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
 Get away from the gears. Just get out of the helicopter, sir.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So we get out and we find out that from December 19th to December 21st,

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 over 1,000 flights had been canceled or delayed.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Actually, I should rephrase that so it sounds more dramatic.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Between December 19th and December 21st,

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 over 1,000 flights had been delayed or canceled outright.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And the reason why was because people were seeing drones fly overhead.

104
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
 Hmm.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 People would be like, oh my God, there's a drone right over these planes trying to take off.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 A drone hitting a plane in flight would be devastating.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I don't know why because they're so tiny, but I guess if it like flew into the engine

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 or like had suction cups and landed on the windshield and the pilot's like, oh, I can't see.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It's like spraying oil.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I mean, come on, dude, a drone hits a wing of an airplane.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It's getting demolished.

112
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,000
 Can drones really weigh more than like the fattest geese or goose?

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You know?

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,500
 But anyways, apparently if a plane hits a drone, it's bad news.

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,000
 So I'm not going to test that, but I'm sure there's some YouTube videos showing that.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 But anyway, so planes shouldn't hit drones is the moral of that story that Jason doesn't believe.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But the airport was like, we can't take off.

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
 There's drones flying overhead.

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,000
 67 sightings of these drones.

120
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
 The airport would be sitting there.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 They'd be eating their crumpets and drinking their tea.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 They'd look out the windows in the airport and that's not an airplane noise.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
 That's a drone flying by.

124
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 They're like, oh, pilots said that, oh, man, I saw a drone fly by.

125
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,000
 I was sitting here in the break room and they're like, are you sure that wasn't the noise an airplane made?

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,500
 He's like, I'm positive that was the noise of a drone.

127
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 67 sightings of these drones.

128
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,000
 The airport's like, we can't let these planes take off.

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 Now the police begin investigating it.

130
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
 They end up arresting the local couple.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 They're like, oh, breaking down the door.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 The couple is like building a drone in the back.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 No, the couple was actually completely innocent.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And so the cops arrested them, released them the next day.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And by that point, a bunch of newspapers had published their names and photographs.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And Britain, unless someone is charged with the crime, this is a new law, you can't do that.

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,000
 So this couple is going to sue all these newspapers and websites in Britain and make a ton of money out of this.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 They said we had nothing to do with this.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Then the next day, an officer giving an interview, a police officer giving an interview says,

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 there may not have been any drones in the first place.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 So at this point, everyone's flipping out.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,500
 This was a busy airport the weekend before Christmas.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,500
 140,000 people impacted by these diversions, delays and cancellations.

144
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,000
 And now you have a police officer saying there may not have been any drones.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
 This is the weird thing.

146
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:41,500
 So after he said that, he got rebuked by the police organization, the cops, the bobbies,

147
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 and they said that's a miscommunication.

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
 They're war drones.

149
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 But 140,000 people were impacted by this.

150
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 The people who showed up at the airport, they're basically trapped there for a long period of time

151
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 because they're waiting for the next flight.

152
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 You had the whole crew, you had the airport, you had all their security cameras, you had everyone with a cell phone camera,

153
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,000
 not a single video or a photo of a drone was taken from this airport.

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 There have been some photos that have popped up online and people are like, look it, it's a drone.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
 But these photos are undated.

156
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 The police have no proof as of right now that they're revealing that there are any drones.

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,500
 And all the security camera footage, there's no video footage of any drones whatsoever, as of now.

158
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 And there's no photographs that have been released.

159
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 So where is all this video and photographic evidence that these drones even existed?

160
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 Everyone is in, has their back to the wall.

161
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 The police, if there were drones, they have to catch the people doing it.

162
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 The airport, if there were no drones, there's going to be mass firings.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,500
 If it turns out that this was just some case of mass hysteria, that one person in a crowd thought they saw a drone,

164
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,500
 and that story spread to eventually became, yes, I saw a drone, I saw three of them, or whatever,

165
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,000
 that's going to be a huge problem.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,500
 Now, the story started on December 19th.

167
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 It was about two days ago when the couple was arrested and released.

168
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 It was roughly one day ago when the police officer said, we don't know if there's any drones in the first place.

169
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 The conspiracy theories have already started rolling.

170
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
 Let me go back to the drone thing real quick too.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,500
 The police, the only piece of evidence they found so far is a broken drone on the outside of the airport.

172
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 And even they're like, we don't know how long this has been here.

173
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 Could have been here for a while, could have been here during this flap, we don't know.

174
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,500
 But anyways, the conspiracy theories have already started rolling in.

175
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 One, the conspiracy is, is that Britain is testing the public.

176
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 The government of Britain purposely set out the story that there are drones flying around,

177
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 because they wanted to ground those flights.

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
 Why, you ask?

179
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 Because they want people, they want to see how people will react when Brexit finally takes effect and people are trapped in Britain.

180
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,000
 Now, never mind the fact that that's not where Brexit is.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Brexit doesn't turn Britain into George Orwell's Oceana.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,500
 It's not a prison island at that point and you can't leave because people from Britain aren't allowed in Europe anymore.

183
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
 It's not what that is.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 But that's one of the conspiracy theories as ill thought out as it is.

185
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
 The other one, of course, is aliens.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 There was some sort of alien craft or alien interference above that airport.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And the government was like, just shut it down.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's not worth having a plane crashing into this invisible UFO that nobody can see.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,500
 Just say there's a bunch of drones flying around.

190
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,500
 Of course, I love the UFO angle, but there's less evidence for that than there are of drones.

191
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 I think at the end of the day, when everything is said and done, the police will try,

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,500
 they'll find one sliver of evidence that there was a drone in the area

193
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,000
 and they'll either say, and the suspect got away, or they'll pin it on somebody.

194
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I think that's what the airport wants. I think that's what the police wants.

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 But I think the most likely suggestion is it is a case of mass hysteria.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,500
 People see a drone or think they see a drone and that story spreads to eventually anything that is slightly out of the ordinary.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,500
 A bird that kind of has like a limp wing or a cloud that kind of looks like a drone.

198
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,000
 It's all shaped with rotors. Anything out of the ordinary, people are like, oh my God, that's a drone because that's what your mind is thinking of.

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I think it's mass hysteria. I bet you they'll never catch anyone involved in this.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Could be wrong, could be wrong, but again, why are they going for that angle when there is no evidence whatsoever?

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,500
 It might as well said there was just a bunch of ghosts on the runway.

202
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 There's as much evidence for that.

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 You could be like, well, you didn't find a broken drone.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It'd be like, yeah, but there's like probably a guy died here, right?

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Like a thousand years ago, maybe like King Richard got stabbed.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Yeah, probably.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So, ghosts or drones or ghosts of drones, but most likely mass hysteria.

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,500
 That's what's going on at Gatwick. That's my opinion.

209
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,000
 But I could be wrong. Probably not, though. We'll find out.

210
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:03,000
 Okay, so our next story is probably, I almost don't even know what category it falls into.

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's both conspiracy and true crime, and it might be the true crime angle.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,500
 It might be one of the dumbest pieces in my, I can't believe that he did this.

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,000
 So let's get for a little, I mean, for a little bit of setup.

214
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 Kevin Spacey, the actor who was accused of molesting dozens of boys and young men.

215
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,500
 He was just yesterday, he was charged with assault of this 18 year old kid that he got drunk.

216
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 And basically, the kid was saying, I couldn't consent.

217
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,000
 Now, that wasn't the only accusation that was made against him, but that's the one he's being charged in right now.

218
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 What's weird, so this is the sequence of events that happened.

219
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 Yesterday, he gets charged with the sexual assault case.

220
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 And then within an hour, probably more like within 30 minutes of the charges officially being announced,

221
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,500
 Kevin Spacey releases a video on YouTube, which they just must be thrilled about.

222
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,000
 So, and the video is called "Let Me Be Frank", which is really,

223
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 he played the character Frank Underwood on House of Cards,

224
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,000
 which was like, he was like a lowly house leader in the US House of Representatives.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And he basically schemes and murders his way up to be president of the United States.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 He ended up getting kicked off the show and killed off screen after he was accused of all these horrible crimes.

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And he's been gone ever since.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Not just the character where Kevin Spacey kind of had a media blackout.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So he gets charged in, I believe it was New York, for this rape for the sexual assault.

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And within a half hour, he releases this video.

231
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,000
 Now, I have my own theory about that.

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 The video is not really heavily edited.

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 It looks like it could have been done all in one take, but it has good lighting and you can hear sound effects.

234
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And he has makeup on and all that stuff.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,500
 So it wasn't like he found out he was getting charged and he's like, "Hey Bruno, grab the camera. We're gonna make this video."

236
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 I bet you anything, he made the video and had planned to release it.

237
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,000
 And the police found out that he was gonna release this video and they charged him.

238
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,000
 They were gonna charge him anyways, but they timed the charge to come out right before the video.

239
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 They may not have known the exact time it was gonna be released, but I bet you someone in Spacey's organization or somehow they found out and they said, "We'll charge him on Christmas Eve."

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Because on Christmas Eve, he's gonna release this video.

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 We don't wanna do it after he releases the video because then it will just look weird.

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 The whole thing is bizarre, but the time, I bet you anything the police knew that video was coming out, they charged him.

243
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 Because if Kevin Spacey got charged and then decided to release the video, he's absolutely insane.

244
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:51,000
 So this is the video. The video is him standing and again, it's not just, I'm not just gonna talk about, there's already, the video's been out for less than 24 hours.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 There's already a ton of conspiracy theories involved in this video.

246
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But I'm going to read you the transcript.

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,500
 My little brother, when he sent this to me, he goes, "It almost sounds like he's talking to his victims."

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,500
 And when I watched it, that was the exact same feeling I got.

249
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 Video starts off with Kevin Spacey washing his hands. That's important with the conspiracy theory stuff.

250
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,500
 And he does this really weird accent, which I guess he has on House of Cards, but anyways.

251
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 He looks right at the camera. He looks right at you.

252
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 He goes, "I know what you want. Oh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong, too powerful."

253
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,500
 I mean, after all, we shared everything you and I. Gross, dude. Gross.

254
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 I don't know what his intended audience is for this. I think you can, I think I can kind of figure it out, but it does sound like he's talking to a young man in a dark room.

255
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 I told you my deepest, darkest secrets. I showed you exactly what people are capable of.

256
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 I shocked you with my honesty, but mostly, I challenged you.

257
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,500
 "And made you think you trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't." That's so gross! Why-

258
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 Yes, yes. Nobody should have trusted you, Kevin Spacey.

259
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 This is absolutely bizarre he released this.

260
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 "And made you think and you trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't."

261
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,500
 So we're not done, no matter what anyone says.

262
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 There's part of me that thinks this video could actually be considered witness tampering.

263
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,500
 It does seem like he's talking to his victims. We're not done, no matter what anyone says.

264
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 It really feels like witness tampering to me.

265
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 And besides, I know what you want.

266
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 Okay, so, and then it has this little thing where he's talking about waiting.

267
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 I don't want to read the whole thing because just for time, but he says, you know,

268
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 "I know you guys have been waiting with bated breath for me to come back."

269
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
 We're gonna skip ahead.

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 This part really set me off. The whole thing sets me off.

271
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,500
 But you wouldn't believe the worst without evidence, would you?

272
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 You wouldn't rush to judgment without facts, would you?

273
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 Did you?

274
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 No. Not you. You're smarter than that.

275
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,000
 How-

276
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 This video right now, the like to dislike ratio, is actually about 70% like to 30% dislike.

277
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,000
 I think a lot of that is people are liking the gutsiness of it.

278
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,500
 But this idea that I would be on his side if I'm smarter, he hasn't been convicted of anything.

279
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,000
 I'll give him that. Like, he hasn't been convicted of anything in a court of law.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 But this idea that I would believe you if I was smarter is so condescending.

281
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Absolutely condescending.

282
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 But anyways, and I don't like being condescended to.

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Then part of the thing is, is that this is where he starts to get-

284
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,000
 Like I said, the impression of the character Frank Underwood from House of Cards.

285
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But then he starts kind of addressing it specifically.

286
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,500
 Where he's like, you know, I got- this was an unsatisfying ending.

287
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 It could have been a great send-off.

288
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,000
 Like, he starts talking- cause he kills his character off-screen, he kind of starts talking about that.

289
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 But here's what's weird. Again, that's some understatement.

290
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,500
 If you and I've learned nothing else these past years, it's that in life and art, nothing should be off the table.

291
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 We weren't afraid, not of what we said, not of what we did, and we're still not afraid because I can promise you this.

292
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 If I didn't pay the price for the things we both know I did, I'm certainly not going to pay the price for things I didn't do.

293
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So again, that is a specific reference, I believe, to the allegations against him.

294
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 That's not the Frank Underwood character, that's him.

295
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,500
 And that plays a big part in the conspiracy thing we're going to talk about as well.

296
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 That last statement.

297
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Then he follows that up by, "Well, of course, they're going to say I'm being disrespectful, not playing by the rules like I ever played by anyone's rules, but I never did and you loved it."

298
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Anyhow, despite all the poppycock, the animosity, the headlines, the impeachment without a trial, despite everything, despite even my own death,

299
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:24,000
 which can be read as the death of Frank Underwood, which is how I think it's going to be. Some conspiracy theorists say that it's the death of Kevin Spacey as a persona,

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,500
 but even my own death, I feel surprisingly good, and my confidence grows each day that soon enough you will know the full truth.

301
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
 Wait a minute.

302
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,500
 Now that I think of it, you never actually saw me die, did you?

303
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Conclusions can be so deceiving.

304
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,000
 Miss me.

305
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And then the video ends.

306
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:59,500
 Now that last part, he puts on a ring from the show, which is a character, a ring that Frank Underwood wears in the show.

307
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 And it's funny because Netflix has issued no comment on this.

308
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,000
 Netflix, they're the ones who produce House of Cards. They have had no comment on this.

309
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 He's basically setting himself back up as a character in a show that at this point is off the air. It's not even new episodes are being made.

310
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:29,000
 It's almost fan fiction, but a stupid, stupid, delusional, bizarre video for a man accused of multiple rapes and sexual assaults to put out on Christmas Eve.

311
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 In the video he's wearing, a Christmas apron. You can hear like a party going on in the background, but it's just an audio effect.

312
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 No one wants to hang out with this guy.

313
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 So why did he do it?

314
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 Part of it could be the egotism. Part of it could be he's absolutely nuts.

315
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 But the conspiracy theory comes in like this.

316
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 He's dead. And this is a deep fake.

317
00:22:49,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 We talked about that on a previous episode where deep fake is you use AI and thousands and thousands of images of somebody and you can actually have a different person move around.

318
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,000
 But you can have the other person's face digitally put on.

319
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,000
 Some of it's convincing, some of it's not.

320
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 But the first conspiracy theory going around right now is that he is dead and this is a deep fake.

321
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,500
 This is he completely computer generated. It's a real person, but with Kevin Spacey's face.

322
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,000
 Unlikely, but possible. I probably say 0.01% possible.

323
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,500
 The other conspiracy theory is that he's not dead, but it's still a deep fake.

324
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,000
 People are like, look at his mouth. Like you can look at the way his neck turns.

325
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It's not how a human moves his neck or his mouth. It is.

326
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
 The other ones are a little more intriguing.

327
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,000
 So, in the beginning of the video he washes his hands.

328
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And I'm not saying, when I say intriguing I'm not saying these are true, but they're interesting.

329
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And we'll go through them, but in the beginning of the video he's washing his hands.

330
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And the part of the conspiracy theory is that he's washing his hands in a religious sense.

331
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 He's washing his hands of his past sins.

332
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 In the video he starts drinking from a coffee mug.

333
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 It is a coffee mug that has a quote from Queen Elizabeth on it about... let me find the exact quote actually that will be interesting.

334
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 Oh, that's great. The Reddit thread, which I'm not a huge fan of Reddit, but they... the thread's been deleted.

335
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,000
 That's great. But I was able to find a picture of the mug.

336
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It's a mug from the... what is it? The castle?

337
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 The castle of Buckingham Palace.

338
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 And it says throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.

339
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 That is a quote from Queen Elizabeth II.

340
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500
 Kevin Spacey apparently is knighted. I don't know if that is actually accurate.

341
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 I saw that on that Reddit thread. That is now the photo... the thread's still up, but the guy who started it deleted it.

342
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
 It's Reddit... I hate Reddit.

343
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,500
 But anyways, they're saying that that mug is showing his connection to the elite.

344
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Even though you can buy that mug at a gift shop, somehow that connects him to the elite.

345
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,500
 And making statements like "Soon enough you will know the full truth."

346
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 And again, the... you know, you trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't so we're not done no matter what anyone says.

347
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,500
 Those are veiled threats towards the elite.

348
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
 I have dirt on all of you guys.

349
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 And if I'm not going to be punished for stuff that I did and I didn't do these particular crimes I'm being accused of, then you don't know me.

350
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,500
 And so the whole video is this veiled threat.

351
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 If he's guilty, he would know other pedophiles and other sexual assaulters in Hollywood or in politics.

352
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 Because they tend to run in packs like predators.

353
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,500
 You swap information, that kid's really cool, he doesn't tell anyone, you know, this person, he's kind of into it, but you know, whatever.

354
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 And you know, so they kind of will swap tips. It's really disgusting. So they have this network.

355
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 But I think that if he was going to name names, what would be the point of him releasing a video saying he was going to do that?

356
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,500
 Maybe it's kind of like a dead man switch where this video is saying "If you do not help me get out of these charges, I will talk."

357
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,000
 So this is either the video of a total crazy egotist.

358
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 It's either a guy, a washed up actor trying to get back on his show somehow.

359
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 It's either a witness tampering and not very veiled threats to his victims or...

360
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 Oh, or there's a couple more. I forgot.

361
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,500
 He's dead and it's a CGI Kevin Spacey. He's alive and it's a CGI Kevin Spacey.

362
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:40,000
 Or it's the real Kevin Spacey threatening the powers that be that if they don't save him, he will topple all of them.

363
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,000
 The first one's completely insane, him being an egotist. The other one, him trying to get back on to a show that's been canceled, is just kind of sad.

364
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 But the conspiracy theories are already rolling. There was a lot of questions of what ring he put on and why he put it on when he did and so on.

365
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 The conspiracy theory community is really diving into this hard to try to figure out what this means.

366
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,500
 And we'll find out soon enough because he's been charged with that crime.

367
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So they will arrest him or he can turn himself in and if he walks into the police station and walks back out, we know he gave them a ton of names.

368
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 If he walks into that police station and does this big thing during court and he's like, "This person's a pedophile and that person, you're a pedophile and you're a pedophile and you're a pedophile."

369
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And everyone's like, "What?" I mean like if he makes a big show of it.

370
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,000
 But most likely he will get arrested and he will plea down and get two months suspended sentence or something like that.

371
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,500
 And then the other thing about that is that's just because he'll have good lawyers and the evidence will be, you know, he said he said.

372
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:53,000
 But even when that happens people will be like, "Mmm-mm, the Illuminati got his warning in that YouTube video and that's why he got off scot-free and just shows how self-perpetuating sometimes conspiracy theories are."

373
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 So I don't give much credence to the hidden messages to the Illuminati in it because you think he could do that more effectively than really seeing a YouTube video.

374
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,000
 You think, okay, and let me just say one last thing about the threats to the Illuminati.

375
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 It would be very, that would be a very dangerous game to play.

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Because he could be like saying, "Yes, I know your secret- or even not the Illuminati, just other powerful pedophiles."

377
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 He could be like, "I know your secrets and you have to help me or I'll let you know all start mouthing off."

378
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,000
 You don't ever say stuff like that because you're just going to get killed.

379
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,500
 Because even if I uphold my end of the bargain, let's say that I go, "Okay, I will help you get off but you can't, not like that Kevin Spacey.

380
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,000
 I will help you get free and in return you will never name me."

381
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And Kevin Spacey goes, "Oh yeah, totally. And then I help you get free. You can hold that over me forever.

382
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,500
 It's not like you, I help you get free and then your memory gets erased from all knowledge of me.

383
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,000
 Next time you do anything or next time it's you're just bored on a Wednesday.

384
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 You call me up and you're like, "Hey man, give me a pizza or I'm totally going to out you as a pedophile."

385
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:02,500
 Like, I know now that you're such a untrustworthy person that there's only the only option I have to protect myself is to take you out.

386
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 So if Kevin Spacey dies in the next couple months or before trial or something like that, then I'll give a little more credence to the fact that maybe he was trying to threaten the elite, the pedophilic elite with this.

387
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 But like I said, most likely he'll get arrested, he'll get a completely short sentence and he won't get any Cosby time and people will be like, "That's because the elite stepped in."

388
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,500
 No, that's just the way our broken justice system works sometimes.
