1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 A charred corpse comes back for revenge, or to just scare you, either or.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,560
 And then we end Missing Persons Week with the story of Frederick Valentik, a young pilot

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,480
 who went missing.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,320
 Simple pilot error?

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,840
 Or was his entire plane abducted into a UFO today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:33,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,640
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,080
 This is our Friday episode, so I hope you guys have a lot of cool plans for the weekend.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,360
 Hey, actually, if you're in the Hood River area, or if you're in the Pacific Northwest,

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,880
 Portland, whatever, Sun Diver, the band I've talked about before, they are doing a concert

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,880
 Saturday at River City Saloon in Hood River.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,480
 I think it's like 9-1.30 in the morning.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,640
 I'll be there.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
 Really cool band.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,680
 I don't know who the opener is, but they're trying to raise funds to get their first album

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,400
 recorded, so swing on by.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
 River City Saloon.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,960
 I'm not sponsored by them or anything like that.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
 I just think they're a really cool band.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
 You should check them out.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,680
 But, let's go ahead and get started here.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,240
 Now, this story that I'm about to tell you is quite interesting.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,280
 Actually, you know, I have to think both of these stories that we're going to talk about

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,760
 today, I've wobbled back and forth on throughout my life.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,560
 But let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,480
 For our first story, we are traveling to Ventura, California.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,400
 Now in Ventura, California, there is a place called Camp Comfort County Park.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,200
 Now if that doesn't sound like a place where a horror movie takes place, I don't know

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,080
 what does, other than like Blood River or Intestine Lane.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,880
 It comfort sounds quite chilling actually.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,160
 And they actually have a large, they actually have, and this isn't like Ojai County, they

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,200
 actually have a lot of kind of spectacular ghost sightings in this area or cryptids,

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,840
 however you want to call them.

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,760
 They have a headless motorcycle rider.

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,600
 I'm assuming his head just got chopped off in a motorcycle accident, although it's possible

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,400
 that his head got chopped off in an industrial accident at work and he just really loved

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
 riding motorcycles.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 There's a bloody bride hitchhiker, which is absolutely terrifying.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,480
 I mean, driving on the road and seeing a bride in the middle of the night would be kind of

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,840
 creepy, but the fact that she's covered in blood, that could be like in the middle of

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,880
 the day in a Bel Air or Rayleigh's.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,680
 You see a bloody bride, you're totally scared.

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,160
 You don't need to be on like a dark night road for that.

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,680
 There's a vampire there supposedly and his big black dog walking around.

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,840
 The vampire's in the grave, don't be scared.

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,920
 You can visit there, he's not going to attack you, but his guard dog like guards his grave.

48
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,160
 But those guys are small potatoes to who we're going to talk about today.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,840
 It's a dark, moonless night in Camp Comfort County Park.

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,760
 You're hanging out with your bros, kicking back with a couple bros, getting a little

51
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,760
 buzz, looking for some babes.

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,040
 And one of them says, not one of the babes that you're looking for, one of the guys that

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,840
 you're hanging out with says, "Hey dude, let's go to the bridge and start like just yelling

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
 random stuff off the bridge."

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 You're like, "What?

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,520
 But you're kind of buzzed, so you're like, "Yeah, I guess that works.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,120
 I mean, maybe we'll meet some girls there in the middle of the night on this bridge

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,620
 in the middle of nowhere."

59
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,000
 So you guys go to the bridge, you're driving your car, you got to shut your lights off,

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
 right, to make it extra spooky.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
 And actually this bridge isn't just like, what is just a bridge, but it has a particular

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,760
 name, a nickname.

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,000
 I should say it's not the official county name, but the nickname is Char-Man Bridge.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,960
 And if you stand on Char-Man Bridge and you yell off of it, just random phrases apparently,

65
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:58,480
 math equations, recipes for muffins, whatever, a horribly bird-scarred man will run out of

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:08,280
 the forest, skin smelling like burnt flesh, and he'll chase you back to your car.

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,640
 That's not you making that noise, that's the Char-Man coming after you.

68
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,200
 And you get in your car and you drive away and he's banging on your windows, bloody pieces

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,480
 of bandages falling off in your car, and actually that you don't notice it, because

70
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,440
 there's always a, there's your car so messy anyways.

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,920
 It's not until later when you're finally cleaning it after three months you find decaying human

72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,520
 flesh in your car, you're like, "Oh yeah, I forgot.

73
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
 Char-Man Bridge, you put it in your scrapbook."

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,040
 So what is the story of Char-Man and Char-Man's bridge?

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
 Actually, here's a good question, which came first.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,520
 Was there a bridge called Char-Man Bridge and then the Char-Man decided, "That sounds,

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,920
 it sounds like home."

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,080
 Or, it's just a place where a horribly disfigured burnt ghost hangs out and that's why the

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
 name did that.

80
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,280
 Now, there's a couple different theories about, so let me say this, Char-Man has been cited

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,040
 for decades.

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,440
 And there's tons of sightings of this guy running through the woods.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,520
 And so for the most part people think it's some sort of ghost.

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,640
 Sometimes you just yell off the bridge and he shows up, sometimes you have to say, "Help

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,520
 me, help me."

86
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,080
 And he comes coming after you, he doesn't come after you to help you.

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,080
 He comes after you to like, you know, and I don't know if anyone's ever reportedly actually

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,640
 been caught or dragged off by the Char-Man.

89
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,960
 But there's multiple origin stories for this one.

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,320
 In 1948 there was a huge fire in the area and a father and a son both caught on fire.

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,680
 The father dies, the son is simply badly burned.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,320
 And for what, so that's the setup.

93
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,040
 And then this is where your 12 year old brother decides to make it a little creepier.

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,320
 So father and son burn in a fire, father dies, son is badly burned.

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,520
 When the rescue workers get to the house, the son has skinned the father's burnt corpse

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,600
 and hung his body from a tree and ran off.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,760
 So the invocation is either he's wearing his father's skin or he just wanted to skin

98
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 his father anyways and the fire made it convenient.

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,680
 There's another origin of Char-Man connected to that same fire in 1948.

100
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,120
 There was a husband and wife caught in a fire.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
 They're in a house.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
 [explosion]

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,280
 Fires go in everywhere, timbers are breaking, back draft is happening.

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,320
 So father, not a father, a husband and a wife, well she might have called him daddy, but

105
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,040
 a husband and a wife are in the house and the fire gets all dramatic and stuff so they're

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,320
 separated but they can look at each other from across the flames.

107
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,840
 But he's all burnt up and she's getting burnt up and his injuries, he can't get to her

108
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,480
 in time and she dies and he, army crawls out of the house, all burnt flesh and everything

109
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
 runs off into the woods.

110
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,200
 So that's why if you yell "Help me, help me!"

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,600
 he comes after you in that other version because the wife the whole time is like "Help

112
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,160
 me, help me!" and he couldn't run his injuries.

113
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,560
 Or also connected to that same fire in 1948, a firefighter died fighting that fire.

114
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,120
 So you have those three origin stories to who the Char-Man is.

115
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,040
 The thing is, is that nobody died in that fire.

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,960
 That was a real fire and it was a really big fire historically, but there wasn't a single

117
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,560
 casualty in that fire.

118
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,560
 So definitely not like a father and the son or the mom or the, what was it, father, son

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,840
 and the wife and the husband and no firefighter side.

120
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,360
 There may have been some vagrant tooling around out there that got burnt, but as far as they

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,720
 know nobody died during that fire and especially none of those stories are true.

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,560
 There's another, the first time I heard about Char-Man was this one, that there was a car

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,760
 accident and a guy got like horribly burned and before the rescue crew could get there,

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,280
 he ran off into the woods on fire and what Char-Man is is basically his ghost coming back.

125
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,040
 Now the idea of Char-Man always really scared me.

126
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,080
 I don't know why, I thought it was real creepy because it's kind of like a ghost that's

127
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,280
 in eternal pain and he comes after you.

128
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,680
 We have a type of Char-Man up in Oregon called the Bandage Man, which is pretty much the

129
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,200
 same thing without the fire.

130
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,880
 It's just, he's just wrapped in horrible like gross smelling bandages.

131
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,920
 He jumps in the back of your car and then you drive away and you find band pieces of

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,760
 bloody bandages in your car, which again most guys won't notice until like three months later.

133
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,480
 But Char-Man's the same thing except he is burnt.

134
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,160
 He has some bandages on him but he's not like a mummy.

135
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,120
 Bandage Man is kind of like a mummy that runs really fast.

136
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,000
 So it's weird that, I think that's probably a legend that is, it's scary and it works

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,840
 and that means it's probably universal.

138
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,240
 There's probably a lot of places with stories of a Char-Man type character.

139
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,800
 But what's interesting too is that there's a plausible explanation for this that I've

140
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,160
 actually heard connected to other ghost sightings.

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,520
 I can't remember the first time I heard this but this whole story is just really, really

142
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
 weird.

143
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,800
 I'm really questioning like how much of it is true at all.

144
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,880
 Obviously I don't think the Char-Man is necessarily true but in the 1960s this is

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,840
 what people think the plausible explanation was for the Char-Man.

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,320
 This is what the police believe because obviously they're not out there trying to arrest the

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
 Char-Man and get a booking for him.

148
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,960
 Back in the 1960s there was a guy with horrible, horrible skin cancer and he would go for

149
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,880
 walks at night so he wouldn't scare people.

150
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 And teenagers would be driving down the road and they would see this horrible, elitist

151
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,120
 figured guy walking around and they'd go "Oh my God, it's a ghost, it's the Char-Man."

152
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,560
 They think that all those legends were retroactively created because this guy with this horrible

153
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,680
 skin disease was walking around at night so they didn't scare him and it would make sense

154
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,720
 because if a bunch of teenagers were yelling at you, you may be yelling back and may be

155
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,600
 perceived to be chasing them and then that would be that.

156
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,640
 So that's how that legend grew but what's so weird is that I'm sure I heard that story

157
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,240
 about someone with skin cancer walking around and people thinking it was monster on the

158
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,120
 east coast as well.

159
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,640
 Like that exact same logical explanation.

160
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,600
 I'm not saying there's only one person with skin cancer who walks around at night but

161
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,720
 I thought it was really weird that I've heard that explanation for other monster sightings

162
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,520
 before and they're like "Oh no, he's a really nice guy, he'd always walk around."

163
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,520
 And the one I saw was actually more recent, they interviewed the guy, it wasn't from the

164
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
 1960s.

165
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,840
 What's a, and again it's super weird, I actually got a YouTube comment just a couple days ago

166
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,320
 on, from SCARTV and it was about my video about people with the glass delusion and he

167
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,800
 says "I heard once about a hippie who took LSD and thought he was a glass of orange juice

168
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,880
 and when, cause he was tripping so hard and when finally at Friday's brain completely

169
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,960
 and finally one day someone bumped into him and he was so sure he was a glass of orange

170
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,280
 juice that he fell over, he broke like, not literally, but in his mind he broke like glass

171
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,240
 and the orange juice went everywhere."

172
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,720
 And it's so funny because when I was in high school I heard that my buddy Sam, I put an

173
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,840
 exact name to it, took so much acid that he thought he was an orange and if you, and he's

174
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,600
 in a mental hospital now and if you touched him he would go "Don't squeeze me, don't

175
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,360
 squeeze me, orange juice will come out."

176
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,680
 Now I don't believe, I, at the time I totally believed that, sorry Sam if you're listening

177
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,000
 to the show, at the time I totally believed that.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,280
 But I think that's a total urban legend, I think that the orange juice, it's, cause really

179
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,520
 what are the chances of two people thinking they're a barrel of orange juice or just an

180
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
 orange?

181
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,240
 So weird, I think for some reason that's a really, I think that's a common urban legend

182
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
 too, LSD and oranges.

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
 Now I'm sure at one point somebody was dressed up as someone took so much acid they thought

184
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 there was an orange and that's where that story comes from.

185
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,760
 I'm sure at one point a man with skin cancer was walking down the street and people thought

186
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
 he was a monster.

187
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,720
 A guy caught on fire after a car accident and booked it in the woods and they never

188
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,220
 found his body.

189
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,480
 Those are all possible things.

190
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,440
 I just think it's interesting how easy it is for these urban legends to kind of morph

191
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,400
 and even their logical explanation I think is simply another urban legend.

192
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,080
 From another place and they just go "Ah, we'll just move that excuse over here."

193
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 So Charmin, if you're out there, Charmin of the World Unite, you have nothing to lose

194
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,560
 but your bandages.

195
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
 I think we really need to have a cryptid olympics.

196
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
 I know I talked about that before but I think we really need to find out who is the top

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,720
 dog of all these monsters of mayhem and we'll see if we can get that figured out for season

198
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
 5.

199
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
 Charmin really scared me as a kid.

200
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,040
 I wouldn't tempt fate and pull over on the side of a bridge and yell at him today but

201
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,240
 yeah, it's just weird.

202
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,960
 It's weird that that bandage imagery and the skin cancer dude and even the orange juice

203
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,720
 and the LSD all just weird universal things or I live in the matrix and stuff just keeps

204
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
 repeating over and over again.

205
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

206
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:14,400
 Now our next story, again, is a story that I totally believed in when I first heard it

207
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:21,520
 and it terrified me and then I started a researcher for the episode and I go "Ah, not ridiculous."

208
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,760
 And now I have a different conclusion.

209
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,080
 It was really weird.

210
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,960
 But for this one we are going to.

211
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
 Sunny sunny Australia.

212
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,400
 I'm assuming it's sunny down there.

213
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,000
 I mean it's at the bottom of the world so it gets like extra sun because it's like technically

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,720
 closer to it and it's big so there's more sunlight per square foot.

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,560
 It's all dirt because I saw a couple documentaries about Australia called The Road Warrior and

216
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,880
 Mad Max Fury Road.

217
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,280
 So we're going to Australia and there we are going to meet a young pilot, a young man

218
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,040
 named Frederick Valentik.

219
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:04,120
 Now Frederick Valentik always wanted to be a pilot and he had a fascination with UFOs.

220
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,240
 Kind of makes sense but his father said he didn't just have a fascination with UFOs.

221
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,080
 He was actually quite paranoid about being abducted by them so it was a little more beyond

222
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,160
 reading "Fate Magazine" or "40 in Times" or anything like that.

223
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,600
 He actually was scared of UFOs.

224
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,160
 Now I will sit around and think all the time what would I do if zombies attacked right

225
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 now?

226
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,200
 What would be my plan if zombies came here right now at my work or while I'm at home?

227
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,360
 How would I defend myself for the first 24, 72 hours?

228
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,760
 I wonder if people do that with UFOs.

229
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,160
 I wonder if people are like if I get abducted tonight what am I going to do?

230
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,920
 Am I going to like start like ball my fist up and start swinging?

231
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,040
 Am I going to reach for that?

232
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,760
 Like I can run full simulations in my mind about a zombie apocalypse or even like terrorists

233
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,920
 taking over my job and it's like Nakatomi Plaza and I'm like crawling through air vents

234
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,640
 which obviously wouldn't be constructed for a dude my size but all that stuff.

235
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,000
 The air vents just collapse and all of the terrorists are like lined up right underneath

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,840
 the air vent I'm crawling in and they just all get crushed.

237
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,480
 I wonder if people do that with UFOs and stuff like that.

238
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,960
 Not like oh yeah I'm imagining I'm the first guy to get on a UFO and I'm like super popular.

239
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,120
 I'm talking about like the bad side of it.

240
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
 You get abducted.

241
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,240
 I wonder if people sit and like I want to say fantasize but mentally prepare themselves

242
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
 for that.

243
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,320
 But anyway so he was kind of like that where he was paranoid of getting abducted by UFOs.

244
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,600
 Now he wanted to be a pilot.

245
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,280
 The problem was he wasn't a very good pilot.

246
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,880
 He actually was having a really hard time keeping his pilot license.

247
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,280
 He kept failing his flying tests to be an official pilot.

248
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,360
 He just couldn't pass the muster.

249
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,640
 He's like sitting there.

250
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
 He's cramming.

251
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
 It's a music montage.

252
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,960
 He's doing all of his stuff.

253
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,440
 He's flying his plane.

254
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,040
 He's waking up in the morning.

255
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,560
 He's eating his pancakes in the shape of planes.

256
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,200
 That's all he can think of.

257
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,960
 So he cannot pass tests to get his pilot's license.

258
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
 He just can't do it.

259
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,800
 He keeps flying though getting those hours in getting that training in.

260
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,260
 He's already been in trouble for flying into secured airspace which obviously just from

261
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,880
 the word of it you would know you can't do that.

262
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,120
 I think even a person who's never flown in a plane knows if they see the term secured

263
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,880
 airspace they're like oh I guess you don't go there and they'd be like yeah you'd be

264
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 correct.

265
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
 He got in trouble.

266
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,320
 I didn't know this was a thing.

267
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,880
 I didn't know this was a problem.

268
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,000
 And again I don't think any non-pilot civilian would ever think this was a problem.

269
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,660
 Frederick Valentik got in trouble twice and was about to be prosecuted for purposely flying

270
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,820
 into clouds.

271
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,580
 What is the point of being a pilot if you can't fly into a cloud?

272
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,820
 That is the only reason why I think anyone would want to be a pilot.

273
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,500
 Your entire life, your entire childhood especially you look up, you see those soft white fluffy

274
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,640
 things and you want to do one of two things.

275
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:19,640
 You want to sit on them like the Care Bears or you want to fly through them like Superman.

276
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,380
 I did not know that was a thing.

277
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,960
 When I read that I was like really, really you're going to prosecute this guy, you're

278
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,720
 going to prosecute this pilot.

279
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,240
 He's like flying and sees like a soft fluffy cotton candy mass towards him and he goes

280
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
 through it.

281
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,060
 It's supernatural.

282
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,300
 Not like I'm that supernatural to do.

283
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,260
 I guess I should say.

284
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,760
 That's ridiculous.

285
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,820
 And I guess you could say well who knows.

286
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,180
 What if another plane, planes know where other planes are.

287
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,700
 It's not like planes are just flying randomly through the sky and you might hit a plane

288
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
 in a cloud.

289
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
 It's a cloud.

290
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,740
 Come on, you can't fly through clouds.

291
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,780
 Can you imagine, I don't think he would have went to jail for it.

292
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,200
 But they would have probably stripped him of all of his flight privileges.

293
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,160
 But going to jail for flying through a cloud might be the worst thing to go to jail for.

294
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
 You're not going to get respect from anybody.

295
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,120
 Why are you and I flew through a couple of clouds.

296
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,360
 Actually you probably would.

297
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,280
 They'd probably be like I wish I could fly through clouds and then they beat you up for

298
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,640
 doing the one dream they could never have.

299
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
 But here we are.

300
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,520
 Frederick Valentik always wanted to be a pilot obsessed with UFOology, paranoid about

301
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,180
 being abducted by UFOs and is on the verge of possibly losing all of his flight privileges

302
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
 for flying through two clouds.

303
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,740
 Separate occasions, they weren't two clouds in a row.

304
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,300
 They went through one and then they're like Valentik, what are you doing?

305
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
 That's it.

306
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,660
 One more cloud and you're out of the skies.

307
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,140
 And he's like oh man and then one day he's just flying and he flies through another cloud.

308
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
 But it was on purpose.

309
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,420
 Like I guess they saw him like eyeing it.

310
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,980
 He's like that looks kind of soft.

311
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,400
 I don't think anyone can see me up here at 10,000 feet.

312
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,720
 Valentik!

313
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,680
 So anyways he's on the verge of losing his flying privileges.

314
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,720
 All he ever wants to do is fly.

315
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,920
 It's October 21st, 1978.

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,200
 Valentik is flying shortly after sunset.

317
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
 No clouds in sight.

318
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,400
 He's like aww.

319
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,160
 He's flying through the sky.

320
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,520
 Obviously I don't know why I pause there.

321
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,980
 I don't know why I pause there.

322
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,860
 And he radios into the air traffic control.

323
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,580
 He says that there is a what he appears to be a plane following him.

324
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,180
 Can't figure it out.

325
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,300
 A large aircraft is how he describes it.

326
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,220
 And so air traffic control is like well we're not showing anything out there.

327
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,060
 And he's like well I'm seeing something.

328
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,420
 It has these lights.

329
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,260
 It has like these four lights.

330
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,720
 He describes it as sort of metallic looking, shiny.

331
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,400
 It moves from underneath him to like behind him to and he's watching this thing move around

332
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
 him.

333
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 But it's at a distance from him.

334
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,560
 It's not super close.

335
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
 But he sees it.

336
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,000
 Now as air traffic control is talking to him and they have the full transcript online.

337
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
 They don't have the recording but as air traffic control is talking to him they start

338
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
 to hear his microphone cut out.

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,020
 And at one point it sounds like his engine might be acting up.

340
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,060
 So this is the ending of the transcript here.

341
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:34,180
 This is Valentik over the radio saying what's going on.

342
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,100
 What I'm doing right now is orbiting.

343
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,140
 And the thing is just orbiting on top of me also.

344
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,900
 It's got a green light and sort of metallic like.

345
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,620
 It's all shiny on.

346
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,740
 It just vanished.

347
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,960
 It's now approaching from the southwest.

348
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,800
 The engine is rough idling.

349
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,880
 I've got it set at 23-24 and the thing is coughing.

350
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,600
 Air traffic control cuts in and says what are your intentions?

351
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,080
 Valentik replies.

352
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,840
 My intentions are to go to King Island, Melbourne, that strange aircraft.

353
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
 It's hovering on top of me again.

354
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:24,940
 It's hovering and...

355
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,300
 Now that wasn't a special effect for a dramatic effect.

356
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,420
 And actually this is the one place where I've seen a little bit of difference.

357
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:38,860
 So in the transcript for the flight control records, after his last it is hovering and

358
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,420
 the microphone is open for 17 seconds.

359
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,980
 So his microphone is still on for 17 seconds after that.

360
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,440
 And what is listed in the transcript is a very strange pulse noise is also audible during

361
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
 this transmission.

362
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,440
 So for 17 seconds you can't hear Frederick but they heard this "Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-

363
00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:02,840
 So for 17 seconds you can't hear Frederick but they heard this for about 17 seconds.

364
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,580
 The other thing I heard, and this is how they reported it, unsolved mysteries did this years

365
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,580
 ago.

366
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,120
 And I've read this account a couple times too.

367
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,280
 When he ends it is hovering and they hear, this is the story I originally heard, they

368
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,360
 heard what sounded like metal scraping on metal for 17 seconds basically.

369
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:33,680
 So he's talking and it's all *makes sound* and they have no idea what happened to Frederick

370
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
 Valentik.

371
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:41,960
 Obviously the line goes dead, they heard either the pulse or the sound of metal on metal colliding

372
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
 and it's like scraping.

373
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,080
 So it wasn't just like a BAM!

374
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,000
 It was like this long scrape, like something brushed up alongside of it.

375
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,520
 Like a UFO had landed on top of it.

376
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,560
 There's a huge search party for this dude.

377
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,960
 And they never found him, they never found his plane.

378
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,440
 What they've come to, the theories that have kind of been settled on in the investigation

379
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,400
 is they think it was one of five things.

380
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,080
 One, well I should say they think it was one of four things.

381
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,520
 One, he was misreading the gauges and he was pulling up on his stick.

382
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,400
 There's this thing called the death spiral where, it's super weird, there's a ton more

383
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,080
 information in the links but basically an idiot's version of it, because I'm the one

384
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,080
 saying it, is when you're turning your plane, if you turn your plane at a, if you turn your

385
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,560
 plane and move your head at the same time, the liquid in your ears that tells you whether

386
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,160
 or not you're standing up straight doesn't move.

387
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,040
 So you can be turning, doing a sharp turn, but your brain will tell you you're flying

388
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,640
 straight because the equilibrium little liquid or the hairs in your ears is what it is, aren't

389
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,680
 sway, it's super bizarre.

390
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,360
 You wonder how many pilots had to die before they finally figured this out.

391
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,640
 But if your head is turning with the turn or against the turn or something like that,

392
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,080
 your ears think you're going straight and so you keep spinning and your brain's like,

393
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,920
 oh no, you're standing, you're going straight dude.

394
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,240
 And that's why it's so unborn for pilots to have to learn how to fly by instruments and

395
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,280
 some pilots have to have blinders put on them during training so they can only look at their

396
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,520
 instruments so they get used to looking at their instruments because if all the deaths

397
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,880
 in front of you is blue, you're really not going to know whether or not you're spinning

398
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
 or not.

399
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,600
 And I think because in the movies it looks pretty obvious, but you're just surrounded

400
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,760
 by blue, it's pretty easy to lose.

401
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,600
 So then that might have been what happened, Death's Spiral.

402
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 He was flying upside down.

403
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
 Now these are all things of why he disappeared.

404
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,040
 We'll get to the UFO step in a second, but other thing is that he accidentally ended

405
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,360
 up flying upside down because again, this is after sunset, so this isn't even all blue,

406
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,160
 it's all black, it's nighttime.

407
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,720
 He just has the lights of his plane.

408
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,240
 Death's Spiral possible, flying upside down accidentally is possible.

409
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,840
 Suicide.

410
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,320
 People think that he could have crashed his plane on purpose because he was going to

411
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,960
 lose his pilot license anyways.

412
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,760
 And what better way to go out than to start the legend that you got abducted by UFOs.

413
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,840
 And what's funny is I talked, when I mentioned, I did a story a while back about the guy

414
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,600
 who wanted to get abducted by aliens and he built a house and made like a UFO and then

415
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,760
 he drove out in the woods and blew himself up a dynamite and everyone thought he was

416
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,400
 abducted for like four or five years, but it turns out he just killed himself because

417
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,240
 he wanted that story.

418
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,040
 I hinted about this story in that one because I said there's another one where he may have

419
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,040
 killed himself to pretend that he got abducted by aliens.

420
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,360
 The fourth possibility is that he faked his death and landed his plane and ran off into

421
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 the wilderness.

422
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,160
 There was a plane seeing landing at Cape Otway in Australia and it looked like his style

423
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,440
 of plane, but there's never been anything to substantiate that.

424
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,040
 Obviously, the fifth answer is alien abduction.

425
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,920
 So let's take a look at the sighting itself.

426
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,120
 Now what's really weird is he's talking about this UFO flying around and he's describing

427
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,520
 this light formation and the general consensus among the investigators and among just skeptics

428
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:23,320
 in general said the light formation that he is describing is actually very common.

429
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,960
 It's like Venus, Mars, it's like these four planets that kind of make a diamond or something

430
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
 like that.

431
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,920
 And I was like, I've never heard of that explanation before, but I live in a city with a lot of

432
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
 light pollution.

433
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,360
 I've always grown up around light pollution, so I don't really ever get to see the stars.

434
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,840
 Only you can see like the big ones.

435
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,280
 So I mean, they're all big generally, but you know what I mean?

436
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,000
 Like I don't get to ever really see the Milky Way.

437
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,080
 I remember I've seen it maybe once or twice in my life because I've always grown up in

438
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,520
 the light pollution areas and never just look out and go, whoa, it's always like I could

439
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,000
 just a couple of stars and a moon for me.

440
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,560
 But that was kind of the common thing.

441
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
 They said, listen, there's this thing that pilots see at night.

442
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,480
 It does kind of look like if it's moving and da da da da.

443
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,600
 And I was like, I'm not really buying that.

444
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,160
 Now when I first heard about the story, it totally terrified me because you imagine this

445
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,000
 young man flying this plane and a large UFO showing up over it and scraping across the

446
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,360
 top of it and either forcing it into the ground or into the ocean or opening up and swallowing

447
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,560
 it whole and we never find him again.

448
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,600
 As I was researching it for the show, I was like, uh, he probably killed himself.

449
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,280
 Like when I was looking more into the circumstances of it, I was like, it kind of had checks those

450
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 boxes again.

451
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,680
 He was about to lose his pilot's license, you know, check.

452
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,800
 He's going through tough times.

453
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,200
 He's a big fan and a scaredy cat of UFOs.

454
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,520
 So that adds the legend check.

455
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,560
 But and then as I was getting ready to record this episode, I was taking another look at

456
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,760
 it and I said, I just, I think that's kind of jump into a conclusion that that's, I mean,

457
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,880
 that would suck to lose your pilot license.

458
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,040
 But I mean, it's not the end of the world.

459
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:06,320
 And it would be really hard not only to fake your death via UFO, but to make sure no one

460
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,960
 ever found wreckage of your plane.

461
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,320
 Like I could see someone being like, Oh, I'm going to kill myself.

462
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,320
 I'm going to drive out to the woods with some dynamite and they won't find me for X amount

463
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,360
 of years if ever.

464
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,320
 But he was crashing a plane that was being tracked into the ocean and hoping that no

465
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,120
 one would ever find it or get out there in time for him to be rescued and stuff like that.

466
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:35,400
 So they have found now pieces of his of a plane near Kings Island, which he was talking about.

467
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,280
 And they said this is similar to the make a model of the plane that Valentik would have

468
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,360
 been flying.

469
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,760
 But it's like the size of your arm.

470
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,600
 It's not like a huge chunk of it.

471
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,240
 So most likely his plane suffered some.

472
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,760
 So I think the death spiral or flying upside down on accident is more likely than to suicide

473
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,200
 or even the alien thing.

474
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,800
 But you got to imagine.

475
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,920
 You got to imagine.

476
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,880
 I sit around all day and I daydream about the zombies coming and what I not daydream,

477
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,320
 but I don't want to say worry, but it's this weird mental state where I'm wondering what

478
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,440
 would happen if zombies showed up now.

479
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,640
 And I know full well in the back of my head, the chances of zombies ever attacking is infinitesimally

480
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
 small.

481
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,360
 It won't happen.

482
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,960
 The chances of me being caught up in some sort of terrorist event is infinitesimally

483
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,560
 small.

484
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,480
 And I would say that if you sat around and you were scared and paranoid about being abducted

485
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,400
 by aliens, it would also be infinitesimally small.

486
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,040
 But what if you did?

487
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,240
 What if when you were a little kid you were scared of the gray aliens?

488
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,440
 As you got older, you couldn't even look at the cover of the book Communion.

489
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,760
 You stayed away from movies that had alien characters in them.

490
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,400
 You didn't even like funny cute little green men on people's t-shirts.

491
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,960
 They always terrified you.

492
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,840
 They were from the skies and they haunted your dreams.

493
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,400
 And one of the things you figured you could do to overcome your fear would be to explore

494
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,920
 the skies yourself.

495
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,960
 Take back a little bit of that power.

496
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,560
 And that fear that you had, that everyone laughed at when you told them, "Yeah, I'm afraid of

497
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
 aliens."

498
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:29,160
 That fear that you had, that gut reaction you had when you saw those creatures.

499
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,040
 You figured it was just like people being scared of clowns or scared of spiders.

500
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,560
 It was just a totally ridiculous fear.

501
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:47,640
 Until the day that UFO opened up swallowed your plane and your fear became a reality.

502
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,280
 It's not common that someone dies from what they're paranoid of.

503
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:01,960
 It's not often that someone dies in the way of their worst possible fear, but it's possible.

504
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,520
 Frederick Valentik did.

505
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,480

 Bye.

518
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,100
 (upbeat music)

519
