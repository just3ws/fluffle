1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
 We've all heard of "Boy Meets Girl", but today we take a look at "Girl Bleets Boy".

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,960
 And then we finish off season 16 by taking a trip in an elevator.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
 After you, sir.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
 Ding!

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,640
 The doors open up.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
 You step inside and I just wave.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,480
 I'm not getting on this elevator.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
 You are.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,280
 You're getting on this elevator.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,520
 And you're about to come face to face with unspeakable madness.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,600
 Today on the season finale of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm having a great day.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,520
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
 Season 16 comes to an end.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,840
 Episode 801.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,640
 That basically is 16 years worth of podcasts.

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,280
 If I did this as a weekly podcast, like a sane person.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,400
 Like every other podcast out there only comes out at once a week.

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 801 episodes.
