1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
 When a man finds himself abducted by aliens, he has no choice but to suck on the tube.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,440
 And then we join a young couple at home, enjoying a little bit of time together.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,320
 But as they're walking into their kitchen and they hear a loud, yet muffled boom somewhere

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,040
 off in the distance, they have no idea they're about to tumble into another world.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:36,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,640
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,200
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,040
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,520
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,240
 Everyone giving up for one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 Mikey, Rattamaker.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
 Woohoo!

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
 Oh yeah, come on in boy!

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,800
 Come on, I don't know why I always sound like a cowboy.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,200
 Cowboy leaning on a bunch of cows.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,240
 Do they have to cowboys traditionally clap?

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,880
 Mikey, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
 I really do.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,440
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,440
 That is another way you can help the show grow.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,800
 Mikey's been a longtime contributor to the Patreon and you also have never given me your

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,680
 address to get your Dead Rabbit Radio supporter stickers.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,560
 So if you guys are a supporter of the Patreon and you've never gotten a sticker, you probably

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,320
 didn't know that you could get one.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,040
 Send me your address, send it through Patreon email or any other way you get ahold of me.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,440
 And we'll send it out to you because those stickers are cool.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,600
 David, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the command codes for the Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 Everyone get on board.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 Hope you got your space suit.

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
 I hope you know how to breathe without a space suit.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,440
 If you don't have one, hit those buttons and launch us out of Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,040
 We're headed all the way out to an alien spacecraft.

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,760
 Pfft.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,480
 Pfft.

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,720
 As we are headed straight up to this alien starship, below us on the blue glob known

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,120
 as Earth, there's a dude.

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
 He doesn't give his name.

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,280
 He posted this report online.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,520
 We're gonna go and call him David.

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,280
 It's December 29th, 2022 and he said, "The other night I had this dream, but I don't

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,360
 think it was just a dream."

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
 I don't think it was just a dream.

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,080
 Now let's take a look at this scenario that he found himself in.

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 David goes, "To be fair, the first part is a dream.

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,440
 I fell asleep.

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,000
 And when I woke up, I was being abducted by aliens."

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,480
 He describes them as standard gray alien type creatures.

51
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,040
 He's walking in this room.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,240
 He calls it like a rectangular room that had a glare from all the walls.

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,440
 There was no identifiable light source.

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,320
 The whole space seemed lit up.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,880
 These are all very standard things we see in alien abduction scenarios.

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,560
 Those are also things that if you watch enough movies, they could give you the dreams that

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,200
 would mimic a standard alien abduction scenario.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,720
 So right now he could be dreaming.

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,160
 He could actually be experiencing this.

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,560
 The gray aliens speak to him telepathically and they tell him the procedures they're

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
 about to do.

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,280
 He goes, "I don't remember the exact words they used, but they were very polite.

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
 Very polite aliens.

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,960
 Let me know what I was about to undergo."

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,560
 And then out of somewhere, he's standing in this room.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
 Out of somewhere, a hole opens up.

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,760
 This hose is kind of like floating around.

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
 And it goes into his mouth.

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,960
 Gull.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,600
 And he starts like, it's one of those translucent hoses.

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,000
 He can see through and he sees this thick red liquid coming slowly towards his mouth.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,880
 He's watching it come through the tube towards his mouth.

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,000
 And he goes, "It was like a reddish liquid and there were darker red particles in this

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 tube."

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It's coming into his mouth, right?

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Standard alien stuff.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,960
 Totally typical gray alien abduction experience, right?

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:13,080
 And then, I don't think I can put this any better than he writes it.

79
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,440
 This was posted online by a guy using the name Naze16.

80
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:27,040
 He writes, "Then a liquid began flowing down the hose and into my mouth.

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,480
 As soon as it hit my taste buds, I couldn't help myself."

82
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:40,920
 And moaned loudly, "Ugh!

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,480
 As I began greedily chugging it all down, it was the best thing I'd ever tasted."

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,360
 You go, Jason, why are you- wait, did you find- did you-

85
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:02,160
 I've been to f*cking somebody posting their bizarre fetish disguise as an alien abduction

86
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,800
 experience.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,160
 That is not for me to decide.

88
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,520
 I would never read something like that and think, "Wow, this guy has a fetish."

89
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
 This is just started.

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
 The story's just started.

91
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,080
 And you can't call it a fetish yet.

92
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,400
 He does say, as he's telling us about his alien abduction experience, he said that even

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,880
 now just typing it out is making his mouth water because he loved the taste of this liquid

94
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
 so much.

95
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,400
 Let's continue though, because we want to know about the alien abduction stuff, right?

96
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,840
 Quote, "I must have been standing there between a few seconds and a few minutes, but I had

97
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,240
 swallowed so much of the liquid that my stomach had began to push out.

98
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,520
 And I was expanding."

99
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,920
 You have that- listen, man, I don't know if this guy has some weird expansion inflation

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,440
 fetish, but I will say this.

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:10,040
 That is such a small niche of a fetish that if this guy had that fetish and got abducted

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,720
 by aliens who wanted to do this to him, talk about a match made in heaven.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,060
 Because I mean, that's awesome.

104
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,160
 If you didn't love getting inflated and the aliens were doing this to you, it would suck.

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,440
 There's no pun intended as you're sucking down that delicious red liquid.

106
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,520
 But then you wonder, could the aliens have given him the fetish?

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,280
 What do you think about that as I continue to read?

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,800
 I'm not done.

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
 I'm not done.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,200
 Okay, quote, "I must have been standing there between a few seconds and a few minutes, but

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,020
 I had swallowed so much of the liquid that my stomach had began to push out.

112
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,020
 And I was expanding rapidly.

113
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,940
 I could do nothing but swallow it.

114
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,020
 I was enjoying it so much.

115
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:06,860
 I grew bigger and bigger, reaching a size well over that of someone nine weeks pregnant.

116
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,180
 I was getting heavier and had to arch my back and hold my hips to prevent myself from falling

117
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
 forward.

118
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,520
 I could hear my belly gurgling and could feel it churning as it continued to swell."

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,920
 I have no way to follow that up.

120
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
 I was trying to think of something.

121
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,100
 I was like, "That's just perfect, right?

122
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,740
 This guy either has an inflation fetish or he has one now.

123
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,740
 What?

124
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
 I just read you some perverts ramblings online?

125
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
 No.

126
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,740
 This is the Arab radio.

127
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,980
 This might have been an actual alien abduction because then what happens as he's slurping

128
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,380
 up that sweet, sweet crimson goo, he wakes up.

129
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
 He wakes up.

130
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
 That was all a dream.

131
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:06,200
 He wakes up and he's lying on his right side underneath the covers and he fills his entire

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,180
 body vibrate with energy.

133
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:18,020
 Then he hears what he can only describe as an angry alien's voice screaming in his left

134
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,580
 ear.

135
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,700
 At that time, David starts to realize he's about to be abducted again.

136
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,060
 So it wasn't just a dream.

137
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,060
 It was real.

138
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,260
 And now that he's awake, he's going to get abducted again and this alien is screaming

139
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,960
 louder and louder and louder in his ear.

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
 And then he wakes up.

141
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
 That was a dream too.

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,320
 That part was a dream too.

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,660
 But this time he wakes up and he's screaming so loud.

144
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,480
 He didn't want to get abducted again even though he did love getting filled up.

145
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,280
 He did probably want to drink some of that goo but he started screaming.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,120
 He was screaming so loud he woke himself up and this time he wakes up for real and his

147
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,940
 stomach is bloated.

148
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:16,240
 Like in real life, he says that his stomach is noticeably bloated and it's gurgling.

149
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,420
 So he goes, "Oh man, maybe that wasn't a dream.

150
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
 Maybe that wasn't a dream."

151
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,300
 He also thought it was weird when he woke up for the final time or as far as he knows

152
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,940
 this whole podcast might be a dream for him too.

153
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,840
 He wakes up from the first dream laying on his right side with the alien screaming in

154
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,300
 his ear and then when he wakes up for the final time, he's on his right side as well

155
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,460
 and he thought that was weird.

156
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,760
 Like he was on the same side both times.

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
 Anyways, let's get back to his stomach.

158
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,500
 Let's get back to his gurgling stomach because he likes to spend a lot of time on this.

159
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,440
 He calls himself, when he wakes up, he's "noticably bloated."

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,540
 And then he, that's an intro, what's noticeably bloated?

161
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,540
 Right?

162
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,940
 Like I don't know how you would define that.

163
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,540
 I'm also morbidly obese.

164
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,500
 I mean it might be hard for me to notice it.

165
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,140
 But maybe if you're like 90 pounds you could tell if you're noticeably bloated.

166
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,140
 But David says that he hadn't eaten much before bed or even that whole evening and he didn't

167
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,140
 feel hungry at all, just "mildly bloated."

168
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:32,240
 So apparently there's a difference between mildly bloated and noticeably bloated.

169
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,640
 I don't know what that is.

170
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,280
 And here this is again, I'm not gonna say that this guy has an inflation fetish, but

171
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,480
 you're spending a lot of time talking about how bloated you are and drinking it in that

172
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
 goop.

173
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,640
 But you know, again maybe the average listener right now that are patting their tummy and

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,600
 they're like noticeably bloated.

175
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,360
 I know what that means.

176
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,160
 Anyways, if you're worried about David's safety, don't worry.

177
00:10:53,160 --> 00:11:01,020
 Just a couple hours later his stomach was now just slightly bloated according to him.

178
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,220
 That's a lot of different variations of bloated.

179
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,900
 I've only heard people go "I feel bloated."

180
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
 And then they don't.

181
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,700
 They're not like "ah man, slightly bloated."

182
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,380
 But at least it's not noticeable as they're touching their stomach.

183
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,780
 He said he's also, he did a follow up post to this.

184
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,900
 This wasn't just a single post talking about him ingesting this liquid that makes his mouth

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,840
 water when he writes about it.

186
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,440
 He wonders, it's an interesting question because obviously it's written like inflation fetish.

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,040
 Some of you may not know what the world's an inflation fetish right when I said it,

188
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,320
 but 10 minutes ago and now you've seen 100 photos of your favorite cartoon characters

189
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,520
 blowing up like a blimp, floating around.

190
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
 Sorry about that.

191
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,080
 But anyways, it's written like inflation fetish porn with the groaning and the arcing of the

192
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,860
 back or arching of the back, however you say it.

193
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,620
 The stomach gurgling is really written like inflation fetish porn.

194
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,860
 What's very interesting is despite that he has some of the similar questions we see in

195
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,620
 standard UFO stories.

196
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,940
 And that's why as much as I love this story because it allowed me to talk about a man

197
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,420
 sucking on a tube until his stomach swelled up.

198
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,600
 But then you have this, he asks these are super interesting questions because he does

199
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,200
 start to go like what are the long term effects of that liquid?

200
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,320
 Like if it wasn't a dream and we do see a lot of alien abduction encounters, they are

201
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,400
 in that weird cycle.

202
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,600
 That's why a lot of skeptics go well they're just dreaming and sure some of them might be,

203
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,200
 but when you're falling asleep and then you wake up and the gray aliens are standing around

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
 your bed.

205
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 Sometimes it's dream like.

206
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,860
 Sometimes you can clearly state that was a dream but this is reality.

207
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,860
 But then you have scars on your body that are unidentifiable.

208
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 Where'd you get them from?

209
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:56,740
 If it was just inflation fetish porn, it really well could be, but if it was just that then

210
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,940
 that's just kind of funny.

211
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,620
 But if we're looking at the story he asks the questions, he goes what did they pump me

212
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,620
 full of?

213
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,820
 Like let's assume that this story is real because he woke up with these other physiological

214
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,380
 effects.

215
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,860
 He goes what in the world do they pump me full of?

216
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,080
 What's the long term effects of having this in me?

217
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,520
 Because I drank a lot of it.

218
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,320
 It was delicious.

219
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,400
 My mouth is watering just talking about it.

220
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,760
 He goes what was the liquid, what are the long term effects of me having the liquid

221
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,840
 in me and where did I get some more?

222
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,440
 Did they sell it at 7-Eleven?

223
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,720
 Do you have some on you?

224
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,320
 He also says he's worried about will he ever be abducted again.

225
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 He thought it was weird.

226
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,280
 He goes why was the alien screaming at me?

227
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
 In anger.

228
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,860
 He goes I could detect anger in the voice of the alien screaming in my ear.

229
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,020
 It's like and then I felt like they wanted to take me again but then I didn't want to

230
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,980
 be taken again.

231
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,780
 Despite his love for the goo, he didn't want to get abducted again.

232
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,060
 So it's super interesting.

233
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,100
 And he did a follow up post to this where he, it was actually a completely separate post.

234
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,180
 He said that he is suffering some physiological effects long term.

235
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,000
 He goes well not long term but as of now he's starting to have joint issues, joint inflammation

236
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,320
 and muscle pain.

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,040
 It's a super interesting story.

238
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,760
 It's quite funny for us to read it.

239
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,160
 But this would be kind of terrifying to go through in a sense because there's so many

240
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
 different ways we could look at it.

241
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,320
 The way it's written it is written like if inflation fetish points.

242
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:35,720
 So you wonder like could, if this dude was completely normal before this but then he

243
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,780
 got abducted by aliens and he was getting aroused.

244
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
 He never says he was getting aroused.

245
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,740
 I'm adding that in.

246
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,740
 He never said he popped a bone or anything.

247
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,340
 But I'm just saying like if he did get aroused by inflating like a balloon.

248
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,940
 Like Jason he didn't say that.

249
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,900
 There was no part of the story.

250
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,380
 Why are you making that hypothetical thing?

251
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,620
 I'm gonna have to put into the show notes my episode about the bridesmaids inflating.

252
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,380
 But anyway Jason I'm not listening to that episode.

253
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,000
 I'm barely listening to this one.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,680
 I'm fast-forwarding through all this.

255
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,480
 Let's just say for sake of argument he was getting aroused while he was inflating.

256
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,920
 But it would have been against his will right?

257
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,320
 It would have been because the goo was so delicious.

258
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 And so he's moaning.

259
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,960
 So I think we can assume he's aroused.

260
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,800
 But imagine you didn't want that fetish.

261
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,440
 Imagine you lived your life totally normal and then you have this quote unquote dream

262
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,340
 you're rejected by aliens and they give you an inflation fetish.

263
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,300
 You're like what if for some you'd be like what is that?

264
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,300
 And you'd have to research and you're like oh no I don't want to be attracted to this

265
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 stuff.

266
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,460
 Like could the aliens do something to you that would give you a fetish?

267
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,820
 You know the weirdest thing about fetishes is how they develop.

268
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:57,180
 Generally your young kid and your sister tackles you and goes smell my feet, smell my feet.

269
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
 Henry smell my feet.

270
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,260
 And you're like no no I don't want to smell your feet.

271
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,200
 That's generally how fetishes happen.

272
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,520
 I'm sure you can develop one later in life if there was something that you really, you

273
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,480
 didn't know was a thing right?

274
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,760
 You didn't know that having sex with balloons was a thing when you were a kid.

275
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,040
 You remember being at a birthday party when you were a kid?

276
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,720
 And some hot lady smothered your head with a balloon and showed the static electricity

277
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,680
 and everyone was like wow Billy look at your hair it's sticking up in the air.

278
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,540
 And you just feel a balloon on your head and you got this big pair of clown boobs right

279
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,900
 in your face and you don't have context for anything that's going on.

280
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,820
 But you don't really think about it but then you're 50 years old and you happen to be looking

281
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,860
 around the internet and for whatever reason you were looking for balloons and then a video

282
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,500
 popped up of a dude having sex with a balloon and then you could have a full blown fetish.

283
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,580
 But even then I would argue in this hypothetical situation that's never happened in the history

284
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,080
 of mankind that the fetish started when you were young.

285
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,680
 They all start when you were young but what if aliens could give you a fetish?

286
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,760
 What if like if I, oh let's even leave aliens out of it.

287
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,040
 Let's say I kidnap you and lock you in my closet.

288
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,720
 And then, okay this one.

289
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,940
 I think we just need to end this segment because it's going to get real dark.

290
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 Real fast.

291
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,300
 It's going to get okay so how about we just look at that.

292
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,980
 David that was such an amazing story.

293
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,180
 I hope you're okay.

294
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,180
 And who knows?

295
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,860
 I mean yes the long term effects of sucking on red fluid coming out of an aliens tube.

296
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,100
 We don't know.

297
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,060
 This is one of these stories that it could 100% be disguised fetish porn.

298
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,920
 But the way like the fetish porn is in the middle and the rest of it is a standard UFO

299
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
 story.

300
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,280
 I'm questioning whether or not something happened to this guy because those are legit questions.

301
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
 He didn't go what's the long term effects.

302
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,240
 Am I always going to get inflated?

303
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,800
 Am I always going to feel as good?

304
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,520
 No he's like my joints hurts.

305
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,040
 This isn't pleasant.

306
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
 What happened?

307
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,280
 It could really be a legitimate alien encounter.

308
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,320
 So we'll just end it like that.

309
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,300
 Before I threaten you with giving you fetishes in my closet, Mikey Radamaker let's go ahead

310
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,260
 and toss you the keys to the carboner copter.

311
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,140
 We're leaving behind my closet.

312
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,860
 I didn't kidnap you.

313
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,060
 You came here willingly and you brought your own balloons.

314
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,900
 Mikey Flyus out of my closet.

315
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:38,460
 Let's head all the way out to a house in the suburbs.

316
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,980
 It's March 22nd, 2022.

317
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,600
 We're at this house in the suburbs.

318
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:53,400
 We're just kind of sitting up on the roof and we see a car pull up.

319
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,440
 Open in the door and we see a young couple get out of it.

320
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,440
 We're going to see Sarah.

321
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,240
 They don't give their real names but Sarah and then her husband Joe.

322
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,320
 She calls him Joey though.

323
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,040
 Sarah and Joey they walk into the house.

324
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,720
 It's March 22nd, 2022.

325
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
 It's 2.50 in the afternoon.

326
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,160
 It's just a standard day in this nice suburban neighborhood.

327
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,180
 When they get home they go into the kitchen and Sarah says, "We're walking into the kitchen.

328
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,540
 Joey is in front of me and he's standing right next to the refrigerator.

329
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,040
 I'm looking at his back."

330
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:35,540
 I was about halfway into the kitchen myself and then off in the distance I hear a muffled

331
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,600
 boom.

332
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,800
 And then off in the distance I hear a boom.

333
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,260
 She described it as sounding like a muffled boom coming from somewhere.

334
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,900
 And even she at the time didn't remember this noise.

335
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
 It was only when she looks back on it.

336
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,960
 She goes, "I remember that noise."

337
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,640
 But at the time she didn't really perceive what was going on.

338
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,780
 But there's a muffled boom somewhere off in the distance.

339
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:23,260
 And then Sarah said it felt like somebody hit her across the back of the thighs.

340
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,220
 As if someone took a broomstick or a board and just slapped right across the back of

341
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
 the thigh.

342
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,220
 She moans.

343
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
 She's like, "Oh."

344
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
 No.

345
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,320
 She's standing there and she feels the impact of something slapping against the back of

346
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,200
 her thighs.

347
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,320
 And then the world tilted.

348
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
 That's exactly how she described it.

349
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,560
 She felt this physical force hit across the back of her thighs and quote, "The world tilted."

350
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,600
 The whole kitchen floor tilted so hard Sarah is now standing at at what she could only

351
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,480
 gauge at like a 90 degree angle.

352
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,900
 The floor is flipped so hard that she's actually physically leaning in the opposite direction

353
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,380
 of the tilt to avoid just tumbling on forever.

354
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,680
 Like the whole floor goes, "Zzshh."

355
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,680
 At the same time where she's trying to write herself and really shh.

356
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,960
 This is so chaotic.

357
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,080
 What's happening with her senses is so insane that she can't really make sense of what's

358
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
 going on.

359
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,360
 Her body almost instinctively leans to the opposite direction to try to steady herself.

360
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,400
 As Sarah is trying to make sure she doesn't slip and fall down this sharp angle, she notices

361
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,440
 her husband in front of her is holding onto the fridge for dear life.

362
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
 He's fighting the tilt too.

363
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,280
 30 seconds pass.

364
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,360
 They're frozen in this motion.

365
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,440
 They're trying to not fall.

366
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,520
 On a floor that they've walked on a hundred, a thousand times.

367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,800
 A totally normal floor.

368
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,600
 It's now tilted.

369
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,480
 And after 30 seconds, in an instant, the floor has returned to normal.

370
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,040
 Sarah is now able to fully stand up.

371
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:35,160
 She's no longer having to kind of crunch her body down and try to maintain this pose.

372
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,120
 She's able to fully stand up.

373
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,040
 And at the same time, her husband lets go of the fridge and turns to her.

374
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,400
 And he's out of breath.

375
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,080
 And she asks her husband, "Are you okay?"

376
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,400
 Joey looks straight into Sarah's eyes and says, "Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, but I don't

377
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,640
 know what happened, but for a moment there I thought I was just gonna fall flat on my

378
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
 face."

379
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,360
 I had to grab that fridge to keep that from happening.

380
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,680
 Sarah is now realizing whatever happened to her happened to him.

381
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,800
 She's confirmed it.

382
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:18,480
 She saw him grab onto the fridge, but now he's confirming that the floor was also wrong

383
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 for him.

384
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,640
 And then he goes on to say, "I don't know what happened.

385
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,040
 I was walking towards the fridge and all of a sudden it felt like something just BAM

386
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,840
 hit me in the back of the legs.

387
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,040
 And it hit me so hard I stumbled forward."

388
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:40,720
 And the next thing I know, the floor was slipping out from under me.

389
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,120
 And Sarah had the same sensation when that force hit her, she felt herself kind of stumble

390
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,480
 a bit and then the floor flip.

391
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:58,640
 And they both stood there like that for 30 seconds until everything returned to normal.

392
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,840
 Sarah was posting about this online.

393
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:08,080
 She was posting about it under the username "Hellcat'swife."

394
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:18,920
 And she goes, "Ever since then, things haven't been right.

395
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,680
 For one, both of us for the next several days could still feel where that force had hit

396
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,960
 them in the back of the legs.

397
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,640
 It felt sore as if whatever slammed into us hit us with enough force not just to make

398
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:42,800
 us stumble forward, but to leave a not a mark but a lasting impression.

399
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,720
 They could definitely feel the physical touch of it, the physical pain of it after all these

400
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 days."

401
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,800
 But that's one thing.

402
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,640
 We see physiological effects after high strangeness that does happen in one way that gives the

403
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
 experiencers a little bit of proof of what happened, right?

404
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,520
 The Irving Lane Stomachs, for example, or in this one, your legs hurt for a couple days.

405
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,520
 Having another witness in the event is a big thing as well.

406
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,520
 It was just Sarah or just Joey.

407
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
 This story may have never been told.

408
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,080
 They might have just chalked it up to some issue.

409
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
 Most likely medical.

410
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,200
 If this happened to you alone, you're walking into a kitchen and everything tilted, you

411
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,880
 might make a doctor's appointment.

412
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,280
 You might go, "Whoa, is that what a stroke feels like?

413
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,560
 Is that what a heart attack feels like?"

414
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,680
 But if this was just the story of the kitchen tilting, which would be weird enough, if it

415
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,520
 was just two people experiencing it at the same time, which would be weird enough, if

416
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,680
 it was just feeling the physical pain later, that'd be weird enough, but we're not done.

417
00:25:49,680 --> 00:26:02,480
 Sarah goes, "Ever since the incident, both of us feel off."

418
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,520
 Maybe that's not the best way to put it.

419
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,320
 Maybe it's not that we feel off.

420
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,640
 It's that everything else is off.

421
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:25,120
 She said, "Other than myself and my husband, our children, and our dog, the world is weird."

422
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:33,480
 These relationships we used to have, not with our immediate nuclear family, but old friends,

423
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,320
 coworkers, some things, off.

424
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:48,160
 We've developed new hobbies to replace the ones we no longer love.

425
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,920
 It's like a complete 180 took place, is how she put it.

426
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,960
 A reset button on life.

427
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,960
 You got a lot of people responding to this as to what it could be.

428
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,080
 Obviously, people started talking about carbon monoxide detectors.

429
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,320
 Other people were saying there's a possibility of if there's a low intensity blast in the

430
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,680
 area, the shockwave could cause some perception issues, things like that.

431
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,840
 You have these different theories going around, but those were the skeptic theories.

432
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,200
 Maybe it was just something exploding nearby that the government covered up.

433
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,240
 Maybe it was carbon monoxide, maybe it was all this other stuff.

434
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:45,240
 Then of course, you had the believers come in and their opinion was they slid into an

435
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,440
 alternate universe.

436
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,000
 Just the tilting of the floor wouldn't explain that, but the fact that now they find all

437
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,720
 these things different, things they used to love they don't love, relationships they

438
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,200
 used to cherish they no longer care about.

439
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,720
 That was what was kind of making people angle towards them.

440
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,040
 Maybe you're in an alternate reality now.

441
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,560
 A couple days later, Sarah came on and did an update because people were like, "Check

442
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,640
 for things that have changed.

443
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,240
 Things that you can actually measure.

444
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,200
 It's hard to measure how much you cared about your coworker prattling on about days of her

445
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
 lives or whatever.

446
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,040
 But what's something you can measure?"

447
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,720
 She did return a couple days later to post again, an update to the original post is how

448
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,640
 she put it.

449
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,200
 She goes, "I have found one thing that's different."

450
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,400
 Really the only thing that I could really notice.

451
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,520
 She goes, "We've lived in this house for years and we had this lamp.

452
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,000
 And it was the lamp that was right next to the couch that we had always shut off when

453
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,320
 we were getting ready to watch a movie.

454
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,480
 And the other day I was sitting there and I went to shut it off.

455
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,920
 I turned the knob, click, and the light got brighter.

456
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,560
 I turned it again, click, and it got dimmer.

457
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,480
 Turned it again, click, it went off."

458
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:31,360
 She said the lamp we've had for years was a single switch lamp.

459
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,600
 You turn it on, you know, lights up.

460
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,920
 Click it again, you know, shuts off.

461
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,840
 That's the lamp we've had all of these years.

462
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,760
 And when you'd be sitting there and it's time to shut that light off to watch a movie,

463
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,480
 and we've all done this a hundred times, you'd reach up and you'd shut it off.

464
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
 You'd just click it once and that light would go dead.

465
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:02,000
 She goes, "But the lamp in our living room now is a three-way lamp with a three-way light

466
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 bulb."

467
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:13,480
 You have to keep turning it until you shut it off.

468
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,920
 She goes, "I know that's not the lamp that was there.

469
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,360
 I know that's not the lamp that was there for years and I know that's not the light bulb.

470
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,880
 And I have a thousand memories of flipping that switch once and that light shutting off."

471
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,960
 She goes, "Right now that's the only difference I've found."

472
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,880
 This is obviously a fascinating story.

473
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,200
 We're looking at a possible experiencer, people who remember shifting into another dimension.

474
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,280
 If the story's true, it could be made up.

475
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,760
 If the story's true, that's what this would perfectly detail.

476
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,200
 We've covered a story like this before where the guy got in the horrible car accident and

477
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,720
 he ended up in this weird realm where the giant sorting wheel was like destroying the

478
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
 landscape.

479
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,520
 I've covered a thousand favorite stories that I've done out of two thousand stories we've

480
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
 covered.

481
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,640
 I'll put it in the show notes.

482
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,560
 That's what this feels like to me.

483
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:16,860
 What it sounds like to me is they're in the kitchen, their kids and their dog are nearby

484
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,880
 if not in the house in the neighborhood, and a bomb went off.

485
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,220
 And it vaporized everybody around them and it would make more sense if the dog and the

486
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,440
 kids are at home and they were all vaporized in the same blast.

487
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,880
 That's what that explosion was.

488
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,040
 And everything tilts and that is them in that sorting wheel type of thing.

489
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,640
 That is their reality actually freaking out.

490
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,880
 We don't know how old the kids are.

491
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,480
 We don't know if they're like, "Hey Johnny, did you get thrown into another dimension

492
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
 lately?

493
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,560
 Did you figure out that your feet were totally off or whatever?

494
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,640
 How would you explain that to a kid?"

495
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,460
 Some explosions, some disaster happened in their original reality and now they're in

496
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,140
 ours.

497
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,380
 But the way the alternate reality works is that it's actually quite possible that Sarah

498
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,660
 and Joey got thrown into our reality where in this world she notices there's a three

499
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,140
 way light bulb and in that reality there was just one way light bulb.

500
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,600
 And it could be in this reality when they went to the store that was the only one available

501
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,020
 so they got the three way light bulb one.

502
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,720
 And that's the way the Mandela effect works or the way that we know about alternative

503
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,480
 universes, quantum, immortality, things like that is this idea that you can recognize little

504
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,060
 things that weren't there before.

505
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,400
 Things can be different.

506
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:43,020
 But then you think, "What if..."

507
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,920
 Let's put our conspiracy caps on for the second time this episode to wrap this up.

508
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:57,620
 What if this could explain some for the Spotify sensors out there?

509
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,100
 I don't have to worry about YouTube anymore but Spotify.

510
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:10,260
 Some that the alternate universe theory explains some mental illnesses.

511
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:18,640
 Recently, I covered this story on my true crime TikTok YouTube channel.

512
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,040
 Told the story in about a minute.

513
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
 It's not a lot.

514
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,400
 I'll probably tell it in a minute here as well.

515
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,040
 Super recent true crime story.

516
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,920
 December 13th, 2022 so incredibly recently in Mitchell, the city of Mitchell in Indiana,

517
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:45,540
 there was a man named Sean Hayes.

518
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,140
 Me, my life's a little messed up right now.

519
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,540
 I'm pretty sure my dad got kidnapped.

520
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,040
 He's been replaced with a robot.

521
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,700
 So can I get your help with this?

522
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,140
 Now that would be alarming enough if you were his friend.

523
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,540
 If he's in your top five, it's popping up right in the front and you're like, "Oh, great,

524
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
 Sean."

525
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,360
 This is how he ends this post.

526
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:16,920
 He goes, "I need to know for sure that that is a robot that looks like my dad before I

527
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,680
 shoot at it."

528
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,240
 We don't know whether or not they alerted authorities about this because obviously that's

529
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
 pretty alarming.

530
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,480
 You're building your own robot right now.

531
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
 You're like, "God, zoops.

532
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
 They beat me to it.

533
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
 I'll have the authorities stop them."

534
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
 No.

535
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,760
 You're like, "Oh my God, I think Sean Hayes is about to shoot his dad."

536
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,260
 I don't know though if they actually called the authorities or not, but on December 20th,

537
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,420
 2022, the police do a welfare check of the Hayes residence.

538
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,740
 So they may have been alerted or people may just thought it was weird that they hadn't

539
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,860
 heard from Richard Hayes, 73-year-old father of Sean Hayes.

540
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:58,380
 So the police show up at the house and they see Sean Hayes running out of the house to

541
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,180
 get in his pickup truck and the police see a shotgun in the pickup truck.

542
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,980
 There's a scuffle that breaks out.

543
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,440
 The cop grabs the shotgun.

544
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,680
 Sean Hayes starts fighting these cops off.

545
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,520
 Finally they subdue him.

546
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,000
 And then they see Lane in the front yard of the house is the body of Richard Hayes.

547
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,120
 He had been shotgunned in the chest and in the head.

548
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,680
 His body had also been mutilated and partially dismembered.

549
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:33,680
 Apparently Sean Hayes was looking through his dad's intestines trying to find the wires

550
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,340
 to prove that his dad was a robot.

551
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,340
 Trying to find some.

552
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,180
 That's a tragic story.

553
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,180
 It's a tragic story.

554
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,180
 Don't get me wrong.

555
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:54,580
 But what if not making light of this, okay?

556
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
 Conspiracy cap.

557
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,780
 You can't come at it conspiracy cap stuff.

558
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:08,400
 What if in an alternate reality Sean Hayes' dad was a robot?

559
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,360
 In an alternate reality he actually was a robot.

560
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:18,120
 And then Sean Hayes slid into the universe where he's not a robot but thought he was

561
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,760
 still a robot.

562
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
 Now I want to be very clear.

563
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,600
 You shouldn't murder him at all whether or not he's a robot.

564
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:33,020
 But what if, that's all I'm saying, is people who suffer from these mental delusions that

565
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,220
 their loved ones have been replaced with zombies or clones or people who are complaining about

566
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,020
 being gangstalked, what if they came from an alternate universe where they were being

567
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,260
 gangstalked and now they're all here.

568
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,420
 It's a fascinating story.

569
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:57,080
 It's a fascinating story of alternate realities, of unlived lives and yet tiny changes within

570
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,960
 these lives that we may not notice.

571
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,020
 There may be a lot of changes that would indicate we actually were from an alternate universe

572
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,520
 and not something as big as the Berenstein Bears.

573
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,840
 Not even something as small as being able to detect your light bulb.

574
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,080
 But text changing in a book you've never read.

575
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:20,060
 You have a book on your library, you have a book up on your library shelf at home, you

576
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:25,540
 never read it, it was a gift and simple text changed in there, you would never know.

577
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,260
 The changes could be minute, the changes could be huge.

578
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:34,220
 The question is, when it happens to you, because if we're talking about quantum immortality,

579
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,460
 we're talking about this happening to everybody at some point.

580
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,940
 When you die you simply shift into a universe you haven't died in yet.

581
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:50,280
 If that theory is true, when you shift, will you be able to tell what changed?

582
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,600
 I mean technically at this point, like I'm 46 years old, I can identify quite a few times,

583
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,680
 maybe 6 to 10 times, where I legit should have died in that situation.

584
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:10,840
 Like miracle beyond the heavens that I didn't die.

585
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,880
 And I'm still here.

586
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,500
 But it's possible that I've shifted 6 to 10 times already.

587
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,260
 And those are the ones I remember.

588
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,180
 I'm thinking about the time when I was a baby, apparently I had a heart attack when I was

589
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,180
 born.

590
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,180
 A little baby boy going eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

591
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:49,140
 The

592
00:38:49,140 --> 00:39:09,580
 question is, is like when these changes happen, will you notice them?

593
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,780
 When these changes happen and they will happen, if this theory is true they'll happen to us

594
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,660
 multiple times and as we get older and our lifespan gets shorter, they'll happen more

595
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,660
 and more often.

596
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
 Slip in the bathtub?

597
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,660
 No you didn't.

598
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,700
 You caught the Rayleigh in just the right time.

599
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,660
 But the universe is slightly different.

600
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,040
 Trip in the garden?

601
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
 Land on the rake?

602
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
 Face first?

603
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
 No you didn't.

604
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
 You didn't put the rake there.

605
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
 You did fall down.

606
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,500
 You got a mouth full of earthworms.

607
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,640
 But the rake didn't pierce your brain.

608
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
 Car accident?

609
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,500
 You're an elderly person driving a car and you can't really see that well.

610
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,940
 You did cause that huge car accident because you couldn't see really well.

611
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,180
 Those cheerleaders are going to need to go to physical therapy for a while that you ran

612
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,260
 into but you didn't die.

613
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
 You kept on driving.

614
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,240
 You kept on driving and you didn't even know you hit those girls.

615
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
 And all of these things happen.

616
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,380
 You didn't have a heart attack in the middle of the night.

617
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,840
 You woke up totally fine.

618
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,280
 But all around you the universe is completely changing.

619
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,720
 And you're dying so often the older you get it's changing more and more frequently.

620
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,360
 And at what point does it become unrecognizable?

621
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,040
 At what point is it not oh the lamp's different or this book title's different?

622
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,000
 At what point does it become completely unrecognizable?

623
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,660
 When you wake up and you don't recognize anybody around you, you don't recognize the house

624
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,820
 that you're in, you don't know what's going on.

625
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,540
 And we see that in people and we think they're insane.

626
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,540
 They're raving lunatics.

627
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:56,540
 They're walking down the street and they're talking to no one about Russian spy satellites

628
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,180
 beaming messages into their brain.

629
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,820
 But what if these are just people who live the life so hard they died so many times that

630
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,080
 they're now in a world that while it's normal to us it's unrecognizable to them.

631
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,680
 It is the kingdom of the insane.

632
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,160
 We totally see it as a normal reality, a normal planet, but to them it is so divorced from

633
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,640
 the world that they knew.

634
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,680
 And even though every time they died they moved just a little bit farther away inches, inches

635
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,560
 away into alternate universes, eventually they've died so many times they're in something

636
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,740
 that is unrecognizable to them.

637
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,620
 Something that induces insanity.

638
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,820
 It's that alien to them.

639
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:50,300
 We pump them full of drugs and all that does is calm down the chemicals that are screaming

640
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
 in their head.

641
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
 None of this is real.

642
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
 None of this is real.

643
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,180
 This is not the world you remember.

644
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,060
 Is that the fate of what happens to someone who has slid through reality time after time

645
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,640
 after time after time after time?

646
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,640
 They move farther away from a world they actually recognize to a world that nothing is what

647
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,400
 they know of it.

648
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,600
 Is that why mad men walk the streets screaming at the top of their lungs?

649
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,600
 They've witnessed a reality that never should have existed in the first place.

650
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,500
 But to us, it's just home.

651
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:44,900
 And if that's the case, what happens to us when we slide too far through the alternates?

652
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:50,340
 What happens to us when we realize we're in a world that has many more differences than

653
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,520
 just the lamp?

654
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,660
 Couple movie titles.

655
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,580
 Couple quotes.

656
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,360
 What happens when we keep going deeper and deeper?

657
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:07,160
 What happens when we die time after time after time and it's tiny changes compounded by more

658
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,640
 tiny changes compounded by more tiny changes until one day we pick ourselves up out of

659
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,300
 the garden, wipe the fresh soil off of our faces.

660
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,160
 We look at the neighborhood we've lived in for years.

661
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,240
 We don't recognize a single person walking down the street.

662
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,000
 Nothing is as it seems.

663
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,080
 Nothing is as you remembered.

664
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,480
 Everything is wrong.

665
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,040
 You know it.

666
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
 You know it.

667
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,080
 And no one can tell you otherwise.

668
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:51,240
 And as you're screaming and ranting and the police are called, the doctors are called,

669
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,120
 and you're pumped full of medicine and you're strapped down and you are treated as just

670
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:03,560
 one of a countless number of mental patients, the people who are doing the strapping, the

671
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,880
 people who are putting the medicine in your body, the police officers who arrest you,

672
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:17,920
 all of the residents of the neighborhood, all of them will eventually share your fate.

673
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:26,080
 Plunged through a sea of alternate realities until finally they go mad in a world different

674
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,360
 than the one they always knew.

675
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:38,440
 And if you think that's bad, wait until you die again.

676
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:51,360
 If you thought this last world drove you mad, the next one's going to be a scream.

677
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,880

686

 Bye.

687
