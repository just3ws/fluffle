1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 The heart wants what it wants. The old saying goes, "But is it really our heart

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:17,520
 that holds our love or is it the cat poop in our lungs?" You didn't know you

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,440
 currently had cat poop in your lungs? And then we travel to Los Angeles, California

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,200
 to take a look at the story of a young mother who's alone with her infant

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,600
 daughter. When she put her baby to bed for the night and crawled into bed

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,000
 herself, she thought she was just gonna have another restful sleep. Instead, she

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,120
 found herself going toe-to-toe against an alien kidnapper today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:56,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,800
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,120
 day too. Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing. Let's go

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,280
 ahead and get the episode started. Walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,080
 Christmas livestream contributors. His name means Lion and he's probably as furry

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,280
 as one. Give it up for Leo. Woo yeah! Come on in. You gotta walk on all fours and do

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,240
 lion noises as you walk. And Leo, Leo, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,360
 episode if you guys can't support the Patreon if you're not a furry. I just

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,960
 outed this guy. That's okay too. Just help spread the word about the show. That

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,280
 really, really helps out a lot. Now Leo, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the

18
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,840
 Jason Jalopy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. Let's drive all the

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,000
 way out to a research facility. Driving on out there. And I'm telling you, like,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,480
 this is where we're supposed to go to this research facility. Now you're

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,560
 expecting to see like a white building, probably like two or three stories with

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,160
 a sign in the front that says something like Cyberdyne or Biosyn or something

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,560
 like that. But we passed those two places. You're like, "Oh, shouldn't we stop the

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,560
 future from being all terminators?" Nah! Let's someone else deal with that. We're

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,800
 driving down and we pass all these research facilities and then we see

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,160
 this old house. The paint's all chipping off and it doesn't look like the porch

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,280
 has been repaired in 20, 30 years and the grass is heavily growing over. And I go,

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,600
 "Here, here's where we're going. Here's the research laboratory." And we're walking

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,880
 inside. Actually, I didn't even plan this. Leo, you're the perfect person to be part

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:42,200
 of this episode. We're gonna visit your buddies. This house is full of cats. And

31
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,520
 then we're about to meet the head research scientist. This lady comes out.

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,160
 Her hair's all disheveled. She's wearing a shirt that has a picture of a cat on it.

33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
 And the picture of a cat is wearing a shirt that has a picture of another cat on it.

34
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,360
 And it just goes on and on. And this is Matilda Buford. Matilda Buford, the local

35
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,640
 crazy cat lady. And you're allergic to cats. You're super confident and itchy. Well,

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,200
 this is just the first part of the show. You won't be itchy the second part. We're

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,400
 in this cat house. We're in this crazy cat lady's house. And these cats are rubbing

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,640
 up against us and putting their scent everywhere. And we're just breathing in the stale air

39
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,400
 of urine and cat feces. I really hope none of you guys listen to this while you're eating.

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,160
 Every so often someone emails me and says, "Dude, seriously? That's not my fault. That's

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,280
 not my fault." No, you know what you're getting into at this point. The smell of uncleaned cat

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,120
 litter. Breathing them cat feces. Recently, I was talking to Cabot Cove Balloon Friends,

43
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,200
 longtime supporter of the show. We were talking about parasites. We were talking about parasites

44
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,320
 rescinding each other photos of our bowels. What are you infected with right now, Cabot?

45
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,880
 We were talking about parasites. We were talking about some of the conspiracy theories involving

46
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,740
 parasites and the way they affect people. And I did an episode not too long ago about

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,320
 parasitic castration. And there's parasites that actually make it so you don't want to

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,120
 have sex or you don't engage in sex. And I said, "Are humans getting infected with that?"

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,400
 Because we're seeing people just disengaging from the dating world and not having sex and

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,520
 just playing video games all the time and things like that. Which, you know, whatever.

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
 I don't have a problem with it. I don't have a problem with people playing video games all

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,120
 the time because I wish I could do it, right? I'm listfully looking at them as their gonads

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,340
 are being devoured by a parasite. I was like, "Oh, why not me? Why do I have to do all

54
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,240
 this work? I don't get to play Minecraft all day long." So I did that episode recently

55
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,700
 about parasitic castration. I'll put it in the show notes, but I'm sure you don't want

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,200
 to listen to it. And then I found this article, though. I found this article really around

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,340
 the time we were talking about, we were sending photos of our own parasitic infestations. In

58
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:02,220
 Finland, the country that famously doesn't exist, there is the University of Turku. And

59
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,360
 a new study has come out of the University of Turku into toxoplasma gondii. This is

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,520
 the parasite that has taken over the world. And I don't think that I'm being an alarmist

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,440
 by saying that. Toxoplasma gondii has taken over the planet. What's weird is it can only

62
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,780
 sexually reproduce in the stomach of a cat. That's the only place where it can actually

63
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,260
 reproduce or the intestines of a cat. I don't think it's like, "Okay, we're in the bowels.

64
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,540
 We can't see each other anymore." But it can only reproduce in a cat. But what happens

65
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,140
 is when the cat poops, the parasites come out of the poop and they're like, "Oh, no,

66
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:52,300
 I want to have more babies." So when you breathe in cat poop, the toxoplasma gondii goes inside

67
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:00,200
 of you. Now right out of a horror movie, this is so insane. They found out that it can only

68
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,360
 reproduce in a cat. Toxoplasma gondii can only reproduce in a cat. But cats poop everywhere

69
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,040
 and this parasite is highly contagious. Now it has to get back into the cat to reproduce,

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,560
 but it's already come out of the cat's butthole. What's it going to do? Well, if a mouse comes

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,940
 in contact with this, you know, an uncleaned cat lady's house, right? This poop's lying

72
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,460
 around, it's dusting off, these little parasites are sailing through the air and a mouse inhales

73
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,580
 it. The mouse loses it. They've tested this over and over and over again. The mouse loses

74
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:42,940
 its fear of cats and will actually get into situations that will get it eaten by a cat.

75
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,700
 And then the toxoplasma gondii is back in the cat's stomach and it's just having a little

76
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:54,040
 horge in there. It's like, "We made it boys! We're back!" That's straight, that is invasion

77
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,580
 of the body snatchers. It actually shuts off the mouse's fear. They've tested it, they've

78
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,880
 put mice in rooms that are infected with this and they'll spray cat urine around and the

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,960
 mouse just walks around it. But a non-infected mouse will smell cat urine and be like, "Oh

80
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,140
 dude, I saw a bunch of documentaries called Tom and Jerry back in the day. This dude wants

81
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,620
 to eat me and he's gone." Now the reason why that would be fine, right? Who cares what

82
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,380
 happens to mice? They're kind of cute, right? They're little cool guys. But they wouldn't

83
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,540
 say it's taken over the world if it's just infected mice. The thing is, is that this

84
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:36,180
 also infects humans and we know this and this is the reason why you have the idea of the

85
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,960
 crazy cat lady stereotype because in some people, toxoplasma gondi can cause schizophrenia

86
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,640
 or trigger existing schizophrenia. There'd probably be another way to put that. Because

87
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,840
 studies estimate right now, this was really taken over the world, studies estimate that

88
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:04,080
 between 30 to 50% of all humans on the planet right now have either been exposed to it or

89
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,780
 are chronically infected with it. Because when it goes in humans, it's eventually going

90
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,620
 to die out. If you're walking by and a cat farts in your face, you're not going to have

91
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,900
 to run to the mental hospital. You're like, "Oh no, I'm afraid I'm schizophrenic." But

92
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,260
 if you're constantly around it and you're constantly breathing it in, you constantly

93
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,860
 have this parasite inside of you. It can't replicate in you. But it's going to do crazy

94
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,100
 things while it's inside of you. When it is in a man, when a man gets this toxoplasma

95
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:41,040
 gondi, it's been linked to being a worst driver. This has effects on how people think, the

96
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,440
 decisions they make. This little guy sliding around in your tummy makes you, for men, it

97
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,260
 makes you a worst driver, makes you more rebellious. You're always talking back to authority.

98
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:01,120
 But in a weird thing, it makes women more warm-hearted, more open to relationships and things like

99
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,100
 that. We do those things other than the schizophrenic cat ladies. It also increases a woman's chance

100
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,500
 of suicide after the age of 60. These are some weird side effects. It would be one thing

101
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,080
 if everyone got more rebellious or everyone got more warm-hearted, but we see a distinction

102
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,860
 between the two groups. It's actually more dangerous for, I mean, obviously being a rebellious

103
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,260
 man can lead to dangerous situations. Being a worst driver can lead to dangerous situations,

104
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,000
 but a higher likelihood of killing yourself over the age of 60, we see that. The very

105
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,040
 first time this was detected in a human was in 1938. A baby was born with it. It was actually

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,120
 in its brains. When the baby died, they didn't know what killed it. They did an autopsy. It

107
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,840
 was starting to have seizures, right? And then it died. And then when they did the autopsy,

108
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,280
 the brain was infested with this, and so were the eyeballs. And that was the first time science

109
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,300
 goes, "Well, this can actually infect a human." The very first time we discovered it in a

110
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,500
 human, it killed the baby. So, I mean, it obviously had been in people before. Like, sometimes

111
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,180
 these are connected to like crazy rulers throughout time. I remember reading an article, there

112
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,460
 was some queen who was super nuts, and they go, "It could have been all of the inbreeding,

113
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,500
 but it could have also been she was known to constantly be around cats." So we know

114
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,980
 all that. That's all established science. But this new study comes out, and it shows

115
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,720
 that this is having an effect on who we find attractive. Like, I've always loved bad drivers.

116
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,400
 They've done this study in Finland recently. The disease can spread from human to human

117
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,880
 in various ways. But one of them is sexual. It's technically a sexually transmitted disease.

118
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,640
 You usually basically, it's really disgusting to think that it comes from a cat's anus into

119
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,500
 you, and then you're having sex and you're spreading it to somebody else. But when a

120
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:06,060
 man or a woman is infected with tozmoplasma gondi, they are rated more attractive. Even

121
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,860
 healthier looking. They did the study and they took people who tested for it, right?

122
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,180
 And then they took people who didn't have it, and they're doing these photos. Apparently

123
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,700
 when you have this in you, it makes your face more symmetrical, which is one of the things

124
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,760
 across cultures that people look for as a measure of attractiveness. They would show

125
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,360
 pictures of people and they'd go, "Who do you think's hotter?" One of them is a cat.

126
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,400
 One of them is a cat with its tail up and some guys like, "Woo!" Can I see that one?

127
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,880
 They're like, "No, that actually got into that. That should have been in the file."

128
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,640
 That's in my personal collection. The scientist puts it in his pocket. With women, if they

129
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,360
 have this parasite in them, it actually makes them thinner. It actually could be a weight

130
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,660
 loss drug. It could be a weight loss drug. People start popping poop. Popping poop pills. It

131
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:00,460
 can make them thinner. And they've seen, this is again because it can be spread sexually.

132
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,540
 It can't reproduce in humans, but the parasite can continue to thrive and it can be spread

133
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,500
 sexually. Women who are infested with this parasite have more sexual partners. Now they

134
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,740
 may have more sexual partners because people find them more attractive, but people are

135
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,920
 finding them more attractive because this parasite is reshaping their body to be more

136
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,600
 attractive so more people are sleeping with this woman and it is spreading.

137
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
 Now I think eventually it wants to get back into the cat. So I'm wondering if we could

138
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,360
 trace people who are infested with this with people who one day they're sitting at home

139
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,160
 and they're like, "I really want to buy a cat. I want to go and adopt a cat." Because

140
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,160
 that I wonder if it can change who you are attracted to. If it can physically reshape

141
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,940
 a human body. So other people find it attractive. Change the jawline, change the cheeks. I'm

142
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,740
 not talking it's not reforming your bones so much, but it can kind of give you a good

143
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,460
 look. I don't see why it can't also be like, "Buy a cat." You're like, "Okay, Jason, now

144
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,100
 you've turned this real life science into science fiction. It's not like the parasites

145
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,240
 in there were the little megaphone. It's not that... What was that? Osmosis Jones. It's

146
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,880
 not like a whole thriving city or is there?" Like this is fascinating because at what point

147
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,560
 are our decisions our decisions and at what point is it a parasite saying, "You know what?

148
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,040
 I don't think I'm going to eat today." I feel like getting more physical fitness. I wonder

149
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,280
 if you went to a yoga studio and started taking to the life of swabs from people. How many

150
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,460
 of them would be infected with this? Fascinating story. I do think that a big part of our...

151
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:47,140
 I think our soul is our soul and our soul is removed from all of this stuff, but we're

152
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:55,580
 also base animals, right? How much of our day to day decisions is based on gut biome

153
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,420
 and bacteria and parasites and all that stuff. I find it absolutely fascinating to hear.

154
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:05,600
 We have one of the most infectious parasites that we know of, right? Who knows what else

155
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,480
 is going on out there? Leo, our cat man. Let's go ahead and tashie the keys to the

156
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,440
 carbonicopter. Catch them in your big old paws. We're leaving behind this crazy cat

157
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,360
 lady's house. We're headed all the way out to Los Angeles, California. And of course,

158
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,840
 I brought a box of kittens with me. They're so cute. We're flying around in the carbonicopter.

159
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:36,860
 It's December 1984, and we're in Los Angeles, California. It's nighttime. It's time to

160
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,140
 go to bed. We don't have a name for this mother and this daughter duo, so we're going to name

161
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,660
 the mother Sally, and she has an infant daughter, little Betty, little baby Betty. Sally walks

162
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:55,100
 up and puts Betty down in the bedroom. They share a bedroom, puts her in a little crib,

163
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,960
 and then Sally's walking through the house, kind of finalizing everything before she finally

164
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,840
 goes to sleep herself. Now, as she's walking around the house, she's not laying in bed

165
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:09,860
 at this point. It is late. She is tired, but she is awake. However, she starts to feel

166
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:18,320
 like she's in a dream-like state. The event is already beginning. She has no idea what

167
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:28,820
 she's about to face. She sees out of her window a strange figure standing at her front door.

168
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,300
 She describes it as an alien that we would describe nowadays as a gray alien. Large head,

169
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:41,140
 short and stature, big black eyes, kind of a frail looking frame. And this gray alien

170
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:50,680
 is wearing a gold outfit, like a gold tight-fitting suit. And this creature is trying to get into

171
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,320
 the apartment. She's actually seeing it turn the doorknob. Instantly panicked, right? You

172
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,040
 would be scared enough if you saw a stranger trying to get into your house, but this creature

173
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,560
 from beyond reality is outside trying to get into her house. So, Sally does what I think

174
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,380
 any parent would do. Her first concern is for her child. She runs into the baby's room

175
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,940
 and the baby is still sleeping. The baby is fast asleep in its little crib. And at that

176
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:27,780
 point, Sally turns around and there in the doorway of the bedroom stands the gray alien.

177
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:38,520
 The gray walks over to the crib and scoops up baby Betty and spanks her super hard. Whack!

178
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,360
 Sally lunges for the child and now her and this gray alien are fighting over this baby

179
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:51,600
 who I'm assuming is awake at this point. She is fighting with this gray alien over her baby.

180
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,760
 And gray aliens are physically very weak creatures. They do seem to have some sort of sonic.

181
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,380
 Or telepathic blast which can freeze people. But you could grab a football, you could grab

182
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,620
 a baby, you could grab anything from a gray alien if you get close enough. And that mom

183
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,340
 has that mama bear energy and she closes that distance and she grabs that baby and her and

184
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,300
 the alien are tugging the baby back and forth until of course the mother overpowers him and

185
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:24,860
 safely grabs the baby away. Now she's holding her infant daughter on the roof of the apartment

186
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:33,320
 complex. She is looking around. She has no idea what just happened. She was just standing

187
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,640
 in her bedroom and now she's on the roof of the apartment complex. The endless night sky

188
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,800
 above her head. The cold December wind wrapping around her body. And as she's standing on

189
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:54,040
 the roof of this apartment complex, she looks and sees that the gray alien is there as well

190
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,720
 as two other humans. And she starts asking what is going on? Come on guy, what's going

191
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:07,060
 on? I need some help. And the two humans just stare straight ahead. Like they're in some

192
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:15,260
 sort of trance. They don't speak. They don't move. They're just standing there. Her attention

193
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:22,900
 turns back to the gray alien who pulls out a wand. Like a magician's wand. Small metal

194
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:30,400
 silo. And dips it into gold liquid. Which I guess is also up there like a little pot

195
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,640
 of gold liquid. Sticks it in the gold liquid and begins to swirl the wand. You're about

196
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,800
 to taste this. This is clearly a dream. Hold on. Hold on. The gray alien dips it into the

197
00:18:43,800 --> 00:19:13,800
 gold liquid and begins to swirl the wand around and it starts to make a "woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

198
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:23,700
 blue light. Shoots out of this UFO at an angle and a blue staircase materializes leading

199
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:36,380
 up into the UFO. Sally has no memories of what happened next. I got this story from Think

200
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:42,460
 About It Docs.com. They got it from Duane Bettel who wrote about this in Heartland UFO

201
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:49,760
 Journal #3 which was published back in December 1994. What I love about this story is that

202
00:19:49,760 --> 00:20:00,880
 one, it shows... Listen, I'm totally anti-alien, right? I mean I love the stories but I'm pro-earth.

203
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,920
 Earth first baby. Like I will go toe to toe with a gray or a reptilian or a pleiadian

204
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:14,000
 any day. I'm a human superiority advocate. But I also understand, I mean I love humans

205
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,540
 more than I love whales but I also know that a whale could kill a human if it wanted to

206
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,980
 or a shark could kill a human or anything like that. So I also respect the amount of

207
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:31,540
 power that these aliens have and this is completely reality warping power. Hearing in the house,

208
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,280
 teleporting multiple people at once, materializing the UFO out of nothingness was at some sort

209
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,160
 of cloak, was at entering our dimension. She could physically overpower this gray alien

210
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:51,040
 and she did but it did not matter. The raw power of aliens is always very very interesting

211
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:58,760
 to me. Because I listen man, I'd love to do an Independence Day scenario or a V scenario

212
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,980
 or a battle Los Angeles scenario where humans are overpowering our alien oppressors. But

213
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,780
 that's all dogfights with UFOs. That's not what it would be like. That's how we can

214
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,980
 think it would be like because that's how we battle each other. But imagine trying to

215
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,100
 shoot a heat seeking missile at a vehicle that can just dematerialize and then rematerialize

216
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,580
 behind you and then all of a sudden you're sitting in a library. You were in an F-22

217
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,180
 fighter jet and now you're sitting in an undending library with rows and rows and rows of people

218
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:39,020
 just frozen in time. What library is this? Where am I? Do I have an overdue book? Like

219
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,120
 that's the raw power of these aliens. How do you fight something like that? How do you

220
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,700
 fight something that can just warp reality? And what I also find super intriguing about

221
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:58,300
 the story is this is the stuff as crazy as it is. This is the stuff she remembers. This

222
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:05,900
 is the stuff that her brain allowed her to process. Because when we talk about aliens

223
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,500
 missing time, people not remembering events, you can say the aliens have some sort of technology

224
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,420
 or some sort of ability to wipe your memories. But remember a lot of times when these people

225
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,020
 undergo hypnosis they can re-remember them. So whatever this technology is or disability

226
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,780
 is it's not foolproof. That's one possibility that the aliens are a wipe in our mind. As

227
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:34,540
 a paranormal investigator myself, I deal far more in ghosts and demons than I do in UFOs

228
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:40,740
 and Bigfoot. On the ground research on that stuff. I used to be an on the ground ghost

229
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:47,540
 hunter. I know for a fact I've seen it happen to myself and I've seen it happen to friends

230
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:55,220
 of mine on these ghost hunts. Your brain can only process so much crazy. Your brain will

231
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:02,780
 actually it has fail safes in it. It's like nope I didn't see that. That's impossible.

232
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,300
 It's happened to me and I believe in all sorts of stuff. Like I said on Monday's episode

233
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,740
 I believe people can get turned into trees. And there have been times where I've encountered

234
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:21,140
 things my brain goes no. Like leave, get out of here, run. And then weeks, months later

235
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,260
 I'll just be sitting there hanging out and all of a sudden this vision will come over

236
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,060
 me and I was like oh that's what I saw. Did I ever tell you guys that story when I was

237
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,820
 in my apartment and it was full of all this negative energy. It's a long story. I had

238
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:41,940
 like this insane roommate. He was like just nuts. And this was back when I was really

239
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,020
 really like playing around with you know like magic. Not magic the gathering which is a

240
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,660
 fun game but like trying to do like rituals and stuff like that. I was in my apartment

241
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,740
 I was there with my buddy Liz. I actually wasn't staying there at this point. I just was like

242
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,780
 full of stuff that I needed to move out but I was still paying rent on the place and I

243
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:08,340
 was living somewhere else and you know I have two apartments at one point. And we went back

244
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,900
 to this place, went back to my place and I walked in and I immediately felt uneasy. I

245
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,100
 hadn't been there for a while. My roommate was nuts. I kicked him out. I changed the

246
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,780
 locks. He crawled in through the window. And I remember I went in there and I felt uneasy.

247
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,100
 I go I don't feel good here. Liz is like oh whatever. She's never like she's easily

248
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:37,380
 spooked but she didn't believe in ghosts as much as I did. And so we went into the apartment

249
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,500
 and I was getting some stuff to take to my other apartment. And I remember I was like

250
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,220
 I have to go to the bathroom. Now that's always a try. This episode might run a little long.

251
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,340
 I didn't plan on telling the story. That's always a trigger though. A lot of times when

252
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,820
 you're in an area of paranormal activity when you're ghost hunting. And I never tell people

253
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,220
 this. I don't tell people this. I shouldn't warn them because one of the things when you're

254
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,940
 doing a ghost hunt is you don't want to feed them information. If you say we're going to

255
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:11,180
 go to this place where a witch was brutally murdered 200 years ago. Sometimes they say

256
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,220
 when you look into the Bubbling Creek underneath Dead Witch Bridge you'll see her face. Obviously

257
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,460
 when you feed someone a scary story they'll be looking for that. And you can actually

258
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,580
 implant that in your head. My technique was if I saw something I would turn to someone

259
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,540
 else and go "Do you see that?" And they'll go "Yeah dude it looks like a shadow. Looks

260
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,660
 like an 8 foot tall shadow standing over there. What is it?" "Is there someone over there?"

261
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,660
 That's exactly what I saw too. See I know what I see. I have someone else describe it to

262
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,060
 me. Now I know it's a real phenomenon. I know that it's not a trick of the like as we're

263
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:53,940
 standing at different angles. I know that I'm not going insane. So one of the things that

264
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,260
 I've learned is that when you're with a group of people if one or more people suddenly have

265
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:06,180
 to urinate it's weird. I know people are like Jason you've said a lot of crazy stuff on

266
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,260
 this show. I think I might have mentioned this before. If you or multiple people have

267
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:17,900
 to urinate it can be either you just drink a bunch of water or that there's a paranormal

268
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,900
 event of hearing manifesting. I don't know what the mechanism is behind it. I always thought

269
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,380
 it could be why people say they piss their pants when they're so scared but then also

270
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,820
 people get so scared they actually piss their pants. It's a weird thing. Now I remember

271
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,100
 being over here and all of a sudden I have to urinate. It's not every time just to be

272
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,700
 clear. It's not every time I have to go to the bathroom. I'm like oh there's a ghost.

273
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,780
 It's a certain set of circumstances but over here all of a sudden I had to go to the bathroom.

274
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:55,300
 It's like I went to the bathroom and I came out and I was just overwhelmed with fear.

275
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,180
 I came out of the bathroom and I was completely overwhelmed with fear and I was like go go

276
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,780
 go go. We're out of here. Liz was like ah she was still picking stuff up to take. Go go

277
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:10,220
 go go. We left. I remember it was probably like a couple weeks later if not like a month

278
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,220
 or two later I was hanging out. I was sitting on the couch at my other apartment. I wasn't

279
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:21,860
 in that old apartment anymore and all of a sudden I remembered opening the bathroom

280
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:30,100
 door of my old apartment. I had a memory now of what scared me so badly. I remember opening

281
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,540
 the bathroom door after I went to the bathroom and standing in the hallway was maybe, I'm

282
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:45,460
 really bad with ages, but maybe like a 10 year old boy with no face. Not like no features.

283
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:51,940
 Not like it was just a smooth face. He was skinned. I could see the muscle tissue. I

284
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,900
 could see where the teeth went into the gums. It was like someone had flayed him. Someone

285
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,300
 had completely removed his face. I remember opening the bathroom door and looking down

286
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,660
 and seeing this boy. Maybe a little older than 10. I didn't ask him his age. I left,

287
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,820
 but I didn't remember why I was so scared for a long period of time because my brain

288
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:19,140
 was like no dude that's it. Like we're not going to let you see this. And the thing is

289
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,940
 is when I was sitting on the couch when I remembered that I wasn't even thinking about

290
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,060
 it. I wasn't thinking oh I wonder what I saw. I had completely, because I've been in areas

291
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:32,740
 before and said oh this is creepy and then I leave. And this was just a fear that crawled

292
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:39,260
 into me. This terror that would just seem to radiate from right in front of me and I

293
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:49,620
 was like we're out. Wasn't thinking about it. Just chalked it up to. It was a weird apartment.

294
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:55,580
 But weeks or months later again I don't remember. It wasn't like years later, but I remember

295
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,740
 sitting there and I was completely relaxed just hanging out and then all of a sudden

296
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:06,620
 I remembered myself opening the bathroom door and looking down and seeing this. You know

297
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:12,540
 what's funny now that I say when I'm looking down I didn't, because it was a 10 year old

298
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:19,140
 boy but I remember almost looking at it face to face. I mean I guess if you're a phantasm

299
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,620
 from beyond the grave. Maybe he was floating? I don't know. I remember opening. I don't

300
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,460
 remember opening the door and looking down. I remember opening the door and seeing him.

301
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,100
 Whatever, whether he was floating or whatever caused that. We're looking face to face and

302
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:41,180
 he had no face. He'd been skinned. He had hair which must have been super uncomfortable.

303
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,700
 You have this giant open wound and you have bangs and it's constantly getting in there.

304
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:54,380
 I can laugh about it now. I ran out of there. Go go go go go. My brain finally goes oh we'll

305
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,540
 let you remember that. Like again I wasn't thinking about it. I just chalked it up to

306
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,860
 creepy apartment. That was fun. That was the same apartment. I talked about this on the

307
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,540
 show a long time ago where that one day I came home and I opened the door and I was sitting

308
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:14,020
 on the couch. And I remember opening the door and seeing myself sitting on the couch and

309
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,860
 me on the couch gets up and we start both walking towards each other and then I don't

310
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:29,060
 remember what happened next. And what's funny is I remember that happening and I still have

311
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:37,660
 a fear of that happening again. Like I won't say it happens every time I come home but

312
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,620
 it's not super rare when I'm coming home and I open the door and I'm thinking what if I'm

313
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,020
 sitting on the couch again. Like it pops into my head at a pretty regular event. What if

314
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,060
 I come home and I'm sitting there like working on my computer and I turn and look. It's super

315
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,460
 weird. It's a weird apartment. It was on Sunrise Avenue. It was on Sunrise Avenue over where

316
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:03,140
 Tom Thumb used to be Sunrise and what is that? Anelope Road? Anyways if you guys want to

317
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,980
 go get an apartment out there be careful because one of them might be haunted. But so sorry

318
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:17,100
 that ran a little bit longer but this is what she remembered. Like as insane as this is

319
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:26,020
 this is what she remembered. So what happened on the ship? What was so insane, so mind bending,

320
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,980
 so soul crushing that her brain said nope. You can remember the staircase. You can remember

321
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:39,300
 the alien. You can remember the wand. You can remember the two humans but you cannot remember

322
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:52,340
 what happened on the ship. You can't. It will break you. What insane things did she see aboard

323
00:31:52,340 --> 00:32:01,620
 that ship? What did they do to her and her daughter? We'll never know because she doesn't

324
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:15,820
 know. And she doesn't know because if she knew it may drive her insane. The raw power of the

325
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:25,740
 aliens that seem to visit Earth on a fairly regular basis should never be underestimated.

326
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,600
 We can make all the movies we want of aerial combat dogfights with UFOs and some of the

327
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,820
 aliens deciding to fight against their own to join the humans. We can make whole series

328
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:45,880
 about the giant Zentradi alien invaders being defeated by the power of love and the technology

329
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:57,020
 of Robotech. But the reality of it is that these aliens are so powerful. It's possible

330
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:05,020
 the war will be won without either side ever firing a shot. There may come a day where

331
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:14,200
 you just wake up trapped in a pitch black room. You scream out for help and your screams

332
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,520
 are answered by the echoes of thousands of other screams, hundreds of thousands of other

333
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:29,540
 screams. You are now a prisoner of the alien invaders when you didn't even have a chance

334
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:42,180
 to fight back. They just warped reality so much that they took us over in a heartbeat.

335
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:49,860
 The only thing you can hope for now is that when the aliens come to your cargo container

336
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:57,840
 to pull you out for whatever insidious experiment they have planned for you, the only thing

337
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:13,200
 you can hope for, whatever they do to you, you pray that you don't remember it.
