00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
 Today is the one-year anniversary of Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,200
 Unless you're listening to this episode any day other than June 14th,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,600
 and then in that case it's just any other episode.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,100
 But no! You're wrong, Calender. It's not just any other episode.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,900
 Because today I'm going to take... I've done personal ghost stories before,

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:26,200
 but we're gonna do some personal true crime stories, some little nuggets from my past

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,600
 that won't get me fired from any job I've worked at or arrested,

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,900
 or beaten up by co-conspirators.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,900
 There's a lot of little mechanisms to that one.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,800
 Then we'll take a look at another paranormal story of mine

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,400
 that actually is a little bridge to a larger story.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,800
 And then I want to talk about some of the conspiracy theories that I have absolutely no proof,

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,700
 but I have a hunch. I have a hunch that they may be true.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,700
 So today we look at Jason's Paranormal Conspiracy in True Crime Stories on Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,500
 [music]

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,900
 Another episode, this is the first annual episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,500
 Not first annual. This is the first anniversary, the one year anniversary episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,600
 And I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,600
 We got a lot to cover here, so we're gonna kind of jump right into it.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 Plus I'm recording it later than I normally do.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,000
 Crazy day, man. Crazy day, crazy hot.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,300
 Had to work, had to go to play practice.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,900
 I'm exhausted. It's like 9 o'clock at night.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,400
 You know, it's funny. I've said this before in past episodes, but

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,400
 there are days when I struggle to get episodes put together in time and I'm just like,

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,300
 "Oh my God, I'm starting the Sleight. I should have done this earlier."

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,500
 And there's like this total struggle and this stress.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,900
 And then the episode is recorded and it just becomes one of a number of episodes that people can listen to.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,800
 Recommend this show to your friends, guys.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,600
 But I mean that as there are gonna be days you go through at work or at school and you're like,

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,800
 "Oh my God, this is the worst day. This project sucks. I'm not getting this paper done on time."

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,100
 But eventually that day will pass and that will just be another paper you wrote.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,600
 Like you...all the struggle that you're putting into writing that paper,

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,500
 six months from now, you won't even remember you wrote that paper.

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 Or you'll stumble across and you'll be like, "Oh, I kind of had a hard time writing that paper."

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,300
 But you move on.

39
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,900
 We so often get...as I'm getting ready to record this episode all day long,

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,600
 I'm like, "I'm so tired and I still have to record and edit an episode.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
 What am I gonna do when I'm going through this mental struggle?"

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,600
 And after I record it and after I edit it, I probably will never remember any of that,

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
 except that now I've recorded it.

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,900
 So when I listen to it, I'll be like, "Oh yeah, I was having kind of a bad day that day."

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,400
 Push through it. It just becomes a memory.

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,000
 The biggest obstacle in your life once you're over it, it is a memory.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,200
 It is done.

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,900
 Remember that, guys.

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,100
 So let's go ahead though and get started here now.

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,600
 Again, like I said in the beginning, my true crime story is like, I got a lot of them,

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,700
 but I don't want to go around just saying a bunch of stuff I did,

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,800
 because this is a public forum and I never murdered anybody.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
 I never raped anybody.

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,700
 Never said anything.

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,200
 I did say something on fire, but that was an accident.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,700
 Like I obviously have standards.

57
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,400
 I don't steal from my employers, stuff like that.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,700
 I'm glad how it goes, rape, murder.

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,100
 I think people who steal from their employers are super tacky.

60
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,900
 Like that is, it's not up there with rape and murder,

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,200
 but when you steal from your employer, that really is just like,

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,900
 I get it, listen, man, you're taking staples or stuff like that, you know, Scotch tape,

63
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,500
 but when you work for a retail establishment, which I've worked retail pretty much my entire life,

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,600
 retail or customer service, we deal with a lot of thieves,

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,400
 a lot of in-house thievery, and it's always super disappointing and it sucks.

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
 Don't do it, guys.

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,700
 But anyway, so, oh yeah, so no, I never stole nothing.

68
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,000
 That's where I was going with that.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,900
 Never stole anything from anyone that I worked for.

70
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,100
 So, but let's talk about some, some safe for work, uh, Jason crime stories.

71
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,600
 And these are all super benign, really, except for the people they're happening to.

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,800
 And I'm really probably just focused on one or two.

73
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,500
 I remember one, what I consider my first, I'm a vandal.

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,200
 That was always my specialty.

75
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 I was a creative vandal and I was basically like a merc for hire in the town of Anelope,

76
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
 which is in the Sacramento area.

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,700
 You had like Anelope, North Highlands, Orangevale, Citrus Heights was kind of my stomping grounds

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,500
 and I was a merc for hire.

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,700
 Now, you didn't have to pay me anything.

80
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
 I just enjoyed causing havoc.

81
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
 But I learned really quickly.

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,300
 We talked about this when I was a couple episodes of talking about losing a lot of weight.

83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,500
 I've been in a lot, I've been, I won't say I've been in a lot of fights,

84
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,900
 but I've been in enough fights to know that they're not the best thing to be in regularly,

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,500
 especially as you get older.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,600
 And I realized something when I don't like someone and I confront them head on,

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,000
 I've now made an enemy that when I go certain places, I may run into this person and we may have an altercation.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,900
 I learned very, very quickly that I can have the same satisfaction of beating someone

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,200
 and them never knowing where the attack came from.

90
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,600
 Because it would happen to me.

91
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,200
 My stuff would get vandalized, my stuff would get stolen,

92
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
 and there's this outrage when it comes out of the blue.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,500
 So I began vandalizing stuff with a purpose.

94
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,200
 I was basically a superhero whose superpower was not getting caught being a dick to other people's property.

95
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,900
 My first case of vandalism was when my dad was the pastor of a church, there was a parishioner.

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,800
 Churches are really weird because there's a super bizarre power structure that goes on behind the scenes.

97
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,400
 That's the reason I don't go to actual churches.

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,500
 It's not because I've walked away from the faith,

99
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,200
 because I'm tired of all the BS behind the scenes.

100
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,900
 So there was like a deacon's wife or something like that who wanted to paint the bathrooms.

101
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,000
 And my dad was like, "I don't really think the bathrooms need to be painted."

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,200
 But she really wanted to and it was basically like a power play.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,900
 My dad was like, "Fine, paint the bathrooms."

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,000
 She painted the girl's restroom like, "M'wah" or something, I don't know.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,100
 And she painted the boy's bathroom purple.

106
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,400
 My dad's like, "God damn it, purple's a girl's color."

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,300
 No, he didn't care about the color.

108
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,200
 He cared that she painted the toilet seats purple.

109
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,500
 And he's like, "You know, people are gonna pee all over this.

110
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,800
 Like this is gonna get stained."

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 And I remember him going like, "Who has a purple?

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,900
 Who has a painted toilet seat to begin with?

113
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,900
 Like it's just gonna get super gross to super fast."

114
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,200
 And my dad is a savvy man.

115
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,600
 And he knew if he just removed the toilet seat and bought a new one,

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,000
 the woman would see him as making a power play.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,200
 And it wasn't worth it to him, but he needed to get rid of that toilet seat.

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,900
 So I'm like probably 12 at this time.

119
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
 This is in Alameda.

120
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,900
 And we lived at the...

121
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,500
 Oh, yeah, I have a listener from Alameda.

122
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,900
 I think it's Merrick.

123
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,000
 Don't stop listening to the show if I get the name wrong,

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
 but I'm pretty sure it's Merrick.

125
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,700
 But I don't have time to check.

126
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
 It's like 9.30.

127
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,400
 So I really hope it's you.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,300
 But anyways, there is Alameda Baptist Church

129
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,200
 and we lived in the parsonage next to it.

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,500
 There's a couple ghost stories from that.

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,400
 I'll tell those sometime, but we're in the house.

132
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
 I'm sitting in the house.

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,700
 My dad comes over and he says, "Hey, Jason, I need your help with something."

134
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,000
 I'm like, "Okay."

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,600
 So we walk over into the church and we go into the bathroom

136
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
 and he goes, "Stand on the toilet seat."

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
 And I'm like, "Okay, now I'm a chubby little kid.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
 I stand on the toilet seat."

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,900
 And he's looking at the toilet seat and he's like,

140
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,300
 "Now do the twist."

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,000
 Like, do the twist.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
 I'm like, "Huh?"

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
 And he's like, "Just dance around on the toilet seat."

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,700
 And I'm like, "Okay."

145
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,500
 So I start twisting on the toilet seat and he goes,

146
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,400
 "Burp, urp, urp, urp."

147
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
 Breaks and he's like, "Thanks, Jason."

148
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,900
 And he takes the broken toilet seat, throws it away,

149
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,900
 goes to the store, gets a real toilet seat and was able to say,

150
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,400
 "Oh yeah, some kids are screwing around in there

151
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,500
 and they broke the toilet seat, had my new one."

152
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,800
 That's when I learned the power of vandalism.

153
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,600
 That was my super soldier serum.

154
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,100
 He got what he wanted.

155
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,600
 He told the truth.

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,300
 And I was like the little sneaky Bart Simpson character

157
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,800
 in the background going, "Hehehehehe."

158
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,500
 Never forgot that feeling.

159
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 As I got older though, my vandalism became,

160
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,100
 "Mwah!"

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,200
 Became perfection.

162
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
 I remember once I walked into, like, not a Sam's Club,

163
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 in, they had a big grocery store called like Food Co. in Sacramento.

164
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
 And I was walking through one day.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I was walking through, I can't remember the exact ingredients,

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,800
 but I remember walking through the aisles at Food Co.

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,700
 I saw, you know how like, at supermarkets,

168
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,900
 they have the like, the little list what's in the aisle

169
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,300
 on the little hanging sign?

170
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,100
 It said like, "Fish, like canned fish, canned meat, cooking oils."

171
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,100
 And I said, "Oh my God, this aisle was made for me."

172
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
 That's where all I have to do is my shopping

173
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
 because see my specialty was,

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,700
 I wasn't just about throwing eggs, which I did do that.

175
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,900
 But I was about biological attacks.

176
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,700
 I wanted to throw fish guts at people.

177
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,700
 Not like, we did, we did cause random havoc sometimes

178
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,900
 and I'm not proud of those moments.

179
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,800
 But when there was someone that I wanted to send a message to,

180
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,500
 but I didn't want them to know that I was the one sending that message,

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,400
 "Fish guts, bro.

182
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
 I would throw fish on people's roofs all the time.

183
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,300
 I think I'm responsible for like an entire generation of seagulls.

184
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
 Like, I'm technically their dad.

185
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,900
 I gave them so much food in the town of Antelope

186
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,900
 that they must be like writing me, like sending me family photos for Christmas.

187
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
 Thanks for helping my family survive that year.

188
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
 Thanks for all the fish guts.

189
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,200
 Fish guts everywhere.

190
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
 Throwing fish guts everywhere.

191
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,900
 And I would first off, I just started doing it for people that I didn't like,

192
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
 people that had wronged me and something.

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,500
 And I know you're thinking, "Chason, you're so lame.

194
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,400
 Why don't you go and fight these people?"

195
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,200
 Well, again, one, I don't want to box people all the time.

196
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,500
 Like, sometimes I just want to go get a pizza.

197
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,900
 Like, if I box this dude because I don't like something his girlfriend said,

198
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,400
 I'm going to have to fight him every single time I see him.

199
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,900
 Or somebody could be like, "Yo, yo, yo, what's up?

200
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,800
 I'm obviously from the 80s and I'm a rapper, yo."

201
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 And I'm like, "I hate that."

202
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,900
 So then I could basically just find...

203
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,800
 Technically, it's the thinking man's revenge

204
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
 because I have to do a lot of homework.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
 I have to find out where you live.

206
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
 I have to find out what room you sleep in.

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
 I have to find out what hours you keep.

208
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,500
 Cars and stuff like that.

209
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,800
 I got to figure out all this stuff.

210
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 Got to figure out...

211
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,900
 Dude, I would broke it down to a science, man.

212
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,600
 30 seconds was actually an extremely long amount of time.

213
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
 Because sometimes I would bring people with me.

214
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
 I'd say, "10 seconds were out."

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
 And they're like, "10 seconds, I can do so much."

216
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,100
 But I'm like, "Dude, 10 seconds because we're going to make a lot of noise.

217
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,500
 And I don't want this coming back on me."

218
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,800
 But eventually, I did become a mercenary where people would say,

219
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
 "Hey, you know, this guy dumped me.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,800
 Can you help me out?"

221
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,600
 And I would all give this speech all the time.

222
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
 I'd give this speech.

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
 I'd say, "Listen, I can help.

224
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,500
 This is going to sound overly dramatic,

225
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,100
 but this is all stuff that I learned from doing this stuff in the past."

226
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,800
 I'd say, "Listen, I can help you.

227
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,500
 But here are my rules.

228
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,800
 No women, no children.

229
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,700
 No chiss-choking.

230
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,600
 I had no problem with destroying a chick's house."

231
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,100
 I said this.

232
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,600
 This is what we're going to do.

233
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,800
 I'm not going to do anything for three months.

234
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
 I'm not going to do anything for three months.

235
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,200
 And they'd be like, "Well, he and I, this is why."

236
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,100
 The reason why you came to me is because you don't want to get back to you.

237
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,500
 You can just go to his house right now and bash his windows in, right?

238
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,200
 You have to wait because the point of doing this is them never knowing.

239
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,400
 They may suspect it was you,

240
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,900
 but the chances of you being retaliated against...

241
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,400
 When I say retaliated against, when I say getting fistfights,

242
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,100
 I'm basically...

243
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,600
 Those are euphemisms for getting your head blown off,

244
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
 because again, we're in Sacramento.

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,900
 It's not like when I say, "I don't want to fight a guy at the pizza parlor."

246
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,400
 That's true.

247
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,300
 I don't want to fistfight him,

248
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,400
 but I also don't want to get like blown away

249
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,200
 because I was mad at something his girlfriend said.

250
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,400
 Like, you just... You have to make smart decisions.

251
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,500
 The smartest decision is to not have such a volatile temper,

252
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,800
 like I did when I was younger.

253
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,200
 But so anyways, I'd say, "Listen, I'm not going to do anything for three months at all.

254
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
 I'm not going to do anything for three months.

255
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,500
 That'll give everything time to die down.

256
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,000
 He may suspect you have something to do with it,

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 but people rarely will retaliate if they just suspect it.

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,300
 So much time will pass that they probably won't put two and two together.

259
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,200
 Two, I'm never going to tell you I'm going to do it,

260
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,600
 and I'll never tell you after it happened.

261
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,700
 You may at some point down the road hear that something bad happened to that person,

262
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,000
 but you won't know if I did it.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,900
 So you have no guilty conscience at all,

264
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,200
 because those are all things that I learned.

265
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,900
 I've done stuff right after the fact, like punched a dude in the face and then it's this whole thing.

266
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,200
 Or I've done stuff and told the person was bragging about it and they felt bad.

267
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,500
 They had troll's remorse so then they went and tried to apologize to the person

268
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,800
 and it was this whole thing.

269
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
 So you come to me.

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,300
 I'm going to wait at least three months, and then I'm never going to talk about it.

271
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,900
 And you may know something happened to him, but you won't know if I did that.

272
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:39,700
 It could have just been a random neighborhood psychopath that super glued his doors locked

273
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,600
 or through fish guts.

274
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,700
 I guess fish guts was kind of my signature, but through fish gets on roofs.

275
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,600
 But yeah, fish guts was just one piece of my arsenal.

276
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,800
 I basically created biological.

277
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,700
 I created some of the most foulest smells outside of feces.

278
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,200
 I don't think I ever used feces, but I created some of the foulest smells possible

279
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,900
 to launch at residences and pour in automobiles.

280
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:10,700
 And that is probably the only true crime stories I'm willing to share in a public forum.

281
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,800
 Just petty vandalism stuff.

282
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,900
 I'm not going to sit here and brag and be like, "And you know I did so much more because I'm a big tough guy."

283
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,100
 I mean, I just think those stories were fairly funny.

284
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,800
 And again, I was looking back on it.

285
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,800
 It would be quite infuriating, but if it happened to me, but every single person I did that to totally deserved it.

286
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,600
 Totally deserved it.

287
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,200
 Trust me.

288
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
 I'm not.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,500
 Everyone who I did that to, it wasn't a very nice neighborhood.

290
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,900
 The people in the neighborhood weren't doing nice things.

291
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,700
 So if you came out and there was fish guts on your roof, you deserve to get fish guts on your roof.

292
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,500
 I'm sorry.

293
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 So anyways, let's go ahead and as the lone rabbit like it and I'm standing on a other roof looking down at him

294
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 with my big red rabbit costume going like, "Yes, the darkness comes to all, but the fish guts come to some."

295
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,800
 I mean, that might sound overly dramatic, but still would have been cool.

296
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,000
 That's my true crime story.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,900
 Let's see how much of that stays in the editing process.

298
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,300
 Let's go ahead and move on to...

299
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,700
 This is the thing.

300
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,200
 Let's talk about some conspiracies that I think may be possible, but I have no proof of it.

301
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,000
 I have no proof of it.

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,600
 So basically it's me just shooting from the hip.

303
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,800
 These are things I've thought about before, and they're weird.

304
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,800
 They're weird ones, but I really, it was like, I don't know how to even go about researching this.

305
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,100
 First conspiracy theory.

306
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,400
 And this kind of falls into a paranormal type conspiracy theory, but the first one is this.

307
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
 I think...

308
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,300
 I've only said this out loud to maybe two people.

309
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,300
 I think Seth MacFarlane may have made a deal with the devil.

310
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,500
 Seth MacFarlane, if you don't know, is the creator of Family Guy.

311
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,900
 And Family Guy came out on Fox.

312
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,500
 It didn't do very well.

313
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
 It got canceled.

314
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,600
 And he just kind of drifted away into obscurity.

315
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,400
 And then he was supposed to fly on, I think, Flight 77, one of the 9/11 planes.

316
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,100
 He was supposed to fly on a plane that day, and he didn't.

317
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,900
 He got delayed.

318
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,500
 And then the planes obviously crashed.

319
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,300
 I don't think I have to tell the rest of the story.

320
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,700
 9/11 people are like, "What?

321
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,200
 What happened on 9/11?"

322
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,800
 You know, planes crashed, much buildings came down.

323
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,500
 So, and then he ends up...

324
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,300
 The Family Guy gets renewed on Fox.

325
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,400
 So, but Seth...

326
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,300
 And I'm not saying that he made a deal with it.

327
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,600
 Let me clarify here.

328
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,000
 I'm not saying that he made a deal with the devil and he caused 9/11 by his deal.

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,700
 I don't think that was his human sacrifice or anything.

330
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,900
 But I always thought that was an interesting detail that he avoided that fate.

331
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
 But he had the cartoon.

332
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,300
 It got canceled.

333
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,400
 And then he kind of just kind of drifted around.

334
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
 You never really heard of him much.

335
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,000
 And then I think Family Guy got syndicated on TBS and then Fox brought it back.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,100
 It might have got syndicated on Cartoon Network, one of the two.

337
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,700
 But Fox brings back Family Guy.

338
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
 Now, that isn't unusual in and of itself.

339
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,800
 That's happened with other shows.

340
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 What's unusual is you have this guy who basically appeared out of nowhere,

341
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,400
 came out with a cartoon, it failed, then comes back out of nowhere,

342
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,500
 gets the cartoon back on the air, gets two more cartoons on the air.

343
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,100
 Host the Oscars is dating some chick from Game of Thrones,

344
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,800
 which that's really...

345
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
 I don't really care about that.

346
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,900
 And then gets his dream project.

347
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,600
 Basically, he's doing Star Trek fan fiction now in the guise of the Oroville.

348
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,200
 He is either...

349
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,800
 Here's the thing.

350
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,400
 I like Seth MacFarlane as a person.

351
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,000
 I don't think he's incredibly talented.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,500
 Like, I think that he's funny, but he's not...

353
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,800
 I remember once he did a live musical.

354
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,300
 There was like an hour and a half long musical concert with him and Lois from Family Guy,

355
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,600
 singing like torch songs, singing Sinatra songs.

356
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,200
 And I'm like, "Why is this on the air?

357
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,100
 Why is this on the air?"

358
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,200
 Him hosting the Oscars.

359
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,800
 You're like, "This is a travesty."

360
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,700
 And I hate the Oscars.

361
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
 And he's making these movies.

362
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,900
 Now, again, I think he's funny, but I don't understand the return on investment for him.

363
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,700
 Like, basically like, yeah, he's funny and he comes out with...

364
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,200
 It seems like for every hit, he has a flop.

365
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
 He's really a 50/50 kind of guy.

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,100
 Family Guy.

367
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,600
 And then he has American Dad, which I actually liked better, but it wasn't as big.

368
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,000
 And then the Cleveland Show was a flop.

369
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,500
 So that's kind of a two for one.

370
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,800
 I guess actually that's interesting.

371
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
 Maybe it's two for one.

372
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
 Maybe he has two hits and a flop.

373
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,500
 But I guess that is a pretty good return on investment.

374
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,400
 But I always got the idea that here was a guy who basically came from nowhere and got a cartoon on Fox,

375
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,000
 which, you know, because of The Simpsons, Fox was looking for cartoons.

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,900
 But the show didn't do well.

377
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,100
 It gets canceled.

378
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,500
 And then it comes back and it's not only bigger than ever.

379
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,800
 He's basically given the keys to the Fox Kingdom to the point where they're like,

380
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
 "Hey, you want to dress up and we're gonna..."

381
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,300
 I can understand animation.

382
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,700
 It's cheap.

383
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,600
 But we're going to make a sci-fi show where you pretend to be a Starfleet...

384
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 I mean, a space captain and get to fly around.

385
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,700
 And I think this is just the beginning.

386
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,200
 Like, I really feel like if anyone...

387
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,800
 If there's any proof that someone's made a deal with the devil, it's Seth MacFarlane.

388
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,200
 I can't prove it.

389
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,800
 And it's not necessarily something I'd want to prove because I would be nice if that wasn't true.

390
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,400
 He seems like a decent guy.

391
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,200
 Just extremely lucky.

392
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
 More luck than talent.

393
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,900
 Again, he's funny.

394
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
 I'm not trying to knock him.

395
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,600
 But you know what I mean?

396
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,000
 Like, there's people...

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
 There are people who seem...

398
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,200
 Who are just extremely talented people.

399
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,700
 And they're just...

400
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,600
 I'll say like someone like Dave Chappelle.

401
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,400
 You're like, "This guy just...

402
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,700
 He's knocked it out of the park every single time."

403
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,400
 For him, I was reading about...

404
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,000
 I'm reading.

405
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
 That's what a nerd I am.

406
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,500
 I was reading about Half-Baked Today.

407
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,000
 And I'm like, "Really? Like, for that movie to come out?"

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,800
 He just knocked it out of the park and then he has a television show.

409
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,600
 Knocked it out of the park.

410
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,400
 So now he had like some pilots and stuff like that that didn't work for him.

411
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 But he just kept...

412
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,700
 He just like really knocked it out of the park each time.

413
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,600
 And there are other comedians like that.

414
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,700
 Comedic talents like that.

415
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,000
 I just don't think Seth MacFarlane is one of them.

416
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,900
 So I don't know.

417
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,400
 Deal with the devil.

418
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,000
 That's a conspiracy theory I have, but it can't prove.

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,700
 Here's a controversial one.

420
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,800
 Sandy Hook.

421
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,600
 Let me see this.

422
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,300
 I believe Sandy Hook happened.

423
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,800
 I believe the children really died.

424
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,700
 And I believe that Adam Lanza was the shooter.

425
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,500
 I don't believe any conspiracies that are saying that it's fake

426
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,400
 or there was other shooters and stuff like that.

427
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
 Still in that realm,

428
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,700
 I always had a sneaking suspicion that the Sandy Hook shootings

429
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,500
 were related to 2012 into the world.

430
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:34,100
 It happened seven days before December 21st, 2012.

431
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,600
 It happened on December 14th, 2012.

432
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,100
 I always felt that those two were connected in some way.

433
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,700
 Not saying that it was some sort of ancient curse or anything like that.

434
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
 I personally think,

435
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,200
 because we've never been able to figure out a motive for Adam Lanza.

436
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,800
 We haven't really been able to find any writings or why he did it.

437
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,200
 This is my theory.

438
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
 They had a bunch of guns because I think that they were survivalist type people.

439
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,000
 They were definitely him and his mom lived there.

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 I think his dad was out of the picture.

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,900
 He was around, but I don't think he was with them at the time.

442
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,500
 But anyway, they had a safe full of guns.

443
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,600
 That's where he got his guns.

444
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,000
 I believe they were probably prepper survivalist type of people.

445
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,900
 And all this 2012 nonsense got in his head and he thought it was the end of the world anyways.

446
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,800
 It's one of those things that I can't prove.

447
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,700
 Nobody can prove.

448
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:29,400
 But I had a feeling the timing was just too good or slash bad because of what happened.

449
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,400
 But I think the Sandy Hook shootings are related to 2012 in some way.

450
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,900
 And again, I'm not saying that some sort of that was the prophecy.

451
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,100
 The minds foretold.

452
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,000
 The destruction was actually the destruction.

453
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,300
 I'm not saying anything like that.

454
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,600
 I'm saying that I think that was the motive or possibly the motive of Adam Lanza.

455
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
 He thought the world was ending anyways.

456
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
 The world was going to end in seven days.

457
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,500
 The whole cycle would be complete and everything would be destroyed when I go out with a bang.

458
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,400
 Or he could also be thinking, "I'm going to spare these children, my mom and myself,

459
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,500
 the suffering of the 13 fictional gods rampaging across the planet."

460
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,100
 I think it was connected.

461
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,700
 No one's ever made that connection.

462
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
 I've never heard any media reports about it.

463
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,200
 Everyone is panicked coming up to 2012.

464
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,900
 And I think that he was one of them and he took it out in a fatal, fatal way.

465
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,400
 No proof of that.

466
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,900
 Just a conspiracy theory, I believe.

467
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,600
 And again, that's one of those things like, "I don't even know how to research that."

468
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,800
 I guess, I mean, if he had those books, but see, we don't have copies of any of that stuff.

469
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,700
 So I think 2012 and Sandy Hook were related in a belief system, possibly a motive.

470
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,100
 But let's go ahead and end it with this, with a ghost story.

471
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,900
 A true ghost story, ghost story that happened to me.

472
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,700
 This would have been back in '98, '97.

473
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:52,500
 It was before the time of the Shadow People invasion, which I talked about quite a few episodes ago.

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,800
 And I was driving through Orangevale as I was wanting to do in my...

475
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,100
 What was I driving then?

476
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,200
 I wasn't driving the Mustang.

477
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
 I think I was driving the Renault State.

478
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,500
 No, I would have been...

479
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,100
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

480
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,000
 But just imagine it was the Jason Jalopy.

481
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
 I would drive around with my buddies, we'd go ghost hunting.

482
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,300
 And I've told stories about us going ghost hunting before.

483
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,100
 The charred pants story on the Lost Episode is one of those.

484
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,000
 But this time I was driving alone.

485
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,200
 Now, I was driving through the back streets of Orangevale.

486
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,700
 It was probably about three in the morning.

487
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,700
 Now, Orangevale, if you don't know, is notable for basically three things in the '90s.

488
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,900
 Meth, skinheads, and no street lights.

489
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,400
 Very rural area, especially when you're going down the side street.

490
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
 Dude, we had such a skinhead populace.

491
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,800
 Just no joke.

492
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,200
 We had such a skinhead population in Orangevale.

493
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,400
 I went to... This is whatever's been true.

494
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,300
 I went to see American History X at the theater opening weekend.

495
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,800
 And I just went to buy myself, because I go to theaters by myself all the time.

496
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,300
 You know that scene, that movie...

497
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,600
 If you don't know what the movie is, it's about white supremacists.

498
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,400
 That scene where Edward Norton takes his shirt off and he has the swastika on his chest

499
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,800
 and he's playing basketball.

500
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
 You can see all the black guys and he's beating them at basketball.

501
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,300
 The audience was cheering like we were watching Rudy.

502
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
 They were like, "Yeah, don't call him, don't call him!"

503
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,100
 And I'm like, "Oh, my God, dude."

504
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,200
 This is a movie about...

505
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,500
 This is like a meditation on racism in the human condition and what it means to be a human.

506
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,700
 And they're like, "Yeah, for..."

507
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,900
 They were cheering.

508
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,100
 Now, to be fair, they didn't cheer during the curb stomping scene,

509
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,600
 but there was a couple of "hmmm," like, "Yeah, like, right on" type motions.

510
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,500
 And to be even more fair to this crowd of skinheads,

511
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,600
 when the movie ended, you could hear a pin drop and everyone shuffled out of the theater quietly.

512
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,300
 Like, that is a really powerful movie and it was very interesting to see

513
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,900
 with a bunch of people who shared similar views as Edward Norton's character.

514
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,800
 That's kind of the area Orangevale is in.

515
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,100
 It's known for meth, peckerwoods, and no street lights.

516
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,700
 So I'm driving down these back roads of Orangevale.

517
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,800
 Really nice place to live, though.

518
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,300
 All the side of the fightings and the meth cooking and the mysterious fish gut bandit.

519
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,800
 They never did catch that guy.

520
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,400
 I'm driving through Orangevale late at night, three in the morning, or something like that.

521
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,100
 And, you know, it starts off, you think, "Maybe I'm just tired.

522
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,800
 Maybe I'm just tired."

523
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,200
 But I'm driving by a creek and it was this weird, like, creek

524
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,100
 that kind of came to where the road was and then turned and ran along.

525
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,000
 Like, it was like running...

526
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,900
 Uh, what perpendicular means it's running alongside or is that parallel?

527
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,200
 Anyways, just imagine the stream is running.

528
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,300
 It's so hot in here, guys. You have no idea all my fans are up.

529
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,600
 The water's coming like it's going to hit the road and then it turns

530
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,800
 and then begins to follow the road.

531
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,700
 So I'm driving to where I know this creek is and I know that's what it looked like

532
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 because I went out there during the day, but this night,

533
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,700
 it was one of my mini nights driving alone, just thinking.

534
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,800
 And I look in front of me.

535
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,300
 The only thing that's lighting anything up are my headlamps.

536
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,100
 And I look in front of me and for a split second, I see...

537
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
 God damn it, dude.

538
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,400
 I can see...

539
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,700
 I see what looked like...

540
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,200
 Ooh, it didn't look like it.

541
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,800
 What was a ghost boy?

542
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,800
 It was probably a boy around...

543
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,400
 It's weird because through the course of the story, I'd feel like the ghost was around 10,

544
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,900
 but he probably was a bit taller than that.

545
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:28,300
 But he was all blue, not like cool, smurf blue or Eiffel 65 blue,

546
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,800
 but he was basically like a translucent person, but you could see the blue outline of him

547
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,400
 to the point that I could draw you a picture of what his shirt pocket looked like.

548
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,700
 Like every detail of his shirt was illuminated in blue.

549
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,900
 His face was blue. I can picture it while I'm talking about it.

550
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,200
 That's why I hesitated to mention it.

551
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,900
 His face was in blue. His hair was in blue.

552
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,800
 You could see individual lines in the hair.

553
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,700
 You could see a shirt.

554
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,800
 He had a collared shirt, like a long-sleeved collared shirt

555
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,900
 that was kind of like a wrangler or like a cowboy type shirt that was unbuttoned slightly.

556
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,200
 He had the chest pocket with the little silver type button.

557
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,500
 It's not like the little button with the little holes in it.

558
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,100
 It's kind of like the silvery button.

559
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,200
 He's standing right in front of my car and I hit him, but it's a ghost.

560
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
 So what are you going to do?

561
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:21,900
 But as I drew, I didn't realize really what was going on until my car was kind of halfway through him.

562
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:31,500
 And then I went to look in my mirror to see, you know, what I, if I, what I had hit was standing behind me now in the road.

563
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,200
 If I was just imagining the whole thing or what.

564
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,500
 And when I looked in the rear view mirror, this spirit was in the back seat of my car.

565
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,100
 The blue boy.

566
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,200
 The blue boy was one of the first.

567
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,600
 He actually, it's hard.

568
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,800
 It's always hard to remember how everything played out.

569
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:59,000
 But I told, I told the story during the shadow people invasion where I saw the little boy who was like the black silhouette running around in my grandma's living room.

570
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,200
 The blue boy showed up after him, but before the shadow people, before I started seeing the fallen shadow people.

571
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,100
 Now the little boy, the silhouette that was running around my grandma's living room.

572
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,200
 I had a horrible dream last night about my grandparents.

573
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,100
 I dreamt that they died, but the thing is that they've been dead for years, but I remember just sobbing in my dreams, sobbing in my dreams.

574
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,900
 I'll never have a place to go in Sacramento again.

575
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,000
 I've lost my home.

576
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,700
 I'll never be able to go back.

577
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
 I love my grandparents.

578
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
 I love them, but they passed away a couple of years ago.

579
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,900
 It was just an odd dream to have.

580
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,100
 So anyways, in my grandma's house, they had the little silhouette boy running around.

581
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,300
 And then they had the shadow people and I've talked about the shadow people.

582
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,100
 I said they were almost ambivalent.

583
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,700
 They almost were too smart to care about humans.

584
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,500
 I never felt either anger or scariness from them.

585
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,200
 The blue boy was straight up malevolent.

586
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,800
 That was the one spirit that I ran into constantly that I actively feared.

587
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,900
 Actively feared.

588
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,300
 To the point, what's odd about it is that I blocked out a lot of stuff that happened with that guy.

589
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,500
 A lot of stuff.

590
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,300
 Because I've said this before.

591
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,200
 There have been times where I've told people, like people have said, "Hey, remember when this happened?"

592
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
 Like when I fought the witch and I was like, "What are you talking about? I never fought a witch."

593
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,900
 And they told me a little bit about it and I go, "Oh yeah, I fought a witch."

594
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,800
 And I'll tell a story. That's not a tease. I'll tell a story someday.

595
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,700
 But people would reference the blue boy to me and I'd be like, "What are you talking about?"

596
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,400
 And they're like, "Remember you said this incident happened with the blue boy?"

597
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,200
 I'm like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot about that."

598
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,600
 To this point, to this day, I basically have three memories of the blue boy.

599
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,700
 One, the time I hit it.

600
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,500
 One, and for weeks I had this feeling like this guy was stalking me.

601
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,900
 So I feel like I have memories that I've repressed.

602
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,500
 Because I was in a state of anxiety because I felt like he was everywhere around me.

603
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,100
 But I remember once I was having a meeting, I worked at Godfather's Pizza in Antelope.

604
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,400
 I had a meeting with my manager, the assistant manager, and my friend Josh.

605
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,100
 And we're standing out in the middle of Godfather's Pizza.

606
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,600
 And as we're talking, I see, so there's like, we're in, it's gone now.

607
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,300
 It's too bad because that was a cool hangout spot.

608
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,900
 But there was Godfather's Pizza.

609
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,900
 Like you had like the dining room area and then it kind of broke off to this hallway that would go to the bathrooms.

610
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,300
 And I remember I was sitting there having a meeting with, we were really just BS.

611
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,000
 And it wasn't like an official meeting, but I'm talking to them.

612
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,100
 And I looked to where like the corner is of the hallway.

613
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,100
 So it's like, oh, see, I just remember.

614
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,100
 Okay, see, this is, I haven't talked about the blue boy in probably like 15 years.

615
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
 I remember now why I was concerned.

616
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,900
 Why, so let me tell you a little bit more of that story.

617
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,700
 I remember as I was talking to management, I was staring at the hallway.

618
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,800
 And then I started thinking, why was I staring at the hallway?

619
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,700
 This is why I was staring at the hallway because previous to that, maybe in a couple of days before that,

620
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,800
 I remember I was in the Godfather's restroom.

621
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 I don't remember all the details, but I was in the Godfather's restroom and the boy was in there.

622
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,500
 I saw the boy in the restroom late at night and I left.

623
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,400
 And I remember telling my friend Jackie about the blue boy and I was totally freaked out.

624
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,100
 And I felt like he was following me around and all that stuff.

625
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,000
 So I remember I didn't want to go into the restroom in there.

626
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,500
 So I was peeing in the walk-in freezer.

627
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,900
 No, I wasn't doing that, but I did a lot of bad stuff there, but not that.

628
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,900
 But anyways, I remember, see, it's like just fragments of memories.

629
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,000
 I remember telling Jackie, I don't want to go in the bathroom.

630
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
 There's something in there.

631
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,400
 But anyways, I was having this meeting with these people and I remember kind of looking past their shoulders

632
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,700
 at the hallway that led down the to the restrooms and I'm like looking at it.

633
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:39,800
 And I see the little blue boy like from the moment he peeks around the corner to the moment

634
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:45,000
 he's in front of me is like a split second.

635
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,800
 Like I see his head start to move around the corner and then he runs so fast within a second

636
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,100
 he's standing in front of me and he just makes this horrible like disfigured face at me like,

637
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:03,300
 "Uhhh!" and I screamed out loud and I actually had a physical reaction and I just kind of

638
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,700
 "Uhhh!" and I remember I didn't breathe in like that.

639
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,700
 I screamed out loud and my bosses are like, my bosses are like, "What?

640
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,000
 What's going on?"

641
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
 And I didn't say anything.

642
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
 I said, "I got to go home, dude.

643
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
 I don't feel good at all."

644
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,000
 Like I basically had a full-on hallucination of whatever this thing was.

645
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,200
 Again, the memory is spotty, but I do have one other memory of this thing

646
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,800
 and it's not necessarily of the blue boy itself, but what I did to stop it.

647
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,600
 Now, I've said a lot of stupid stuff on this podcast, but this might take the cake.

648
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,100
 And when I say just this podcast, I don't mean this episode.

649
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,600
 A lot of stupid stuff just on the run of the podcast to begin with.

650
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,900
 So I don't know why it got into my head, but I came up with an idea that...

651
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,700
 This is so stupid sounding.

652
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:55,300
 If you take a piece of your soul, if any of this stuff exists,

653
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,300
 if you take a piece of your soul, if your soul is the highest form of energy,

654
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:06,500
 the highest form of you in existence, your body is just a meat wagon for your soul,

655
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,200
 you can take a piece of your soul, break a piece of it off, and turn it into a weapon.

656
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,300
 Do I have any proof of that?

657
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,100
 No.

658
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,300
 I don't know where I got that idea from.

659
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,700
 I just felt that it was true.

660
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:25,800
 And the problem was is that you're basically trading a piece of yourself

661
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,400
 to turn it into something that you can use offensively.

662
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
 I mean, you can make a shield as well.

663
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,400
 We'll get to that later, but you break off a piece of your essence.

664
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,200
 I used to be, you know, and I guess I should say this now.

665
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
 I used to be like into astral travel, all that stuff.

666
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,400
 Those are, again, far more episodes to do in the future.

667
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
 We'll talk about doing astral travel.

668
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,300
 I used to be really, like I said before, I used to be really into conspiracy theories.

669
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
 I was not skeptical of conspiracy theories at all.

670
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,900
 I was the same thing for all the paranormal stuff.

671
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,500
 Like, I really believed all of it.

672
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,600
 I was really into all sorts of weirdness and stuff like that, not wicked weirdness.

673
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,400
 I never went down that path, but I was just into like all sorts of wacky beliefs.

674
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
 And now I look back on it and go, "Ah, it's probably just a dream.

675
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,900
 It's probably just imagination.

676
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,800
 This stuff doesn't work."

677
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,500
 Anything like that.

678
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
 [Sighs]

679
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:18,100
 So, I'm going to forget what I just saw out of the corner of my eye,

680
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,400
 and we're going to go ahead and keep recording this episode.

681
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,100
 So, but I had this theory.

682
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,200
 If you take a piece of your soul and you basically break it off,

683
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,500
 you could create a weapon that would protect you.

684
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
 Why your soul would protect you?

685
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,400
 I don't know.

686
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,500
 But I believed that it could and it did.

687
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
 I mean, if any of this is true, and I'm not just like having,

688
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,300
 I wasn't just having seizures and imagining all this stuff,

689
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,500
 which is 100% possible.

690
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
 It was all my imagination, 100% possible.

691
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 But anyways, through visualization, through astral travel, whatever you want to call it,

692
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 I came to the conclusion.

693
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,000
 I said, "I feel like such an idiot talking about this stuff."

694
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I was able to remove a small piece of my soul and I made a sword out of it.

695
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And because it was all about visualization, and actually, that's an,

696
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 now that I say that out loud, that's interesting because it could just be the,

697
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 the act, I always talk about visualization and positive thinking and stuff like that.

698
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 The act of visualizing this, whether or not I took a piece of my soul out,

699
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 is probably irrelevant.

700
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 The fact that I was visualizing it and visualization is magic in a sense.

701
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Reshaping the physical world through your mental thoughts,

702
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 that could be, that could explain what, you know, how this all worked.

703
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 But anyways, take a piece of my soul.

704
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Human souls, I always saw as translucent blue.

705
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 So mine is, yours is, everyone's is, and that's why the boys was as well.

706
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 That's their natural state.

707
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 I took a piece of my soul and I forged an ornate sword in my mind.

708
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Now, I knew the sword didn't actually exist.

709
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I'm not saying that I carried it around in a sheet,

710
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 but I knew on some level, or I believed on some level that it did,

711
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 on some plane outside of our own.

712
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And, but here's the thing, the trade-off was,

713
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 is that now I have this offensive weapon to protect myself from ghosts,

714
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 but it's a part of me that probably I shouldn't have taken out,

715
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 because it's part of your soul.

716
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 You only get one of those throughout all of eternity.

717
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 But the boy, the threat of the boy, forced me to do it.

718
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 It wasn't the shadow people, it wasn't the shadow dogs.

719
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 It wasn't any of the other nonsense going on in my life.

720
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 The threat of the blue boy, who, and the, from the time I saw him to that Godfather story,

721
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 was at least five or six months of constant issues with him that I've just blocked out.

722
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And after that Godfather story, I would say it would probably went on for another two or three months,

723
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 because at that point, we were now in the story of the shadow invasion people.

724
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And I also had to deal with this stupid little blue bastard running around, scaring me,

725
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 standing behind me doing creepy stuff.

726
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 So because of the threat of him interrupting my daily life,

727
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I forged the sword, or I believed I forged the sword.

728
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I'm not making it up now, this, all this stuff, all of these events happen,

729
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 whether or not you believe that they happened, or that I was just imagining them.

730
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I experienced these, and again, I can't say for a hundred percent.

731
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 I could never say that what I, I'll say I saw these things,

732
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 but if you could say these are the reasons, these are the logical reasons why you saw these things,

733
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I would go, okay.

734
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 But anyways, I forged the sword.

735
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 So I have this thing now, and that's the end of the story.

736
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 That's the problem sometimes when you tell these stories, when you tell personal ghost stories.

737
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Something happened, but I don't remember what.

738
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 I remember there was a point where I had the sword, and then the blue boy was no more.

739
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I don't know if I confronted him.

740
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 I don't know if he tried to get me, and I summoned this sword, this mental sword.

741
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Again, I wasn't carrying around, but I took a piece of myself and mentally had it separate.

742
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Basically, a tulpa actually, now is a good way to put it, created this sword.

743
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Did he show up, and I cleave him in half with it?

744
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Did he know that I have it and never came back?

745
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 That doesn't sound like him.

746
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 He was so malevolent.

747
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 He had such a good time freaking me out that I don't think anything could have scared him.

748
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 The blue boy just disappeared.

749
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Not disappeared in the sense that he's gone, but disappeared in the sense that the threat was over.

750
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 I'll tell you, so he disappeared.

751
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Now, I do know that there had been times where I had encountered other ghostly things,

752
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 because I was just seemed to be a magnet for a while.

753
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 And that sword I created in my mind from my soul seemed to just cut them right in half.

754
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Golden ribbons is what it would look like.

755
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Golden ribbons.

756
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Sometimes they'd be translucent blue.

757
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Sometimes they'd be dark silhouettes.

758
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Sometimes it would just be a feeling in the house, but I could mentally, in my mind,

759
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 cleave them in half, cut them, eviscerate them.

760
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Golden ribbons, and then they would disappear.

761
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 The sword that I created, the Topa Mind Thoughts Form sword, from a piece of my soul.

762
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 This sounds so insane, but it worked.

763
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 It worked for me, at least.

764
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 But the thing with forging a sword like that, like I said before, it's from something very important.

765
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Something you can't lose, but I don't have that sword anymore.

766
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 It got replaced when someone gave me another one.

767
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 But we'll talk about that on another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

768
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
