1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
 When a young man sees a ghost standing in his living room, he realizes ghosts are real.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,740
 I guess ghosts really do exist.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,820
 But this one has a twist.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,880
 And then we travel to Pennsylvania to meet a young man who is tasked with trying to complete

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,520
 an impossible task, set up a computer for an elderly couple, and then teach them how

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,280
 to use it.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,560
 While this man may be braver than most of us, his courage is truly put to the test when

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,120
 he comes face to face with an insectoid today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:52,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,560
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,560
 Hope you guys are having great day too.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,600
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,520
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,560
 First off, Slytherin on the ground of Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,880
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, ExtensionCord.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,320
 Woohoo, yeah, yeah, watch him slither.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,080
 The more you clap, the closer he gets to the outlet.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 Wee!

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
 Okay, now he's in.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,160
 ExtensionCord, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot, so that's a real Patreon's name.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,560
 You guys are like Jason, you're clearly just making stuff up now.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,800
 You just want to advertise your Patreon, you're like looking around your house, you're like

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,000
 "Tomorrow we'll be sponsored by Blender."

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,360
 ExtensionCord, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand it.

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,400
 I really do.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,560
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Command, it helps out so much.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,560
 Tell your friends, tell your family, talk about it online.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,240
 That also helps the show grow.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,640
 ExtensionCord, I'm gonna go ahead and tie you around the steering wheel of the Jason

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,880
 Jalopy.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,040
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,400
 Drive us all the way out, too.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,680
 A haunted house.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,160
 This is one of the stories where we don't have a location, it was posted online anonymously,

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,080
 and it was written by a guy named Prochetto Pizza, Prochito?

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,000
 Prochito Pizza, we're gonna go ahead and call you Jerry.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,080
 Jerry says, "This story takes place back when I was in high school.

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,600
 I lived in a haunted house."

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,760
 Not like one of those Halloween haunted houses where people jump out at you and stuff like

41
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
 that.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,280
 It's on my bucket list to work in a haunted house.

43
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,000
 One of those, it doesn't even have to be a big haunted house, like six flags or nothing

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,040
 like that.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,560
 Even a local regional haunted house would be super dope.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,760
 You have a job for a couple weeks, and then you don't have it anymore, but for three weeks,

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
 you're giving it your all.

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,760
 I'm jumping out of hay bales and spraying fake blood on people.

49
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,320
 They're like, "Jason, we told you, you weren't hired.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,960
 This is one of those biblical haunted houses where we talk about sins.

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
 Get out of here.

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
 I'm spraying blood at the pastor.

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
 I'll be back tomorrow night, sir."

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
 I've always wanted to do that.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,280
 I think it'd be totally dope, but that's not the type of haunted house he's living in.

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,720
 He's living in a real haunted house.

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,440
 He's living in a haunted house, and he goes, "Here's the thing.

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,960
 We all knew it was haunted."

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,200
 It was the traditional things you would associate with a haunted house.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,440
 He goes, "You would hear footsteps throughout the house when everyone was accounted for."

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,320
 Every show often something would fall off the shelf.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,720
 It's interesting because a lot of people think that's incredibly common because we

63
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 see it in movies all the time.

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,840
 When stuff's getting knocked off your shelf, that's a rarer type of ghost.

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,520
 Sounds are quite easy.

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,280
 It appears for ghosts to do.

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,920
 For people to go, "I just lived in an ordinary haunted house.

68
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,880
 Stuff was flying off of the shelves.

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,840
 It's actually quite rare."

70
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,040
 That's when you're getting into poltergeist activity.

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
 Most hauntings are just noises or smells.

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,200
 That was another thing he said.

73
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,680
 He goes, "Every show often you could catch the whiff of cigar smoke."

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,720
 I didn't really see anything.

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,080
 He's saying that as a book, as everyone around it said.

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
 He goes, "Oh, that's normal."

77
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,200
 But I'm talking about I never actually saw a ghost in this house until one day Jerry

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,560
 said that he was in the kitchen.

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,760
 He's standing in the kitchen and something catches his eye.

80
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:30,720
 He turns and he looks into the living room and he sees a translucent apparition.

81
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,300
 Even though we don't have a specific location for this haunting, he does describe this ghost

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,520
 as wearing colonial style clothing.

83
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
 Almost pilgrim-like.

84
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,040
 So we'll assume it's the East Coast of the United States.

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,040
 He said the reason why, what caught his eye really when he saw this ghost was two things.

86
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,760
 First off, that he's looking at a translucent person.

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,800
 He said the clothing looked old-fashioned.

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
 It definitely wasn't modern clothing.

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,560
 He said that the pants were, they appear to be tucked into the socks, which is how the

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,400
 pilgrims wore it.

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,200
 The apparition had no head.

92
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,800
 And he doesn't say that it walked away.

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,440
 He doesn't say that it blinked away, but at some point it looked.

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,200
 It's not there until the day he's like, "Yeah, I'm charging people $5 ahead to get it to

95
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,720
 come in here and look at this headless ghost."

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
 No, at some point that he vanished, the ghost vanished.

97
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,160
 And Jerry goes, "It does make sense because this house was built in the 1700s.

98
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,120
 We would definitely have, if anyone was going to show up in this house, which is haunted,

99
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,160
 that it would be the apparition of a guy in colonial clothing."

100
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
 It's interesting because Jerry's already lived in a haunted house.

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,480
 He's already heard things and smelled things and had stuff fall off shelves.

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,440
 He doesn't particularly say that it was hovering around him or hitting him in the face or anything

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
 funny.

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,840
 But he sees a, God, just imagine he's like eating an apple.

105
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
 Jerry's all, "Ugh."

106
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,240
 And then he looks over and he sees a translucent man with no head in colonial garb.

107
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
 And he's like, "I'm just going to take another bite of this apple.

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,760
 I'm still hungry."

109
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,040
 Well when Jerry's dad came home that day, Jerry goes, "Hey dad, you know this is nuts.

110
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 I was eating an apple.

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
 I was eating an apple.

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
 He doesn't know how to tell stories."

113
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
 It was a warm sunny day this afternoon and I was hungry for an apple.

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,280
 Eventually he gets to the point and he goes, "I saw a ghost.

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,200
 I saw a headless ghost."

116
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,440
 And he was dressed in peculiar clothes to say the least.

117
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,000
 And the dad, as he's describing, this is such an interesting ghost story.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,880
 "Hey, I know that I've kind of buried the lead.

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,120
 I took a long time to get to it too, but this is so interesting."

120
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,640
 As Jerry is telling his father this story, the dad's just going, "Uh-huh."

121
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,640
 He's like listening to this story and then he's like, Jerry's describing the clothing

122
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,360
 and the dad's like, "Yeah, okay."

123
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,880
 The dad goes, "Well, you know, the dad says that's very interesting.

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,680
 You saw proof of life after death, son.

125
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,760
 I have something to add to that story.

126
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,360
 Do you remember Uncle Mike?

127
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,840
 Uncle Mike, he died a couple months ago.

128
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,760
 Jerry's like, "Yeah, yeah, I remember Uncle Mike."

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,880
 He goes, "Yeah, you know, we have this urn of his ashes and I'm going to bury them in

130
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,200
 the backyard."

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,880
 And so I'd actually taken his ashes and I moved the urn outside in preparation that

132
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,800
 I was going to bury him later today or tomorrow.

133
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,040
 Whenever I get around to it, the raccoons are playing with it.

134
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,800
 So yeah, I think that might have had something to do with the apparition you saw in the house

135
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
 today.

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,960
 It was the fact that I moved the urn and the ashes out into the backyard.

137
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,320
 And what Jerry, this is so crazy, what Jerry realized in that moment was, because you know,

138
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,000
 he was describing it all to his dad and then once the dad mentioned Uncle Mike, Jerry's

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,800
 like, "Oh dude, Uncle Mike used to be big into softball.

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:13,000
 He played a lot of softball and it wasn't an old-timey colonial outfit he was wearing.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,880
 It was like an old-timey softball uniform.

142
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,640
 I don't know how old I may be, but it might have been one of those lame baggy ones.

143
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,880
 But the point is, is that the pants were tucked into the socks.

144
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:33,960
 So through the translucent haze, the colonial clothes looked like, you're like Jason, this

145
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
 is not as interesting.

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,320
 As I'm saying it out loud, I still think it's pretty interesting.

147
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,800
 It wasn't a colonial ghost, it was an Uncle Mike ghost.

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,200
 It was a softball uniform that looked like he played for the Colonials, I don't know.

149
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,640
 But yeah, I mean, it would make sense.

150
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:58,640
 Like you're seeing this ghost and you're going, "Yeah, pants tucked into socks, colonial,

151
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
 right?"

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:07,160
 You immediately think of some adult softball league and Uncle Mike blew his brains out.

153
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,920
 So that's why he doesn't have a head.

154
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,120
 I don't think that Uncle Mike, he wasn't the ghost that was making the footsteps.

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
 We don't really have a timeline.

156
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,760
 We don't have a timeline here.

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,440
 But he doesn't connect any of the other paranormal activity.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,760
 He doesn't also go, "Oh, and Uncle Mike loves smoking cigars.

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,840
 He loves smoking cigars and making books ever in midair."

160
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,400
 Those are his favorite hobbies of an adult softball.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,280
 I think the place was haunted.

162
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,960
 The place was haunted before this family even got there.

163
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,200
 And when they brought home Uncle Mike's, and that's a, I made that name up.

164
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,280
 I don't know what his uncle's actual name is, but when they bring Uncle Mike's ashes

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,680
 home, his spirit joined the revelry.

166
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,840
 And it's interesting because I don't necessarily think the spirit was connected to the ashes

167
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,320
 because I don't think the physical form really has much of a connection, but it would be

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,080
 connected to the emotional energy of the people living in that house, the people who missed

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,520
 him the most, his family.

170
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,920
 This ghost tags along, but it has no form whatsoever.

171
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 It has no energy.

172
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,720
 But it's now you've moved a recently deceased spirit into an actively haunted house that's

173
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,000
 going to be able to charge itself off that energy and manifest.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,200
 Which is, again, one of the rarer forms of ghosts.

175
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,960
 Those are the stories you hear the most about because they're so weird and creepy, but most

176
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:40,120
 ghostly activity is sounds and smells and then apparitions and then moving things.

177
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,040
 So this was a super active house.

178
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,080
 I don't think Uncle Mike was the original ghost.

179
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,440
 I think that this ghost was able to manifest because this place had so much energy already

180
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,480
 in it.

181
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
 And when they moved the ashes out, the ghost showed.

182
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
 I don't know.

183
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,720
 The whole story is interesting as to why you would bury ashes in the backyard.

184
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,200
 When the ghost shows up, I guess you have to ask yourself, are you going to listen to

185
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
 the ghost?

186
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
 Was the ghost saying one last goodbye?

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,920
 Or was he trying to appear because he didn't want to be buried in the backyard?

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,720
 I mean, I'm sure eventually they did bury him back there.

189
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
 Is his ghost still there?

190
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,000
 Has he joined the collection of spirits?

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,640
 Is he there so he can spend more time with his family?

192
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,840
 Is he trapped because they brought him to a house that is just not necessarily a positive

193
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,440
 conductor of paranormal energy, but a vortex that's keeping souls trapped there?

194
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
 Who knows?

195
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,400
 Lots of hypothetical questions, but a very interesting story.

196
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,960
 Very interesting story about getting your clothes wrong.

197
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,960
 You thought you saw a colonial ghost, but really it was a dead relative.

198
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,400
 You died fairly recently.

199
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,920
 I've always wondered how many ghosts we see where they're like, "Oh, if you look down

200
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,280
 this hallway at 3 a.m., you'll see a ghost of a maid wearing old-timey Downton Abbey

201
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 clothes."

202
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:06,120
 It was really like some sex-fib, some sex-fetish party, some girl dressed up as a maid, and

203
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,520
 then tripped and landed on a broken wine bottle and slid her throat open.

204
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,720
 She bled all over the floor.

205
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 Then now that's her.

206
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 That's her ghost.

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,960
 She's trapped in Downton Abbey clothes for the rest of time.

208
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 Who knows?

209
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,440
 It's probably more likely some old-timey ghost, but it could be just a costume, and then you

210
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
 have the whole idea.

211
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,720
 This is what I'm actually doing.

212
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 I'm doing that.

213
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,760
 I know it sounds like I keep promoting, and I am.

214
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,560
 I'm doing a presentation at the Oregon Ghost Conference on March 24th in Seaside, Oregon.

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
 We are going to be talking ... Is it March 24th?

216
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,440
 I better double check that that's the date here.

217
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
 Hold on.

218
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,320
 I'll be doing a presentation on ... Yeah, I'm doing a presentation on March 24th at

219
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
 the Oregon Ghost Conference.

220
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,920
 We're talking about how the spirit is or looks after death.

221
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,600
 Could you imagine not having a head as a ghost?

222
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,920
 We don't know what it's like to be a ghost.

223
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,080
 Maybe you see through your fingertips, but there's a lot of good ghost cigarshops out

224
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
 there.

225
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
 You want to smoke.

226
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,040
 I mean, what is it?

227
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,840
 You would think if it was true that the manner in which you died is the manner in which you

228
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,640
 haunt, which I don't believe.

229
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,560
 I don't believe that, but there are so many ghosts that are walking around with no heads.

230
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,960
 You figure the old rap saying, "Protect your neck" would become a philosophy.

231
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,560
 The whole idea of life would be, "Die with a perfect body, otherwise you'll be floating

232
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,440
 around in the afterlife with no head."

233
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,760
 Let me just give you a little advice.

234
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,320
 Don't let anything happen to your head anyways, whether or not ghosts are real.

235
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,960
 You're like, "I don't believe in ghosts.

236
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,080
 You're banging your head with sledgehammers."

237
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 Don't do that.

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,760
 It's just interesting.

239
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,360
 Do we need to make sure we don't die certain deaths?

240
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,600
 Does that make a difference in how a ghost lore is divided on this?

241
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,080
 Sometimes you get a ghost with no head and they died by most likely shooting themselves

242
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,640
 in the head or they were beheaded during life.

243
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,600
 But then there are other soldiers who get blown to bits by a bomb in some Godforsaken

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,640
 battlefield and their ghost is fine walking around.

245
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,400
 It's an interesting question and we don't know as paranormal researchers why some ghosts

246
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,160
 are totally just like banged up.

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,480
 They're all covered in blood, no head, missing limbs.

248
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,000
 And then other ghosts who also died in horrible way.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,280
 Most drowned ghosts aren't blue.

250
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,320
 Most drowned ghosts don't have snails crawling out of their nose or a hermit crab living

251
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 in their brain.

252
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,760
 I mean, so what is it?

253
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,760
 What is it?

254
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,800
 But anyways, a fascinating question, fascinating story.

255
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 A fascinating way for me to advertise Oregon Ghost Conference March 24th.

256
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 Come out and see me.

257
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
 This will be a lot of fun.

258
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,840
 Extension cord, let's go ahead and plug you into the carpenter copter.

259
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,160
 We are leaving behind this haunted house.

260
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,800
 Take us all the way out to Pennsylvania.

261
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:11,000
 Specifically, we're headed out to Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania.

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,320
 I found this story on the amazing websites phantomsandmonsters.com.

263
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
 Check it out.

264
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,440
 They got new, they got like I've said before, they have more articles on that site than I

265
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,760
 could ever cover on this show so I recommend everyone check them out.

266
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 It's a great website.

267
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,160
 This story was originally sent or posted by a guy named PM, just his initials.

268
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,640
 We're going to go ahead and call you Peter.

269
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,160
 This story starts off in 2002 when Peter was 14 years old.

270
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,680
 And a friend of his goes, "Hey Peter, I know you're really good with setting up computers.

271
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,180
 I know you're a whiz.

272
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,840
 You're also very handsome and looks like you're strong.

273
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,840
 Have you been working out?"

274
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,040
 And Peter goes, "Okay, what do you want me to do?

275
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,000
 So obviously you're trying to butter me up to do something that most people would find

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 painful."

277
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
 And the friend goes, "Yeah, that's pretty much what I'm doing.

278
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,240
 I'm wondering if you can set up my grandparents' computer."

279
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 I've done it.

280
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
 I've done it.

281
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 Not for these.

282
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
 I'm not Peter.

283
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 I'm admitting that I'm the only one who told this story.

284
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,080
 No, everyone, I think anyone who knows anything about computers has had to set one up for

285
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,240
 an elderly person or program their mother's phone or stop their printer from shooting

286
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
 out paper across the room.

287
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,400
 Anyone who knows anything about tech support has been dragged into the scenario at one

288
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 point or another.

289
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,800
 And that's why I feel Peter's pain.

290
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,360
 Peter's like, "Oh man, I thought I was going to have fun tonight.

291
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,780
 Instead, I'm going to be putting these people's..."

292
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:43,280
 Not only does he have to assemble the computer, he then needs to load the software up, which

293
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,000
 at this point in time is probably the AOL disk they got in the mail, and then he needed

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 to do a tutorial.

295
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,080
 It's like all the worst possible things you could do.

296
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,760
 But anyways, Peter says, "Sure, I'll do it."

297
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,360
 And he rides his bike over to his friend's grandparents' house.

298
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,520
 When Peter gets there, he finds that the only people in the house are the grandparents and

299
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 their six-year-old granddaughter.

300
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
 She was visiting.

301
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,000
 He originally tried having her set up the computer, and she's like, "I can't even spell

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 the word.

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,880
 What am I supposed to do with these cables?"

304
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,800
 So they send her to her room.

305
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 She is fast asleep.

306
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
 Peter is there.

307
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,520
 He sets up the computer, loads up all the software, and does the tutorial.

308
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,000
 This is a mouse.

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,560
 This is a browser.

310
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
 This is your monitor.

311
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,320
 They're all like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, Einstein.

312
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
 What's going on?"

313
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,960
 The monitor is not the computer.

314
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,040
 By the way, there are two separate pieces there.

315
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,400
 Like, you're blowing my mind, man.

316
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,320
 Anyways, after everything is set up, all the software is loaded and the presentation is

317
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,000
 over, Peter is ready to go.

318
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,840
 It's time to leave.

319
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
 Grandparents are very thankful.

320
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,960
 Hey, we know this wasn't an easy task.

321
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
 Thank you so much for setting this up for us.

322
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,800
 We will email you tomorrow with a whole new list of questions.

323
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
 First question, how to use email.

324
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,720
 And he's like, "Uh-huh."

325
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,920
 After the presentation is done, Peter is ready to leave.

326
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,160
 The grandparents are now sitting on the couch in the living room.

327
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,840
 But before Peter can actually walk out the front door, suddenly a cold breeze sweeps through

328
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,400
 the entire room.

329
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:28,200
 When this happens, Peter sees both of the grandparents turn and begin staring into the kitchen.

330
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,640
 And Peter's looking at the grandparents and he's like, "What?"

331
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,920
 And he turns and he looks into the kitchen as well and he sees what they're staring

332
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,520
 at.

333
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,240
 Standing in the kitchen are two gray aliens.

334
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,280
 You know, they look like their traditional gray alien except for two details.

335
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,120
 One, their eyes seem to be a little bit farther to the sides of their heads.

336
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,720
 Gray aliens, the eyes are normally in the front of the face like a human's eyes.

337
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,960
 They also said they were wearing silver jumpsuits.

338
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,960
 They also said not only were the eyes farther apart than he had seen in drawings or in movie

339
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,080
 or television shows of aliens.

340
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,160
 He goes, "These gray aliens were taller than I had imagined gray aliens to be and their

341
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,400
 necks were thicker.

342
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
 They also wore silver jumpsuits."

343
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,120
 Now on any given day, two gray aliens appearing in your kitchen or somebody else's kitchen

344
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,160
 if you're visiting them would be shocking and probably the most exciting thing, at

345
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,520
 the very least the most exciting thing you've seen that day, if not ever.

346
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,240
 But there was another figure standing in this room that was running the show.

347
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,320
 This was the main attraction.

348
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,840
 Standing in between these two gray aliens was an insectoid.

349
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,360
 These giant bipedal insect creatures.

350
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,440
 They're very rare in UFO stories.

351
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
 I love them.

352
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
 I think they're super cool.

353
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
 I think they're super cool.

354
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,480
 I think the idea of the insectoid race is just so much you could do with it.

355
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,560
 As they're ripping me apart, I'm like, "Oh, this is so awesome, dude.

356
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,120
 Late eggs in my stomach.

357
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
 That's also awesome too."

358
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
 It's like, "What?

359
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,680
 You're enjoying this little too much?"

360
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,120
 Insectoid aliens I love.

361
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,400
 There's a giant insectoid also standing in the kitchen towering over the grays and he

362
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:27,280
 was wearing a black robe with a yellow stripe going down the middle.

363
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,520
 So an insectoid alien garbed in a flowing black robe and then two gray aliens flanking

364
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,880
 it with silver jumpsuits.

365
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,320
 Peter is shocked about what he's seeing, but he's also shocked by the fact that the grandparents

366
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,760
 don't seem to be particularly worried about what is going on.

367
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,520
 Peter said the insectoid and the aliens walked out of the kitchen and began to move through

368
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,680
 the house.

369
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,280
 They were gone for about a minute and then the insectoid and the gray aliens began walking

370
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,560
 back towards the kitchen, but now the insectoid is carrying the six-year-old granddaughter

371
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,800
 in its arms.

372
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:22,520
 The insectoid looks at Peter and Peter is looking at this praying mantis-type alien.

373
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 They've locked eyes and Peter goes, "Listen, I don't know how I got this feeling.

374
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,920
 I didn't get a telepathic signal.

375
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,720
 It definitely didn't say anything to me, but somehow when this thing was staring at me,

376
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:49,160
 I understood that this creature knew who I was.

377
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,680
 I don't know how he knew that and I don't know how I knew that he knew that, but I knew

378
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
 that.

379
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:02,000
 When he looked at me, I could tell in some way that he knew who I was."

380
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,480
 And the whole time the grandparents are just sitting there, now they're watching what's

381
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
 going on.

382
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,600
 They're not like turning on the television, they're all cranking the volume up.

383
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
 They're like, "Ah, that insectoid.

384
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,400
 His chittering is so annoying."

385
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,000
 No, they were watching it in silence.

386
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,640
 They were watching these aliens move through the house, go to the granddaughter's room,

387
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,240
 and now they're coming out with the granddaughter.

388
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,440
 They're just not doing anything about it.

389
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,320
 And Peter's obviously, he's in shock, he's terrified, he doesn't know what to do.

390
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,280
 He's only 14 years old, but finally he realizes the grandparents aren't going to stop whatever,

391
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,840
 whatever is about to happen isn't going to be good.

392
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,240
 The grandparents aren't going to do anything about it.

393
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,480
 I have to do something about it.

394
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,240
 And Peter said, "I took one step towards these aliens.

395
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,320
 I took one step and the grandfather reached out and grabbed my arm."

396
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:05,640
 And he said, "They will bring her back."

397
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,480
 At that point the aliens are now in the kitchen and a light materialized around the four of

398
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 them.

399
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
 The emantus is still holding the little girl in his arms.

400
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,680
 This light materializes and then they vanish.

401
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,840
 The three aliens and the little girl just disappear.

402
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,160
 Peter said, "It was interesting, the light appeared out of nowhere.

403
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,840
 Everyone vanished, but then there was this odd glow left behind that remains for a few

404
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,280
 seconds after whatever this was, this teleportation sequence or whatever.

405
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:48,440
 He goes, "You saw this glow last for a couple seconds and then slowly fade away."

406
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,000
 Peter's just standing there completely.

407
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,240
 What words would you even use?

408
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,680
 You'd basically have every human emotion, every negative human emotion going on through

409
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,440
 him right now.

410
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,800
 He doesn't know what happened.

411
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 He's perplexed.

412
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,600
 He's terrified.

413
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,040
 But all of this stuff, he doesn't understand why no one did anything to stop this.

414
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,840
 So he's just standing there and he goes, "Maybe a minute past."

415
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,680
 There is just silence.

416
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
 I'm standing there.

417
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,840
 The grandparents are sitting on the couch.

418
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,240
 And what do you even say?

419
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:27,320
 I'm shocked that I saw this and then the grandpa says, "Once again, they will bring

420
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,820
 her back."

421
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,320
 Peter says about a minute passes of stunned silence.

422
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,760
 How would you react to any of this?

423
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:44,320
 You just saw in the most minimalist of terms, a six-year-old girl get kidnapped.

424
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,720
 But it wasn't just that, was it?

425
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,200
 There is aliens and teleportation and the fact that the grandparents, the people who

426
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,160
 should be protecting this girl, let it happen.

427
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,560
 And a minute passes of silence in this house and it is finally broken when the grandfather

428
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:05,680
 says, "Once again," and this is a direct quote both times, "They will bring her back."

429
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,200
 Peter got on his bike and took off.

430
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,280
 He said the whole time I was riding home, I felt like something was following me.

431
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,520
 Something was ready to snatch me right off my bike.

432
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,520
 I was petrified.

433
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,960
 But he made it home and he couldn't sleep, which is understandable, right?

434
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,040
 Again at the very least you saw a six-year-old girl get kidnapped in front of you.

435
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 He couldn't sleep.

436
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,840
 The next day he asks his friend about what would possibly have happened.

437
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,360
 He goes, "Hey, remember the other night?

438
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
 I set up your grandparents' computer.

439
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
 I didn't expect this.

440
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,800
 I expected to spend a couple hours explaining to them the difference between a modem and

441
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 a CD-ROM."

442
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,280
 No, three aliens showed up and kidnapped their granddaughter.

443
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
 What are your relatives?

444
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,920
 You guys are all part of the same family.

445
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
 What in the world is going on?

446
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,880
 Do you know anything about this?

447
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,720
 And Peter says his friend explained to him, "This isn't the first time that's happened.

448
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,400
 Like I'm sorry to put you in that position.

449
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
 I didn't know.

450
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,600
 The night you were going over was kidnapping night, but this isn't the first time that

451
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 it's happened."

452
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,480
 He goes, "This has happened a lot and every time it's happened, people have tried to

453
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,800
 stop it.

454
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,440
 The grandparents have tried to stop it.

455
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,840
 Other family members who had been there when this happened tried to stop it, but they never

456
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,240
 could.

457
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,520
 They can never stop this from happening and they always brought her back."

458
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:43,320
 In fact, I'll tell you right now, Peter, she did come back home a couple hours after you

459
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
 left.

460
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,000
 They did bring her back that night because they always do.

461
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,040
 And there's no way to stop it, so you just let it happen.

462
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,840
 Peter said shortly after this event, the entire family moved out of the area.

463
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,480
 So not just the grandparents, but everybody, everyone who was a part of this family, they

464
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,360
 just moved and he lost contact with his friend and with the grandparents.

465
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,840
 He doesn't really know what happened after that one night.

466
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,000
 It's a very interesting story, what I love about it, other than having one of my favorite

467
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,720
 alien races involved in it, the Insectoid.

468
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,280
 We can really take this story apart.

469
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,640
 I'll try not to drone on too quickly, get it?

470
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,040
 No, okay, let me explain.

471
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,720
 A lot of times, great aliens are considered drones.

472
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
 Some UFOologists say that they are part of their own race.

473
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,440
 While there's other UFOologists who believe that the grays are actually biodrones, they're

474
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,840
 like organic material, or they're actual robots, but they're constructs.

475
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,040
 They have no feelings.

476
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,440
 They have no emotions.

477
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,600
 They're basically the same as a tractor on earth.

478
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,760
 It's a vehicle or a mechanism meant to carry out a study.

479
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,520
 What's interesting about this one is the two gray aliens, their eyes are farther off to

480
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,760
 the sides of their heads than the normal gray alien.

481
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
 Almost like an Insectoid.

482
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,440
 Insectoid aliens don't have the eyes right in front of their head.

483
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,200
 They're kind of offset to the sides as well, not completely on the sides, but...

484
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,360
 So it's almost like the gray aliens they were being manufactured to serve the race they

485
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,680
 were with in this story.

486
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,160
 Because there's also some...

487
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,040
 The gray aliens wearing clothes, we actually see that a lot in UFO stories, like actual

488
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,320
 peoples encounters with gray aliens.

489
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,640
 In television and movie shows, gray aliens don't wear clothes, but when you dig through

490
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,200
 the reports, gray aliens wearing clothes are very, very common.

491
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,120
 So the silver jumpsuits, that's not really a signifier of anything.

492
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,200
 That's just...

493
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,360
 They do tend to wear clothes from time to time, but the larger necks, they're actually

494
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,600
 a little bit taller than the average gray alien, or the thicker neck taller than the

495
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,840
 average gray alien and the eyes kind of offset.

496
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,600
 Makes me think these may have been...

497
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,440
 If not, if we don't go with the gray...

498
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,320
 Because I don't know if I'm sold on that.

499
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,640
 The gray aliens are just tools.

500
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,160
 They're just kind of like mindless drones.

501
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,480
 Whether or not they're mindless drones or they do have their own unique personality, their

502
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,080
 own unique race, these ones may have been genetically modified by the insectoids to

503
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,200
 appear more like them.

504
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,760
 So that's an interesting little tidbit, but Jason actually the most interesting tidbit

505
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,360
 is the six-year-old getting kidnapped.

506
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,760
 He's talking about fashion choices.

507
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,920
 This is what is so interesting to me about UFOology with ghosts.

508
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,480
 It is a very one-on-one.

509
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,840
 Ghosts don't seem to be more powerful than the average human.

510
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,040
 They don't seem uniquely strong.

511
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,160
 Sure they can float through walls and they can throw stuff at you, and like if you punch

512
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,440
 them in your hand just goes through them.

513
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,120
 But ghosts basically seem to be limited to the strength level of a human.

514
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,720
 Aliens have been nerfed a lot, again when we talk about like television shows and movies,

515
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:18,360
 but when you dig through the lore, aliens are incredibly powerful beings.

516
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,720
 And we see a lot of, even when you look through the reports of missing time and things like

517
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,920
 that being knocked unconscious.

518
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,080
 We've done a whole episode about are great aliens evolved from dolphins because they

519
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,640
 both have the same type of sonic attacks.

520
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,840
 All this interesting stuff in the lore, when you watch movies and television, the great

521
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,880
 aliens are just like we come in peace, clean your environment.

522
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,280
 But in real life, I mean we've come across aliens that were bulletproof.

523
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,560
 We've come across aliens that people have tried stabbing them and the knife just slides

524
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
 off their skin.

525
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
 They can also be incredibly strong.

526
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:00,000
 Again, outside of all of the paranormal stuff, teleportation and mind-wiping people, a lot

527
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,400
 of these aliens you could not go toe-to-toe with a reptilian or an insectoid.

528
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,480
 They would gut you on the spot.

529
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,760
 Great aliens do seem to be quite frail.

530
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,080
 They seem to be built basically for pressing buttons on computers, flying spaceships, if

531
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,800
 they are a designed race, they're not built for combat.

532
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,040
 But reptilians and insectoids are.

533
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:30,840
 Whatever world they evolved on must be hell because they're just built to kill.

534
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,400
 And so at the end of the day, this insectoid could have just massacred everyone in this

535
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,520
 house and not have thought twice about it.

536
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,640
 You could have been a house of the...

537
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,960
 Just the way the power level of these things is off the charts.

538
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,920
 But what I like is that the insectoid wasn't doing that.

539
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,640
 However, the people did try to stop this from happening before and they never could.

540
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,640
 We don't get any info on if they were physically harmed or they had some sort of psionic block

541
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,160
 on them that they couldn't move.

542
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,200
 But to the point where the grandfather was resigned to just like not even get up off

543
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
 the couch.

544
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
 He's not even pretending.

545
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
 He has a guest over.

546
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,440
 He's not even like, "Oh great, now I gotta pretend that I can do this."

547
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,920
 He knew it was fruitless.

548
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,880
 He knew that they were gonna take her no matter what these beings were just far too powerful

549
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,160
 for the average human to interact with.

550
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,880
 He had tried before, other family members had tried before, and it has failed every single

551
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
 time.

552
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,000
 It would have had to have been a ton of times for you to not even get off the couch.

553
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,720
 It's that idea of the Groundhog Day Syndrome, right?

554
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,960
 Even by day five or day 50, you may still be trying to figure out the mystery.

555
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,760
 But by the 200th time this had happened, you're just like, "Whatever, I'm just gonna

556
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
 lay in bed."

557
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,480
 You hear the sound of the six-year-old getting kidnapped.

558
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,800
 You're like, "There's nothing we can do."

559
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,920
 And they always bring her back.

560
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,320
 So if I don't do anything, they're gonna bring her back.

561
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,520
 If I do something, there's a chance that I could get injured or that they won't bring

562
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
 her back.

563
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
 You know?

564
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,280
 And I think that's kind of implied as well.

565
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,360
 If you ended up injuring these beings, if you set a trap for them or busted out a shotgun

566
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,640
 and took out one of the gray aliens, blew away half of his skull, you may never see your

567
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
 daughter again.

568
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,360
 That teleportation's still going to happen.

569
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,800
 They're just bringing up one less alien.

570
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,360
 So it's a super interesting story.

571
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,040
 It's quite creepy.

572
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:37,480
 The idea of how powerless a human is, we are the dominant species on this planet.

573
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:45,680
 But on this planet is the key part of that sentence.

574
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,240
 You know, at any point, these more powerful beings can show up and do whatever they want.

575
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,520
 And there's nothing you can do about it.

576
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,400
 That's the key takeaway to really UFO stories.

577
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,600
 Their technology is greater than ours.

578
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,920
 Their scientific understanding, hand in hand with the technology, would be greater than

579
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,420
 ours.

580
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,880
 It's just raw power.

581
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,320
 It's just raw, unadulterated power that we can't even understand.

582
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,520
 We have it in our sci-fi shows and we have scientists working around the clock all over

583
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,080
 the world to move an atom from one millimeter away.

584
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,840
 No, it's not even a millimeter.

585
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,240
 It's even closer than that.

586
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,040
 But to make like a molecule jump, we go, "Look it.

587
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
 Look it.

588
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,080
 We're working towards teleportation.

589
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,760
 Aliens can do that with three dudes and then pick up a fourth and then just go back home."

590
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,040
 Like, we can't even comprehend that.

591
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,320
 And that's like their Sunday.

592
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,800
 That's just what they do to get around.

593
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,480
 So they outmatch us on science.

594
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,120
 A lot of the races outmatch us on physical power.

595
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,400
 We have had stories of people shooting aliens.

596
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
 Sure.

597
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,200
 We have had aliens get killed by humans with shotguns or rifles or whatever it is.

598
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:08,400
 We have had stories of UFOs getting shot down by fighter craft, but they're incredibly rare.

599
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,680
 When you look at the amount of alien encounters that we have versus the amount of alien encounters

600
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,440
 that when they come down to some sort of physical conflict, the humans win.

601
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
 It's incredibly rare.

602
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,040
 And again, you have that survivor bias.

603
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,600
 We don't have the accounts of the times the aliens killed humans.

604
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,920
 There is an encounter that went sideways and the aliens killed everybody because there's

605
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,220
 no one to tell that story.

606
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,680
 So we only have the stories where people survive alien encounters.

607
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,280
 And I think that may also skew how we feel.

608
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,440
 And I'm talking about hand-to-hand combat at this point.

609
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,160
 Great aliens might be incredibly strong, but anyone who's ever gotten toe-to-toe with one

610
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,000
 and lost, there's no one to tell the story.

611
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,800
 And the people who haven't physically gone after great aliens, they go, "I don't know,

612
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
 they've got skinny arms.

613
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
 He looks like a big old whim."

614
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,160
 It's a fascinating story.

615
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:10,680
 What do you do when an overwhelming force takes the person you love?

616
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,920
 It's a simple question, but it has no answer.

617
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,720
 If it was an armed raid from across your nation's borders where they broke in and they sacked

618
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,400
 the town and took all the women back home with them, the town population could get what

619
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,840
 guns they had left in rallying an army and go to take them back.

620
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,800
 We've seen that happen throughout history.

621
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:40,160
 But if an invading army simply teleported into your house and took your wife and then

622
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,760
 teleported away, first off, where do you even attack?

623
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,880
 Where did this army come from?

624
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,080
 Who are they?

625
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,760
 Overwhelming force, superior technology, massive physical strength differences, all of these

626
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:05,240
 things add up to make humans quite weak on the galactic scale.

627
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,640
 So when these encounters do happen, when this, really for lack of a better term, invading

628
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,960
 force canapses the ones we love the most, we know we can't defeat them.

629
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,600
 We know we can't fight back.

630
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:27,280
 All we can do is hope that they bring our loved ones back.

631
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:54,800
 But if they don't, there's still nothing we can do about it.

632
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:10,840
 That's all for now.

633
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:27,480
 Bye.
