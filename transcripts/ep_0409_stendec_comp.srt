1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
 A bus full of passengers sees something out of this world.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,640
 And then we travel back to the year 1947 to take a trip on a plane that is faded to crash.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,080
 British Airways Stardust was a tiny plane trying to climb over the Andes Mountains.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,880
 And just before the plane disappeared, it sent off a cryptic Morris code.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
 Stendec.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,880
 Stendec.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 Stendec.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:46,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
 Here's a little behind the scenes nugget.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,840
 I'm recording this episode right after I recorded last episode.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,400
 My idiot friend thought it would be real funny to get an appendix infection during a worldwide

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,760
 pandemic.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,200
 So she's on the verge of having to go to the ER for surgery.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,200
 Hopefully it's not an appendix infection and she just has horrible, abdominal pain.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,800
 What's the abdomen?

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,120
 The abdomen, the acting, hopefully she's just the pain that she's feeling is not that serious

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,920
 in her region between her boobies and her waist.

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,000
 But there's a pretty big chance I'm going to be at an ER later today or tomorrow.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,160
 So I wanted to get out today's episode so I could be with my friend while she's going

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
 through that.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
 Again, hopefully there's nothing wrong.

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,120
 The reason why I'm letting you guys know that is one, you guys probably be like, "Dude,

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,840
 he sounds just as bad as he did yesterday."

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
 No, no, no, trust me, I'll feel better tomorrow because I'll sleep in a better position too.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,360
 If anything huge happens in the next 24 hours and it's not addressed on this episode, that's

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
 why.

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
 So there we go.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,600
 So that's why my voice sounds the same and hopefully I have nothing but prayers for my

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
 friend while she's going through this and it would be awesome if you guys could share

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,240
 either prayers or good will with her as well.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,000
 Sabine, we hope everything works out and we'll keep you guys updated.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,360
 But first off, let us go ahead and we are going back to Argentina.

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,840
 Now I've said a lot of times this podcast is one of the biggest podcasts in Argentina

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
 right now.

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
 It's crazy.

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,600
 And actually the new stats have come out.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,840
 No joke in the true crime category, this podcast is the 75th podcast in the world, guys.

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,720
 And I know what you're thinking, "This isn't a true crime podcast."

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 Shh, don't tell them that.

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 Shh.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
 This is a true crime, kind of true crime-y, right?

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
 Huge.

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
 Huge.

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
 So thank you everyone for listening to the show.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,600
 But we have a huge listenership in Argentina and recently I did a story about Argentinian

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
 cryptids and they were all just giant sloths.

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
 Not a lot of stuff going on down there.

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,160
 But I kept looking from Argentina bros and gals, right?

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,640
 I got your back.

54
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,240
 And for this one I'm giving the keys to the carbonicopter to one of my longest time

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,360
 patreons, Chris Kilborn.

56
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
 Give it up for Chris Kilborn.

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,640
 He was the one who inspired me to set up the Patreon in the first place.

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,240
 And I want to give a shout out to the people who have been supporting the Patreon all this

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 time.

60
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,520
 I don't want to do just one shout out and then that's it.

61
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,800
 Because I appreciate your support.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,000
 So Chris Kilborn, you got the keys to the carbonicopter.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,360
 Actually we're not doing the carbonicopter for this first segment, so put the keys in

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
 your pocket.

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,600
 We're taking a bus trip.

66
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,200
 We're going to Argentina and we're in this bus.

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 It's 1986.

68
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 It's springtime.

69
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,920
 It's beautiful outside.

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,280
 We're all sitting in the back of the bus just chilling.

71
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
 That's the only cool place to sit in a bus, right?

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
 You got to sit in the back, right?

73
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
 That's totally dope.

74
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,280
 Isn't that where Rosa Parks sat?

75
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
 Oh no, no, no.

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
 She was supposed to sit in the back.

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,680
 So it's only cool if you...

78
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,080
 Or did she have to leave the bus?

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,040
 There's my American education system going.

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,360
 No, I think she was sitting in the front and some white dude jumped on and said, "You need

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
 to get to the back of the bus."

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,400
 And she goes, "No, my feet hurt."

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,120
 And then I don't remember what...

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
 Oh, she gets arrested.

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,920
 So if you choose to sit in the front of the bus, go ahead.

86
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,840
 I will yell from the back of the bus because I'm still going to be cool.

87
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,200
 Sitting back here.

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,600
 So we're on the bus in Argentina and we're driving down the road.

89
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 Chris is the bus driver.

90
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
 Chris is driving the bus down the road.

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
 He's like, "Tegan, I want to drive the Carver De Compteur.

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
 I've been supporting you all this time.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Don't worry, don't worry."

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,920
 Driving the bus down the road, we're going to Tobosí or Tobosí, which sounds better.

95
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,120
 Tobosí, it's a town in the Entre Rios region of Argentina.

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,400
 Middle of the day, just driving the bus.

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
 And there's like this hill which happens...

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
 You know, there's a lot of hills all over the world, not just Argentina.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 There's Ale.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 There's like power lines and stuff.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Again, not unique to the country of Argentina.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
 And there's this guy standing on top of the hill underneath the power line.

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
 Now, that's not a big deal, right?

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 A lot of people stand.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,560
 It's a free world.

106
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,880
 People can stand wherever they want, unless you're in Tiananmen Square.

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,520
 It's okay to stand places.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,800
 But for whatever reason, everyone on the bus felt compelled to look at this dude.

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,440
 And he's not looking at any of them.

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,240
 He's staring straight up at the power lines.

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
 So a little odd, right?

112
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,160
 But not, "Hey, everyone, look out this window, there's a guy looking up at the power lines."

113
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,360
 But people felt compelled to stare at this guy.

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
 The bus starts to slow down.

115
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,200
 Thinking it's a passenger.

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,480
 Might be, right?

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 Starts to...

118
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,400
 If buses didn't stop to pick up weirdos, there would never be anyone on a bus.

119
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,280
 The bus starts to slow down.

120
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,880
 And everyone on the bus gets a little, like, a little knot in their stomach.

121
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
 Ugh, what?

122
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
 Oh my...

123
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,640
 And we get a little scared.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,680
 The man standing on the side of the road looks into the bus.

125
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,080
 He's no longer looking at the power line.

126
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
 He looks in the bus.

127
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,760
 And that's when the people get the full scope of what's going on.

128
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,800
 This isn't the size of a normal man.

129
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 He's small.

130
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,080
 He's not three apples high, but he's not, like, what's the average height?

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,920
 Five foot eleven, five foot ten, something like that?

132
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
 Shorter than that.

133
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
 That's a...

134
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,480
 I know that's a big variance, but he's short, okay?

135
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,200
 Short dude.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,520
 He's not wearing normal clothes.

137
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,420
 He's wearing a silver suit.

138
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,760
 And he has what's described as big cuffs on.

139
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,360
 Now I don't know if those are, like, big old, like, Dracula cuffs, if that's a thing.

140
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
 You know, like, those cuffs that Count Duckula had?

141
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
 That's an obscure reference.

142
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,320
 You guys are like, that's even more confusing.

143
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,720
 I know what cuffs look like.

144
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 I don't know who Count Duckula is, or let alone what his cuffs look like.

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,560
 Anyways, he has Count Duckula cuffs, or I wonder if he had, like, broken, like, space

146
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
 handcuffs.

147
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 That's how I imagined it.

148
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,560
 Other than the Count Duckula thing, I imagine it like, "Pshh," like he broke free of space

149
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
 cuffs.

150
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,400
 The point is, he had giant eyeballs, a big bald head, and he's looking at the people

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,960
 in the bus, and fear so intensely overcomes, and fear so intensely overcomes the bus driver,

152
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,360
 he floors it, and peels out, and everyone just looks, and the man is just staring at

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,640
 them as they drive away.

154
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,160
 Now, Argentina, you guys, you guys got to do me some favors, bro, because it took me

155
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,280
 a long time to even find that one.

156
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,240
 Argentina, come on, guys, you got to help me out.

157
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
 Our next story takes place in Argentina, too, but come on, guys.

158
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,120
 Okay, that one is a little weird.

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,280
 That one is a little weird.

160
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,520
 But dude, come on, guys.

161
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,000
 Giant sloths, and what is most likely?

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,400
 Most likely this was a bald, short man waiting for a bus in the middle of nowhere, and it

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,560
 drove away from him.

164
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,160
 That's what most likely happened.

165
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,720
 This is listed on ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

166
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,160
 They have this big repository of UFO encounters.

167
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,400
 This is listed there.

168
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
 Argentina, come on, bro.

169
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
 You got to help me out.

170
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 You really got to help me out.

171
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,840
 I do like this story because it takes place in the middle of the day, multiple witnesses,

172
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,160
 but at the end of the day, it's probably just standing in a field.

173
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,960
 Big eyes, I mean, were they gray alien big eyes?

174
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,600
 Were they precious moment big eyes?

175
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 Were they bug eyes?

176
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
 Who knows?

177
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,000
 Anyways, this guy to this day, he's still standing in that field with his Count Duckula

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 cuffs on.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,360
 I almost should offer a prize to you who can ever find me the best Argentina ghost story

180
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,440
 -- Argentina ghost story UFO story or cryptid.

181
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,560
 Okay, we'll do that.

182
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,920
 Whoever can give me the best story from Argentina, and we'll have this contest going for, I don't

183
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,280
 know, a month, I will give you something.

184
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,240
 I'll send you something.

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,120
 You'll work out the details, but you'll get something from me, something, I don't know.

186
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,920
 I actually -- my friend Lana has made some rabbit themed stuff for the podcast that I

187
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 have sitting here.

188
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,840
 Maybe I'll give you one of those things, or maybe I'll give you something.

189
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,960
 I'm just not going to like wave over the podcast, so I'll send you like, "I'll autograph someone

190
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,400
 else's book and send it to you.

191
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
 Find me something."

192
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,640
 Now, before you guys start looking for Argentina stuff, we're about to cover a very unique

193
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,400
 Argentine story here.

194
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,760
 Very unique Argentine story.

195
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,600
 So that's the interesting thing -- think about Argentina.

196
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,680
 They have a bunch of stuff, bunch of giant sloths, and this bald guy standing on a street

197
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
 corner.

198
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,920
 But then also in their cryptids, they had the first ever microscopic cryptid.

199
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,280
 I've never covered that before, and this one is a very interesting story as well.

200
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,760
 Fire up that carbonicopter, Chris.

201
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:44,160
 We are headed up to the Andes.

202
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,600
 That's a little storm sound for us.

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,920
 It's August 2, 1947, a little bit after 5 p.m.

204
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,520
 The Stardust is a British Airways plane traveling from Buenos Aires to Santiago Chile.

205
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,120
 It's a little guy.

206
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
 It's a little plane.

207
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,760
 If you had to draw a picture of a plane equivalent of the little train that could, you'd draw

208
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
 this plane.

209
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,960
 It was a little plane.

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,400
 Six passengers, five crew.

211
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
 11 people in total.

212
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,920
 You can do math.

213
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,000
 The plane is flying up.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,640
 It has to cross the Andes to get to Santiago Chile.

215
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,080
 It does this all the time.

216
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,440
 Planes go up and down these mountains all the time.

217
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,280
 It's not the safest job in the world.

218
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
 But what are you going to do?

219
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,800
 You're going to take llamas up all over the place?

220
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,440
 No, you've got to fly over the mountains.

221
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,960
 This plane -- we're in 1947.

222
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,040
 This plane is being piloted and crewed by World War II veterans.

223
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,760
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

224
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,520
 This story takes place in Buenos Aires.

225
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,200
 They're not see veterans.

226
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,480
 Not as far as I could tell.

227
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
 Not as far as I could tell.

228
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,600
 I believe they're all British veterans because it's the British Airways.

229
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,960
 Although you got a little suspicious there when I was doing the research.

230
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
 I was like, "Hmm."

231
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
 They're like, "Yes, yes.

232
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,120
 These are all members of the Waffen -- what was it, the Waffen Division?"

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,280
 Anyways, they're flying -- and actually, that kind of plays into it a little bit.

234
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,240
 So they're British veterans, I believe.

235
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,520
 I wasn't able to find a clarification on that.

236
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:16,160
 But they're flying up over the Andes.

237
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,960
 Four minutes before the plane's supposed to land in Santiago.

238
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,200
 And these six people are going to disembark, and these five other people are going to go

239
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,560
 reconstruct Hitler's brain in a laboratory somewhere.

240
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,400
 The radio operator at the Santiago Airport gets a Morse code message.

241
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,560
 And what it says is, "ETA Santiago, 1745 hours."

242
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,280
 So we're expecting to land in four minutes.

243
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,080
 They're sending this out at 541.

244
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,000
 Again, you can do math, but Morse code says, "ETA Santiago, 17.45 hours."

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Stendec.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Stendec.

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,960
 The guy at the radio control booth is like, "What?

248
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
 Okay.

249
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
 What?

250
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
 What do you mean?"

251
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,240
 Now, he gets the first part of it, obviously.

252
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,440
 This isn't his first day on the job.

253
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,480
 It means we're going to be landing in four minutes.

254
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
 Stendec, though.

255
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,360
 He never heard of this before.

256
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
 He just launched out of Morse code.

257
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,920
 When he Morse's back, what are you guys saying?

258
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,720
 He gets two responses.

259
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 Stendec.

260
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
 Stendec.

261
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,400
 And then nothing.

262
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,600
 The plane never lands.

263
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,760
 It starts to become a bit of an international incident, because the people on this flight

264
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,880
 were basically...

265
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,520
 I read this article in the VintageNews.com.

266
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,760
 They said, "The crew of the flight basically seemed like people out of an Agatha Christie

267
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,560
 novel or a spy novel."

268
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
 It was all sorts of weirdos on this plane.

269
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,480
 You had a Palestinian on the...

270
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,280
 That alone doesn't make a weirdo.

271
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,120
 You had a Palestinian who?

272
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,400
 I have to add this in.

273
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:06,480
 Who supposedly had a very valuable diamond sewn into his clothing.

274
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,120
 You had a British diplomat on this plane who was carrying a briefcase full of documents,

275
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,520
 diplomatic secrets that he was headed to an embassy with.

276
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,680
 You had a German woman on the plane and she supposedly had her husband's ashes, which

277
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,000
 doesn't necessarily seem suspicious in and of itself.

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,440
 But that opened up rumors to theories that the other people on this plane were fleeing

279
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,200
 Nazis or that she was a Nazi and she was leaving.

280
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,760
 So you had all this stuff going on and people thought...

281
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,160
 People immediately thought when this plane does not land, because it's supposed to land

282
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
 in four minutes.

283
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,400
 They learned very quickly that this thing was missing.

284
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,320
 Sabotage.

285
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,400
 Somebody took out because of the diplomats on there.

286
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 Someone else goes, "No, no, no.

287
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
 It was about the diamond.

288
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,520
 Someone else was trying to steal it, which would be a pretty bad plan."

289
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,720
 "I got the diamond!"

290
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
 The plane crashes.

291
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,000
 Like, that's not a really good theft thing.

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,640
 Was this part of your plan, Bane?

293
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
 Like it just...

294
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
 That would be a bad...

295
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
 But I mean, maybe he jumped out.

296
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,200
 But anyways, so you had all this stuff and then people thought people were faking their

297
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 deaths.

298
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,080
 There were Nazis on the plane and they were trying to escape deeper into South America.

299
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 Things like that.

300
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,200
 They wanted to make it look like they were dead.

301
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,640
 So you had all of these rumors going on and you basically had two groups.

302
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,600
 You had the media going, "What in the world happened?"

303
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,400
 High-level people, mysterious people died on this plane.

304
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,680
 The plane is gone.

305
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,000
 They're assuming they're dead because the plane is simply gone, right?

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,400
 So you had these groups trying to figure out what could have happened.

307
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,960
 Was it sabotage?

308
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,240
 Was it theft?

309
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
 Was it a cover-up?

310
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,520
 And then you had a bunch of people wondering, "What in the world does Stendec mean?"

311
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,680
 Is it some sort of warning?

312
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
 What's going on?

313
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,200
 And you had all sorts of theories.

314
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,360
 Some people said the guy was trying to type in "descent" because if you scramble up the

315
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,360
 words of "Stendec," it's an anagram of "descent."

316
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,920
 But people would go, "That's not how Morris Code works."

317
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,240
 Morris Code is not...

318
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
 It doesn't work like that.

319
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,640
 Like if you would have to seriously mess up your Morris Code rather than spell something

320
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,720
 wrong to get it that way, you had a bunch of...

321
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,120
 And someone goes, "Let's say he did make an error and was trying to write "descent"

322
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,360
 and typed in "Stendec."

323
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
 He would have had to make the error multiple times.

324
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
 And this guy was a trained veteran of aircraft.

325
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,960
 So the fact that he's making the same mistake over and over again doesn't correct himself.

326
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
 That is the thing.

327
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,720
 People came forward and said, "We think it's an anagram for something."

328
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:28,040
 We had "Severe turbulence encountered, now descending, emergency crash landing."

329
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,840
 People said that that is a World War II phrase.

330
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,040
 However, others have said that is not a common phrase.

331
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,720
 If it was used at all, definitely wasn't a phrase that if you used it, you would not

332
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,480
 assume someone else to know because it would be fairly obscure.

333
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,760
 Also, he said, "1745, like, I'm going...

334
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,200
 ETA were landing in four minutes, then why would he say, 'We're crashing, we're crashing,

335
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
 we're crashing.'"

336
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,760
 The other one was, "Stardust tank empty, no diesel, expect crash."

337
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,240
 People were like, "Why would you make up an acronym that the first letter is the name

338
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
 of your plane?"

339
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,840
 You would really be assuming, like, that's just...

340
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
 It doesn't make sense.

341
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,040
 But people were really trying to come up with anything that Stendec could mean.

342
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,600
 Because it was the last clue of what happened to the ship.

343
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,680
 There's another version of Stendec means, "Santiago Tower, even navigator, doesn't exactly

344
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 know."

345
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
 What?

346
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
 I mean, now you're just making stuff up.

347
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,160
 Plus, Stendec's ends with a C, so you're just kind of making stuff up at this point.

348
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,040
 The point is, is that there's a lot of theories of what Stendec meant.

349
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,400
 Nobody could ever figure it out.

350
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,360
 And then the mystery gets weirder.

351
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,520
 I said earlier this was a British Airways plane.

352
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,440
 This plane went missing in 1947.

353
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,160
 1948, the British Airlines plane, Star Tiger, vanishes mid-flight.

354
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:58,360
 1949, British Airways Star Aerial, vanishes in mid-flight.

355
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,960
 Some people thought that the company itself was being sabotaged, running some sort of

356
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,680
 insurance scam.

357
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 Who knows?

358
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,200
 But, Star Tiger disappeared a year later.

359
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,560
 Star Aerial disappeared a year after that.

360
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,080
 Both of those planes disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle.

361
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,800
 And we're some of the earliest planes that went missing in that area that started the

362
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,480
 story of the Bermuda Triangle.

363
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,480
 Passenger planes flying over this area, vanishing off the face of the earth.

364
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,520
 So now you have one airline that's lost three planes in three years disappeared completely.

365
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,720
 What does Stendec mean?

366
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,360
 A UFO magazine in Argentina went by the name Stendec.

367
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,280
 I don't know if they're still around, but the word Stendec became so synonymous with

368
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,680
 a fortian or mysterious activities that it became shorthand for it.

369
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,280
 Three planes go missing, all owned by the same company.

370
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,920
 Two over the Bermuda Triangle, really at the start of that whole story.

371
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,000
 One over the Andes.

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,960
 Fifty-one years later, 1998, these two mountaineers are climbing up Mount Topungato.

373
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,520
 It's a giant glacier.

374
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,680
 One of the tallest mountains in the America.

375
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,600
 You've left my notes I got off Wikipedia.

376
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,120
 They're mountaineering, they're walking around up in the snow.

377
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,560
 Stick in the ground, stick in the ground, stick in the ground, stick in the what?

378
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,480
 Piece of clothing up on this mountain.

379
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 What?

380
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
 I thought we were the first ones up here.

381
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 Oh man.

382
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,280
 Look at it, someone's jacket.

383
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,720
 Hey, Gus, over here.

384
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,600
 It's an engine buried in the snow.

385
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,120
 They report it, but it's at the top of the mountain.

386
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
 So what are you going to do?

387
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,320
 Two years later in the year 2000, Argentinian army goes up there.

388
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,480
 Start looking around, poking around.

389
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
 They find a propeller.

390
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,000
 They find plane wheels.

391
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,320
 They find human torsos preserved in the ice.

392
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,240
 DNA sent and tested, matched against relatives.

393
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,080
 These were the remains of the people of Stardust.

394
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,520
 So this is the theory.

395
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
 The plane was flying.

396
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
 They thought it had clearance.

397
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,840
 It smashed right into the side of the mountain.

398
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
 Caused an avalanche.

399
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,560
 Because they went looking for the plane.

400
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,080
 They weren't just like, "Oh, it's six minutes late.

401
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,320
 It was four minutes ago."

402
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,880
 "Oh well, it's then deck."

403
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
 They went looking for the plane.

404
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
 They couldn't find it.

405
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,040
 The plane, they believe, hit the mountain head on and then caused an avalanche, which

406
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,480
 completely buried it.

407
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,840
 And as the over the next 51 years, the snow was settling and moving down the mountain,

408
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,760
 the debris was actually going down the mountain as well.

409
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,240
 Getting exposed, snow melting, stuff like that.

410
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
 And that was that, right?

411
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,880
 It's interesting to think, you wonder if anyone survived.

412
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,280
 That's kind of grim, but I wonder if anyone survived the impact.

413
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,760
 And they just kind of had to live in an iceberg for a while.

414
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 And then you just kind of die.

415
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,080
 You just kind of die at a certain point.

416
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
 You're like, "I wonder if..."

417
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
 I mean, again, that's kind of grim.

418
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
 But it's like, you could live for a while.

419
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,640
 People lived in igloos and stuff like that.

420
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,920
 Of course, igloos don't fly at 700 miles an hour and crash into stuff.

421
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,560
 I mean, igloos, people build them and then go inside of them.

422
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,600
 They don't fly and smash.

423
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
 Everyone would turn everyone into jelly.

424
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,600
 But if you survived the initial impact, I bet you you could hang out in that glacier

425
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,400
 for a while and just hang it out.

426
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
 I don't know.

427
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,440
 You'd have a great standard of living.

428
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,320
 You're underneath 30 feet of ice.

429
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,800
 I guess your oxygen would be...

430
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,880
 But anyways, maybe someone tunneled their way out.

431
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,080
 Maybe someone tunneled their way out into the great Nazi utopia that's underneath the

432
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
 Andes.

433
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
 They're like, "Oh, welcome.

434
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
 Welcome here.

435
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,960
 Thank you for bringing Hitler's, the rest of Hitler's brain."

436
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,640
 Yes, my masters, the Nazi mole people.

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,680
 But for the most part, I think that they probably all died.

438
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,080
 And I don't think it's controversial saying that.

439
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,400
 That they all died on impact.

440
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Horrible.

441
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,880
 After 51 years, they finally did have an answer to one part of the puzzle.

442
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
 The plane crashed.

443
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,600
 It didn't disappear off the face of the Earth.

444
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,560
 But to this day, nobody knows what "stend deck" means.

445
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,440
 People are still trying to figure it out.

446
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,360
 Just because you found the remains of a plane doesn't necessarily mean you can discount

447
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 alien intervention.

448
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,680
 If you went to the bottom of the Bermuda Triangle and you found every boat and plane that had

449
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,360
 crashed in there, it doesn't mean everyone was a bad pilot or it was a bad pilot.

450
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,080
 That stormy day that day is just a graveyard.

451
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,400
 It'd be the equivalent of if somebody went missing and then you found them dead later,

452
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,240
 you're not going to think, "Oh, maybe they just happened to have a heart attack."

453
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,400
 The same time they were missing.

454
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,680
 You're going to start looking for suspects over who caused them to go missing or who

455
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,960
 may have caused them to crash.

456
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,680
 Now the most likely scenario is you're just crashing into a mountain.

457
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,400
 It was foggy, it was stormy, couldn't really see, crashing into a mountain.

458
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
 Everyone died.

459
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,440
 An interesting mystery with a possible, easy answer.

460
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,280
 Plane crash.

461
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
 Everyone died.

462
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
 And if it wasn't for those mountaineers on that particular day, we probably would have

463
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
 gone another 20 years without finding out what happened to Stardust.

464
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,920
 But then you look at the other things.

465
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:22,480
 Three planes missing, three years, all from the same company, two over the perimeter triangle.

466
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,800
 We may have found the wreckage of the Stardust, but will we ever find an answer to that ill-fated

467
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,040
 plane's last words?

468
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,240
 Stendec.

469
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,200
