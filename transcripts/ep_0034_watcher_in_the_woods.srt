1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 Will the world end on July 27th? And just when you thought conspiracy theories couldn't get any

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,560
 dumber, we delve into Jewish swim lessons today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:20,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,840
 Carpenter. Hope you guys are having a great day. I am. You know what's funny? I was listening back

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
 to the previous episode of the Ageless Travel one. I was like, "Oh, I'm so excited to

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,280
 find all this stuff." And I realized that unless you knew about the Ageless Travel conspiracy

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,400
 theory mystery before it, you're like, "What is this lunatic talking about? Why is he so happy

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,040
 about this?" But I know the fanbase of the show is kind of split, and it's crazy to think there's

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,360
 a fanbase, but the fanbase of the show is kind of split in two. They're the people who are really into

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
 collecting information on wacky conspiracy theories. And there are other people who just

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,200
 like hearing the occasional odd story. And I hope that kind of played into both of those.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,200
 But again, I definitely had a lot of fun researching that. So we do have a couple good

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,720
 stories for you tonight. One story I think is going to be entertaining just because of how

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,280
 frustrated I was once I found out exactly what I was looking into. Actually, you know, it's funny.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,600
 I think both of these stories kind of frustrate me on different levels, on different levels.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,280
 I don't like end-of-the-world prophecies. I think they can be fairly dangerous to people who aren't

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,360
 of a level mind. And that's the blood moon thing. And then the Jewish swim lessons, when we get

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,480
 into that, that's just, that's enough. That's enough of that. It's interesting too. So, you know,

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,760
 on this podcast we talk about conspiracy. It seems to be mostly conspiracy stuff,

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,440
 secondly, some paranormal stuff, cover a little bit of true crime. And I do think those things

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,080
 kind of intersect. Another subject that I like to talk about, we haven't talked about much on the

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,280
 show, is weird science. It's like high science, like kind of a cutting edge of things. I really

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,480
 like that topic. Killer robots, you know, nanobots. I was watching a video today about something

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,800
 called graphene. It's supposedly this super light, yeah, super durable material. And I was like,

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,000
 "Okay, I've never heard of that before. That's really good." You know, the thing though that I

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,720
 come across a lot is transhumanism. So transhumanism is the evolution of mankind. The next stage is

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,600
 not going to be a biological evolution, but it is going to be a technical evolution. You know,

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:27,120
 so we're going to have things like bionic eyes, robotic legs. I don't know if necessarily exoskeletons

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
 count. That might be like a bridge, but you know, it's kind of like a Johnny Mnemonic thing, where

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
 you have like a chip in your brain, you plug a port, you have like a port on your neck, and you

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
 stick a cable in there, and you can, you know, download the internet, internet in like a minute,

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,960
 into your brain, which sounds like a nightmare. Like honestly, I don't want all that information

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,840
 in my brain. The one thing, it's funny, they always talk about these transhumanism things,

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,280
 like to reach the next level of ascension, we put this little chip in your brain, and it will allow

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,360
 you to, you know, maximize the use of your brain or whatever nonsense, or you know, they can do this,

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,240
 you know, electronic hearing. You know what I want more than anything that no one's ever talked about?

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,120
 I want a robotic butthole. That would sell me on transhumanism. You tell me you want to put a chip

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,520
 in my brain, I'm thinking, what about the privacy implications? Is it something that can be hacked

39
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,160
 into? Does it send out some sort of signal? Is it a tracking signal? You tell me, hey Jason,

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'm going to put a valve where your butthole used to be. So whenever you have any like problems going

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,840
 to the bathroom, like you got the flu, or you're having just general issues,

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,640
 there's like a release valve. It's like a bionic butthole. And because it gets sore,

43
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,840
 it gets sore when you have diarrhea. And like you don't want to, you're like, I don't want to say

44
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,320
 you don't want to wipe. You obviously have to wipe, but it gets sore, and then you got to get those

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,640
 soft baby wipes, the medicated ones sometimes. It would totally prevent hemorrhoids, it would

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,720
 totally prevent a lot of issues with IBS. I think you might need to have like a robotic

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,160
 intestine for that. But yeah, and it's just like a little valve and you could hold it forever.

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,920
 You're like, oh man, I really need to go to the bathroom, but we're like 50 miles away in the

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,280
 woods because we went to Ong's Hat and got lost. Oh, I don't have to worry about it. I have a release

50
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,680
 valve that'll just stay locked. And then eventually you find a bathroom and you just hit a button and

51
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,280
 it all comes out. And there's no like pressure, nothing. That's what needs to be done. You know,

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,480
 and that's the thing, a lot of times with high science, there's a lot of like hoity-toity stuff.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,200
 They always want to, especially transhumanism, they kind of blend the quasi mystical with the

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,440
 technology and talk about like, this is the next evolution. No man, just give me a robotic butthole

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,880
 and call it a. I'm totally fine with that. Totally fine with that. You get the key, you know, I'm on

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,040
 that keto and one of the side effects when you started off, because I went off of it,

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
 because I had to go to a party and, you know, I wanted to enjoy myself, but one of the,

58
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,760
 one of the side effects when you first started is what they call keto flu. So you have a bit of

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,360
 diarrhea and it hurts, man. It hurts after, you know, like having diarrhea for the third time in a

60
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,960
 day, you're like, oh man, I'm sitting on the toilet the other day and I was thinking, I wish that I

61
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,880
 just had like a little button I could press and it just came out. So work on that transhumans.

62
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,600
 I think you'll win over a lot of people if you can make it more mundane. No one wants to chip in

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,120
 their head except for a bunch of nerds. Nobody wants that. So we're coming up to the, to the red moon,

64
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,480
 blood moon, blood moon, not red moon, we're coming up to the blood moon. So whether it is it's a

65
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,600
 lunar eclipse where this, I don't have to explain a lunar eclipse to you, but anyway, so the moon

66
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,560
 is turning red. So this was a big deal back in 2014 when they were going to have four blood moons.

67
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,720
 They had one in April 15th, one on October 8th, and then April 4th to 2015 and September 28th to

68
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,920
 2015. And people are saying this is going to be the, this is how they always get away with it.

69
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,000
 The headlines always say the end of the world, the end of the world. And when you talk to the

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,280
 prophets, I'm doing air quotes and you can't see that because I'm on a podcast, but when you talk

71
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,800
 to the prophets, they go, oh no, no, no, this is the start of the end times. This is just the

72
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,600
 beginning. So nothing will change. You will notice exactly nothing. There will be no difference from

73
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,200
 today versus tomorrow because it's just starting. That's always how they get around this because

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,480
 if you, you know, when you have people who go, nope, the rapture is taking place this day and

75
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,000
 the next day passes and there's no rapture, then you have egg on your face or egg lists on your face,

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,720
 but, or sack on your face. Sorry if you didn't give those references. Those are all from the last

77
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,040
 episode. I shouldn't assume everyone listens to every episode, but you say, oh no, no, no, it's

78
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,760
 just the start. So anyways, these, this prophecy, this bunch of prophets came out back in 2014,

79
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,160
 2015, saying that this was the start of the end of the world. There was a book written called

80
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,920
 Four Blood Moons explaining the whole thing by I think a minister named Hagi Hagi. And he,

81
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,720
 it was a best seller. People were spending this, spending their harder under money

82
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,160
 buying this stupid book, making him a millionaire. And then nothing happened, but again, it's just

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,840
 the start. And now we're back to this again because we're having another blood moon. And again, this

84
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,680
 is another sign that the world is ending. So now this is a different minister. His name's Paul Begley,

85
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,320
 Begley. And again, he's saying July 27th is not the end of the world, but it is a sign of the

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,280
 end times because you are already in the end times. Well then, if we're already in the end times, why

87
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,000
 do we need a sign? The blood moon is a natural event. It looks scary. And I know in the Bible it

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,880
 says that the sun will go as black as sackcloth and the moon will turn blood red. And that's part

89
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,640
 of the prophecy that's listed a couple different times. Here, here's the thing. Those are really vague

90
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,680
 prophecies for a reason because you're not supposed to know when the end of the world is coming to.

91
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,360
 A lot of the prophecies had to do with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem. The

92
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:22,160
 Bible itself is, the Old Testament is a religious history of the Jewish people. And it is a cornerstone

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,240
 of their faith. They don't call it the Bible, but the Torah. Then the New Testament is basically the

94
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,360
 sequel where Jesus shows up and says, "Forget all the old rules. Just follow me. I'll get you in

95
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,680
 heaven. You guys are cool. Let's do this." Now, Jesus also talked a lot about the end times. A

96
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,240
 lot of people misconstrue that because he talks about the end times are going to happen in his

97
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,200
 generation. And honestly, I was confused by that because I thought, wait a second, Jesus saying the

98
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,480
 end time is going to happen in his generation. I'm obviously not in his generation. But again,

99
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
 when I've the more looked into that, in reference to the basically end times of the Jewish people

100
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,560
 and the destruction of the temple and all of these things. So a lot of these events pointed

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,160
 towards historical things that were historical to us. It was the future to them. The reason why

102
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,120
 this stuff is dangerous is because people, not you guys. I get that the people who listen to

103
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,520
 this podcast, I think I have a very smart audience. And the reason why you've stuck with the show

104
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,000
 is because I'm not telling you, I'll tell you which ones I think are true, which conspiracies I

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,040
 think are true, but I'm not going to present the Titanic conspiracy. Actually, no, I did

106
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,640
 think that one was true. I'm not going to present all these conspiracy theories to you and say,

107
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
 "Oh, no, you got to believe this. You got to believe that." I think you guys are fairly smart. And I

108
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,720
 think that as you listen to the show, you kind of know the angle of it. If it's debunkable,

109
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,040
 it gets debunked, no matter how interesting the story is. But there's a lot of people out there

110
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,600
 who aren't like you. The majority of people aren't like you, where these things terrify them.

111
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:08,400
 Terrify them. These prophecies can be life ruining to us. It's a funny story. Oh, those crazy nutbags

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,080
 thinking the world's going to end. So there was that minister, Harold Camping, who years ago

113
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,160
 was trying to tell people. He believed that on May 21, 2011, so we're talking way far back, really,

114
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,000
 he believed that the rapture is going to happen. And people are freaking out about this. One man

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,680
 spent $150,000 of his money buying billboards, telling people to repent. And you may think,

116
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,720
 "Well, that guy's an idiot." And he is. But that's the problem, is that he was an idiot with $150,000

117
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,960
 and he wasted it on the—not saying that trying to convert people to your religion is a waste,

118
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,040
 but trying to tell people it's the end of the world and it not happening,

119
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,360
 it's just foolish. Now, him spending his money is really the least of our worries.

120
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
 You have incidents like this, when people are selling these into the world things,

121
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,760
 it terrifies people. I remember listening to Coast to Coast AM back before 2012. I think I actually

122
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,040
 had downloaded some of the podcasts or some of the recordings they had after the event.

123
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,520
 And George Norrie was taking phone calls and he was getting calls from people being like,

124
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,560
 "Oh yeah, me and my buddies are out here. We're having a good time. We're just going to drink

125
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,080
 and see if the Mayan gods show up to stomp us all." And George Norrie would be like, "Well,

126
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,520
 you know, have fun." And he'd get in call. "Oh, I don't believe in any of this stuff,

127
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,640
 but it sure is fun to hear about it." And George Norrie's like, "Oh, that's great."

128
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
 Someone else called up and said, "You know what? Since this is the last night alive,

129
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
 I'm going to start doing heroin. I'm going to shoot up a bunch of heroin,

130
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
 because what's the point?" And I've always been curious about it.

131
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,200
 George Norrie's like, "Don't—that's not a good course of action to do." "Oh, you know,

132
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,400
 I'm not—I don't know. I probably won't do it." And it could have been a troll call,

133
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,000
 but it could have actually been a legit thing. You think the world's going to end and you've

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,880
 always been curious about heroin. Why not? Another caller said that he was feeling so close to the

135
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,040
 universe because he knew the universe was going to end and he could feel space and time bending

136
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:12,080
 as the world was about to be destroyed by the Mayan gods, that he felt himself drawn to his roof

137
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,080
 where he was then going to fly away. And at this point, George Norrie's getting a little panicked,

138
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,640
 because basically what the guy is telling him is that he is going to accidentally commit suicide.

139
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,600
 And he's like, "No, don't do that. Don't do that." Whatever, you know, George Norrie, he gets a lot

140
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,560
 of crazy people on his show, and he always—the one thing I like about Costa Coase is that he's

141
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,440
 generally very like open. He kind of lets people say what they want to say and doesn't question them

142
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,520
 too much. He'll ask questions, but he doesn't question their beliefs too much. But you could

143
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,320
 tell at this point he was like, "No, I have to do something. Like this guy might actually jump off

144
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:58,720
 of a building." So, how many people killed themselves in the run-up to 2012 because they were scared?

145
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,280
 There was a small increase. There was like 2,000 extra suicides in the year of 2012,

146
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:11,520
 than there was the year before. I think it was like 38,000. I had looked it up earlier,

147
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,040
 and I think in 2012 it was 40,000. So, you know, that's just the United States. And you know,

148
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:26,320
 people at one point, the government of, I believe it was Mexico, had to block off access to a mountain

149
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,200
 because they got wind that a cult was going to go up there and kill themselves on December 21st,

150
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,240
 the day that the world was supposed to end. So, these things, yes, they sell books and

151
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,320
 they're clickbait, but they can really cause damage. They can really cause damage. That's why

152
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,360
 I hate stories like this. I hate stories like this. No, the world is not going to end on July 27th.

153
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,720
 No, the start of the end of the world is not going to happen on July 27th, and we're not in

154
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,240
 already the start of the end of the world. Whenever someone brings this up, you just got to be like,

155
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,160
 man, like, you got to call them out like you would call out a flat earther and just ask them to back

156
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
 it up. Well, my minister said, and to be fair, most ministers think this is nonsense. What I think

157
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,200
 is interesting was we had 2012 and that was a Mayan prophecy, and we have a lot of prophecies

158
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,080
 about Christian, the end of the world of Christians, but there was a story I read a long time ago,

159
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,840
 and I don't know how true it is, but so there is the Muslim version of that, of the end of the

160
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:35,440
 world mythology story. And when Ahmadinejad, President Ahmadinejad of Iran, when he was first

161
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,320
 elected, he went to a well and he wrote on a scroll and him and the other people around,

162
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:49,040
 he dropped the scroll down the well. And what apparently that ritual is, it's to summon their

163
00:14:49,040 --> 00:15:00,480
 version of like the purging force of the planet. It was basically summoning up some sort of mystical

164
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,640
 force to help Iran purge the world of the non-believers and to accelerate the end of the world.

165
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,400
 Christians do it too. They're always trying to build the temple because Jesus can't return until the

166
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,240
 third temple is built, so there's always constantly a right-wing Christian's trying to raise money to

167
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,000
 rebuild the temple. It's odd that these people want to accelerate the end of the world and ISIS is

168
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,560
 the same way. The ISIS ideology is to get the Western nations into Iraq that didn't really work

169
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,880
 out for them, to have the Western nations move into Iraq and just get annihilated by them. And

170
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,560
 through all that bloodshed, they would, it was a religious cult that had state power. That was the

171
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,080
 odd thing about ISIS, and I'm talking about them in the past tense because they are pretty much

172
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,160
 past tense of this time. They would be the equivalent of Westboro Baptist Church took over

173
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,800
 one-third of a country. That was what ISIS was. We'd always think of them as this terrorist force,

174
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,840
 but they were a terrorist force with the end of the world doomsday cult. It was basically Waco

175
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,040
 Meats, the Westboro Baptist Church, Meats Al-Qaeda. And that's what made them dangerous,

176
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,600
 but they've been annihilated for now. They may pop up with another name or something like that,

177
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,080
 but they're just getting destroyed, which is good, which is good. And we didn't have to send

178
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,600
 in tons of troops. We have things called airplanes, which they pretty much lack. So don't worry about

179
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,280
 the blood moon, and I don't really think any of you were. I just had to vent about that because

180
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,520
 that really makes me mad. Another story that makes me mad. And I guess it really shouldn't make me mad,

181
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,200
 but this is again, this was one of the requests I've been getting. What are Jewish swim lessons?

182
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,560
 What are Jewish swim lessons? It took me a while to find it, and after my success of finding about

183
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,520
 Aiglis Travel and the Belray Surge and the Despair Code, I'd been pretty much batting a thousand

184
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,000
 up until this, and I did find it. So I mean, I guess that's okay, but it was okay.

185
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,320
 So the Jewish swim lessons is three little words. It's on the conspiracy chart. It can be traced back

186
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,320
 to a poll thread on 4chan. So that's the politically incorrect board. So you can kind of see where this

187
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,480
 is going. It should be kind of implied with the Jewish swim lessons, but I'm going to go ahead and

188
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:25,040
 read this to you. Well, because I can't even, I couldn't say anything this stupid myself. While

189
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:32,400
 on the Poconos, I noticed camp after camp or Jewish, over 70% by my sincere estimation in northeast

190
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,560
 Pennsylvania are Jewish. I started pondering what the reason was because Jews do not seem to be very

191
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,640
 interested in normal outdoor sports, nor do they seem to spend their resources very often on amusement

192
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,080
 parks and things along those lines. Okay, disclaimer, I don't believe that Jews have a problem with

193
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,200
 outdoor sports. That's a weird stereotype. I think that's someone who's never met Jewish

194
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
 person. Don't they, they have Olympic teams. Actually, I know they have Olympic teams because

195
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,520
 one of them got shot up in Munich. But anyway, so according to him, not me, according to him,

196
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,600
 Jewish people do not like sports, even though they play every single sport available. So he goes on,

197
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,560
 and so he comes to that conclusion. First off, he's like, all these camps are Jewish, like 70%

198
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:27,520
 of the kids in these camps are Jewish. And why Jewish kids don't like sports? What's going on?

199
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:34,400
 Okay, okay, so I get it. It's a stereotype, whatever. Now he has that conclusion. Now we're

200
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:42,720
 going to go into the next step. I was then telepathically connected to a Hasidic Jew.

201
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,080
 That is one sentence I thought I would never read.

202
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:56,800
 Okay, he continues, I started asking questions. I suppose you are programming the children there,

203
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:06,080
 he mentally nodded, yes. How somebody mentally nods, okay, okay. Okay, so back to the letter,

204
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,480
 back to the letter. I continued, I suppose at some point that you sacrifice a child there,

205
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,400
 program them, and then lock it in with sexual abuses thereafter by the staff. He stated something

206
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,520
 along the lines of bingo. I asked how could I catch them in this? The response was that the

207
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,880
 ritual sacrifice must be real or maybe operating in a virtualized state, yet the sexual abuse is

208
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,920
 often real. I suppose that they refer to these camps cryptically when they talk about camps,

209
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:41,360
 and people presume they are referring to the Hala hoax. So I guess now he's, okay. So now he's

210
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,760
 saying that whenever they talk about, oh, I guess now he's saying that whenever they talk about

211
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,200
 Nazi death camps, they're actually referring to camps in northeast Pennsylvania, apparently.

212
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,560
 Hala hoax, if you don't know, is a term, derogatory term for the Holocaust, because these people

213
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,520
 claim that the Holocaust never happened. And then he goes on to say, interestingly enough,

214
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,320
 interestingly enough, the solution may be to camp out on these camps from the beginning

215
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,600
 to the end with cameras in the trees that can monitor the camps for any group programming

216
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,640
 session. So what we have here, I'm assuming this is a man. I think people generally assume that

217
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,080
 when people are online are their same sex that they are. But I'm going to assume this is a guy.

218
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,280
 So what this guy is saying is that he, someone, he realized that 70% of the people who go to

219
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:38,800
 the camps in his area are Jewish. Then he is hanging out at his house or walking down the street or

220
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:50,800
 doing whatever. And he hears a Hasidic Jew in his head saying, well, actually, no, he starts

221
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,080
 asking questions. So imagine that you're hanging out and then all of a sudden you hear a voice in

222
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,680
 your head and somehow you're able to determine its ethnicity and religion. The first thing you do

223
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,840
 is start asking questions about, hey, what are you doing with kids in those camps? And then it

224
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,200
 mentally nods yes to your questions. And then you ask and it's like, well, we kill them, but we

225
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,000
 don't really kill them. But the sexual abuse is real. And this guy's having this whole conversation

226
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,960
 in his head. And then he decides the next step is to go to these camps and install cameras

227
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,440
 all around the camp to record young boys and girls in the woods.

228
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:35,040
 That's Jewish swim lessons. Because they're at the camp and they're engaging in swimming and,

229
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:44,720
 I don't know, lacrosse and making bracelets to send back home. This is where googling those

230
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,720
 three words led me to the rantings of an obviously mentally ill and racist man.

231
00:21:50,720 --> 00:22:00,000
 These swim lessons are used to program children. Here's my question, actually. Why would they do

232
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,080
 it to if the Jewish people in his mind, not mine, I have to keep distancing myself from that.

233
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,360
 If Jewish people in his mind are torturing kids, why would they do it to other Jewish kids?

234
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,080
 That doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't you do it to people that you felt were unworthy?

235
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,160
 I mean, I guess like Catholic priests, molest cast the Catholic boys, but they're not trying to

236
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,080
 program them or necessarily torture them. They're just trying to get their rocks off.

237
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
 This is supposedly some ritual thing. And I'm going to say right now, this isn't true.

238
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:40,560
 None of this is true. I hope that goes without saying. But it's like, what's the point? And

239
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,280
 this question gets asked all the time. I've seen it online. People have asked me about the show.

240
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,720
 Hey, do Jewish swim lessons, do Jewish swim lessons. I found it. It's ridiculous. It's made up.

241
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:02,160
 It's very racist. And this guy is out there putting cameras up in trees and

242
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:13,600
 he actually gives you links to find Jewish camps in Pennsylvania. So you can be part of his

243
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,720
 underground resistance against the quote unquote swim lessons that are really used to program

244
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:27,600
 these kids. So out of this guy's post, it's posted January of 2017. So over a year ago,

245
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,280
 out of this post came Jewish swim lessons on the conspiracy board. Out of this guy's ranteens,

246
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,960
 it's now been solidified as a legitimate conspiracy theory. But I hope I was able to shed a little

247
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,040
 bit of light on it for you because you'll see people go, "Hey, what's Jewish swim lessons?"

248
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,280
 And now, what do you do? You can share my link and say, "This is what it is. It's the ranteens of

249
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,040
 an idiot." Not the podcast host. Well, he's kind of out of it too, but it's the ranteens of this

250
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,880
 idiot on this board and so on and so forth. You know, I always like to say this. I thank you so

251
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,400
 much for listening to the show. You can always hit me up at DeadRabbitRadio and gmail.com.

252
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:16,240
 We're at Twitter @JasonOCarpenter, at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio. Is there for you to follow us

253
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,520
 on that as well? I didn't mention it last time, but again, I want to thank you, Ash Black, for

254
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,360
 doing our logo art. It looks amazing. Like I said, it's on my phone. It's on my wallpaper.

255
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,680
 You know, I'm trying to spread that. We're going to be putting on flyers soon and everything like

256
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,880
 that. If you like the show, subscribe it and share it. Share the show. I've actually seen some

257
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,080
 people already do that online. People asked, "What's Michigan Blue Hell?" And somebody posted

258
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,240
 one of my YouTube videos about that. So thank you. Thank you for that. That's how the show grows.

259
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,320
 That's how we keep the momentum going. This is the Daily Paranormal Conspiracy and True Crime

260
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,200
 podcast. Thanks for listening today. You don't have to listen to every episode, but thank you for

261
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,000
 listening to today's episode. Tomorrow we are going to be back with another ridiculous conspiracy

262
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,640
 theory. Tomorrow we're going to come back with another ridiculous conspiracy theory. All this

263
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,880
 week, I really like the stories we have. I really like the stories we have. The Blood Moon 1 has just

264
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,200
 kind of fell in my lap because it's in the news right now. But you see people talking about it

265
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,280
 just say, "Hey, how many end of the worlds have we lived through? We're still here. We're going to be

266
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:27,920
 here on the 28th. We're going to be here on 2025, you know, July 28th. We're going to be here in 3000,

267
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:34,480
 July 28th. The world is not going to end because there's a lunar eclipse. We're not cavemen. Just

268
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,040
 remind them of that. I will see you back tomorrow night. I have a great night and thanks for hopping

269
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:51,920
 in. Is that a good outro? I don't know. I might keep that. Bye.
