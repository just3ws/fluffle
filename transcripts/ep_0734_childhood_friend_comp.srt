1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 What would you do to gain superpowers?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,880
 And then we take a look at one of the things we cherish most, our memories.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,860
 But what if we're not remembering our life, but someone else?

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,760
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:28,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
 I'm your host Jason Carvener, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,600
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,800
 I hope you had a fun weekend, hope it was very, very relaxing for you.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,520
 But if not, we're going to do our best to make this week really cool and relaxing for you.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,560
 First off, barreling into Dead Rabbit Command, it's our newest Patreon supporter, Cannon.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
 Get it?

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
 Barrel Cannon, get it?

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,880
 As I'm nudging you in the ribs, you're like, "Yeah, that was terrible."

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,000
 Slightly better than your other puns.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,960
 Cannon, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,280
 You guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too, I totally understand it.

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,720
 Just help spread the word about this show really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,040
 Cannon, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgival.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,920
 Take us up, up and away, we are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,120
 We are heading on out to India.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,200
 I think it's every little kid's dream to be a superhero.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,120
 And you go, "No Jason, that's a modern invention."

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,360
 And you know, I would actually say, I'm sure like little dudes, like little Greek dudes,

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,520
 were like, "Man, I want to be Hercules someday.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,640
 I wish my mom got boned by a giant bull or a Minotaur or whatever Hercules showed up."

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,840
 I wish that my mom was deceived in having sex with some sort of goat monster.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,280
 And then I could have been Hercules.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,880
 I think even if you go way far back, I'm sure there were like Jewish settlers, you were like,

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,600
 "Oh dude, maybe if I look in the arc of the covenant, I'll be okay.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,760
 Maybe it'll give me superpowers and I'll fly around."

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,600
 Because we have stories of heroes going all the way back to Gilgamesh, people walking

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,160
 around doing fantastic things.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,080
 And I'm sure kids and some adults, a lot of adults probably, were reading those books

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,160
 going if only.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,000
 If only I was sentenced to push a boulder up a hill for all time.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,400
 I would be able to do it.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
 I'm strong enough.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,640
 I think being a superhero is universal.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,960
 It's not because of the Marvel movies, not because of the DC movies, not even because

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,760
 comic books.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,640
 Being a superhuman just has a nice ring to it.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,520
 So we're in India now and we noticed that the streets are kind of empty.

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,520
 People are running into their houses, shutting the doors and the dirgeables just floating

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
 overhead.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
 And we see this bank getting robbed.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,320
 This dude's coming out of the bank and he's like, "No one will stop me.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,640
 My name's Dynamite Hands."

48
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,240
 And he's like throwing dynamite and blowing a bunch of stuff up.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,760
 And the cops are like, "Well, that's not really super power.

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,960
 That's just you being able to afford a lot of dynamite."

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,280
 And I throw his dynamite at the cops too.

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,920
 And then another criminal runs out of the bank and he goes, "I'm slither.

53
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
 I'm going to slither around."

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,200
 He's just slithering around.

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,720
 The cops are like, "That might even be a worse superpower."

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,840
 But they're trying to shoot him and he's slithering so fast the bullets are going right over him.

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,640
 The easily killed dynamite hands.

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
 He is dead bleeding out in the street.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,760
 But then all of a sudden this dude shows up.

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,640
 15 year old boy just appears from the shadows and he's slinking along.

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,200
 And they go, "Whoa, dude.

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
 He's moving all super weird and stuff.

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
 What's up with his legs?"

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,840
 And that's when they realize this boy, no, this man, is made of mercury.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,960
 And he's like sliding through the streets and he's like beating up slither or whatever

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
 that guy's name was.

67
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,160
 He's like, "Take this snake face punch, punch."

68
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,920
 And the guy ties immediately of mercury poisoning.

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,600
 And he's like, "Once again, mercury man is here to save the entire country of India.

70
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,240
 No crimes too small or too big."

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,360
 I mean, this is a continent-sized country full of 1.1 billion people.

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,600
 But somehow mercury man will be here no matter what.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,440
 And the cops start cheering and mercury man goes to give him high fives and the cops are

74
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 like, "No, no, we don't want to die horribly."

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,200
 Then we realize this is just a dream sequence.

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,240
 And we're standing in a trauma center and mercury man in real life is a 15 year old

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:20,240
 boy, a 15 year old boy on a gurney going, "Ahhh, the pain, the pain."

78
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,800
 This story's been running around the internet for about a day or two.

79
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,080
 It's quite amusing.

80
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
 And it's true.

81
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,240
 Like this is a story when I first saw I go, "This must be from the Daily Star or something.

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,440
 This has to just be fake."

83
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,360
 The National Center for Biotechnology Information.

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
 It's a real group.

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,120
 They have a real medical newsletter and they recently reported this.

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,840
 And because it's a medical journal, they leave out a bunch of information.

87
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,880
 So you can't go and dox this guy or show his arch enemy Lord Voltrom.

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,680
 It can't show up and destroy his family.

89
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,640
 In India there's a 15 year old boy who wants superpowers and who doesn't.

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,120
 That's what we were saying about in that intro.

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,600
 And he's a fan of the X-Men who isn't.

92
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,040
 X-Men are totally dope.

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,400
 And he goes, "You know what?

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,760
 So Wolverine, he's pretty awesome.

95
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,280
 He has metal bones."

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,720
 And then there's this other character who I wasn't aware of.

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,480
 I love comic books but I haven't been able to read him for a long time.

98
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,640
 There's another character known as Mercury.

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,800
 Kind of World War Hulk.

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
 She fought Belasco and Limbo.

101
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,200
 I had to look all this stuff up.

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,800
 She survived M-Day which was when Scarlet Witch said, "No more mutants."

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,640
 And there was only 198 mutants left.

104
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
 I read up till about then.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
 But I was unfamiliar with Mercury.

106
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,520
 I did some research on her.

107
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,040
 Her main thing is she's a shapeshifter.

108
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,840
 She's liquid metal and her body's like Mercury.

109
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,180
 So this young boy, let's call him Terry, living in India, he dreams of being a superhero.

110
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
 So what he does?

111
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,980
 He goes, "I can't work in a gamma-radiated lab.

112
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,960
 I probably walked down the street and fallen into some sewage.

113
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,600
 That turned into the Toxic Avenger."

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 No.

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,980
 I want to be like Mercury or maybe some metal-coated bone.

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:04,720
 So what he did was he broke open a thermometer and put the Mercury in a hypodermic needle

117
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
 and injected it into his body.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,360
 He goes, "Ahh!

119
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,220
 That hurts way more than I thought it would.

120
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,980
 Then he wakes up the next day and he tries to make Mercury hands show up.

121
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,220
 Nothing."

122
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,260
 So a week or two passed and he goes, "You know what?

123
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,900
 You know what my good buddy, Spider-Man, once told me?

124
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,300
 Don't stop injecting yourself with Mercury."

125
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,420
 So he took another thermometer, broke it up, put the Mercury in a hypodermic needle.

126
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,800
 Oh my god, this hurts.

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,360
 This hurts more than the first time.

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,800
 They say with great pain comes great powers and Spider-Man's like, "That's not the motto."

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,040
 He still has no Mercury powers at this point, so he's like, "Well, luckily this family

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,640
 owns a third thermometer."

131
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,120
 He breaks that thermometer open, injects it into his arm.

132
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,040
 At this point, two months have gone by and he realizes he has no superpowers.

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,300
 Professor X is not showing up to him, and technically he wouldn't be a mutant because

134
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,260
 he would be considered an altered human, but that's just quibbling.

135
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,460
 The fact of the matter is he has a non-healing ulcer in his arm and the pain is unbearable.

136
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,580
 So after two months, after the first injection, he goes to a local trauma center and he tells

137
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,780
 him this, "Guys, listen, I don't want you to blow my secret identity because eventually

138
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,980
 I'm going to fight Slither and dynamite hands."

139
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,520
 They're like, "What are you talking about?"

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,640
 And he goes, "You guys can't tell anyone my secret identity, but I've been injecting

141
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
 Mercury into my body."

142
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,640
 And at that point they're like, "Okay, stop.

143
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
 This has to be a joke."

144
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
 And he's like, "No, no, no.

145
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,720
 I was trying to get superpowers and here we are.

146
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
 Here I am in horrible pain."

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,120
 But he was very, very lucky.

148
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,760
 This is why I didn't kill him.

149
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,200
 He never put it directly into like a blood vessel.

150
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,840
 It was going into his skin, so it just created a non-healing ulcer trying to get this power.

151
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,180
 So they were able to dig it out.

152
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,380
 They're going to have to do skin grafts.

153
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,620
 It was not the easiest thing.

154
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,940
 Now he has the power of not being able to fully flex his forearm.

155
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,500
 There is a bit of concern about this young boy because in the report, this was not a

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,620
 joke in the articles.

157
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,780
 I swear, I read two articles on this and I go, "This has to be a joke."

158
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,300
 And then I found the report itself.

159
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,020
 This wasn't the first time he tried getting superpowers.

160
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,960
 Before this, he was willingly, how many times, he got injected three times with mercury and

161
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,320
 you figure that would be awful.

162
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,640
 But before that, I don't know how many times I would do this before I said, "You know what?

163
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 Screw this.

164
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,960
 I'm going to inject mercury into my body."

165
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,640
 He allowed himself, this is true, he allowed himself to get bit by several spiders trying

166
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,680
 to get Spider-Man's powers.

167
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,600
 Now I don't know if he was putting the spiders in the microwave to irradiate them, but he

168
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,180
 was trying to get them, and how many?

169
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,180
 Was it like three?

170
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,180
 Was it 10?

171
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,180
 Different spiders?

172
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,220
 I want to know because I want Spider-Man's powers.

173
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,620
 But they said, yeah, they also said that he had, this is in the report, "Surprisingly,

174
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,260
 he had no other psychiatric problems and had a normal IQ."

175
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,940
 I'm going to argue with both of those because as much as it would be cool to have superpowers

176
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,880
 and as much as people dream about having superpowers, not many people are allowing themselves to

177
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,580
 get bit by spiders or injecting themselves with mercury.

178
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,100
 But there is, there's a caveat to that because I know right now you have hyperdermic needle

179
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,080
 full of mercury and you're like, "Uh-uh, there are a lot of people who inject themselves

180
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
 with mercury.

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,680
 He's the guy who does it for superpowers, apparently in India."

182
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,240
 Like, oh, in most parts of the world, if someone saw someone with a hyperdermic needle full

183
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,820
 of mercury, you'd be like, you'd swat it out of their hands.

184
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,420
 But in India, it's actually considered not by everyone, but it's by the alternative medicine

185
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,920
 crowd.

186
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,740
 It can heal things, which is the weirdest thing in the world because it's such a known

187
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,620
 toxic, but people do use it as a medicine.

188
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:09,660
 There was a guy in, there was another guy in India back on February 8th, 2005, a 22-year-old

189
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,460
 guy who was an alternative medicine practitioner.

190
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,680
 He went to the hospital, his hands were swollen, and he didn't feel good.

191
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,840
 He had a high heart rate, he had a fever, and the doctors tested him out, and they were

192
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,280
 running these X-rays, and they're like, "Dude, what is all of that in your hands?"

193
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,240
 And mercury was beginning to accumulate in your hands.

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,560
 And the problem is, is I've, we used to work in a morgue, so I'm, I have a certain, I'm

195
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,120
 used to seeing dead bodies, but when, when I just got done watching Deep Space Nine, and

196
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,180
 then I'm doing research, and I'm scrolling through a page, medical journals show super

197
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,180
 gory stuff.

198
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,860
 So I'm scrolling through this page of these mercury hands people, and it just cuts to

199
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
 a photo.

200
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,460
 I mean, it looked like someone was, it looked like that Tom Petty video where they were

201
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,380
 eating Alice like cake, except instead of it being a cake, it was, it looked like someone

202
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,620
 cut a pie piece out of this dude's hand, and you could see all the muscle tissue and the

203
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
 bone.

204
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,940
 Because it's mercury infused, it wasn't like they're like, one strip of skin, please.

205
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
 And then it'll be better.

206
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,100
 They had to actually remove a bunch of like muscle tissue and, and muscle tissue and skin

207
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
 and all this stuff.

208
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
 It looked disgusting.

209
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,460
 It looked like they cut like two inches deep.

210
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,660
 But he was like, "You know what?

211
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,220
 I don't need your medical treatment.

212
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,240
 Sir, sir, at least please let us bandage your hands back together."

213
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,580
 You have massive open wounds, and he ended up leaving without telling anyone.

214
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,020
 He goes, "Alternative medicine will save this."

215
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,580
 And he died about 48 hours later in some other medical facility in India.

216
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,660
 So people do use it.

217
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,180
 There was another case in the same journal that people have used it as an aphrodisiac.

218
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,940
 And those people would inject it into their heart.

219
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,340
 This guy was still alive too.

220
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,460
 This guy, this guy did not die immediately.

221
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,700
 I, I, I shouldn't say they injected it right into their heart.

222
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,060
 They injected it into their chest.

223
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
 He survived.

224
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,180
 So I don't think he actually got it into the heart chamber.

225
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,660
 I remember when I was reading this, I have a buddy named Mark.

226
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,180
 I think I've talked about him before on the show.

227
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,100
 He's a really cool dude.

228
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,420
 And he told me a story that he goes, "Yeah, dude, like, because he's older than me."

229
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
 He's like in his fifties.

230
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,660
 He goes, "Yeah, man, back when I was a kid, like, you know, it was probably like 12, 15

231
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
 years old.

232
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,940
 We have this guy in the neighborhood who was like totally nuts.

233
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,660
 He would do anything."

234
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,460
 And back then, like, you'd always find Mercury just lying around.

235
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,780
 You go to the good old Mercury pit on your day off and look at your weird reflection in

236
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
 the goop.

237
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,340
 But he goes, "Mercury was a toxin, but no one really thought it was a toxin.

238
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,860
 It was something cool you would play with.

239
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
 My dad had access to it too.

240
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,700
 It was just something that kids played with.

241
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,980
 You make a basketball out of it.

242
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
 You're trying to dribble it.

243
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
 It's all splashed in.

244
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,780
 And everyone's face is like, "Ugh."

245
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,260
 He goes, "My buddy, when I was growing up, had this party trick where he would take Mercury."

246
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,980
 And he goes, "Hey, guys, watch."

247
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,100
 And he'd swallow it.

248
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,260
 So Mercury always makes like a perfect ball.

249
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,700
 You can chop it up and make some perfect ball.

250
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,340
 He'd swallow it.

251
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:12,100
 And then within seconds, it would shoot out of his butthole.

252
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:19,820
 Because it's so heavy, it would go through his body down as esophagus into his tummy,

253
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,420
 through his intestines, and then come right out of his butthole.

254
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,620
 Now, I don't know.

255
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,780
 I had a lot of questions when Mark told me this story.

256
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,380
 My first question is your first question.

257
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,100
 Is he okay?

258
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,980
 And Mark goes, "Oh no, he was totally nuts."

259
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,220
 And he made him even weirder because he did this all the time.

260
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,500
 But apparently, I don't know if he was walking around naked.

261
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,380
 He's like, "Hey, guys, want to see a party trick?"

262
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,980
 They're like, "Ah."

263
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,460
 I'm assuming he had clothes on, but it would fall right out of your underwear, roll down

264
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,220
 your pants leg.

265
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,580
 Because it's so heavy, it's so dense, but he swallowed it.

266
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,380
 And you would take, let's say, like a one-inch ball.

267
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,700
 That's actually quite huge.

268
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,820
 Let's say you took something that was a quarter of an inch and you swallowed it when it came

269
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,820
 out of your butthole.

270
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,220
 It would probably still look like it was a quarter of an inch, but it would have coated.

271
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,580
 I don't know, maybe it's moving to the home.

272
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,660
 Maybe it doesn't leave a coating.

273
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,260
 But yeah, so people, the moral of the story is stay away from mercury, kids.

274
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,820
 It won't give you superpowers.

275
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,940
 It is a cool party trick.

276
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,460
 Like Mark remembered, like how many cool things do you remember from your childhood?

277
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,220
 This is a great segue from the next story I didn't plan it like this, but like think

278
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,180
 about all the antics that other class clowns are doing.

279
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,380
 You may not remember what the class clown was doing in third grade or fifth grade or

280
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:41,300
 eighth grade, but Mark, 40 years later, remembers mercury shooting out of another dude's butthole.

281
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,660
 So on that level, so you got to give him that.

282
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,380
 It was definitely a memorable trick.

283
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,660
 He remembers it.

284
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,660
 That's a great segue into our next topic.

285
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,140
 Can, and I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys of the carboner copter.

286
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,980
 We are leaving behind India.

287
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,700
 We are headed right on out to Australia.

288
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,700
 [imitates car engine]

289
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,980
 We're in Australia and we're going to meet a man.

290
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,140
 Online he's known as Major Ad 1014, but we're going to call him Joseph.

291
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,220
 And if that's his real name, it's just a shot in the dark.

292
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,300
 Joseph grew up in a small town in Australia, but he's moved away from that small town.

293
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,420
 He still likes to keep in touch.

294
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,420
 He still visits from time to time.

295
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,900
 And one day he was recently thinking about his best friend from primary school.

296
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,620
 Laura.

297
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,500
 And Joseph's sitting back and thinking, you know what?

298
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
 That was so fun.

299
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,820
 I remember hanging out with Laura.

300
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,660
 She was my best friend at primary school, which is elementary school in America.

301
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,460
 Such a small town that we grew up in.

302
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,180
 There was only 80 students in the entire school, but me and Laura, man, we really got together

303
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,060
 and we hated the popular girls.

304
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,860
 We thought they were so snooty and full of themselves.

305
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
 It was so nice.

306
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,940
 I remember me and Laura used to make up this code.

307
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,420
 We would have this code that we would be able to talk about the girls, but they wouldn't

308
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
 know it.

309
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,300
 We'd use the code words and it was just a lot of fun.

310
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,940
 I wonder what Laura's up to.

311
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,060
 We've all had this thought.

312
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,500
 We've all fired up Facebook or classmates or my space.

313
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,260
 I thought, I wonder what our old friends are up to.

314
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,700
 People we see hang out with high school, middle school, things like that.

315
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,540
 He hops on to socials.

316
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,340
 Can't find her.

317
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,940
 Now women in particular can be hard to find because their names change.

318
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,380
 So he goes, okay, you know, she could have gotten married.

319
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,460
 Very, very common for a woman to change her last name.

320
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,060
 That's going to make it a little more difficult.

321
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,740
 Now because he likes to go back and visit this small town, he's actually still friends

322
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,700
 with a lot of the people from his primary school.

323
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,940
 He's friends with them on Facebook.

324
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,300
 So he's looking through their profile saying, and she must be friends with one of my friends.

325
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,420
 We had mutual friends in school.

326
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,100
 Nothing.

327
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,780
 Cannot find Laura on Facebook.

328
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,060
 A couple days later, he's talking to his dad on the phone who still lives in that small

329
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,060
 town.

330
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,900
 He goes, hey dad, you remember Laura?

331
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
 Remember Laura?

332
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,900
 And he's like, not particularly.

333
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,260
 And he goes, well dad, it's so funny because I know that you talked to her aunt all the

334
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,260
 time.

335
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,260
 You guys are actually really good friends.

336
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,700
 And says the aunt's name and the dad goes, oh yeah, yeah, I know.

337
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,460
 The aunt.

338
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,260
 But I don't know Laura.

339
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,660
 I don't know Laura.

340
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,620
 And he's like, no, no, no, we went to school together.

341
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,140
 Me and Laura were best friends.

342
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,900
 And he talked to her aunt all the time.

343
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
 And the dad thinks about it.

344
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,460
 He goes, well, that doesn't make any sense, son, because the family you're talking about,

345
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,260
 they're very wealthy.

346
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,620
 Very, very wealthy family.

347
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:44,140
 They wouldn't have kids in public school.

348
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,940
 They all went to private school.

349
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,420
 And Joseph just kind of lets the issue pass.

350
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,660
 He goes, my dad doesn't have the best memory anyways.

351
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,860
 But he keeps thinking about it.

352
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,700
 And he's driving him nuts.

353
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,420
 I can't find her.

354
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
 Such a good friend.

355
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,100
 I hope nothing bad happened to her.

356
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,420
 He ends up talking to his friend, Aaron, on the phone.

357
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,420
 Hey, you know, just shooting the breeze, talking.

358
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,900
 And then he goes, hey, you remember Laura?

359
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
 I remember my friend Laura.

360
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,220
 I hung out with her all the time.

361
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,820
 We were all in primary school together.

362
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,420
 And remember that code that we had?

363
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,500
 I'm having a really hard time tracking her down.

364
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,860
 You know anything that happened?

365
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
 Is she okay?

366
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
 What's going on with her?

367
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,620
 And Aaron goes, dude, I have no idea what you're talking about.

368
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:33,740
 Now all of this stuff would be easily excused in a school that's much bigger than 80 students.

369
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,980
 But it was 80 students in the whole school, even if you didn't know someone, it was almost

370
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,060
 likely you knew of someone.

371
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,180
 And your friend's best friend, you would totally know this person's name.

372
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,460
 So Joseph is going, Aaron, I know you know who Laura is.

373
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,140
 We hung out all the time, all through school.

374
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
 We had the code.

375
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,740
 Remember we were always talking in code?

376
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,700
 And Aaron goes, dude, yeah, I remember the code.

377
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
 Your code.

378
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,300
 And you would talk and no one could understand what you were talking about.

379
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,660
 And you'd think it was so funny and clever.

380
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,500
 We had no idea what in the world you were saying.

381
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:29,460
 So this time, Joseph realizes he is the only person who has ever seen or spoke to Laura.

382
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,540
 She doesn't exist outside of his memories.

383
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,980
 He goes to look at school photos.

384
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
 No Laura.

385
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,900
 There's a list that shows what students weren't there on the photo day.

386
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,660
 Her name is not on that list.

387
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,540
 Time passes.

388
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:57,380
 And it puzzles him that he remembers someone that nobody else remembers.

389
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,340
 But what are you going to do in this situation?

390
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,420
 Can you drop everything and rush back to town and try to solve the mystery?

391
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,180
 Or is it just something that you keep going that Aaron must have forgotten?

392
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,820
 My dad must have forgotten.

393
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,100
 This isn't supernatural.

394
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,660
 This isn't bizarre.

395
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,860
 Maybe her photo wasn't taken.

396
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,980
 And you would keep making allowances for this.

397
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:26,140
 But the time comes where Joseph is going to go visit town anyways.

398
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,860
 And now he needs to figure out what's going on.

399
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,060
 Now he's back to where this whole story started.

400
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,820
 If this can be solved, it will be solved here.

401
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,260
 He asks his dad to call up Laura's aunt, the woman who he knows as Laura's aunt.

402
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,620
 And he wants to talk to her.

403
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,500
 Laura's aunt says, "Listen, I don't have a niece named Laura.

404
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 I have two nieces.

405
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,220
 I have two girls.

406
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,860
 Their names are Kate and Amy.

407
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,020
 And they did go to private schools.

408
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,500
 And the youngest is still five years older than you.

409
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,660
 You never would have been in the same grade level as her anyways.

410
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,540
 This is his best friend.

411
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,220
 And his memories are nothing.

412
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,060
 Whispers of a dream rather than memories.

413
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,660
 But you see enough of the crossover.

414
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,620
 It's connected to real people and the code.

415
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,460
 The code he remembered speaking to Laura in.

416
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,780
 Aaron just heard him talking in code to himself.

417
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,220
 And Aaron thought this whole story was very, very amusing.

418
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,980
 Because while Joseph was visiting this small town, him and Aaron and some other friends

419
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,780
 from that primary school go out to a bar.

420
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,780
 And Aaron brings this up.

421
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:54,900
 And Aaron goes, "Guys, Joseph believes that his imaginary friend from school was actually

422
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
 real.

423
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
 Can you believe that?

424
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,100
 Can you believe that Joseph actually called me up and wanted me to verify?"

425
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:09,340
 His imaginary friend, Laura.

426
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,620
 There's another girl in the group of this pub named Alice.

427
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,140
 And upon hearing the name Laura goes, "What?

428
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
 How is Laura?

429
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,260
 You guys used to hang out all the time.

430
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
 She's not imaginary.

431
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,300
 Joseph and Laura used to hang out all the time.

432
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,300
 She's doing well, I hope.

433
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,660
 I mean, I haven't heard from her, but you guys used to sit in the cafeteria together

434
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,180
 and you'd always be drawing.

435
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,940
 Yeah, how is she?"

436
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,220
 Joseph and Aaron kind of look at each other.

437
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,940
 And Aaron is completely silent.

438
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,300
 And this catches Joseph completely off guard because at this point he's pretty much made

439
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:56,180
 peace as uneasy as a piece it may be that somehow his memory is wrong.

440
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,380
 And now finally, third party says no.

441
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,460
 Laura's real.

442
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,460
 And described an activity they had done together in school.

443
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,820
 Joseph kind of has to play it off because this is such a shocking revelation.

444
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,260
 Instead of going into the whole backstory, he just tells Alice, "You know, I haven't

445
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,620
 talked to her in a while.

446
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,180
 I haven't seen her since school."

447
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,100
 But he said for the rest of the night, Aaron just kind of sat there.

448
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,540
 And after the party disbanded and people are going their respective ways, when it's just

449
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,900
 Aaron and Joseph, Aaron turns to Joseph and says, "You're haunted.

450
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,180
 You're haunted, mate."

451
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:45,700
 Joseph kind of played off the comment and they haven't talked about it since.

452
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,940
 Absolutely bizarre story.

453
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,380
 And there's quite a few things that could be going on.

454
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,620
 First off, we always got to justice.

455
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,180
 It could be totally fake.

456
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,900
 Anything we get online, whether it's a green text or a news article, it could always be

457
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,220
 fake.

458
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,460
 But that's the first thing.

459
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,780
 The second thing is that it could be a practical joke, not on us.

460
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,060
 Just giving the skeptical argument, it could have been arranged that Laura is an imaginary

461
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,780
 friend and Aaron got Alice to say, "Hey, say that you remember this girl we're going to

462
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
 pull this prank on her."

463
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
 That's possible, right?

464
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,260
 It would be weird because Aaron kind of took himself out of the party.

465
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,540
 It seemed to have ruined Aaron's night because for the rest of the time they were out of

466
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,820
 that pub, he was trying to process the fact that he has no idea who this Laura person is.

467
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,700
 And he had made up in his mind that Joseph had his memory wrong.

468
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,500
 But it's possible that it was some sort of weird practical joke and that'll come to light

469
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 shortly.

470
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,980
 Let's look at the paranormal answers for this.

471
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,540
 Just get those skeptical ones out of the way.

472
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,060
 There's the paranormal aspect as far as ghosts.

473
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,860
 And that's where the story first seems to take you, that he was interacting with a ghost

474
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
 this whole time.

475
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,380
 And only he could see it.

476
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,380
 And the literature, the lore of ghost hauntings that goes so far back.

477
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,260
 Everything from little kids seeing imaginary friends in their room and then it turns out

478
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,340
 that they're describing someone who died there 1500 years ago.

479
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,220
 That's very common in the lore.

480
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,220
 The idea of people seeing something and going, "Hey, I just had this conversation with this

481
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,700
 maintenance man and everyone's like, 'What?

482
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
 We didn't see anyone.

483
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
 We just saw you talking to yourself.'

484
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,300
 And then it turns out the maintenance man was ghost."

485
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
 Those stories are so common.

486
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,780
 But to have someone interacting with someone else in public, it's not a little three-year-old

487
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,700
 in the nursery talking to the grandma standing in the corner that no one else can see but

488
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
 the three-year-old.

489
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,780
 Good luck falling asleep tonight, parents.

490
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,060
 This would have been a continuous event in public.

491
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,660
 Or at a certain point everyone would be like, "Hey Joseph, you're cool and all."

492
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,460
 But you keep talking to someone who's not there.

493
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,940
 If it had been a one-off thing, like we covered the story about the Okinawa haunting at the

494
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,380
 base, I'll put it in the show notes where the kids are talking to the kids on the other

495
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,380
 side of the fence.

496
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,940
 There's like a daycare center and on the other side of the fence was where a family was murdered.

497
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,780
 I think two families were murdered there.

498
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,940
 And the kids on the daycare would throw their toys over the fence because the kids on the

499
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,420
 other side of the fence wanted to play with the toys and the daycare workers know that

500
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,020
 place has been abandoned for years, the other side of the chain link fence.

501
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,540
 Those are kind of one-off events, basically.

502
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,940
 They don't last grades first through fifth.

503
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,020
 So you're thinking it's a ghost, though, when you read the first part of the story, and

504
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,740
 not story in a fictional aspect, but the first part of the account.

505
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:44,100
 But then when we get the update, it sounds almost like alternate dimensions.

506
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,220
 And at some point, Joseph would have been traveling in this world and in a world where

507
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:57,980
 Laura existed, and then moved to a universe where Laura didn't exist, but the memories

508
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,220
 of her still did, but only his memories.

509
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,260
 And everyone else he talked to and all the social networks and everything, the photographs,

510
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,160
 never proved that she existed.

511
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,220
 So now he's in a new alternate universe.

512
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,340
 And then we have a third party show up.

513
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,380
 So does that mean Alice may have also been initially from universe A?

514
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
 She's also been shifted over.

515
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,620
 This is one of the stories that is so puzzling, and it's also mundane in the sense that this

516
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,500
 doesn't affect the character's daily life.

517
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,660
 Like there are some stories that have, like true crime tends to not be very mundane.

518
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,820
 It's very in your face.

519
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
 You're dead.

520
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,980
 Or someone close to you is dead and you have to spend the next couple years in trial or

521
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,900
 you committed a crime and you have to face the punishment.

522
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,100
 The stakes are very high and a lot of paranormal stories, the stakes tend to be super low.

523
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:55,020
 Unless I bought a new house and it's so haunted, I bought a new bunk bed and it's so haunted,

524
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,460
 I have to leave, things like that.

525
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,020
 I've been abducted by aliens, I've had health problems ever since, but most of the time

526
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,700
 paranormal stories are very, very mundane.

527
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,740
 Whether or not the Mandela effect makes it so the Berenstein bears and the Berenstain

528
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:15,940
 bears are different, that doesn't really have any effect on your life.

529
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:24,780
 But this one, the stakes are mundane and they're also astronomically terrifying high stakes.

530
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,260
 We trust our memory every day.

531
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,420
 Every action we do is based on memory.

532
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,700
 Every decision we make, it's even as simple as getting out of bed.

533
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,140
 You remember how tall your bed is so you know how to get out of it.

534
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,440
 You remember these things.

535
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,700
 The memory is so important and what if it's false?

536
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,980
 What if we don't remember the right stuff?

537
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,900
 And we never know it because we, if he had not been sitting around, this story actually

538
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,300
 started, started off a little bit further back.

539
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,900
 He was having a conversation with a new friend in a new town and her name was Laura and that

540
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,540
 made him start to think about his old friend Laura and I just cut it out for brevity and

541
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,220
 now I'm explaining it now but he just happened to restart thinking about Laura again and

542
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,580
 started tracking her down.

543
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,900
 Had he not gone on this journey, he would have just have always assumed that not only

544
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,420
 did she exist but everyone remembered her.

545
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:35,240
 So how do you know that your cherished memories are real, any of them, at all?

546
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,380
 You know, you cannot prove it until you look into it.

547
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,780
 Now I can remember hanging out with Steve Daimwood and Mauricio Carrillo all the time and I know

548
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,180
 they still exist because Steve Daimwood supports my Patreon and he hung out with Mauricio about

549
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,260
 a year ago.

550
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,460
 But what about all my other friends that I don't talk to on Facebook?

551
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,060
 I talk to Josh Morimer, I talk to Jason Campbell.

552
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,580
 These are all guys that I hung out with a long time ago.

553
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,880
 Hanging out with Quinn and DJ.

554
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,160
 I can keep naming friends.

555
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:13,040
 My point is, is that what about the friends that I can't name off the top of my head whose

556
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:22,520
 actions with them informed the person I am today but they didn't exist?

557
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,480
 Like what does that say of me as a person?

558
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,840
 Because the person I am today is based on the memories I had.

559
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,740
 But if those memories are false, like this Joseph character, he had fun getting back

560
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
 at the cool girls.

561
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,900
 It gave him a sense of power.

562
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,340
 To come up with this code, they can insult these girls right to their face and the girls

563
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,540
 wouldn't know what was going on.

564
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,980
 And that gave him a sense of striking back against entitled people.

565
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:55,340
 And that type of behavior will carry on throughout your life, but did it ever happen?

566
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:01,400
 I mean Alice remembers at least the drawing.

567
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,280
 Aaron remembers the code but doesn't remember anyone it was shared with.

568
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,400
 What we remember are things we did, but what if we didn't do them?

569
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:18,080
 What if our memories, not all of them, but what if some of our memories are false?

570
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:29,420
 And it's so realistic that we remember people who no one else acknowledges existing.

571
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,060
 Because even though Alice popped up in the end of the story to say that Joseph wasn't

572
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:40,460
 losing his mind, the aunt didn't know them, Aaron didn't know them, no photographs of

573
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,580
 Laura.

574
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,560
 What do we have to hold on to other than our past?

575
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:56,480
 It is the one thing that should be unchanging.

576
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,040
 The future can be anything.

577
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,880
 The present changes from moment to moment, but the past is unchangeable.

578
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,920
 It is a fixed moment.

579
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,400
 As much as we may want to change it, we can't.

580
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,920
 This is a universal truth.

581
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:21,700
 But what if it's not?

582
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:34,200
 What if the past is as fluid as the future?

583
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,660
