1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 an old American folktale with a surprise twist ending,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,840
 and then we go back to the conspiracy iceberg to take a look at a broadcast of an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,400
 that may have caused an entire nation of children to have explosive diarrhea today on Dead Rava Radio.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,000
 [music]

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rava Radio.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,880
 It's a shock to me and probably to you as well that I got through that intro without laughing at the word diarrhea.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,560
 Don't worry, you'll have many more opportunities to hear me laugh about it as we continue doing this episode.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,360
 I recently bought a tablet with the gift cards my mom gave me for Christmas. It's pretty awesome.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,960
 Now when I'm done recording and editing the episode, I just have Star Trek the next generation playing all day long.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
 That's the one Star Trek series that I've been interested in that haven't seen every episode.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:06,880
 I haven't seen all of the original series, not a huge fan of that. I'm not into the new Star Trek, the, you know, like the new movies and the new television show.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
 I'm not into that. I like the next generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise. I like all that stuff.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:21,040
 So that's what I got. So, that's a little warning. I'm sure in future episodes the Star Trek references will get deeper and deeper as the show goes on.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:30,960
 Yeah, so get ready for a lot of Star Trek references. One thing I've learned when I've been listening back to the show, there's one movie that I reference all the time.

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,840
 It's probably like every three or four episodes I make a reference to this movie and I've never seen the movie ever. And it's Home Alone.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:50,720
 I'm constantly talking about Home Alone style traps in so many episodes. And then I was like, I've never seen that movie, but it's such an iconic image of just like these improvised traps that a kid would make.

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,440
 That's, that they're fairly effective. So Home Alone. But I have no interest in seeing Home Alone.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,840
 However, what I do have interest in, how is that for Segway, is telling you the story of Taley Poe.

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,080
 Now, Taley Poe is one of those things that is kind of like half-crypted, half-100% fictional.

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,680
 And you could argue that almost all crypts are 100% fictional. But it's a story from American folklore and I just thought there was something interesting in it.

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,280
 Maybe it was the visuals, maybe it was the creepiness/child-like version of the story that I came across.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,240
 This idea was actually sent to me by Ramsay. So if you're like, I don't want to hear Jason read off any more American folklorists, blame Ramsay.

24
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,480
 But I found the story super interesting. Ramsay emailed this to me. So like I said, this is from North American folklore.

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,400
 And it centers, it's like in the early, or probably like late 1800s. It's an appellation. It's from the appellation. So it's like Hillbilly. Hillbilly story.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,680
 It's a story of Taley Poe. He also goes by many different names, depending on who's telling the story.

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,360
 He have Taley Bones, Tail Bones, Taley Poe, Taley Poe. I think they were just kind of making stuff up at a certain point.

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,280
 And they're like, "Grandpa, tell us the story of the cat again." He's like, "Which one?" And they're like, "Taley Bones?"

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,440
 He's like, "Yeah, that was its name, Taley Bones." Like I think they just started picking out different names because Taley Poe is kind of the name that it goes off of.

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,400
 So we'll give this a shot. We'll see how this works, because maybe it won't work. Maybe it'll suck, but we'll see.

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:32,560
 So Taley Poe in the folklore was a cat the size of a dog, as smart as a human, and incredibly vicious. Long, sharp, black claws, black fur.

32
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,280
 It was a night hunter, and it had an exceptionally long tail. So I...

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,240
 Do tails make noise when they move? Like, if you put your ear super close to a dog's butt, would you hear a...

34
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
 [Humming]

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,440
 Is the tail's wagging? I don't know. I've never done that. Anyways, here's the story. There's multiple versions of this.

36
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:02,720
 I'm gonna tell you the story that I read, and then we have actually a director's cut. A deleted scene, an alternative ending.

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,000
 Whichever one you want. It's all the same. There's this hermit living in the Appalachian Mountains.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,760
 And he has his three puppies. But they're not puppies. They're like big dogs. Big hunting dogs.

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,840
 Now he's up in the Appalachians. He's just a dude hanging out. Imagine he probably has a beard and a like a sawed-off shotgun.

40
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,800
 And a hatchet. And he's just making ends meet up there. So, like, walking through the woods.

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,680
 He's got his three puppies behind him. Three big old puppies. They're actual dogs. Because if I keep calling them puppies, what happens to them is quite grim.

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,080
 He's walking with his three dogs through the forest. And he's looking for something to eat. And their dogs are like, "Oh, my stomach hurts."

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,040
 And he's like, "Whoa, that's weird. You guys talking?" They're like, "I mean, woof."

44
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,040
 They're walking through the woods. This is not gonna come well. They're walking through the woods. And he sees a rabbit.

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
 And he's like, "Oh, this is dope, dude." And he loads up his shotgun.

46
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:57,360
 I don't know why I use both blasts. But anyways, the rabbit is smeared across the forest.

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
 He's like, "Oh, I probably should have just used my rifle." He picks up what's left of the rabbit.

48
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,720
 Eats some of it. Feeds the rest of his dogs. And then he's like, "I need more food than that."

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,520
 And he starts eyeing his dogs. And he's like, "Hmm. Which dog has the most meat on him?"

50
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,480
 But before he can answer that question, he sees a long black tail sticking out of the bushes.

51
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,600
 Apparently, somewhere. He doesn't see what it's attached to. He just sees a long tail. And it's going...

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,880
 And he's like, "That's weird. I didn't know tails made noises." So he sneaks up on whatever it is.

53
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,200
 I don't know why he just didn't open fire on whatever was attached to the tail.

54
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,880
 But he sneaks up and he has his hatchet. He's watching the tail kind of...

55
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,040
 Now it sounds like the wind apparently. But he walks up to the tail, takes his hatchet, and just

56
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,120
 cuts the tail off of whatever it's attached to. He hears a loud yell from the bushes and it takes

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,440
 off. And he's like, "Oh, okay. That ended well." Now he has like this... I don't know. Let's say it's

58
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 like a two-foot-long tail. Still kind of squirming and squirting blood in the bushes. And he's like,

59
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,280
 "Hmm. I'm just going to eat this right here. I'm just going to eat a hole." So he picks up the tail

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:14,800
 and he opens his mouth. He's swallowing the tail whole. And dude, I just like...

61
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,320
 Take your time, Hermit. Okay, just... Hermit. Just... Okay, breathe through your nose. Breathe. Yeah,

62
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,160
 there you go. Is that better? Hermit nods. As he's breathing through his nose...

63
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:38,480
 Swallows the whole tail. The dogs are like, "What the hell just happened? We wanted some of that."

64
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,280
 Hermit's like, "Yeah, you wouldn't like that. It was disgusting, but I was super hungry." So they go home.

65
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,440
 That night, Hermit's laying in bed and he hears a voice. He hears a voice in his dark bedroom.

66
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,720
 I don't know if he had a bedroom because he's Hermit, so it might just be a one-room shack,

67
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:04,400
 but anyways, he hears a voice. And the voice says, "Daily Po. Daily Po. Who has my Daily Po?"

68
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,840
 I'm glad I'm a camp counselor. I had a fire now. That is what my life has become. The Hermit's like,

69
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,640
 "Oh my god, oh my god. He totally like freaks out. He wakes up. There's a huge black cat. It's the

70
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,200
 size of a dog. It's just what I described at the beginning of the story." Standing at the foot of

71
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,760
 his bed, looking at his stomach, and it's like, "Daily Po. Daily Po." And the Hermit goes, "That's

72
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,840
 weird. I thought that was your name. That wasn't what was in my stomach and the cat looks confused

73
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,480
 for a second." Hermit calls in his dogs, and Daily Po jumps out of the window, assuming he has a

74
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,800
 window again because he's a Hermit. Daily Po walks to the front door, opens it and leaves,

75
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,880
 and the dogs chase after him. And the Hermit's like, "Oh man, that was close. I don't know what

76
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,840
 the thing was." Eventually the dogs come back, but only two of them come back. And he's like,

77
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,200
 "That's not good. Luckily I didn't really like that dog that much, so whatever." He goes to bed.

78
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:11,440
 Later that night, he hears the door open again. He's like, "Uh oh. Daily Po. Daily Po. Who has

79
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,640
 my..." And he's like, "Dogs get him. Like he's totally freaking out." And the dog chases Daily Po

80
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,480
 back out of the cabin. Dude's freaking out. Only one dog comes back. And the dog that didn't come

81
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,440
 back, that was his favorite dog. Now the Hermit is actually feeling sad. He's kind of left with the

82
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,760
 milk toast dog, the dog he didn't like. He's like, "Damn it." But he's trying to go back to sleep for

83
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,480
 whatever reason why he just didn't stay guard or lock his door at this point. Daily Po shows back

84
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,000
 up, repeats his phrase, "Taly Po. Daily Po." The Hermit sends the dog after him. He gets the point.

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,840
 This time the last dog doesn't come back. And even though the Hermit didn't like that dog,

86
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,800
 it was at least his last form of protection. The Hermit stays up with his hatchet and his shotgun

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,640
 is hiding under the covers. And he hears the door open again. And Daily Po comes back in,

88
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,720
 jumps on the man, disarms him, they're wrestling over the shotgun. First round goes off.

89
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,520
 Wrestling, wrestling. Second round goes off. Daily Po takes the shotgun, unloads it, dismantles

90
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,160
 it, throws it in the corner like Jason Bourne. And then he just knocks the hatchet away. He's like,

91
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,840
 "No, he disassembles the hatchet too." He turns into a bunch of splinters. And then Daily Po

92
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,280
 crawls on top of the Hermit and says, "I want my Daily Po." Just get to the point. I'm not going to

93
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,680
 say my phrase again. The Hermit's like, "I don't have your Daily Po." And Daily Po looks at him and

94
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,400
 says, "Yes, you do." And then begins ripping his stomach apart with his long claws. Now I'm going

95
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,720
 to take a point to remind you that this story is often repeated in a book of scary stories for

96
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 children. It is actually based on a real tale from the olden times in the Appalachians. But

97
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,640
 because it has a cat, because it says the same thing over again and it has like this numerical

98
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,440
 like countdown, they've made it for kids. But the original, there's two original versions. One,

99
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:09,360
 Daily Po rips his guts out, shreds him, pulls his bloody half-digested tail out of the Hermit

100
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,640
 stomach, and then looks at the camera and says, "Now I have my Daily Po." As the man slowly

101
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,400
 bleeds out, I imagine that Daily Po just left his body there. And the wounds were bad, but it wasn't

102
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,680
 an instant death. So he laid there for probably about 10 to 12 hours, bleeding and screaming as

103
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,960
 the stomach acid was kind of dissolving his own skin. But actually what killed him was exposure

104
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,920
 because Daily Po left the door open and it was the dead of winter. That's not a good story to

105
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,880
 tell your kids. Now I don't think the camp counselor goes on. Then in the third hour, he was still

106
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,400
 in agony as the stomach acid spilled all, no, they probably did that part out. But there's another

107
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,360
 part that most versions leave out. This was the part where I was like, "Okay, this is the story,

108
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,160
 this is the ending that I'd want to hear." It's the same setup, but one version ends like this.

109
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,840
 Daily Po jumps on the bed, disarms the man and says, "You have my Daily Po." And then he

110
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,800
 sodomizes the Hermit. Now. That's definitely left out of the children's version because everyone would

111
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,520
 be like, "What's sodomized?" And he's like, "Oh, the camp counselor is like, uh-oh. Should have

112
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,960
 read this other version." But in one tale of the story, whoever invented this idea is like the

113
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,560
 M. Night Shyamalan of the Appalachians. You have this creature, does that mean he was

114
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,280
 sodomizing the dogs? Are the dogs like left in the forest just kind of like laying there smoking

115
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,880
 cigarettes? They're like, "That was actually kind of fun. You don't knock until you try it, right?"

116
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,240
 And the other dog's like, "Yeah, that was quite amusing." And then Daily Po sodomizes his Hermit.

117
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,840
 Now, I'm gonna have to say this, just to get this out here. I'm neither furry nor gay, but if a

118
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,840
 sentient anthropomorphic demonic cat appeared out of nowhere and wanted to have sex with me,

119
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,760
 I'm down. Like, you can't pass that up. Like, that's not a bad ending to that story. That's

120
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,600
 nowhere near as bad as bleeding out and dying of exposure or being eaten, having your guts ripped

121
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,080
 out by a cat looking for his tail. If the ending of the story is the cat simply sodomizing you

122
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,520
 and then you live, you're just smoking a cigarette with your dogs and you're like,

123
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,720
 "That was surprisingly fun. I'll take that ending 100% because you live." I mean, here's a pro

124
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,640
 tip from an old-time bachelor. You can only bang so many baristas. At a certain point, if an

125
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,680
 anthropomorphic human-sized intelligent evil cat showed up in my doorstep and was like, "Hey, I saw

126
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,880
 you on Tinder. I don't know. I don't think I'm gonna pass that up. I don't think I'm gonna pass it

127
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
 plus if I did it probably just ripped my guts out." But, you know, at a certain point, that story

128
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,400
 is far more intriguing than just getting your guts ripped out. That's the story of Tallypo.

129
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,800
 I hope you guys enjoyed it and I hope you learned a little bit about me in the process.

130
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,160
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Okay, so we got Tallypo out of the way,

131
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,680
 smoking a cigarette. We're oddly relaxed. A little sore, but not as much as we thought.

132
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,240
 It's not as much as we thought we'd be. But, it's time to get back to work, flick the cigarette to

133
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,440
 the side. Unfortunately, we're in the Appalachians and it's dry now and everything goes up in flames,

134
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,120
 but that's actually perfect because what we're gonna do is we're going to use the burnt out

135
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,720
 forest as a landing pad. Somehow I can whistle. Carbnercopter shows up because we got a long

136
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,280
 journey ahead of us. We're leaving the Appalachians. It'd be totally fair. I don't know where those

137
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,480
 are at. I think they're somewhere around the east coast. It's like a hillbilly country. I think it's

138
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,200
 like higher up in Tennessee, something like that. I don't know. Anyways, we hop in the Carbnercopter.

139
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,920
 We're going to Brazil. Now, I have a lot of listeners in Brazil and I have a few friends in

140
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,320
 Brazil. I want to say this up front, guys. All the information I have about the water quality in

141
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,000
 Brazil is strictly from news articles that I've read. If I'm wrong, let me know. I'm not trying to

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,240
 say Brazil has the dirtiest water in the world. However, the water supply in certain parts of

143
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
 Brazil, especially Rio, will play a part in this story. So we're on the Carbnercopter.

144
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:29,920
 We are flying over the Atlantic, I think, headed down to Brazil. Now, while we're there,

145
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,960
 we want a little in-flight entertainment, right? So I go, "Hey, guys, I got this DVD.

146
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:41,360
 I got this DVD of the SpongeBob episode. Just one SpongeBob episode." You're looking at me like,

147
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,840
 "Why would you have a DVD of just one? Oh, no, don't worry about it. Here, I'll put it in and you

148
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,640
 watch it. But you might want to sit to where your butt is hanging over the side of the copter."

149
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,200
 You're like, "What? What's going on here?" And before you can answer a question or move to the

150
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:03,840
 side of the copter, I start the DVD. Now, this is a SpongeBob episode. On the Carbnercopter,

151
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,000
 we have, in particular, we got all of you guys, but we got Romantis Anon and we got Marcus Atias

152
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,080
 Vareles. Both of them personally requested the SpongeBob SquarePants story you're about to hear.

153
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,720
 They both are smart and they are leaning their butts off the side of the copter. I know you're

154
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,120
 still questioning whether or not you should, but please do that. Seriously, right now, hurry up,

155
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
 hurry up, the episode's starting. And they both hit me up on YouTube to request this,

156
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,760
 so I wanted to give a shout out to them. So, helicopter...

157
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:41,360
 Okay, that noise will make sense in a little bit, but as the helicopter lands...

158
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:52,720
 We land at a airport in Brazil. Very, very messy. Security guards come up. They're not only

159
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,640
 holding their guns, they're also holding their noses because of the smell. So, SpongeBob SquarePants

160
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,560
 Defocation Brazilian Broadcast is the conspiracy theory we're going to be talking about today.

161
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,920
 It sounds like a bunch of words thrown together, and it most likely is. Most likely is just what

162
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,400
 we call word soup, where someone picked the funniest words and put them in a phrase. However,

163
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,360
 but what it is, the theory is this, is that there was an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants,

164
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,040
 where when Squidward was singing a song, hit the brown note. The brown note is a...

165
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,640
 As far as I know, it's mythical, that it doesn't actually exist, but the brown note is apparently

166
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,400
 a free, a sound frequency that causes you to poop your pants. That's what they call the brown note.

167
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,120
 They've done a lot of stuff on it. South Park's done an episode on it. Miff Buster's did an episode

168
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,240
 on it, but the conspiracy theory is that there was an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants that had

169
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,680
 weird visual imagery, and Squidward singing, because Squidward plays the flute, or the

170
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,080
 clarinet, clarinet. And he played a brown note in the show, and it made a bunch of kids in Brazil

171
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:07,280
 have pooped their pants. However, it wasn't just that. It was that they pooped out half their body

172
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,320
 weight. Most of these kids in one sitting just PFFF, four pounds of poop. Just watching the episode

173
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,160
 of SpongeBob and just sitting there and you're eating your goldfish crackers, then you're like

174
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:26,240
 How long would I have to make that noise to equal four pounds? A lot. That would be a long,

175
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,000
 that would be like a loop I would have to do. So, for a second there, I was thinking maybe I should

176
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,200
 try to do it for four pounds. But anyways, so that's a conspiracy theory. Now, the question is

177
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:45,200
 this. We have a couple questions about that. One, did it really happen? And two, why? So, as far as

178
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,680
 did it really happen? It's on the conspiracy iceberg, but that doesn't mean anything as far as the

179
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:56,800
 conspiracy itself being true. We can't say for sure that it 100% happened. There's no proof

180
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,640
 that Nickelodeon never came forward. You know, there was always that thing about the Pokémon

181
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,840
 episode that was causing epileptic seizures that was shown in Japan. There's been a lot of controversy

182
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,280
 about that because kids did go to the hospital for that. Kids did have to go to the hospital for that.

183
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,840
 And the broadcaster was saying it had nothing to do with this. It was some psychosomatic

184
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,360
 mass hysteria that was going on. However, we won't show that strobe effect ever again. That

185
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,840
 strobe effect has been repeated and we haven't had these mass epileptic seizures. It hasn't been

186
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,440
 repeated on broadcast television, but it was shown to other people because when they were trying to

187
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,200
 figure out what caused these kids to freak out, doctors and scientists and stuff like that were

188
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,480
 watching the video and they're like, "This wouldn't have caused it. There must have been something

189
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,280
 else that caused it." And the kind of consensus last I heard was that one kid probably had an

190
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,720
 epileptic fit due to it because he was epileptic and then there's just this mass hysteria thing

191
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 going on where other kids are just like, "I don't feel good, mommy." And that got wrapped up in this

192
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:59,120
 whole thing. So could this episode, could Squidward have hit the brown notes and made a bunch of kids

193
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,040
 poop four pounds of poop in a heartbeat and end up in the hospital? We don't see any news like

194
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,960
 we did with the Pokemon of a mass amount of kids being rushed to the hospital for what would only

195
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,840
 be described as explosive diarrhea. We've never seen any of those reports. Now, part of the conspiracy

196
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,720
 is it was covered up because the SpongeBob, SquarePants, Defocation, Brazilian Broadcast

197
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,160
 happened right before the Rio Olympics. And so they didn't want the publicity that a bunch of kids

198
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:38,160
 were just everywhere as world leaders and athletes from all around the globe are coming there and

199
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,200
 they're like, "Oh, gross." Like, they didn't want that. Now, the other side of the theory is that it

200
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,680
 wasn't a actual SpongeBob, SquarePants broadcast. Someone had jacked the signal. Someone basically

201
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,160
 made their own SpongeBob episode and inserted it into the feed for the actual SpongeBob channel

202
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,440
 or where the SpongeBob episode would be. So it was a fake episode specifically to make people do

203
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
 this. The first explanation was it was a SpongeBob episode and it just happened to have this effect.

204
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,120
 Then the theory was, no, it was a bootleg SpongeBob episode that was specifically designed to make

205
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,800
 kids go poop, just blow up, blow their butthole up. So let's take a look at that. Now, again,

206
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,960
 we don't have any proof that the SpongeBob, SquarePants, Defocation incident ever happened.

207
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,840
 We don't. And we do have it with the Pokemon story, at least the kids being rushed to the hospital.

208
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,680
 But let's look at the idea that there was a bootleg episode. Is it possible that someone would have

209
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:40,000
 a reason to make all the kids in a particular geographic area have uncontrollable diarrhea

210
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
 to the point where they're being transported from their home to the hospital? So keep that in

211
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,080
 your mind for a second, because we're going to work with that in a moment. However, one of the

212
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,160
 interesting pushbacks to the whole SpongeBob, SquarePants idea of it being a broadcast is that

213
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,760
 we're leading up to the Olympics. So we're in the year 2016. And this is where I don't, again,

214
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,080
 I'm not meaning any insult to my Brazilian listeners or my friends in Brazil. But when

215
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,080
 the Olympics were coming up, there was a serious concern with the water supply in Rio de Janeiro.

216
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,440
 Here was a headline. This was a headline from an article when I was researching this.

217
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,880
 Rio 2016, swimmers need to ingest only three teaspoons of water to be almost certain

218
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,960
 of contracting a virus. So in the city of Rio, you have waterways that are infected with raw human

219
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,040
 sewage. And this water can make you have diarrhea. They were telling people who are coming over to

220
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,240
 Brazil, don't put your head under water. If you don't want to get sick, don't put your head

221
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,480
 under water. And swimmers were like, that's not possible. So where you would have swimming and

222
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,640
 rowing and all these water based events, that water was coming from waterways that were infected

223
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,440
 with bacteria and toxin. That would make you sick. Here's a quote.

224
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,520
 "Water pollution has long plagued Brazil's urban areas, where most sewage isn't collected,

225
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,120
 let alone treated. In Rio, much of the waste runs through open air ditches to fetted streams and

226
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,560
 rivers that feed the Olympic water sites and blight the city's picture postcard beaches. So

227
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,280
 you would have a guy who's been training in a sterilized pool in a chlorine infested pool

228
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,400
 in deepest Russia for the past 18 years and now he's swimming in this pool that is full of bacteria

229
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,080
 and viruses. His immune system isn't going to be able to handle it. It said prime beaches remain

230
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,600
 deserted because the surf is thick with a putrid sludge and periodic die offs leave the Olympic

231
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,920
 lake littered with rotting fish." So it was not the cleanest water supply. You go, what does this

232
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,280
 have to do with SpongeBob SquarePants? Here was a bit of pushback on the conspiracy theory.

233
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,840
 There was no SpongeBob video. There was no hijacked broadcast. What happened was just the

234
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,920
 water supply over there is so bad that you had an outbreak of some sort of stomach disease,

235
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,000
 some sort of intestinal bug that did cause a bunch of kids to poop out half their body weight

236
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,440
 and they covered it up. The Brazilian government was like, dude, it's three days till every major

237
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,320
 country and some minor ones come here to compete in the games. We don't want the news headlines to

238
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,920
 be about all these kids in the hospital. So just bury it. And from that, if a bunch of kids got sick

239
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,680
 and started pooping and they didn't hear anything about it in the media, but they're like, well,

240
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,600
 that's weird because I got sick and this other kid down the street got sick and this kid got sick and

241
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,920
 no one was explaining. It was some sort of intestinal bug in the water that was going around

242
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,080
 because they didn't want to have the bad coverage. The conspiracy theory could have pulled up and

243
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,040
 they said it's weird that all of these kids got sick around the same time and that's the time

244
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,720
 that SpongeBob SquarePants is showing up. But again, if it was that intestinal bug, we didn't see any

245
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,040
 massive outbreaks of explosive diarrhea among the Olympians. So it could have just been,

246
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,680
 first off, it could have never happened. There could have never been an outbreak of four pounds

247
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,640
 of diarrhea across Rio. That's the most logical answer and the whole thing is just made up.

248
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
 Secondly, it could have happened, but it had nothing to do with SpongeBob. It just had to do

249
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,280
 with really, really bad water quality and that story was covered up. And then two, it happened.

250
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,360
 It was related to SpongeBob for whatever reason. Someone was either did it on accident, someone

251
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,800
 put in a frequency that shouldn't have been there, or someone did it on purpose. So let's go,

252
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:29,600
 let's use our imagination caps. Carbonic copter has landed in Brazil. We're spraying it out because

253
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,040
 I told you to hang your butt out the side. You didn't, you watched the episode. So we're spraying

254
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,640
 it out as you shamefully go out to buy a pair of pants, a pair of hot pants. And we start to explore

255
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,680
 the idea that what if I have no proof of this, but we're just using our imagination caps. What if

256
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:52,000
 the SpongeBob broadcast was real and it was a weapon? So around a couple months before the

257
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,280
 Rio Olympics, there was a rumor going around in conspiracy circles, mostly on 4chan's

258
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,000
 conspiracy board. And it might have even been on their politically incorrect board. But there was

259
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,320
 a rumor going around that in, I think it was October of 2016, September, October of 2016,

260
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,000
 a group of people were going to release an airborne version of Ebola. They were going to launch it

261
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,120
 first in China, and then they were going to let it spread across all of Asia, Europe, and down into

262
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,280
 Africa. And the second it started to appear in China, this group, whoever they were, they were

263
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,160
 never named. It was this nameless group. We're going to use their influence to shut down the

264
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,160
 airports and waterways in and out of the Americas. So North and South America would be completely

265
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,840
 safe from this. The second it took hold in a city in China, everyone is going to shut down.

266
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,280
 And the rest of Europe would really have nowhere to go. And the goal of this airborne Ebola virus

267
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,200
 was to create a world where the Americas ruled supreme. It wasn't just the United States,

268
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,640
 it was basically like this us versus them, us being Canada, United States, and all of

269
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,320
 Central and South America and Mexico. It obviously didn't happen. But what was interesting was it

270
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,880
 was going on for a while. I know people who listen to the show who are old timers on the,

271
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,320
 on 4chan will remember that story, because it was building for a while. And I remember thinking

272
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,640
 that would be awful. And of course, it's possible to bio engineer a weapon like Ebola and make it

273
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,800
 airborne. You're taking a big risk that you can shut down their waterways before that one person

274
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:35,440
 in China hops on a plane. But you know, the reward is you conquer the globe. You have a planet now

275
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,640
 that has two continents worth of people. And you have everything else. And I guess I'll shell you.

276
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,040
 Well, if they didn't shut down their their airways enough, they would be taken over Japan and all

277
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,840
 that. But that was a conspiracy theory. And I remember thinking that could happen. That could

278
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,000
 happen. But then someone beat us to the punch. So if that conspiracy theory was true, there was a

279
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 group planning to unleash airborne Ebola in September of 2016. Someone beat us to the punch.

280
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,520
 There was a huge outbreak of Zika. And for the first time, a lot of people, I had never heard

281
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,360
 of it before. For the first time, a lot of people all around the world were introduced to the Zika

282
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,320
 virus. Now the Zika virus, it's a mosquito borne virus. You get bit. Once you're infected,

283
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,280
 you get like a headache. You don't feel that good. You know, like I feel a little

284
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,960
 lethargic. And then after about 10 days or so, you feel better. You haven't in your system for up to

285
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,400
 81 days, you're still contagious. And so it takes a mosquito to bite you, but you can spread it

286
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:42,160
 through different bodily fluids. And the problem is, is that if a pregnant woman gets the Zika virus,

287
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,440
 her baby gets this disease, is that a higher chance of getting this disease called like

288
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,000
 microphalagee, where they have a little tiny head. So massive brain damage. And we started seeing

289
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,120
 this huge outbreak of this disease in Brazil and in South America. And it came to the point where,

290
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,360
 it got, it spread to America, it came to the point where the governments were like, don't get pregnant.

291
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,080
 Where the Pope, who, you know, the Catholic Church is against birth control, the Pope was like,

292
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,000
 it may not be a bad thing if it prevents the Zika virus. Not having a baby may not be a bad thing

293
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,880
 if it prevents Zika. Because the effects of having a baby infected with this microphalagee is lifelong.

294
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,520
 And I remember watching that, that virus get a lot of coverage in the media. And I thought,

295
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,680
 someone beat us to the punch. If that conspiracy was true, that the Americas were going to launch

296
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,280
 this airborne Ebola, someone on the other side said, yo, really? Really? You want to do that?

297
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,040
 Let me show you what we've developed. Now, the Zika virus had been around for a while,

298
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,280
 but they had never made a connection between Zika and microphalagee. And I know I might be

299
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,560
 pronouncing that wrong, but the tiny brain disease, and they don't know if it was a new strain of the

300
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,160
 Zika virus. They don't know why the Zika virus was so really, they don't know why the Zika virus

301
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,280
 was so aggressive this time. And again, in make believe conspiracy land, you can imagine this.

302
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:09,520
 One group is going to launch an airborne Ebola in Asia. Another group says, if you really are going

303
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,960
 to do that, we will sterilize your entire countries forever. Here's a taste. They released this

304
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,440
 biological weapon in Brazil, and we see it happen. And they go, okay, if you do your Ebola thing,

305
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,040
 we're going to make that a permanent thing. Like, here's a little taste of what the Zika virus can

306
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:30,320
 do. We can make sure every mosquito that's possible will carry this stuff. We can turn this airborne.

307
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
 We may not be able to Ebola melt your blood out, but we can make sure that every fifth pregnancy

308
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,960
 from now on in all of your populations, they'll have a born, they'll be born with a little tiny

309
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,080
 baby head. So what do you want to do? And so the Ebola people back down and then the Zika virus

310
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,040
 people said, okay, we're not going to release our full, because it's bad, but it's not as bad as we

311
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,800
 thought it was going to be. The Zika people are like, okay, you're not doing the Ebola thing,

312
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,440
 we're not going to sterilize your entire continents. Do I have any proof of that? Absolutely not.

313
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,600
 I said earlier that Zika caused, because I said earlier that Zika could be spread by bodily

314
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,800
 fluids. A little known fact, a very little known fact, one of the things that can spread Zika

315
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:18,080
 is diarrhea. If you have diarrhea, all the liquid can actually spread it. So people at the time knew

316
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,200
 stay away from mosquitoes, stay away from semen. Semen can also spread the Zika virus,

317
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,000
 but they didn't know about the diarrhea, it being spread through diarrhea. If you, if a little kid

318
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,920
 has Zika and he goes, oh, I don't feel good. And then 10 days later, he's feeling totally fine,

319
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,840
 not thinking anything of it. He still has a Zika virus in him for 81 days. And the way that the

320
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,920
 Zika virus, if you wanted it to be a bio weapon, you would need it to target predominantly women,

321
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:48,400
 because those are the ones that had to worry about getting pregnant. So let's wrap this all up in a

322
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:57,280
 bow. You have a group in America that wants to send Ebola to Asia and win this war, whatever

323
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,920
 they're waging, the powers that be are fighting against each other. Then you have a group in Asia,

324
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,840
 Europe, Africa, wherever they're based, and they go, we're not going to let them do that.

325
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,800
 So they spread the Zika virus in Brazil. And it's not catching on as quickly as they want,

326
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,960
 because it has come very clear to the health organizations in the Americas, Zika virus is

327
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,000
 being spread by mosquitoes. And if we can protect pregnant women from mosquitoes,

328
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,880
 then we can slow the halt of this tiny brain disease. But the people who aren't being protected

329
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,160
 from mosquitoes, which would be men and children, because they don't have to worry about getting

330
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,120
 pregnant, they're still getting bit by mosquitoes. They're still like, ah, man, they're getting

331
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,400
 infected with that Zika virus. So someone on this group, someone in this other conspiracy

332
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,720
 organization says, well, we know that the women are being protected from mosquitoes, because

333
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,240
 they had to wear all they put all this mosquito netting up, these kids are still outside playing

334
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,360
 football. So what if these kids who have Zika, we can infect their mothers in another way?

335
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,480
 People are like, well, how do we do that? And they're like, well, if they have diarrhea,

336
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,680
 and the mothers touch that, they can get the Zika virus. And if they're pregnant,

337
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,400
 or going to become pregnant, this will happen to their children. And then again, the health

338
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,640
 organizations in the Americas would go, how in the world did all these women just get it? We have

339
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,680
 all these protective things. We're telling women not to be anywhere near mosquitoes, we're providing

340
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,320
 mosquito netting for these houses and things like that. So if you wanted to have a bunch of people

341
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 who had the Zika virus spread it to their mothers in an afternoon,

342
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,760
 insert a broadcast on television, that at one time broadcast, no one else would see it, it would just

343
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,080
 disappear into the ether after it was shown. They would cause all these little kids all over the

344
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,280
 city to have explosive diarrhea. It would make such a mess. And the mothers cleaning it up and

345
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:51,520
 taking her kid and taking the kid to the hospital and the liquid is everywhere. It's in the taxi cab.

346
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,040
 It's in the waiting room. It's on the hospital bed. And every single person who touches it would

347
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,920
 be like gross. But they wouldn't think of Zika. They wouldn't think that this little bit of liquid

348
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:12,400
 can ruin a baby's life forever. This is how we're going to help it spread. And this is

349
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:20,080
 another warning to the conspiracy group that's trying to pulverize 70% of the human population,

350
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:28,400
 that we are truly willing to redefine the term fighting dirty. And the aftermath of that.

351
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,400
 It would be a messy afternoon. But even if you only hit one tenth of the pregnant women in that

352
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,520
 city, you have women who already have kids. So the chances of them having another kid is higher

353
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,880
 than just a mosquito flying and biting random women. They get the Zika virus. They have a kid.

354
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,920
 They have this problem. The tiny brain disease not only affects the family, it affects the economy.

355
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:58,000
 Governments need future workers to keep going. So they may try to take us out with Ebola over here.

356
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,240
 But we can devastate them right now. And we will let them know with this 30-minute cartoon

357
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,720
 that all bets are off. They better not try anything in a few months. And oddly enough,

358
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,240
 there was no airborne Ebola and the Zika virus has pretty much kind of fallen to the wayside.

359
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,360
 It still happens. But not nearly as bad as they thought it was going to. Was there a

360
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,720
 bio-weapon attack planned for Europe, Asia, and Africa? Was it stopped by a bio-weapon attack

361
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:39,360
 in South America? Who knows. Most likely, probably not. However, it's an interesting story. And I

362
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,360
 have no proof of any of it. But I think it's an interesting story. And sometimes, that's all

 you need to have a good episode. It's an interesting story. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our
