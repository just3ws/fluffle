1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Authorities are baffled when they find the charred remains of a man who may have willingly

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,740
 crawled into a boiler, and then we take a look at two pieces of technology.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,760
 One is haunted by the soul of a dead man.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,100
 The other one is haunted by the voices in your head.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,300
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:32,460
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,460
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,460
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,140
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,860
 And one thing that I want to do is I want to recognize people who help support the show

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,120
 in whatever way.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,140
 You guys know I do the Patreon shoutouts?

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,260
 But as I was looking through my YouTube channel, a lot of people have donated through the

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,060
 Super Chat very very generous donations, especially during the Thanksgiving livestream.

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,540
 I want to give you guys shoutouts too.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,940
 So I'm going to sprinkle you guys in among the Patreons, but if you donated during the

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,340
 Thanksgiving livestream or other livestreams that I still have access to, you'll get your

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,060
 chance to play the Carpenter copter because I think that's fair.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,220
 I really appreciate the support.

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,340
 So first off let's give a shoutout to one of our livestream supporters, the Rampart.

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,700
 Everyone give a round of applause to the Rampart.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,700
 He's doing the robot.

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
 He's knocking over stuff.

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
 What is a Rampart?

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,700
 Is it a wall?

26
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
 He's just standing there.

27
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,300
 He's perfectly motionless.

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,340
 Rampart, you are going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,820
 If you can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,660
 Just help spread the word about the show.

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,420
 That helps out tremendously.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,980
 So we're finally getting to start tickling the Rampart so he starts moving.

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,980
 Rampart, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

34
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,900
 We are driving up to Bellingham, Washington.

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,060
 Jalopy is going down the dusty roads.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,700
 So I got this story from a YouTube listener named BBBH.

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,060
 So I got to give you a tip of the hat for recommending this.

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,060
 I had never heard of this before.

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,460
 It's a creepy little mystery.

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,140
 I also want to give a little tip of the hat to Dean Kahn.

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,180
 He's a journalist for the Bellingham Herald and a lot of my information I got from an

42
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,740
 article that he wrote.

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
 So let's dig into this one.

44
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,300
 Rampart is driving us up to Bellingham, Washington.

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,900
 And as we're going there, we're going to hit that little time travel button.

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,100
 We're back in the year 1987, specifically, September 20, 1987.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,540
 Car pulls up, Twin Peaks music is playing.

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,540
 It's beautiful.

49
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
 It's super creepy.

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,740
 We keep waiting to see Killer Bob in the backseat.

51
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,060
 He's not in the backseat though.

52
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,580
 He's hiding underneath your bed.

53
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,060
 Guys, sweet dreams.

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,540
 Killer Bob's waiting for you.

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,420
 We are headed up to Georgia Pacific's waterfront mill.

56
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,620
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

70
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,420
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

71
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,420
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

72
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,420
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,420
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,420
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

75
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,420
 dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun,

76
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:27,420
 They open the top gate of the boiler and they look down and the workers like, "Yep, that's what I saw."

77
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,420
 And there. This is this guy's first acting job. He's looking at the camera.

78
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,420
 It's in there. The director's like, "What? You're not even, there's not even a director! Why are you acting so weird?"

79
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,420
 There's a body in there and the cops are looking down there and what they see is it's about a 20-foot drop.

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:54,420
 There's a layer of pipes before you hit the ground level and laying there is a human body. The cops are like doing Roshanbo to see who has to crawl in and crawl in and get the body.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,420
 The body is of an unidentified man who's been cooked. It's been cooked so much that it's partially skeletonized.

82
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:10,420
 So you see like bones sticking out and stuff like that and then like it's all like sizzling. I don't think there's still steam lines coming off of them.

83
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,420
 But definitely dead, definitely cooked. What's interesting is they're looking at the body and they go, "Okay."

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:23,420
 We don't know who this is. We can make some guesses. 25-35 year old man, we think he's probably about 5'8", 5'9".

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:32,420
 Very slight man though. 130-155 pounds. And so that's kind of like their first thing when they take it back and they do the autopsy.

86
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:40,420
 They start to realize stuff. Two broken thigh bones. They're like, "Well that might happen if you fall 20 feet onto a bunch of pipes."

87
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,420
 Right arm is broken. They noticed that whoever this was took their jacket off and placed it underneath them.

88
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,420
 They tore their shirt off and wrapped it around their leg as some sort of splint.

89
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,420
 But most chilling of all is he had socks on his hands.

90
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:04,420
 So the cops are looking at each other and they're like, "You know the sock puppet show ended last week and the other cops like I know. I went to what I took my kids to and it was awesome."

91
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,420
 So this guy wasn't here for the sock puppet show and they're like, "No."

92
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:17,420
 The reason why this man had socks on his hands is with the cops believe is he tried to crawl out as the boiler was activating.

93
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:30,420
 The boiler reaches 370 degrees when it's turned on. All that steam enveloping your body. You think you're reenacting that scene from Empire Strikes Back with Hansel and the Carver Knight.

94
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:40,420
 This is the worst kind of cosplay because it kills you. They think that this guy, these are their theories that it was, a dude just wanted to really hang out inside of a boiler.

95
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,420
 And they turned it on. He's like, "Oh, this is awesome place." He's putting up posters and stuff like that.

96
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,420
 And then he hears like a time note, activate boiler 9. He's like, "Uh-oh."

97
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,420
 They think it's that, that a guy did it willingly too, that he was dead before he was thrown in there.

98
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,420
 But that's when the cops are like, "Well, we know the sock puppet festival already ended so that doesn't make sense."

99
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,420
 He was probably alive when he went in there, but it's possible that somebody threw him in there.

100
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
 Somebody beat him up, broke his legs.

101
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:12,420
 Because 20 feet you can break your legs, but he broke his thigh bones. That's a pr- I mean, you could do it.

102
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,420
 They also said it's possible that his legs were broken when somebody threw him into the boiler.

103
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:26,420
 But whatever the case, they figure he had enough wear with all to try to protect himself from the scorching heat.

104
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:32,420
 So he throws a jacket underneath him to kind of protect himself from the pipes with that super hot water running through the pipes.

105
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,420
 And with the socks on his hands was trying to crawl out and it didn't- they don't know-

106
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,420
 Well, they know how he died. He got cooked, but they don't know when he died.

107
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,420
 So they don't know who it is. They don't know how they got in there.

108
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:49,420
 Oddly enough, like almost like if this wasn't a novel, you would think it was fake.

109
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:55,420
 He was burned up. He was cooked. But it's like a steamer. It's not like Freddy Kruger's flame factory.

110
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:02,420
 In the boiler, there was a ticket for an airplane, continental airline ticket.

111
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:13,420
 But it was not scorched so much that you couldn't read what airline it was, but it was scorched enough that you couldn't see registration number, seat number, name, nothing like that.

112
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,420
 It was just a tantalizing clue of who this could be.

113
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,420
 They're theories are suicide, curiosity, murder, or a prank.

114
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:31,420
 One of the theories that came up later on was someone said, "Hey listen, we are a bunch of urban explorers and normally we go into abandoned things."

115
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:39,420
 But we really like living on the edge. We used to go into the mill and sneak around because it's a pretty cool place.

116
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:45,420
 We actually paid off an employee because there wasn't a lot of employees. It was super loud. Everyone had their little office they would hide in.

117
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:52,420
 You'd have these people go in and they'd kind of be like, "Hey, look at this. I mean, we're gonna come during the tour, but it's way coo-ler at night."

118
00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:00,420
 An employee let him in. This guy tells a story that one summer, some out of town or from New York showed up and wanted to join us.

119
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,420
 And we said, "Yeah, you can join us. It's really cool, but you gotta be careful because we're not supposed to be here."

120
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:13,420
 Our employee who we paid a lettuce in, he has a signal that when he blows it, we get out of there and we have this predetermined meeting spot.

121
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,420
 And then newcomer is like, "Yeah, sure. I'm totally down." So then they go inside and I don't know what you would do in a place that...

122
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:26,420
 I mean, it's not like an abandoned and st. asylum. It's a functional mill that people are working in, but they would go in and they'd sneak around.

123
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,420
 And then the warning thing was blown and everyone ran out, but the New Yorker never came out.

124
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,420
 They were like, "Okay, okay, he's from New York. He can probably take care of himself."

125
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,420
 And this group went home. They went their separate ways.

126
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,420
 So when the police heard the story, they began looking into missing people from New York, matching that description.

127
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,420
 They narrowed it down to like five people, but none of them could ever really be confirmed to be the man in the boiler.

128
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,420
 And that seemed to be it for a long time. This mystery hadn't been solved.

129
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:03,420
 But in 2006, there was a man named Richard Severson who always had his suspicions about this event.

130
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,420
 He worked at the Western Washington University. He was a steam engineer at the steam plant at that university.

131
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,420
 And he tells this story to a journalist. He says, back in 1987, this summer,

132
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,420
 a woman was on the tour of this... There was multiple people, but one of them happened to be this woman

133
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,420
 who was on the tour that he was giving at the steam plant.

134
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,420
 He said she was about 30 to 40 years old. She was about five foot six tall. She's a very wiry woman.

135
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,420
 And you know, you didn't really think anything of her. She's just walking around and stuff.

136
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,420
 And then we got to one of the boilers and she said, "Can I crawl into that?"

137
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,420
 And he's like, "Yeah, I mean, sure. Hey, let me open this little gate for you. It's not an operation. You can crawl in."

138
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,420
 And he goes, "She crawled in and then she got back out."

139
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,420
 He's like, "Okay, tour group, let's go look at this next boiler that's identical to this one."

140
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,420
 But she crawled back into the boiler and the guy's like, "Dude, you can't. Come on. Get out of there."

141
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,420
 And then she crawled back out. And then she crawled back into the boiler and crawled back out.

142
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,420
 And this went on and on and on. She kept coming in and out of the boiler.

143
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,420
 Eventually Richard kicked her out. He says, "You got to get out of here. I got a tour to run."

144
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,420
 "I'm a very professional guy. I went to college for this. I got my degree in tourism."

145
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,420
 "You got to get out of here." And as she's leaving, he says, "Why don't you go to the Georgia-Pacific mill?"

146
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,420
 And the reason why he said that, one, because he just wanted her off the property,

147
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,420
 but two, he goes, "I know they have security there." And they do have security there.

148
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,420
 But, you know, it's security at a mill. It's not security at a top secret NSA base.

149
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,420
 So he said that, and he goes, "A couple weeks later, he had heard about this body being found."

150
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,420
 And he waited until 2006 to tell the story. He was kind of thinking about it.

151
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,420
 But the interesting thing was he kept telling himself, "But the person I saw was a woman."

152
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,420
 And they keep saying it was a man.

153
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,420
 To this day, they have no idea who this person is or was.

154
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,420
 They have absolutely no idea who it is.

155
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,420
 So after a very long nap that I just took, I took a nap, dude.

156
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,420
 I saw how many of socks I've been up all night. Eventually, I had to go to sleep.

157
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,420
 So I'm basically sleeping in the factory in the Georgia-Pacific mill, and everyone's kind of standing around.

158
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,420
 I'm all comfy. I have a little Veronica doll cuddled up.

159
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,420
 You're like, "Dude, come on. We got to listen to this podcast to start nudging me with your foot."

160
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:30,420
 Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys. Rampart, call in that carpenter. We are leaving behind the Georgia-Pacific mill.

161
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,420
 I think that's what it's called. Like I said, just woke up from a nap.

162
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,420
 We are headed out to an arcade.

163
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,420
 We're flying around for hours. We can't find an arcade. Eventually, we do find one.

164
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,420
 There is an arcade in Alameda. I lived in Alameda for a time. There's an arcade down there.

165
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,420
 That's really cool. I think you pay like five bucks, and you can stay there all day.

166
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,420
 Wouldn't have that been a dream when we were kids, dude?

167
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,420
 Anyways, we're walking into the arcade. We're super cool. We got on our leather jackets.

168
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,420
 We're pushing everyone aside because we're headed straight for the NBA Jam game.

169
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,420
 It's two-on-two, guys. Actually, that's sound effects for space invaders.

170
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,420
 He's on fire. Oh, yeah. Punch it in the hole.

171
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,420
 B-b-b-b-ballin'.

172
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,420
 I actually never liked-- I never liked NBA Jam. I liked the artistry of it.

173
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,420
 I could obviously tell there was a lot of care into it. What's the one-- like, toastie.

174
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,420
 No, that was Mortal Kombat. He's on fire. Damn, son.

175
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,420
 No, I wish they had had that sound clip back then. You had NBA Jam.

176
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,420
 If you don't know, people are like, "What in the world is NBA Jam? Ch-ch-ch-ch-choke on it."

177
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:44,420
 It's a game. Basically, imagine a normal basketball game, but the announcer is on the middle of some meth binge,

178
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,420
 three-day meth binge, and all the players have normal-sized bodies and then oversized heads,

179
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,420
 and you could do super moves. So I think if you had three uncontested shots--

180
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,420
 I don't remember this from playing the game because I never played it, but I was researching it.

181
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,420
 I think if you have three unchallenged shots in a row, you get fire-y flame!

182
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,420
 And then, like, that is-- people are constantly yelling-- yelling in your ear the whole time you played.

183
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,420
 It's a game. I played it, like, maybe three or four times.

184
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,420
 Like, because I enjoyed the artistry of it, I thought it was a really cool game, but I'm not into basketball.

185
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:15,420
 It's just not my cup of tea. It's not my butter and j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j

186
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:45,420
 It's just not my cup of tea. It's not my butter and j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-

187
00:14:45,420 --> 00:15:15,420
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch

188
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:41,420
 [laughs]

189
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,420
 Now, he's one of the players in NBA Jam. You can play as Petrovic, of course.

190
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,420
 They're like, "Oh, nope. He's passed beyond the Mortal Coil. Delete his code."

191
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,420
 Like, he's a big player. People are fans of his. So he's in the game.

192
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,420
 What happened one night was at Midway-- at Midway Studios.

193
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,420
 They were playing one of their newest games, Mortal Kombat.

194
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,420
 "Y'all finish him! Toasty, finish him!"

195
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,420
 Oh, flawless victory. See, I know all those ones.

196
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,420
 But as they're playing Mortal Kombat, the NBA Jam's next to it, and it's running the demo screen.

197
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,420
 It's running the screen to kind of get people attracted to the machine and just out of nowhere goes Petrovic.

198
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,420
 Hell, look at each other. Now, the game does yell out players' names.

199
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,420
 It was just kind of an eerie moment late at night.

200
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,420
 They're continuing to play Mortal Kombat.

201
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,420
 Petrovic!

202
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,420
 Stop playing Mortal Kombat. They look over at the machine.

203
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,420
 Is Petrovic even on the screen? No, it's the demo screen.

204
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
 Petrovic!

205
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,420
 The NBA Jam machine would call out the name Petrovic just at random times,

206
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 and it would do it with no other player's name.

207
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,420
 You didn't have to be playing the game. It would just be running that mode, trying to attract viewers.

208
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
 Petrovic!

209
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,420
 Mark Teramel said we never were able to figure this out, and he goes,

210
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,420
 "This isn't a spooky ghost story for Midway that we tell the interns.

211
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,420
 If you have a first edition NBA Jam machine, it will yell out Petrovic

212
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
 at random intervals."

213
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:14,420
 The machine that was made right before he died is the only one that screams out his name

214
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,420
 in the middle of the night.

215
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,420
 It's a creepy ghost story. It's no doubt it's a creepy ghost story, and what's interesting,

216
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:25,420
 it's most likely some sort of glitch, but if it was yelling out "Pippin" over and over again,

217
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,420
 no one would know except for people who hate Pippin, except for people who like the Detroit Pistons.

218
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,420
 But other than that, you wouldn't think anything of it,

219
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,420
 but you have this guy's name who had just died very recently being screamed out through this.

220
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:44,420
 Now, the idea of a ghost possessing a computer, that's pretty standard, maybe not necessarily like a ghost,

221
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:50,420
 but we have stuff like Lawnmower Man, or Lawnmower Man 2, or Game Over, which I saw in the theater.

222
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,420
 So all those in the theater? Not Lawnmower Man 2, that was in the theater.

223
00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,420
 But, uh, Virtuosity, we always have these stories about technology being possessed or infiltrated by something.

224
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,420
 Well, let's take a look at a story that I think might be the creepiest version of this.

225
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,420
 It's trying to help people, but the implications are quite terrifying.

226
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 "Rampart, lead the way. Your strong, wall-like body will protect us as we walk through the arcade

227
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,420
 and find ourselves in research laboratory."

228
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,420
 We walk in, it's in London, so everyone's like "Pip, pip, cheerio."

229
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,420
 They have beakers full of tea and stuff like that.

230
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
 We put on our lab coats and all of that.

231
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 I want to give a shout out to the Twitter follower, SnailWife.

232
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,420
 SnailWife recommended this story to me, and it's absolutely fascinating.

233
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 So thank you very much, SnailWife.

234
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,420
 We're walking through this laboratory, and again, a shout out to the journalist who wrote this article.

235
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,420
 I'm going to be referencing a lot, Zion Gudim.

236
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,420
 I like giving people credit for what they do.

237
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,420
 We walk through this laboratory, and it's actually a laboratory that's specifically for like mental issues.

238
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,420
 So they probably don't have beakers sitting around.

239
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,420
 They're like dipping brain in fluid.

240
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,420
 They're like "Hmm, let's see how this brain does when I put it in turpentine. It melts."

241
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
 It's Roger Rabbit's brain.

242
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,420
 Schizophrenia, 1% of the world's population they believe has schizophrenia.

243
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,420
 Hearing voices is the most common symptom of schizophrenia.

244
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,420
 I think that's this most stereotypical one too.

245
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,420
 That's the one you think of if someone tells you they have schizophrenia,

246
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
 which generally people won't tell you that.

247
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,420
 But I think from movies and stuff like that, you think the general going crazy and then the hearing voices.

248
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,420
 70% of schizophrenics report auditory hallucinations.

249
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:36,420
 So in 2017, at King's College London, they developed this program called the Avatar Therapy Program.

250
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,420
 So what they do is they're going to sit someone down in front of a computer,

251
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,420
 and they go "The voices in your head, they're very distressing to you, right?

252
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,420
 They're getting in the way of your life. They're scary. They're making you think things you don't want to think."

253
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,420
 What does that voice look like?

254
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:59,420
 And so then using like a character creation tool from Skyrim or Saints Row the Third,

255
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,420
 people will build what they think the voice in their head looks like.

256
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,420
 Now it's not the whole body. It's not like mine is a mage and he has like a big flowing robe and a giant staff.

257
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
 It's just the head.

258
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,420
 But with all these sliders you can give, you can give him hair,

259
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 make the eyes bulge out or just kind of beady or somewhere in between,

260
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
 and use these sliders to do that.

261
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,420
 So now you've created this, the voice in your head that you've been suffering with since you were 20,

262
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,420
 you're now looking at on a monitor in front of you.

263
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:35,420
 And then the researcher goes "Okay, what does the voice sound like?"

264
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,420
 And the doctor begins speaking in a microphone and again there's a bunch of sliders there

265
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,420
 that they can change the pitch and the tone and the speed and all of this stuff.

266
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:52,420
 Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? That's the voice.

267
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,420
 This is him? Is this what the voice in your head sounds like?

268
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
 Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

269
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:04,420
 It's so spooky and I'm telling you right now, there's articles in the show notes.

270
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:10,420
 They show one of these therapy sessions and the face that is staring out from the computer monitor

271
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,420
 looks like a voice in your head. It looks creepy.

272
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,420
 It looks like a guy you would run into at a bus stop and immediately be sketched out about.

273
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 Like, it's really creepy. If you had to imagine, I don't have voices in my head,

274
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,420
 but if you had to imagine what a voice in your head would look like, it would look like that.

275
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:37,420
 It looks human. It's human. There's something like a little, like dark, a little demonic about it around the eyes.

276
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,420
 But that's not it. It's so creepy. So what they do, when I say creepy, it's amazing.

277
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,420
 This is actually incredibly beneficial for the people who use it.

278
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,420
 They've done tons of studies with this and the doctors say it's that you do six sessions, each one's only 10 minutes.

279
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:59,420
 So you do over six weeks, you have one, 10-minute session each week and you talk back to it.

280
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:08,420
 So the doctor's sitting in the room and he's going, "You're fat. You'll always be fat. You're a big fat, nothing loser."

281
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,420
 This is research assistants walking by. There's no one sitting in the chair.

282
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
 They're like, "Oh, I have to put on a little bit of weight."

283
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,420
 The doctor's like, "Hehehehe." No, he brings a patient in. He's a professional.

284
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:25,420
 The patient sits down and he goes, "You want to hurt yourself, don't you? You want to do these bad things? You're a bad person. Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you."

285
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,420
 And it's the voice you hear in your head, but now you're seeing a 3D representation of that face.

286
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:45,420
 It's all like Lawnmower Man graphics. And you're hearing that voice come out of the speakers and it's your job as the patient to go, "No, I'm a good person and I've never done anything wrong except that one time I stole those Girl Scout cookies from my niece."

287
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,420
 But that's between me and me and my niece voice into my head. And you begin talking back to the head.

288
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:58,420
 Now what happens is over the course of these six sessions, at first the doctor's like, "Oh, you're nothing. You're absolutely nothing."

289
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:07,420
 But at session two, session three, as the patient begins standing up to the face, it goes, "I guess you're right."

290
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:12,420
 And then it will start to complain, "How come I don't have any power over you anymore?"

291
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,420
 "I'm in control, but now you're so strong."

292
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:23,420
 That'd be awesome if there's like a fade away button. They're like, "No, no, I'm going back to the nether, no!"

293
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,420
 And then it's like all sound effects, "Doo!" Game over screen.

294
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,420
 They did a full study. 75 people doing that, 75 people doing alternative theories.

295
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:37,420
 Now to the people who just did this, nine of them completely stopped hearing the voices. They've never come back.

296
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:44,420
 And then you had a large majority, more than the alternative treatment people, that the voices got less distressing.

297
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:52,420
 They got less noticeable. By standing up to these voices in the computer, they were able to actually start to confront it.

298
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:58,420
 And the doctors like, "Listen, schizophrenia is something that is not a one size fits all thing, and we know that."

299
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,420
 "We've been doing medication for years, people still hear voices."

300
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,420
 "We've been doing therapy for years, we still hear voices."

301
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:13,420
 Avatar therapy is not the cure for this. He goes, "This with medicine, this with therapy can change your life."

302
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:20,420
 We're not saying this is the thing, but he goes, "I believe in a few years this will just be part of any psychiatrist's toolbox."

303
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,420
 "You'll have this equipment at your place." Because it's just a computer program and a microphone.

304
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:31,420
 But you can do this. It's bizarre. It's super bizarre.

305
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,420
 It's an amazing story. I love seeing technology help people like that.

306
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,420
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps and wrap this episode up.

307
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,420
 We all know how things work. We're all old.

308
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,420
 Right? If you're listening to this podcast, you're at least, I don't know, 14, 15 years old.

309
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,420
 "Hey dad, can I listen to that rapper radio?"

310
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,420
 "Sure son. Just shut it off if he starts talking about Nigerian's penises, this variant."

311
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:07,420
 "That's well dad!" Even if you're 14 years old, I think you're aware of the fact that technology marches ever so forward.

312
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:16,420
 So this is the way it works. They build this machine. You can totally do all these sliders, customize the voice, doctor speaking into it, talking to you.

313
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,420
 First thing we're going to get is a graphical upgrade. The face looks more realistic.

314
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:29,420
 The sound technology will get better. You can sound indistinguishable from the voice in your head rather than like a rough estimation of it.

315
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,420
 But then they'll start to figure out a way to do home therapy.

316
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,420
 They'll figure out a way to take this software and make it available 24/7.

317
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,420
 This is maybe three or four years down the line. This is successful. This is just how technology works.

318
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,420
 Arcade games were originally these huge consoles and then they became the console in your home.

319
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,420
 And now it's the entertainment powerhouse that basically ties together your living room.

320
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,420
 I have a device that I use to check my oxygen saturation levels.

321
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:05,420
 That device would have never been a home use device 10, 20 years ago. The technology didn't exist and now you can buy it on Amazon for 20 bucks just in case you're afraid you have coronavirus.

322
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:13,420
 This device will become available at home but instead of having your loved one sitting in the next room going, "You suck! You're a terrible person! You need to do the dishes more often!"

323
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:18,420
 And you smell like cheese. You're like, "Doesn't that what the voices in my head say?"

324
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,420
 "Yeah, but all those things are true!" And then your loved one leaves.

325
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:30,420
 They'll figure out some way to automate it. Someone will start, somebody will start to build an AI program to run this.

326
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:39,420
 And that is why we are here now. We are now 50 years in the future. It's 2070 and the world is a wasteland.

327
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:44,420
 That's always been the concern about AI that will eventually just eliminate humanity.

328
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:50,420
 But what happens when that AI is modeled after Schizophrenia?

329
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:57,420
 What happens when that AI is designed to replicate the voices in people's heads?

330
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,420
 What happens when the technology goes too far?

331
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:09,420
 And on top of that, the AI in that technology specifically wants to hurt people.

332
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,420
 Specifically thinks you're dumb. Specifically thinks you're worth nothing.

333
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,420
 And it was on a computer in a lab someone was trying to develop this software to the next level.

334
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,420
 Self-treatment for Schizophrenia, but they go just too far.

335
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,420
 This technology makes it so the voices in your head can be confronted and be destroyed.

336
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:41,420
 But what happens when that technology goes too far and the voices in your head are unleashed on all of humanity?

337
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,420
