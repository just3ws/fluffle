1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 So, I'll Black Panther the other day.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,280
 I know I'm a little behind the curve.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,000
 I'm not going to give a full review of it, but I do have to say that it's probably the

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,880
 manliest movie I've seen since 300.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,440
 I just wanted to wrestle people after watching Black Panther.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,200
 And what we're going to talk about today is meatless chickens, Britain's calorie restrictions,

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,920
 which is kind of tied into that.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,920
 Why people don't see UFOs anymore?

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
 And a few other subjects.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,920
 I'm Jason Carpenter and this is the 14th Family.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:46,760
 Okay, so we have two related stories starting off today.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
 It's pretty interesting.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,160
 So, KFC has decided to try to create a...

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,800
 The headline of the article on CBS Money...

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,200
 I'm going to provide the links.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,360
 I'm going to provide the links.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,040
 CBS's Money Watch website, they have an article called KFC Creating Vegetarian Version of

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
 Its Fried Chicken in the UK.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,640
 So, where they're going to start doing is they're going to create some sort of soy-based

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,080
 or plant-based chicken flavored.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,080
 I'm sure it'll still look like a chicken leg.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,480
 I wonder if it'll have a bone in it.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,200
 Because it's kind of...

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,320
 I don't like bone chicken, but I guess that's kind of the part of the chicken, fried chicken.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
 I guess...

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,000
 I don't know, maybe the bone will be edible.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,880
 But anyways, so it's interesting because I'm reading this article and the article starts

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,080
 off like this is some sort of revolutionary thing on behalf of KFC.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 But it actually turns out that a lot of restaurants, a lot of American restaurants are making soy-based

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,600
 versions of their products for Europe because they're starting to have a crackdown on how

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,880
 many calories...

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,160
 They're having recommendations on how many calories you should eat per meal.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,080
 And we'll get into that in a second.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,600
 So anyways, KFC...

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,920
 So, KFC is making their soy chicken, their vegetable-based chicken.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,520
 And then McDonald's currently has a soybean-based McVegan burger.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,240
 That's probably okay.

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,320
 And then Pizza Hut is selling vegan pies.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,720
 Which I think the terminology is a little weird because when I think of the term pie,

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,800
 I'm thinking of an actual pie.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,920
 But I guess they mean like pizza pie.

42
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,160
 I'm looking at a picture of it here.

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,480
 It looks completely unappetizing.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,480
 I don't...

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
 Isn't most...

46
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,600
 Isn't any pizza kind of vegetarian unless you put meat on it?

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,320
 Like couldn't you just order vegetable pizza?

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,680
 Like why does it have to be special?

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,080
 It's a vegan.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,920
 100% vegan.

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,480
 Our gluten-free flatbread crust.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,240
 None of that sounds...

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,920
 Oh, interesting.

54
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
 Bacon bits, 100% vegan.

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
 Okay, I'm on the Pizza Hut website.

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,920
 I have enough horror stories about Pizza Hut to fill its own podcast.

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,640
 Pizza Hut is the grossest pizza parlor.

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,960
 And I've eaten it a lot of them.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,240
 I've eaten it like the Little Mom and Pop shops.

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:20,560
 And I had a Pizza Hut in my neighborhood that was just discussing you at order.

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,000
 I had always ordered Marinette.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,080
 Well, I didn't always because I learned my lesson, but I would order marinara sauce for

63
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,080
 my pizza and they would basically give me like red soup.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,960
 It was basically like all water with like a single chunk of tomato floating.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,760
 Floating in it.

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,680
 And the pizza was disgusting.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,520
 I think once I ordered pasta and they gave me like two pounds, it was just like in this

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,480
 huge like cafeteria style tray.

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,200
 The whole thing was completely unappetizing.

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,360
 And it's I hate that I'm bad mouthing all the Pizza Hut because of the local Pizza Hut

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,640
 in Sacramento, California, but it was absolutely disgusting.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,200
 I have nothing but bad memories of it.

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,400
 So having a vegan pizza coupled on top of that disgusting marinara sauce I had just isn't

74
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
 doing it for me.

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:18,320
 A lot of this is coming out because apparently the UK is trying to and I think I lost my...

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
 Where did it go?

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,800
 Okay, so while I'm looking for that link about the UK thing, I'll talk a little bit more

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 about Black Panther.

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,480
 I know a lot of people have seen it already and it, you know, I always heard really good

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
 reviews about it.

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 And you know, generally when movies get good reviews, I think people have kind of picked

82
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,360
 up on this by now when talking to me is that I'm always very, very cautious when people

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,880
 are like, oh yeah, you know, this movie is the best because normally it isn't like very

84
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,640
 rarely have I seen a movie that people unanimously said was good and it was...

85
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,240
 Okay, let me say this.

86
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,200
 It's good, but the hype's not there.

87
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,440
 Let's see British Calorie Restrictions.

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,920
 But no, this one actually stood out and yeah, it was super manly.

89
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,200
 Like I was surprised.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,480
 It was just all about like dudes fighting each other and like wrestling for control, like

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,720
 politically and physically.

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,880
 It was like, I just wanted to go out and like wrestle people after watching it.

93
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,440
 And I still want to wrestle people and it's been a couple of days since I've seen it just

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,640
 really kind of amped you up.

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,000
 So I think I'm going to end up watching it again.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Here is an article.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Okay.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,680
 Okay, so I found it.

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,920
 So what it is is there is a British plan that's called the 400, 600, 600 and it's basically,

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
 it's a recommendation.

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
 It's a recommendation.

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,240
 They're telling people that this is what the government recommends you do, but this

103
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
 is it.

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,080
 You need 400 calories for, for, for breath fix and you need 600 calories for lunch and

105
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
 600 calories for dinner.

106
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,640
 That's 1600 calories altogether.

107
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,880
 I know I double checked my math several times.

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:05,400
 As interesting, I, I mean, I'm on a diet and I eat, I'm 285 pounds now and I eat probably

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,040
 about 1800 calories on my diet.

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,520
 I'm supposed to like to maintain that weight.

111
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,360
 I have to eat like 2500 calories.

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
 So that's a good 700 calorie deficit.

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,640
 1600 calories is a huge deficit for a lot of people.

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,280
 The average deficit, the average amount of calories that a man should have is 2000.

115
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,460
 I think it's kind of similar for women.

116
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,640
 So they're, they want everyone to eat basically under their deficit.

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,160
 The reason why is two.

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,440
 I mean, you could say, well, there's only one reason.

119
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,040
 Well, there's multiple reasons, but we have it.

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
 The world has issues with obesity.

121
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,640
 They're trying to curb that as far as early deaths and medical costs, big part of its medical

122
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
 costs.

123
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,920
 The government probably wouldn't care if it wasn't costing so much money to treat people

124
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
 who are obese.

125
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:59,400
 Of course, people are going to say that it's part of like, you know, like government control,

126
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
 government encroaching on your life.

127
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,720
 And that is part of it.

128
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,600
 I'm not going to just, I'm not going to say that's not true.

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,080
 I think that stuff like this, this calorie recommendation comes into stuff like soda

130
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,960
 taxes and candy taxes and things like that.

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,480
 The government is trying to get you to curb your behavior.

132
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,400
 They're not necessarily doing it to control you, but that is the end result.

133
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,920
 They do end up controlling a portion of your life that you would think would be up to you.

134
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,600
 The reason again, why they want to control it is because health costs are skyrocketing

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,320
 and they want to bring those down.

136
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,960
 Now, conspiracy theorists would say that this is just a way for the government to, if the

137
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,960
 government, if you get used to the government controlling the little things in your life,

138
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,720
 you're more likely to let it handle the big things in your life without question.

139
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,080
 But we'll see how this goes.

140
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,400
 So this is why they're introducing that meatless chicken.

141
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
 It seems weird.

142
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
 I don't have a problem with the meatless chicken.

143
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,360
 I don't even have a problem with the calorie restrictions.

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,000
 My concern always is that it's going to become mandatory.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Not mandatory.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Well, maybe.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,160
 I mean, I don't, I mean, they're going to be guards coming into your house and like,

148
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
 like punching you or like throwing over your food stores if you have too much money.

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
 Maybe I mean too much food.

150
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,000
 Maybe it'll come to a thing like if you see a fat person walking down the street, the government's

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,040
 like, "Oi, what do you, what do you do when mate?

152
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,600
 Those are two different countries, but you're fat.

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,120
 Like you cannot be that fat if you were following our recommended guidelines.

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,480
 Maybe, maybe 1984 is not about the year with the amount of calories that, what was that

155
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,760
 guy's name?

156
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,920
 Willis Wallace Watson?

157
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,720
 Anyways, yes.

158
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,920
 Maybe we have finally cracked that, that ingenious code because 1984 came and when and nothing

159
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 happened.

160
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,240
 So it's about the calories.

161
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,840
 Next story we're going to talk about is UFOs are getting harder to spot a researcher claim

162
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,160
 or research claims.

163
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,320
 This is on Fox News.

164
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,200
 Now, I know a lot of people poo poo Fox News, but it's, they have a great weird news section.

165
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,560
 That's where I found, I found a lot of these weird articles.

166
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:27,120
 So anyways, the headline, the article starts off with the best way to start off a UFO article,

167
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
 but just by like being a dick.

168
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,440
 First line of the article is, "Perhaps it should be close encounters of the blurred kind."

169
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
 That's pretty funny.

170
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,240
 I'm sure this reporter stayed up quite late to get this.

171
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,640
 A new research suggests that UFO sightings in the US, which tend to move in six or seven

172
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,840
 year fluctuating cycles, are in a permanent downtrend and researchers are puzzled.

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,440
 So it's interesting.

174
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,040
 So apparently in the past, like we'll have peaks and valleys of UFO sightings and the

175
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,520
 article goes on to say that one of the big peaks was 2012 and we'll get into that in

176
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
 a second.

177
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,320
 But I think it's interesting if, if you, if there is a natural phenomenon, if there's

178
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,960
 a phenomenon actually happening, it shouldn't peak or valley in that sense.

179
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,720
 I mean, I guess like volcanoes come and go, but mountains don't disappear.

180
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,240
 Like if there's, if you can actually say, yeah, every six years people see more UFOs

181
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,880
 than they do and like there's like a six year high and then nobody sees a lot of UFOs for

182
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
 a while and there's another six year high.

183
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,920
 That seems to me more like a social factor.

184
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,440
 I think that would make me lean more towards UFO sightings are more of a social thing than

185
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
 a, than a scientific thing.

186
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,920
 If we can see these peaks and valleys like that, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.

187
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,720
 But it's interesting because right now, yearly UFO sightings are there's 7,837 on average,

188
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,920
 which is a drop of 41% from the three year peak average years.

189
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,800
 So from where it was at where it peaked, it's 41, it's a big job, 41%.

190
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,560
 The article goes on to say between 2012 and 2014, the US had a peak average of 13,500

191
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,120
 yearly UFO sightings.

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,760
 And then however, in 2015 sightings fell 11% to 11,975 and 2016 saw an even more dramatic

193
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,640
 drop falling 21% to 10,602.

194
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,280
 Then the next line is where stuff.

195
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,840
 So you here we go with that.

196
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,140
 So those are just raw numbers that research has come up with.

197
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,000
 And so generally when you have these scientific scientific, when you have these scientific

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,320
 studies going, you have the raw numbers and then you start postulating, you shouldn't,

199
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 but they do.

200
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,840
 And that's when things start to go sideways.

201
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,120
 Okay, I'll take those numbers more people, less people are seeing UFOs than before.

202
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
 Okay, fine.

203
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,480
 I'll take those raw numbers.

204
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,480
 You have them.

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,440
 I'm not going to question those next line cost to the researcher, Costa.

206
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,280
 Costa has not yet found a solid reason for the significant drop in sightings, but speculated

207
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,880
 that it had to do with broadband internet access.

208
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
 Here's a quote.

209
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,280
 We see relatively flat sighting reports from 2001 to 2006, Costa wrote.

210
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,800
 This flatness is considered an artifice of reporting as broadband internet access was

211
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 still growing in most areas.

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,840
 Access to broadband is a major driver in people having routine use of web reporting services

213
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,360
 such as new fork and move on.

214
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,240
 Okay.

215
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,120
 If they're kind to see where they're going at, they can say we didn't get a lot of sightings

216
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
 between 2001 and 2006, fair enough.

217
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,000
 But now everybody has it, not everybody, but you know what I mean, most people have it.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,080
 And this is my main problem with the UFO sightings in general.

219
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,920
 I was always big into UFOs growing up.

220
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,680
 I think everyone when they're a kid falls in love with something paranormal because

221
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,780
 the world just still seems incredibly magical and open to them and things like that.

222
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,880
 So I was big into UFOs and I was a kid and I read the book.

223
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,840
 I was big into everything, ghosts and UFOs and demonology and spontaneous human combustion

224
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
 and all that stuff.

225
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,960
 But anyways, I'd read these books and you have these pictures of these UFOs and I remember

226
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,400
 a read, one book I was reading said to carry a camera with you at all times in case you

227
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,560
 see a UFO.

228
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,600
 And so if you see a UFO, we can take a picture.

229
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,240
 And if only people carried cameras, we'd have more UFOs.

230
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
 And I thought about that at the time.

231
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,880
 I was probably like 12 or 13 cameras are still relatively expensive.

232
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,080
 We didn't have digital cameras back then.

233
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
 But I thought what a great idea.

234
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,840
 Yeah, I should totally like carry a camera around with me all the time now that that

235
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,920
 would just make me get beat up all the time by bullies.

236
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
 So I didn't.

237
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,000
 I couldn't afford a camera anyways, but now everyone has a camera.

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,440
 Everyone has a camera.

239
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,840
 We used to get you could look back and we'd get maybe 10 to 15 good UFO photos.

240
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,720
 A year.

241
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:19,400
 And you just had people with like actual camera cameras like film plate cameras, Kodak cameras.

242
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,320
 Now everyone has a camera.

243
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,180
 We get like 10 to 15 good photos a year of UFOs.

244
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,280
 That's what doesn't make sense to these 7000 sightings.

245
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,000
 We should have 10 let's say let's 10% 10% people take pictures.

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,440
 We should have 700 photos a year minimum coming back of these things.

247
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,760
 Now I understand that when I look up at the sky and I see something that I can't identify

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,560
 that as a UFO and I understand that that is what is in this report.

249
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,480
 The 7000 sightings are both large visible aircraft with windows and you see little aliens walking

250
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,080
 around through the windows.

251
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:07,640
 That's part of the 7000 and me looking up and going whoa, something just flew by like

252
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,440
 a dart in the sky like a little light bulb that I was also in that sighting.

253
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,280
 And so when part of the problems with the UFOs is that it's such a vague term.

254
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,560
 Part of the problems with UFOs is that the numbers that they're throwing at us for the

255
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,360
 amount of sightings we're not getting anywhere near that amount of photos or video or anything.

256
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,320
 Where are the photos?

257
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,760
 I'm not a total skeptic on this thing.

258
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,240
 I can be convinced and I'm not saying that I just need photos to convince me.

259
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,440
 It's going to go a long way.

260
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,080
 You can tell me that this is going on and you can tell me oh no no no there's more UFOs.

261
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,480
 We just don't have enough broadband internet to report them.

262
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,320
 There's more UFOs but people just aren't looking up as much which is actually what they say

263
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:06,160
 earlier in the article they say the spike that was seen in 2012 can be attributed to

264
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,400
 the mine calendar media Bollyhoo causing more people to look up, Costa said.

265
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,640
 So in 2012 more people were looking in the sky and that's why.

266
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,360
 No more people were thinking about UFOs in the end of the world and all of this metaphysical

267
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,080
 stuff so people were seeing more stuff, more things like that.

268
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,860
 That's a more obvious answer.

269
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,360
 If you're going to be on the fringe of science, you do have to start to be honest at a certain

270
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,680
 point and go maybe most ghost stories are made up.

271
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,920
 Maybe some of them are true, maybe a minority are true but we have to assume you just can't

272
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,360
 accept everything.

273
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,240
 And so these 12,000 when someone's interviewing this person and go why did we see more UFOs

274
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,240
 in 2012?

275
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,680
 I can just imagine the reporter going uhhhh people looked up more.

276
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,460
 Because that's their grasp in its troughs.

277
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,500
 That's really the only thing they could pull up.

278
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,860
 I think it would be awesome if UFOs were flying around and we had footage of them and like

279
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,540
 you know I could wrestle them, I could show them clips of a black panther and then communicate

280
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,540
 via wrestling.

281
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,540
 That would be awesome.

282
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:19,500
 But you know, you know, we need a little more, we need a little more.

283
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,540
 And you need to start, you have to be enthusiastic, you guys need to start putting your best feet

284
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,320
 forward because, yeah come on.

285
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,200
 You know, come on.

286
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,720
 The reason why people, there's less UFO sightings is because broadband internet access, that

287
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,400
 just doesn't wash.

288
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,320
 You could see, I would have accepted a made up answer like there's less sightings because

289
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,800
 the solar system's heating up and we've seen in the past that UFOs don't like being around

290
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 heat.

291
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 Okay I'll take that.

292
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,760
 Or the global temperature is going up and UFOs are trying to send us a message by not

293
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
 visiting us.

294
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,760
 I'll accept that.

295
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,380
 You're going to postulate something, postulate something.

296
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,440
 If you're going to postulate something about something fantastical, postulate a fantastical

297
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,600
 explanation.

298
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,380
 Don't then say it's because we don't have broadband internet.

299
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,940
 It's just bizarre to me.

300
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,500
 Just bizarre.

301
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,640
 But speaking of aliens, Elon Musk, everyone's favorite, well except for reporters.

302
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,500
 Reporters don't like the guy anymore, but Elon Musk, everyone's favorite tech genius.

303
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,440
 He's like a James Bond bad guy but good.

304
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,400
 Or at least like maybe this is his origin story.

305
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,640
 He tweeted the other day, "There are no aliens officially at least."

306
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,920
 And of course all the conspiracy sites and the fringe sign sites go crazy.

307
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,800
 It'll be interesting to see.

308
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,520
 I think a lot of times.

309
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,340
 I think everyone wants something to be out there.

310
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,740
 And I think when somebody who's obviously very rich and very powerful and has access

311
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,940
 to halls of government and access to science and research that the common man doesn't when

312
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,620
 they post something like this, it may be tongue in cheek, but it definitely gets everyone

313
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,900
 excited because we want there to be aliens.

314
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,300
 I think that that would be exciting to know that there are other things out there in their

315
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,380
 visiting us and stuff like that.

316
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,200
 So we have articles where we're talking about UFO sightings, but then we always get thrown

317
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,420
 this little bone and people go, "Oh yeah, maybe it's it."

318
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,560
 It would be awesome.

319
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,120
 I'm not going to lie.

320
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,920
 If there were aliens though, I don't know if Elon Musk would know about it even despite

321
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,560
 his tons and tons of money and the fact that he probably hangs out with scientists and

322
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,280
 stuff like that.

323
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,180
 And you know again, the question always becomes, what do we care about?

324
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:53,660
 Do we care about aliens or do we care about aliens visiting us?

325
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,220
 Because to me it's two totally different issues.

326
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,700
 If someone goes, "Yeah, there's aliens.

327
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,940
 We have proof of alien life."

328
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
 And I'm like, "Really?"

329
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,980
 And they're like, "Yeah, it's a thousand light years away and we can just tell from gas from

330
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,700
 a radio spectrometer."

331
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,700
 I'm like, "Ah."

332
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,280
 And if they say, "Dude, we have proof of aliens."

333
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
 And I'm like, "Really?"

334
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,000
 And they're like, "Look out your window."

335
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,280
 That's what we want.

336
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
 That's what we want.

337
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,240
 I want to look out my window and see like a mothership or like any type of ship.

338
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,440
 And be like, "Whoa, look at there's an alien."

339
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,880
 And hopefully they don't like kill us before we kill them because we will have to shoot

340
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
 them out of the sky.

341
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,480
 That's obvious, but that's what we want.

342
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,280
 So yes, there probably are aliens and Elon Musk technically is right there.

343
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,740
 Wait, no, no, no.

344
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
 Elon, yeah.

345
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,180
 Elon Musk said there are no aliens officially at least.

346
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,780
 Like, yeah, we just want aliens.

347
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:57,820
 And so when people give us the smallest bit of hope that there are aliens out there, I

348
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
 don't know.

349
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
 It would be awesome.

350
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,220
 I'm not going to like poo poo on the whole...

351
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,700
 I'm going to poo poo on the whole UFO thing because I think it's kind of lame overall,

352
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,140
 but I'm not going to poo poo on the existence of aliens altogether because I think it'd

353
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,320
 be awesome.

354
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,440
 I think it'd be awesome.

355
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,120
 So that's all the stories we're going to do today.

356
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,080
 There's a lot of bad news today.

357
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
 There's a lot of like crummy like dark stuff.

358
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,800
 I'm still trying to figure out how to work that into this podcast.

359
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,040
 So I'm not going to touch it right now.

360
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,400
 We're going to figure it out because again, I want it to be relatively lighthearted, but

361
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,960
 when you're dealing with conspiracy stuff and like dark, dark topics, they're going to

362
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
 come up.

363
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,340
 So we'll figure that out.

364
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,500
 I still haven't come up with a catchphrase to say goodbye, but I did figure out how to

365
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,900
 fade my music in and out.

366
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,220
 So that is going to be beneficial.

367
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,980
 So we're going to go ahead and close out from here.

368
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,860
