 Honey that was once used as a weapon of war and we take a look at UFO sightings interfering
 With our military maneuvers today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I
 Hope you're having a great day. I'm having pretty good day. It's 98 degrees. I'm recording during the day again
 But I have a sore back so I have a heating pad on my back. So my back is probably closer to like 105 110
 I think I told you before that I made my own back ointment with the
 It took a I think it's called a dragon pepper or devil's tongue or something like that. It's one of the top two hottest peppers
 Scorpion maybe
 anyways, I
 Took one of those and I squished it into a bucket of been gay and just like mushed it around
 And so I've been used I've only used it a couple times because it's pretty intense obviously what's interesting about it
 Is you rub it on your back? You don't feel anything like normally when you put on an ointment on your back you feel stuff immediately
 This one you rub on your back. You don't feel anything and then you rub it on your back a little more and you still don't feel anything
 And what happens is you get to a point where well I did I put it on my back
 I woke up. I didn't get much sleep last night. My back was hurting
 Because I'm sleeping on the couch, but that's another story
 and so
 I'm walking to work. I have this ointment all over my back
 I need to come up with a name for it, but I'm walking to work and I begin sweating and my back's on fire
 It really has to be water activated for it to work. So it's kind of an interesting
 Interesting little little thing little thing going on, but yeah, I just got some muscle pain in general
 I think I'm just not sleeping well or whatever
 So we got some really good stories for you today
 One of them is actually off of that conspiracy list I often reference and it's one of the ones that people have always kind of laughed at
 And just the name of it. They're like what that's stupid. That's totally made up and I went and looked it up and it's real
 It's actually real
 There it's made today. It still exists today. So a lot of stuff on the conspiracy list
 I think is word salad just a couple words put together
 But some of it I found some documentation for some of it what happens is it gets a life of its own so
 Someone will throw something on the list and then people will then work backwards to try to find a conspiracy for it
 And that's always interesting too because whether or not the story is true sometimes is irrelevant
 It's the fact that the story exists in any way the cylinder man is not a true story
 But it's an interesting fun story and the fact that it has become a
 Quote-unquote true story. It's become a myth of our times the story behind slender man is more fascinating than slender man
 himself
 And so I think when we go deeper into some of these conspiracies, we're gonna run into those things
 I'm going to
 Make a quick plug for a product. It's not I'm not getting sponsored by this, but I use it all the time
 And it's something everyone uses all the time, but this is phenomenal
 So deodorant and here's the thing I think a lot of people get this mixed up
 You don't just need deodorant you need deodorant anti-perspirant because they're two completely different things
 I think a lot of people get them mixed up deodorant just coverage up any sort of smell you're gonna have any perspirant
 I don't know if I'm saying that right, but any perspirant keeps you from sweating
 And I get that you know some people don't like to use anti-perspirant because it
 Blocks the pores in your armpit and so you can't secrete
 The the you know toxins you're supposed to but I like to use both. I don't like to just buy a deodorant or an anti-perspirant
 Why would you buy an anti-perspirant and not a deodorant? I can understand if someone just got the deodorant, but anyways
 Old spice wolf thorn
 Is the best deodorant I have ever had it's a little it's probably about 380 of
 For just one bar of it. I think it's called the bar
 It smells great. It works great. I've never had any trouble with it
 Doesn't stain any of my shirts old spice wolf thorn if you're looking for a good smelling
 Effective deodorant that's the one and I've tried and I think everybody has and I've tried all sorts of stuff
 And sometimes I want to save some money
 So I'll buy like the two pack of arm and hammer deodorant, which is okay, but it's just doesn't I don't really like the smell as much
 It's effective in what it does, but and it kind of stains my shirts, but old spice wolf thorn
 I know that totally sounds like an ad and it kind of is I'm not getting paid for it, but it's like my favorite deodorant
 I love the smell of it. It's just super efficient. I kind of gone on for that for a bit now. Okay, so
 We'll go ahead and get started on this episode here
 Sponsored by wolf thorn deodorant. No, I'm joking. I'm joking
 So I came across some interesting stories and the food based one is actually
 The conspiracy the one that's on the conspiracy list
 It's one that a lot of people have requested a lot of people have questions its existence
 They thought it was just something funny that someone put in the board and that is mad honey
 So mad honey is actually a real thing and it's manufactured today
 It comes from turkey
 now
 Mad honey kind of got its reputation
 Because of an event back in 67 bc
 I wasn't able to find any sourcing for this story
 This is from an article that you all post below and I was hoping to get some more detail on this actual battle
 But I wasn't able to so in 1960. I'm sorry 1967 in 67 bc these roman soldiers were invading
 the black sea area
 and
 The king the the king in that area king. Let's see how much I butcher this king myth right dates myth redates
 Knew that these roman soldiers are just going to plow over his troops
 This is the turkey region region what wasn't called turkey back then. I don't believe but anyways
 The he sees that these roman soldiers are coming through and he's like how am I going to take these guys on they're very well trained
 You know, we got a good army too, but
 We've got to take care of this. You don't want to have to fight them in an open field
 So he ordered his men
 Hey
 Go get some of that mad honey, and I want you to break off huge honeycombs of mad honey
 And it's actual honey, and I want you to just drop it
 In the area leave it around so as the troops are marching they'll run into it. They'll find it
 Now you're a soldier. It's 67 bc. You're not you know an army marches on its stomach
 There's no snicker bars back then you're getting a little hangry
 You want to kill some turks, but you're also just kind of hungry right now
 And you look down and you see a big red honeycomb laying on the ground
 Looks delicious looks kind of like a pomegranate. Maybe you're hoping maybe it tastes like one so you pick it up
 Take a big bite of it. Hmm. Dude. This is this is like honey
 This this tastes delicious and the other roman soldier goes oh man here. Let me see that glass devias or whatever
 Oh, you know what I found out too
 that the
 roman word for sheath
 Means vagina
 So if you back and if you traveled so basically a vagina is just the latin form of saying the word sheath because it makes sense
 You're kind of like putting
 Your your your quote-unquote sword into a sheath
 So you're gladius into a vagina
 So if you traveled back in time you would hear a bunch of roman soldiers being like oh man, where's my vagina?
 I left it at home
 I got to go because otherwise I can't carry the sword all the time. No here borrow my vagina. It's a little worn out
 But it'll fit your sword. Oh, thank you. Thank you
 favius
 anyways, so
 I'm sure that ruins the narrative
 The narrative immersion of my well crafted story here, but anyway
 So these the roman soldiers with vaginas at hand taped to their waist
 Are walking through they're marching through this
 path to invade to take on the turks
 And they keep finding chunks of this red honeycomb and oh man. This is delicious
 Eatin it
 having a good time
 And then the side effects kick in
 First a couple of the soldiers
 Get a little nauseous
 A little sick
 Some of them are complaining about blurred vision. You can't see anything really well
 Then the hallucinations kick in they see the god Saturn fly across the sky
 Throwing out rose petals at their feet. They see two squirrels
 Playing ping pong or the roman equivalent of ping pong back then
 Their vaginas begin to talk to them. Hey put a sword in me
 And in the midst of the nausea blurred vision and general unwellness not to mention the
 Crippling hallucinations the turks showed up and slaughtered
 slaughtered the romans
 So what is mad honey?
 Mad honey is actually
 Honey create obviously, but it's some honey created by bees
 that
 Are let loose in an area that has
 A bunch of uh rojijeron
 So it's these flowers. So what happens is even today the turkish beekeepers in the area
 They'll create their regular honey
 And then they'll load up their big boxes of
 Bees and they have to hike them up this huge hill where that's where all the rojijeron things are all the rojijeron
 I know i'm not saying that right, but
 rojido
 den drawn anyways, so they take them up there and
 Bees can pollinate those type of flowers really anywhere, but up there. There's no other flowers around
 So every bit of pollination the bee gets it's from those flowers. They go back to their beehive
 And they the one of the chemicals in those type of flowers is a hallucinogenic
 So the bees basically are making hallucinogenic honey
 In turkey it's considered to have a lot of health benefits and that's why people still still make it
 It's very expensive too. I think it's like 120 dollars a bottle
 And you can order it online if you're so inclined. However before you do that
 We'll get to the health warnings soon enough if the nausea and hallucinations didn't
 Didn't get you
 But in turkey it's kind of a cultural thing where oh you're sick. Just take a scoop of mad honey
 Oh, you're you know lethargic take a scoop of mad honey a little depressed. It's a scoop of mad honey
 If you just take a scoop you're fine, but it's very easy to overdose on it can actually kill you if you take too much of it
 So it starts off and it low blood pressure irregularities on the heartbeat
 Nausea numbness blurred vision fainting potent hallucination seizures and death in rare cases
 So it's nothing to be toyed with
 and this article
 It was a very interesting article this reporter goes to turkey and kind of talking to different people and a couple of them
 Are like oh a couple of other people from the west are like, yeah, I really want to get some mad honey
 I can order it online, but you never know what's going to be in it could be fake
 This is kind of like the holy grail of honey
 I wonder if bees pollinate marijuana. It doesn't have to be a flower. I wonder if they could cross breed a flower
 and marijuana
 And then bees would pollinate marijuana. I don't know how does marijuana grow its seeds, right?
 Seeds fall off. So maybe that's different, but do bees pollinate sunflowers because those have seeds too
 anyways anyways
 So they're making this honey over there
 And you can buy it and it's you can buy it from a shop there
 But they don't really advertise it because again if you're in turkey, you know where to get it
 They don't want a bunch of westerners coming over taking three scoops
 Flipping out and calling themselves the messiah as they run down the street naked and on fire
 And it basically causing the government to regulate their business
 They keep it on the download they keep it under the shelves
 Every so often some you have to have a friend who will introduce you to the right shopkeeper
 And they usually keep it under their counter
 Fascinating and again, you can order it online, but you don't know what you're getting
 So mad honey
 Very simple
 Um, it is a it's such a lesser known conspiracy that it shows up on the conspiracy list
 It's actually fairly easy to find I just googled mad honey
 A lot of people are like, what is mad honey? This is fake and it maybe maybe it was a little more than googling it
 I think it it took me maybe like five ten minutes, but it wasn't hard at all
 And I thought it was fascinating that it was it's basically a
 Biological weapon
 You can use it against an invading force and they don't know what they're into it takes very specialized
 It's like only can grown a certain area like you can't have a bunch of other flowers around
 And I always think that's interesting. So like how did they first discover this like who was the first guy?
 Who saw a cow and goes, you know what?
 Yeah, I'm drinking out of that udder
 Who at what point in human history because I mean someone had to sit there and go man, you know what my sons
 Drinking from my wife's boob
 And that calf is drinking from that cow's boob
 Ergo, I should be able to drink from that cow's boob
 Like you you had to have a chain of events a chain of decisions to get there
 And the same thing with this, you know
 That there are beekeepers in the valley for a thousand years
 And they're like making honey and stuff like that and since they're like
 Some guy shows up
 Charles Charles the Turk shows up and they're like get out of here, Charles. You can't put your beehives here
 This whole area is taken. He's like fun. I'm gonna go somewhere else
 So he climbs up the hill to get away from all the bullies and he puts down his beehive and he's like, okay
 I think I'll put him up here
 And then he starts noticing his honey's red and he's like, oh, that's a waste
 It throws it out and then more bees they make more honey and it's red and he's like, what am I going to do with this red honey?
 I'll taste it and he takes a bite and he's like
 Oh
 Oh, this actually isn't that bad even though it's red. It tastes pretty good
 What do you think bee goddess and the bee goddess is talking to him because he's having horrible hallucinations
 And then from that point on somebody said, you know what I bet you this has some health benefits
 Lowering blood pressure is a health benefit. I don't see really see how blurred vision is a health benefit, but
 It's that that chain of events had to happen
 I mean, maybe they found a red just beehive one day and they're like, hey, let's take a bite out of that and see what happens
 But even then that's weird to get to the point where they're manufacturing
 Mad honey and they know enough about it that they can use it effectively against an invading force
 It wasn't just a fluke. Nothing's ever a fluke and I think that a lot of times when we look at society or world history
 we jump from
 We jump to like point
 12 the point 12 was being mad honey exists. We don't know who found it. We don't know why they found it
 You know same thing with shaman
 Who are like take this bean and put it in your ear and then blow out your left nose while chewing on an onion root
 And it'll get how do they know all that stuff?
 More importantly, how do they know which stuff in the
 Forest is not poisonous
 Shamans are like, hey drink this but don't drink too much or you're gonna die. Like how do you figure that out?
 ayahuasca things like that the
 You think evolutionary wise someone would have found it eaten it died and then everyone else would have been like no not doing that anymore
 That's what animals do
 Animals eat plants and they keep dying and then they go they evolve to where they're stop eating that plant
 So it's weird how we just jump we skip whole parts of human history and it's just like oh this exists
 humans drink milk
 And who was the first guy was like, mmm that white mucus coming out of that udder that dirt covered mud covered udder
 Yeah, i'm putting that in my mouth
 Fascinating because somebody had to do it
 somebody had to do it
 Our next story
 We're gonna go in the completely opposite direction
 from
 I can't think of a pun
 From bees in a box
 To ufo's
 Yeah, I got nothing. Okay, so I always saw this was an interesting story. I it's one of those stories that
 It's one of those stories that you have to take a lot of stuff on faith like mad honey can be tested
 So there are some stories like dovelyn wisconsin, which they really has no backing information the town that disappeared
 And we we run into those fairly often then there's stories that have some backing information
 And that's eyewitness testimony first person eyewitness testimony. I was there
 And then you get stories where it's like third person then you get stories that are like
 Very well documented this story kind of falls into that area of the first person. So we have to
 Assume these people are telling the truth if we're going to believe in this story
 If you don't believe that they're telling the truth the story completely falls apart
 Because the government has said now it's not happening
 But you know again when you ever you're building a conspiracy you have a group
 You have a factor in it as a group that people don't normally trust which is the military
 so
 This is the idea and this kind of plays into a couple of theories. I have with aliens in general
 And I've heard this story. I don't think this story will come as a surprise to anybody
 Maybe some people I guess if it didn't come to a surprise to anyone I wouldn't cover it
 But we've been having a problem
 With our nuclear bases
 United States nuclear bases now they're scattered across the United States when I was a kid
 I actually was told that there were certain skyscrapers in New York that had no nothing in them
 They were just a nuclear missile and they built a building around it to hide it
 And I don't really think I believed that I think it's an interesting
 scenario
 But I would be the point of having one nuclear missile in New York ready to launch and
 Hidden in a building
 New York's getting nuked anyways. It's not like it would be a total shock
 It's not like you'd like be able to save it for after the war or something like that
 Anyways, that was an old urban legend and there's at least one or two buildings in New York City that have a nuke in them
 It's a kind of an empty shell of a building
 so
 We have what we do have nuclear bases across the United States
 back in the 60s
 They were having reports the u.s. Air Force was getting reports from servicemen
 saying
 There's bright lights in the sky
 And our nuclear weapons deactivated
 Air Force command is like what are you talking? What are you talking about?
 Oh
 Servicemen there's bright lights in the sky. We see them
 They come through the perimeter
 And our missiles just get deactivated. So of course Air Force. It's like you guys are nuts. That's not happening
 And these kept popping up these stories kept popping up
 One of the stories we have a witness. It is Air Force captain robert salis c a l as
 He was at maelstrom air force base in montana
 And
 He hears
 So this that basically the security the base security tells him
 That we have a problem. There's some bright lights very high up and they're moving into our perimeter
 So everyone's freaking out. They don't know what's going on
 This is you know, not necessary. I guess it's like the height of the cold war 67 1967
 You see these bright lights moving overhead
 And what are you going to do you're going to open fire on them? You don't know what they are
 You don't know if they're us. You don't know if they're russian
 You don't know if it's uh
 Even if it's us if it's some sort of shadowy group, you know, who knows they don't know so they're not going to just open fire
 and what happens is
 10 of the icbms that
 captain salis
 Had control over
 Just all deactivated
 They all shut down now this testimony. He didn't give this in a smoke filled apartment while he's sitting in his recliner
 And you know with an iron lung counting these days down
 This is part of the disclosure project where he was at the national press club
 And they had a bunch of people coming out. I think the number was over a hundred of
 previous soldiers previous airmen
 A military personnel who were coming out. So this wasn't just him saying this
 Yeah, well, he taught okay, so here's an interesting
 This is funny
 So what I just said I just said 120 airmen and servicemen were testifying about this
 and then
 I the reason why i'm leaving this part in because I think this is important when we're talking about any stories like this
 I stated that as a fact. I read it on this website earlier. This is the actual this is the actual information
 so
 Okay, so here's here's what it said. So from what it looks like salis was at the
 National press club and I have watched footage of this and i'm going to post it up as well some other servicemen
 But originally I said there was 120 servicemen part of this
 That's not true. So hastens the ufo researcher robert hastens said he has talked to more than 120 former service members
 Who have seen ufo's near where nuclear weapons are stored and and tested
 Some of these incidents involved ufo's deactivating nuclear missiles
 So now we're talking third party again 120 people did not join the disclosure
 pro
 120 people did not
 Join the disclosure program a man who makes his living
 Researching ufo's has talked to 120 people and they confirmed his story now. I'm not throwing
 I'm not saying he's a liar or anything like that, but
 The amount of proof the amount of evidence changes drastically versus 120 people coming forward
 Versus one person saying i've talked to 120 people because at best
 He's telling the truth and he did talk to them, but at worst he's making it up
 He's misinformed
 He's exaggerating and all of those things and i'm not going to say which one is which because I don't know
 But I think it's interesting because and it chalk it up to my ignorance
 But I think it's important when we talk about conspiracy theories and paranormal stuff
 That too I watch a lot of these conspiracy videos and I listen to these podcasts and they will make blank and statements
 A very very common one is no one can go to antarctica. I've heard that multiple times
 No one can go to antarctica
 Nobody can go to antarctica and I heard that on maybe two different podcasts in maybe the span of three or four days
 I went home and googled that that is 100 not true
 There's like no only seven nations can go to antarctica and there's this treaty that bans anyone from going to antarctica. That's not true
 There are restrictions to going to antarctica. They don't want you to go in there and drilling for oil
 But if zanzibar
 Decided if they got their act together and had a good gdp
 And got all their finances in order and began to explore and they said hey, we want to go to antarctica
 There is no law preventing them from going to antarctica
 If you have the money you can charge a complaint to antarctica
 They may say hey, don't go super far inland because your plane is going to crash
 But you're not going to get shot down by f-18s
 It's flat out not true and I've heard multiple podcasts say you can't go to antarctica and and
 They got their facts wrong just like I got my facts wrong and I almost just kept going and if you're listening to this podcast
 And you never checked it out. You're like whoa 120 servicemen went to this one meeting and they all stood there and told their stories
 And that's just not true. But anyways, let's get back on topic
 I again, I'm going to call it out when I make mistakes too because again, it's important and then you know
 They also quote a retired air force lieutenant colonel dwin amazon and again. This is important
 He comes out and says oh I in 1967 I was in montana and I saw a
 A message come over the wire saying nuclear weapons were disabled
 Well, you know, again, that's third party. I get it that you're in the military and he may have seen that message
 I'm not disputing
 Some of the facts here. It's funny because as I'm reading this story and this kind of happened with
 Um, and uh, what was the other consp- oh the titanic conspiracy is I'm reading this article
 I've heard about this story for a long time and as I'm reading this article
 I can feel like my skeptical
 Vibes picking up. So we have this article
 I read it over a few times. I'm very familiar with the story of
 UFOs being spotted over military bases and UFOs shutting down nuclear missiles
 But according to this story that story that I've been hearing for five to six years come really can be verified by only one person
 And that is captain salas
 Uh, lieutenant colonel aimson
 arnson
 Said that he saw wire message that it came through and then hastens is saying he talked to other men who have the story
 But they've never come forward. So the story I've been hearing for five years really
 Can only be verified by one person who says he was there when it happened
 Is it possible that he saw bright lights come overhead? Yes. Is it possible that the nuclear missiles were deactivated? Yes
 Is it possible that?
 The air force obviously saying this isn't a threat. This isn't a problem now
 I was kind of reading the story and I again I've heard about it. It's a fairly famous incident that they're doing this
 And it's not only happened in america. There's reports of it happening in
 britain and in
 russia
 But again, it's real sparse information. It's kind of the same level of evidence
 But I was hoping to do this story about UFOs, you know
 Flying over military bases and people were like, what is that and all of a sudden ring
 Like a light comes down like I imagine like this is 1960s light
 So the special effect is just a light fading on and off and people were like call the captain
 Should we shoot it down? No, sir. Ba da da da. They're just kind of like looking at stuff
 Their their vaginas are hanging off of their waist. The soldiers just still have swords in 1967 and they're looking up
 and then all of a sudden like
 Their Icbm's what's going on here get the
 President on the line. We got to figure out what's going on
 That's the story I wanted to tell
 And maybe it happened. Maybe it happened just like my 1960
 sci-fi movie brain wanted to have happened
 Do okay here. Let's do this. Let's get this let's get this episode back into
 Hopefully conspiracy land. Do I think this happened?
 Man, I really just can't do I think this happened based on the information that I've read about
 and this article
 Well, you know here let's end it like this. I'm not going to worry so much about debunking it
 I think everyone should go out and do their own own own information on this
 The resistance of light. I don't have any problem debunking
 There's some stuff that you just on the on the face of it is fake. It's fake. See, I think that's the difference
 I don't think this is necessarily fake. There's some of the details could be mismatched and we only have like one real eyewitness
 About this, but I do think this is interesting because when they talked to
 um lieutenant colonel Arneson
 He said
 He he they the article ends like this. He has many questions about these sightings. He goes
 Are they extraterrestrial? Who knows? Are they from other dimensions? Who knows? Are they from underneath the earth? Who knows?
 Your guess is as good as mine
 And I think that's how we're gonna have to wrap that story up because I can't come out and say this is 100 fake
 I don't have
 Then full knowledge based on that. I've done reading on this, but I
 Don't have a full knowledge based on this story or on really anything
 So i'm not gonna come out and debunk it. There will be other like the anthony bordain thing
 I think that that was just a tragic event
 And I'll debunk that
 I don't believe that he was murdered
 this story i'm going to put in the
 I'm going to put it in the possible category honestly, and I think that when you have someone going, I don't know what it is either when you have a
 Uh retired air force colonel lieutenant colonel going height
 I don't know they could be from another dimension. They could be from underwater. Who knows your guess is as good as mine
 Sometimes stories have to end like that
 Sometimes stories aren't going to have conclusive evidence and they're going to have an alien footprint or a bigfoot hair
 You're just going to have to go from that that might be true
 Again like I was saying it depends on how much trust you you put into your source in the beginning
 And I'll trust these gentlemen unless i'm given information that says otherwise
 So I think we came back around on that. I was if I when I was going on there for a while
 I was like, oh
 Yeah, this story's a buzzkill, but no, I think it actually is hopeful because I think sometimes you can find
 You do have to just say it might be your guess is as good as mine
 It might sound like a cop-out answer, but I think saying if I had gone and said this is not true
 That's being ignorant and if I said, you know what despite all my misgivings, this is 100 true
 That's just being ignorant as well. They're just opposite sides of the scale
 We're going to go ahead and end
 This episode of dead rabbit radio right now
 My name is jason carpenter you can hit me up at dead rabbit radio at gmail.com. That's a preferred method of
 Communicating with me. You can also hit me up at twitter at jason o carpenter

 And we're basically taking these episodes and cutting them into smaller little portions
 So that's always nice to get a different audience
 A different audience there and tomorrow we'll be continuing
 Our food based conspiracy theories with a tasty yet tricky
 story
 Hope to see you guys back tomorrow. Have a great day
