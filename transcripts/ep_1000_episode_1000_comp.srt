1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 BONG BONG.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 What's that?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Huh?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 What?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 What's going on?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 BONG.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Oh no.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 That's the sound of a clock.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 The striking midnight right now.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 12 more of those 12 more of those BONG noises right in your ears.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 BONG.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 They're coming at you.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Oh no.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,760
 What could possibly be going on?

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,920
 And then a ghost walked into my bedroom and said, "Tonight you're going to be

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,400
 visited by three ghosts, Jason.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,680
 The ghost of podcast past."

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,200
 I'm sure you can guess the other two right?

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,200
 Present and future.

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,200
 Oh no.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,800
 Are they going to be scary ghosts?

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
 Maybe.

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,120
 I guess we'll find out because you must now do a show.

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
 Do a podcast.

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
 That's what you do, right?

26
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,920
 It's your thousands episode.

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
 The ghost?

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,600
 That's the ghost mispronouncing that, not me.

29
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
 Ghost.

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 You better learn how to pronounce words.

31
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
 Yes.

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,720
 It's episode 1000 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

33
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,680
 We're going to take a look at some creepy tales from my past, the present and the future.

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,160
 You guys know the gimmick, right?

35
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,040
 On today's one thousandth episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,040
 BONG.

37
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:24,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode.

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,640
 That's not another episode.

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,240
 It's episode 1000 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

40
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,440
 Who would have ever thought we would get this far?

41
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
 Not me.

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
 Not me.

43
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,320
 I have a whole numbering system that's only three digits.

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,200
 I don't know what I'm going to do now to keep track of this stuff.

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
 I guess just add another digit.

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,120
 But thank you so much for what's my normal intro.

47
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

48
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,320
 I'm having a splendid day.

50
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,400
 I hope you're having a splendid day as well.

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,520
 We're walking around the snowy streets the day after Christmas morning.

52
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,880
 And we're going to talk about some stuff.

53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,920
 We're going to talk about some stuff that I have to clear up.

54
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,840
 There's this one story that I know you guys.

55
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,760
 I know some of you guys have been like, "Dude, is he ever going to address that?"

56
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,560
 Or, "What's going on?

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,760
 We'll get to that in a second."

58
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,800
 And then we got some cool stuff to talk about.

59
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,240
 If this is your first episode, maybe listen to the first 999 episodes.

60
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,800
 Oh, I guess I should start off by saying that.

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,280
 This is an episode 1000.

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
 This is most likely episode 1005.

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,040
 I've made some errors numbering episodes.

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
 People have pointed that out.

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,200
 And I would say thank you.

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,000
 Thank you for letting me know I made that error 100 episodes ago.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,320
 It would take me forever to try to correct it.

68
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,160
 But anyway, guys, seriously, thank you guys for being on this journey.

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,880
 Whether this is your first episode, and that'll be a weird one.

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,360
 Or your thousandth episode, welcome.

71
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,320
 And thank you for being part of the fluffle part of the dream team that is Dead Rabbit Radio.

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,600
 And since you're so special, you're going to be our captain, our pilot, this episode

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 today.

74
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
 Let's go ahead and start off.

75
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,320
 I'm going to give you the keys of the Jason Jalopy.

76
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,800
 Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,560
 Drive us all the way out to Portugal.

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,520
 And as we're driving out there, the Ghost of Christmas pass jumps out of the trunk.

79
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,920
 And he's like, "Hey guys, I'm along for this journey as well, because we're headed back

80
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,560
 into the past."

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,800
 Specifically, we're headed back to episode 914.

82
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,720
 Transmorphers and interactive adventure.

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
 And I'm like, "No, that was the scariest episode I ever did.

84
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,360
 I'm trying to like fight the time travel.

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
 Like no, no, I'm punching clocks."

86
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
 But it's useless.

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
 It's useless.

88
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,680
 Eventually we are back on July 18th, 2022.

89
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,520
 That is when I put out Transmorphers and interactive adventure.

90
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,280
 I love doing interactive adventures.

91
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,320
 They're a lot of fun, but they're also a lot of work.

92
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,680
 They have to kind of happen organically.

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,520
 I really just can't sit down and go, "I'm going to try to find a bunch of associated

94
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,920
 stories that takes forever to put together just any episode of this podcast."

95
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,960
 But it's extra work when I'm trying to come up with a theme, right?

96
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,080
 Have all these stories that are kind of related.

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,200
 I usually get one maybe every one or two seasons.

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
 So maybe out of a hundred episodes, there's one interactive adventure.

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,120
 I love them.

100
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
 You guys seem to enjoy them as well.

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,440
 But little did you know.

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,440
 Some people knew.

103
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,720
 Some people knew and they made it very well known that they knew.

104
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,760
 They were laughing at me.

105
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,480
 Little do most people know that in episode 914, I just wanted to talk about people turning

106
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,840
 into things that aren't human.

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,360
 Because that's a big fear of mine.

108
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,760
 I think the idea, and it's very, if I turned into a tree, but I don't remember being a

109
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,480
 human, I'm totally fine with that.

110
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,040
 As long as I'm well watered and I'm in a cool spot, maybe I'm a palm tree on a beach.

111
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
 I can throw coconuts and pirates.

112
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,120
 Or like a big oak tree with a swing.

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
 So kids are swinging.

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,880
 I keep breaking my branches just to watch them fall.

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,280
 As long as I'm like a cool tree, not like a weeping willow or something lame, sitting

116
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,680
 in a swamp.

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
 That would suck.

118
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,080
 Got frogs all over me.

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,680
 But also, I wouldn't care if I was just a tree and didn't have a human mind.

120
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,360
 But if I was a tree, how many times can you watch the sunset before you're like, can you

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,720
 plant me closer to the house so I can watch Disney Plus?

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,920
 The idea of being, having a human consciousness trapped in the body of a beast or an inanimate

123
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,880
 object terrifies me.

124
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
 Terrifies me.

125
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,960
 And I've always tried placing where I got that fear.

126
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
 I often quote the Doctor Who episode.

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,920
 There's a Doctor Who movie about a man who turned into a statue.

128
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,520
 I think that terrified me.

129
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,760
 I think Josie Packard turning into a doorknob on Twin Peaks.

130
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,160
 That sounds so great.

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,320
 It's so weird.

132
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,760
 Josie Packard became a doorknob or a knob on a dresser if you got to be specific.

133
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,920
 That stuff terrifies me.

134
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,800
 So I found these related stories that were about people changing into things.

135
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
 And again, it was fairly organic.

136
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,080
 Like I think I had one or two stories like that and then I just stumbled across two more.

137
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,440
 Well, one of those stories.

138
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,520
 I was like, oh, this would be so terrifying.

139
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:13,040
 And it's funny if you listen to the way I talk about the pigman from Portugal.

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,800
 So a couple of people know where this one's going.

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,200
 The way I talk about the story, the pigman from Portugal.

142
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,080
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

143
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,720
 I'm like telling it.

144
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,720
 I'm telling it as if it's a real story because I don't know.

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
 I don't know.

146
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 See, here's the thing.

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,400
 I live in the world of the paranormal.

148
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,800
 So when I hear things that other people would think that's unbelievable, I go, maybe, maybe,

149
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,760
 you know, that might be true.

150
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,880
 You might be able to become a pig person.

151
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,120
 And this story I found on the X board and just a brief overview.

152
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,520
 These four young men were walking home from a bar one night.

153
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,520
 They looked down the alleyway and they saw like a monstrous sight.

154
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,440
 The silhouette of a creature standing at the end of this alleyway had a t-shirt that was

155
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,600
 too tight.

156
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,440
 So his stomach was showing and they described it as a bifurcated belly.

157
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
 So like the fat fold in upon itself.

158
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,760
 He had like a sunflower hat or like a wide brim hat and had a purse on as well.

159
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,240
 And these four men beat it up because they were drunk and they were scared.

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,400
 They beat this thing up and they took his purse and all that was in the purse was some

161
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,400
 Colonel's a corn.

162
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,000
 And I tell this story the same way I would talk about something I read in the New York

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Times.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,240
 I do a little more mood building, but you know what I mean?

165
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
 Like, I'm like, wow, maybe this happened.

166
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,600
 And if you pick number three, you're a pig person.

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,520
 I released the episode.

168
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,840
 This is back when episodes are still getting released on YouTube.

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:03,240
 Imagine if you walked into a dinner party and you had a big pudding stain on your back.

170
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
 But you don't know it.

171
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880
 You don't know what you're like on this dessert.

172
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,680
 That way when I get hungry, I just take my jacket off and lick it.

173
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,360
 You don't know the pudding stains there.

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,640
 And you walk into this party and you're waving at people and people are like, hey, what's

175
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 going on?

176
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,360
 You know, hey, what's up, man?

177
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,520
 And you start to hear people snickering.

178
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,800
 Oh my God.

179
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 You don't know what they're snickering at.

180
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,760
 Maybe they're snickering at that loser who came in behind you.

181
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,400
 Yeah, that guy's totally lame, but not me.

182
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
 You hear a little bit of snickering here and there.

183
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,160
 But the longer you're at the dinner party, the more it just becomes outright laughter.

184
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,080
 And then you realize they're literally pointing at you and then finally someone comes up and

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,440
 goes, hey, buddy, you got some pudding on your back.

186
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,680
 That's what happened with this pig man of Portugal's story.

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,560
 And everyone who pointed this out, they didn't do it in a mean hearted way, but it was funny

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,160
 because I saw the YouTube comments start to roll in and people started for people originally

189
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,720
 were just like, LOL, I can't believe you talked about the pig man of Portugal.

190
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,200
 And then sure enough, people started to say, hey, that that's a real story, dude.

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,520
 Like that's a that's an inside joke.

192
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,080
 It's a real story, but it's about this guy.

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,240
 I'm like, what are they talking about?

194
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:30,800
 So it turns out, it turns out that the story is real in a sense.

195
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,680
 And I did not know this at the time.

196
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,320
 I started pieced this together through YouTube comments and I started doing some research

197
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,680
 and I'm like, uh oh, oh no, this is not going to end well.

198
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,960
 And what sucks is I left the episode up.

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,680
 I left the episode up on the podcast, but the YouTube video, I go, you know what?

200
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,960
 I'm going to private, I'm going to private this YouTube video for now.

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
 It was out for a while.

202
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,920
 Most people who watched on YouTube watched it like within a day or two of it coming out.

203
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
 Nobody even noticed that I private it.

204
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,880
 I'm going to private it for now and see what my what I'm going to do.

205
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,080
 There's really I couldn't do much because I thought for a second maybe I can edit out

206
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,080
 the pig man of Portugal segment.

207
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,520
 But it was a chooser chooser on adventure segment.

208
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,840
 It would be odd if people go, I picked number three.

209
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,040
 How come there's no number three?

210
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,560
 And then the rest of the episode, I think the pig man of Portugal might have been the

211
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,960
 second story.

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,880
 For the rest of the episode, I kept referencing the pig man story.

213
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,440
 So I listen to the episode and I go, I, it would be butchered.

214
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,040
 Like I would have to take everything out.

215
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
 I didn't want to.

216
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,800
 I will take out stuff if I have to.

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,160
 And that is something I do have to, because you know, sometimes I'm covering like these

218
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,360
 Reddit threads and you never know.

219
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,680
 Like I could put something out and someone contact me and go, Hey, you know, that was

220
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,200
 a story that I told.

221
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
 And I did never thought it would be on a podcast.

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,080
 Like can you take that out?

223
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,240
 That's never happened to me.

224
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
 That's never happened to me.

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,200
 One person, there is one person who did that, but they won.

226
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,760
 I could never prove it was the same person who originally wrote the story on Reddit because

227
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,400
 the account got deleted.

228
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,320
 They came a couple months later and was like, Hey, can you take that story down?

229
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,560
 And before I could even answer them, they then had a list of demands.

230
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,680
 Like I had to then have a 10 minute apology inserted in and I had to write a letter to

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
 the mayor or something.

232
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,480
 I'm super bizarre and I was like, I don't know what's going on here.

233
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
 This is crazy.

234
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,520
 I'm just gonna leave it up.

235
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,880
 I would love to talk more about like these emails I'm getting from this person, but I

236
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,120
 feel like I would just be drawing more attention to what I can only and this is so bizarre.

237
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,640
 Maybe in a future segment I will, but he was actually making the original story weirder.

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,360
 But if somebody came to me and said, the mayor, the mayor has ever moved an axe.

239
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
 Can you take this down?

240
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,880
 I may not be able to completely take it down, but I might be able to add something.

241
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
 10 minute long apology.

242
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,560
 I don't know what that guy was on about.

243
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,200
 But anyways, I'm looking at this.

244
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,640
 I go, I can't really edit it out.

245
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,320
 I'll private it on YouTube, which I regret now because I didn't know this when you private

246
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,880
 a video on YouTube and then when you put it back, all the comments are gone.

247
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,640
 All the comments are gone, which sucks because I hate doing that.

248
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,240
 But the reason why this video started getting a bunch of attention was because it is a true

249
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,480
 story, but it's not about a man turning into a pig.

250
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
 That's what I figured.

251
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,440
 I go, and I think I said in the episode, I go, could you imagine like being a human

252
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,040
 and then turning into a pig so your clothes would get smaller and you would steal a hat

253
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,400
 to wear to kind of cover your face.

254
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,400
 It might not be the type of hat you would normally wear.

255
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,800
 You purse full of corn because you're eating stuff and you're still trying to hold on to

256
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,000
 the remnants of your humanity.

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,160
 Turns out that what I actually did was your lovable naive podcaster.

258
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,400
 He just wants to talk about pig people and ghosts, clones, all this stuff.

259
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,920
 I all of a sudden was standing in the middle of a war.

260
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,240
 Apparently I'm vaguely aware of Ethan Ralph.

261
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,000
 Ethan Ralph is the host.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,440
 I think it's a podcast on YouTube called the kill stream.

263
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,760
 And he also has a website called the Ralph retort.

264
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
 Apparently.

265
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:30,520
 I know that he, I had to look too much research though to figure out what was going on because

266
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,720
 in the YouTube comments people were laughing.

267
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,280
 Laughing and they're like, oh my God, you fell for the Portugal pig man story?

268
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,880
 And I was like, yeah, it was a cool story.

269
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,520
 They said that really happened.

270
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 So what happened was Ethan Ralph, apparently, I don't know how I would classify him.

271
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,200
 I think alt right.

272
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,600
 I think that's even how he classifies himself, but Ethan Ralph is an alt right.

273
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,320
 And if that labels wrong, I apologize, but I was, because I'm doing all this research

274
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,400
 and people are calling them all sorts of different things.

275
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,160
 So I'm trying to find the one thing that I saw comments.

276
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,480
 So let's just say, and if I'm wrong, put it in the YouTube comments for sure.

277
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,560
 You guys will be laughing about it anyways.

278
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,320
 Ethan Ralph alt right commentator.

279
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
 He runs with Nick Fuentes.

280
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,760
 He's kind of in that circle.

281
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,160
 Well apparently he has beef with this website called Kiwi Farms.

282
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,160
 And they were basically were set up to monitor Christian activity and then they just said,

283
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,640
 let's look at the internet as a whole and find these lowl cows.

284
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,600
 So you have Kiwi Farm and Ralph, Ethan Ralph fighting.

285
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,280
 Well apparently Ethan Ralph used to beef with this guy named Andy Worsky, who actually am

286
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
 familiar with.

287
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,400
 I remember him way back in 2016 when he was just putting out YouTube videos all the time.

288
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,640
 So you have Andy Worsky and Ethan Ralph are fighting Kiwi Farms and Ethan Ralph are fighting

289
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,400
 Ethan Ralph and Nick Fuentes are friends.

290
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,600
 And then there's me.

291
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 There's me.

292
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,280
 A guy who just wants to tell a story about a shapeshifting pig man that I found on the

293
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,200
 export and I thought was really cool.

294
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,920
 Well it turns out that because someone goes, I got a lot of comments.

295
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,360
 They go, Jason there's an actual video footage of this attack.

296
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,880
 What it was was Ethan Ralph went to Portugal because that's where Andy Worsky like his

297
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,280
 ethnicity is.

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,360
 I don't know if he was born there, but you know he's Portuguese.

299
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,520
 So either of goes there to troll Andy Worsky.

300
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,080
 And while he is there, he's like live streaming and people know his location.

301
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,560
 So two people I guess followed him to Portugal and beat him up on camera.

302
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,920
 There's a video of Ethan Ralph getting beat up and he is wearing a shirt.

303
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,120
 Like as he's getting beat up his shirt gets pulled up.

304
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,920
 So you can see his stomach and he's wearing like a sun hat and he has like a man purse

305
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,560
 on him.

306
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,320
 All of a sudden I found myself standing and like basically there's this war going on between

307
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,840
 all these factions.

308
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,640
 And I'm just walking through the middle of this battleground going, anyone seen a big

309
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
 person?

310
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,400
 I'm looking for some fun stories from my paranormal podcast.

311
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,000
 And I remember when that came out I thought I don't know what to do.

312
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,440
 Like I just, here's the thing, because the show's daily I just kept putting out episodes

313
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,880
 but in the background I'm thinking I don't know what to do.

314
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,920
 I can add an intro to it in that episode.

315
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,160
 That was one idea.

316
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,880
 But I go, it wouldn't make any sense to go hey this next story is super political.

317
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,000
 This next story is so political I wouldn't have covered it if I had known.

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,480
 But enjoy.

319
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,680
 I could have added an out, because it was a couple of days, like it took a couple of

320
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,240
 days for these comments to start rolling in.

321
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,960
 And I was like okay so now what do I do?

322
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,200
 And I go, you know what?

323
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,600
 I'll just address it on a later episode.

324
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,080
 So now here we are, 80 episodes later.

325
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,600
 I'm addressing it.

326
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,320
 I think the episode still works.

327
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 I think it's a fun story.

328
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:11,360
 And the reason, I think it's important to, oh listen, I know that I'm naive.

329
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,240
 And I know that I want this stuff to be real.

330
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,200
 Like I get that.

331
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 That's part of me.

332
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,800
 And we've told stories that turned out not to be real.

333
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,600
 I don't tell a story that I know isn't real.

334
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,400
 Unless we're going to dissect it or we're going to go this is white.

335
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,520
 Like monkeys don't exist obviously.

336
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
 I don't believe in that.

337
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,320
 But we talk about that all the time.

338
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
 We dissect it.

339
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
 We look at it.

340
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,240
 We make fun of it.

341
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,960
 And then we have the other thing that I know is fake.

342
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,680
 If I know it's fake, I would never have covered it.

343
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,760
 If I knew this was a meme, I would have never covered it.

344
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,240
 But I get that that's me.

345
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,200
 That is my ghost of Christmas past.

346
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,080
 That night, you know, the naivety of me when I want to, when I read this stuff, you know,

347
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,960
 because I want to, I was like, oh dude, this is really cool.

348
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,360
 Like even though it was creepy, it was really cool.

349
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,320
 And then it turns out it was, it was just such a weird situation to be in.

350
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 It really was.

351
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,600
 And it was a situation that I just didn't know how to rectify or if it even really needed

352
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 to be rectified.

353
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,160
 I think if everyone involved, I think most people wouldn't care.

354
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,960
 I don't think Ethan Ralph or Nick Fuentes or Andy Worsky or Kiwi Farms, I don't think

355
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
 they would care at the end of the day.

356
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,720
 I think they might all think it's funny.

357
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
 I don't know.

358
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,920
 Maybe maybe Ethan Ralph wouldn't think it was funny.

359
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,720
 I think if you, if you looked at it and you go, oh, he was tricked.

360
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,560
 This was a, he was honestly tricked by this.

361
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,800
 I think then you could go, well, that's ridiculous.

362
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,560
 Like he heard this story and he thought it was real.

363
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760
 I wasn't super stressed out about it.

364
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,680
 I just, I was puzzled more than anything.

365
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,480
 I was puzzled and I didn't know what to do next.

366
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,640
 So I just kind of let it sit there.

367
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,960
 I did put the YouTube episode in private, but I kept the podcast episode up.

368
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
 It's never been edited.

369
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
 And I still think it's a good episode.

370
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,840
 It sucks that story's fake.

371
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,080
 I wouldn't much rather have a world where there are pig people walking around, but

372
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,280
 you know, that's part of the, part of the nature of being a paranormal researcher.

373
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,000
 So that is my ghost of Christmas past.

374
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,360
 I wanted to give you guys a little bit of, well, I guess I also guess I needed to correct

375
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
 that story, right?

376
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,880
 I needed to correct the story.

377
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
 I just didn't know how.

378
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
 So there you go.

379
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
 That's how we do it.

380
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
 But you know, that's that.

381
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,480
 We have that done 80 episodes late.

382
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,800
 Let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider and jump off the highest point in Portugal.

383
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 Let's glide all the way out to a mortuary.

384
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:42,080
 Luckily, the ghost of Christmas past used to be a burglar when he was still alive.

385
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,120
 So he's going to Jimmy open this lock and we're going to walk into this morgue and

386
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,680
 make yourself comfortable around all these recently deceased bodies.

387
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,560
 I got my feet up on a table.

388
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:01,000
 The reason why we're sitting in this morgue is because it's so funny, the stuff that we

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,640
 don't cover on the show.

390
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:16,560
 I have a list of stories that are some of the most disturbing pieces of content I think

391
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,120
 I could put out.

392
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,160
 It's so funny to think about what the show at a certain point, I'm going to have to start

393
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 a second podcast.

394
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,840
 I really just come to that point and it's not.

395
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,760
 I can't let it interfere with the five episodes a week of Dead or Abba Radio.

396
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
 But well, you go.

397
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 You go.

398
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,400
 The other thing is you could just not tell those disturbing stories.

399
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,560
 I've always thought about, we're not always probably the past year of starting a side podcast

400
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:54,600
 called Dead After Dark, which is, I mean guys, seriously, I almost need to get these stupid

401
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,920
 stories off my hard drive.

402
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,240
 Just because when I'm looking through stuff, I was like, oh, Ziya, why do I keep this file

403
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
 here?

404
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,560
 I should hide this file, just dark stuff.

405
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,240
 And I guess that's the thing, I could just not do them.

406
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,160
 I really like doing the TikToks because that allows me to itch my true crime, scratch, or

407
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,240
 is it scratch my true crime itch?

408
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,480
 Because I really love true crime and I don't cover a lot on this show.

409
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,640
 Because what I've learned is that people who love paranormal don't like hearing about people

410
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
 getting brutally murdered.

411
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,960
 I've realized that it took me a couple of years.

412
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,040
 People who love true crime, it's nothing.

413
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
 It's nothing.

414
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,640
 I totally read a story about kids getting sliced in half and then switched to a ghost story.

415
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,000
 It's like a continuation and then those kids became ghosts and they haunt the house to

416
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 this day.

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
 But people who are into the paranormal, people who are into UFOs don't want to hear that

418
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 stuff at all.

419
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
 They don't want to hear any of it.

420
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,440
 And it's so funny because when I started the podcast, I thought paranormal conspiracy

421
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,320
 true crime, I talk a lot of those early episodes too about the Venn diagram of these things

422
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,920
 kind of colliding.

423
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,280
 And I think I overestimated that Venn diagram.

424
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,960
 I think true crime is more separate.

425
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,240
 I think people who are into paranormal, they can listen to the cool conspiracy theories

426
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
 and people who are into conspiracy theories can listen to the paranormal stuff.

427
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,840
 But the hardcore true crime stuff.

428
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,040
 And that's why nowadays I only do one true crime story a week.

429
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,640
 And it's not any of the gruesome stuff.

430
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
 Like Jason, I'll disagree with that.

431
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,280
 You've told some horrible stuff on here.

432
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
 Yeah, trust me.

433
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
 It's worse.

434
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,400
 Like I have these files ready to go.

435
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,840
 So I'm always thinking about doing a side podcast.

436
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,640
 But what's interesting is looking at the stuff I don't cover.

437
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:51,720
 For example, there's two stories that I've mentioned multiple times.

438
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,640
 One story people go, are you going to cover it?

439
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
 Are you going to cover it?

440
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
 I still get emailed to this day about that story.

441
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,200
 And the other one I've mentioned two or three times and nobody talks about it.

442
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,760
 And it's super interesting to me.

443
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,440
 That nobody ever even asks about the second one.

444
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,040
 The first story that I've mentioned once or twice on the podcast is Lost Summer.

445
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:20,320
 And it's a story about my personal experiences involving the world of conspiracy and the

446
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,360
 world of the paranormal.

447
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,000
 And it took place over the course of about a summer.

448
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,040
 And I will never tell that story on the podcast.

449
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:39,840
 I've never told that story to anyone ever.

450
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,080
 And the reason why is because it involves other people.

451
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,280
 So like if I'm telling a ghost story, if I'm saying, yeah, me, Josh, and how we went out

452
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,720
 ghost hunting and da da da da da da, who cares?

453
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,960
 They're not going to lose their job.

454
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,520
 The mayor of the town is not going to chase them if they have no ghost hunting.

455
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:06,800
 But if there's a conspiracy story, I can't tell that story because we're going through

456
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,560
 things together.

457
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,900
 And for me to then years later, I mean, it's been what, 12, 13 years for me to just talk

458
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,600
 about it nonchalantly on a podcast.

459
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:30,760
 And someone was at first confiding in me for me to then tell that story.

460
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,480
 When this person was talking to me, I didn't have a podcast.

461
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,280
 It was just me and this person having this conversation.

462
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,360
 There's also the thing is the story is, it's several things.

463
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,520
 It's bizarre.

464
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,120
 It's unbelievable.

465
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,920
 It's anti-climatic.

466
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,400
 And in a weird way, even though I experienced it, parts of it may not be true.

467
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,080
 Not in the sense that I made anything up, but things that this person was telling me

468
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,840
 may not have been true.

469
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,880
 So decisions that were made based on conversations, you know, you understand, someone's telling

470
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,760
 you something, some of it may be true and some of it may be false.

471
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,520
 And to be honest, I don't even know if this person is still alive.

472
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,160
 I don't even know this person is still alive.

473
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 But I feel like I would be betraying what they told me for entertainment on a podcast.

474
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,660
 That's the first story.

475
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,120
 People have asked me multiple times, are you ever going to tell a lost summer or are you

476
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,560
 ever going to tell a lost summer?

477
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,280
 And it's so funny because it's getting hyped up and it's super anti-climatic.

478
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,880
 And if I told it, you'd be like, huh, that's it?

479
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,520
 But you still have to have that.

480
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,440
 You still have to have, if someone's telling you something and I've had people email me

481
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,840
 about stories I've done, high ranking people in the world of conspiracy theory have emailed

482
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,920
 me and said, would you like more information on this topic?

483
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,040
 But you can't tell anyone about it.

484
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:18,120
 And I told them, I go, nowadays as a researcher, I research stuff to share it.

485
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,280
 See back then, lost summer, it was just about the acclamation of knowledge for myself.

486
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,700
 I told this person more recently, a couple years ago, they said, I can give you more

487
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,160
 information on it, but it's just for you.

488
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,640
 I said, I appreciate that.

489
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,120
 But the researcher I am today is to share the knowledge.

490
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,400
 So I politely declined the conversation.

491
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,720
 And they said, thank you.

492
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
 Like, I mean, that was fair.

493
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,360
 I was coming at it at that level.

494
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,720
 Now if they had said, let's talk about this and I don't care if it's on the podcast,

495
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,080
 that would have been a different situation.

496
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:58,480
 But the acclamation of knowledge for myself, that there's nothing wrong with being a researcher

497
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,120
 like that, but I'm not a researcher anymore.

498
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,480
 The story that I've mentioned a couple times that nobody ever asks about, which I think

499
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:15,560
 has the best title out of all of them, is the snuff film from outer space.

500
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:23,280
 Now the reason why I don't tell that, I've had that story ready to go for probably a

501
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,760
 year and a half to two years.

502
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,440
 It is sitting right in my ready to go file.

503
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,160
 It's kind of like my storage center.

504
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,760
 I look at it all the time.

505
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,000
 The snuff film from outer space.

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,480
 The reason why I don't cover it.

507
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:43,760
 And it's so interesting because I see a lot of parallels between myself and this man

508
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,920
 known as Timothy.

509
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,320
 There's this guy named Timothy.

510
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,600
 And I see parallels between us.

511
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,080
 He says that what happened, and see here's the thing, I don't want to go into a ton of

512
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
 detail on it.

513
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,000
 I'm still debating on whether or not to do it.

514
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:06,320
 The problem is that you cannot tell the story without completely doxing private citizens.

515
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
 There's no way to tell the story without that.

516
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,120
 Because what he believes is that he saw a murder take place on a beach and then it was

517
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,840
 turned into a staged suicide.

518
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,960
 He saw it and someone he was fishing with that night saw it.

519
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
 They covered it up.

520
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,440
 They made the body look like a suicide.

521
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,080
 But if you go to Google Earth and go to these direct coordinates, which is this house backyard.

522
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,920
 I mean, this guy goes hardcore.

523
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,800
 He lists names and addresses and personal photos of people.

524
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,600
 He's dropping this stuff all over the internet.

525
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,480
 He's dropping it all over 4chan.

526
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,800
 He's dropping it all over Quora.

527
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,040
 He's dropping it all over Reddit.

528
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,640
 Personal photos of these people.

529
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
 Addresses.

530
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,800
 If you put in this, I feel like I'm just teasing you at this point, but if you put in this

531
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,280
 Google coordinates, you will get the backyard of this house and there's bloodstain.

532
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,160
 What he says are bloodstains on the beach.

533
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,320
 And he said, the people who murdered this girl are so powerful, there are arms dealers

534
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,680
 according to him.

535
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:18,000
 The people who murdered her are so powerful that they want the image viewed from space.

536
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,560
 They want, it's basically their own personal snuff film.

537
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,200
 They want to be reminded.

538
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,080
 Now this whole thing happened quite a few years ago and I checked it.

539
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,320
 I checked it right before coming here to edit it.

540
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
 The picture's still up.

541
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,760
 The picture of the bloody beach.

542
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,800
 What's interesting is that he says, and I verified this back in the day.

543
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 He was correct.

544
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,400
 If you change it to street view, it's not there.

545
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,960
 But if you do it to the global view, it's there.

546
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,160
 He says they're using their powerful connections, this family, so they can view this snuff film

547
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
 from space.

548
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
 Let me get a date for that.

549
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,120
 I mean, I got the document right here.

550
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,280
 2015 is when it happened.

551
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,440
 It's an interesting look at a man who believes in a conspiracy theory.

552
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,200
 It's also an interesting look at a man suffering from mental illness.

553
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,320
 Because I told you kind of a very, very bare bones version of it.

554
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:19,640
 He also, the buddy with him, apparently got shot with some sort of mind control beam.

555
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,000
 And if I remember correctly, let me look at my notes here real quick.

556
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,320
 I mean, I guess I am kind of doing it as much as I can.

557
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,880
 He got mind manipulated.

558
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,320
 He said the other witness got mind manipulated and got 30 years in prison.

559
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,160
 He doesn't say what his buddy did.

560
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
 He got mind manipulated.

561
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,320
 He went to prison for 30 years.

562
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,840
 And now it's Timothy's job to stop the snuff film from outer space.

563
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
 Here's the thing.

564
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,920
 Here's the real tragic thing.

565
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,960
 And this is where I kind of see parallels between myself and Timothy.

566
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,840
 Is I did a ton of research on this.

567
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,320
 I really did look all this stuff up.

568
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,520
 I have these notes here.

569
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,480
 There was a young woman who committed suicide.

570
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,880
 He names the girl and he goes, "This girl was shot on the beach."

571
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,160
 But they made it look like she committed suicide.

572
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:15,120
 I looked it up and she did die on the day that he said she did.

573
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,560
 I couldn't verify that she died of a suicide.

574
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,600
 Very rarely will they put that in a death notice, right?

575
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
 But they have like...

576
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,280
 And the thing is, I'm looking at this story and I've been looking at it for a year and

577
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,780
 a half.

578
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,880
 And I go, or two years, however long it was, I go, "I can't tell this story without doxing

579
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,960
 these people."

580
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,800
 And this girl killed herself.

581
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:45,040
 Like this family is dealing with the tragedy of one of their loved ones taking her life.

582
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,080
 And I don't even think they know this guy's out there.

583
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,360
 I think they have no idea that Timothy is running around the internet claiming that

584
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,520
 she was murdered.

585
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,080
 Not only was she murdered, but they're controlling satellites in space so they can be reminded

586
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,800
 of that.

587
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,160
 They want to see that snuff footage from outer space.

588
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,560
 And I think it's so interesting because that's pretty much the segment.

589
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,800
 Because I did do this segment as much as I could, you know, giving you the Google cord...

590
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 See, that's the thing.

591
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,920
 Like on the one hand, there's a legal thing of me putting out stuff that can get...

592
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
 That's doxing.

593
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,800
 That's 100% doxing when I'm releasing the information of an adversarial element of a story.

594
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,120
 When I'm talking about like a haunted Kmart and I go, and I'll say this a lot of times,

595
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,040
 I don't know, like it's on 3rd Street and Claremont, so if you want to swing on by...

596
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,240
 The Kmart's not doing anything wrong.

597
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
 Right?

598
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,960
 I'm not saying that this family's doing anything wrong, but Timothy is.

599
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,080
 So if I have a podcast where I give out Google coordinates or even just put it in the show

600
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,280
 notes, even though I would be disputing the conspiracy theory and I do, I don't think

601
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,120
 what he's saying is true.

602
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,840
 And actually I know what he's saying isn't true because he changes his argument based

603
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,400
 on where he's at.

604
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,400
 Posted on Reddit as, look at this mystery, look at what's going on.

605
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,440
 He posted on 4chan as Hillary Clinton killed this girl.

606
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,560
 When he posted it on 4chan, he posted on the poll board, the Politically Incorrect Board,

607
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,920
 back in 2018, he titled it, "Information that will lead to Hillary Clinton's arrest.

608
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,240
 This blood is displayed like a sick trophy on Google Earth.

609
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,840
 The Clintons faked her suicide the next day."

610
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,400
 So that's not true.

611
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,200
 See, we can look back to his earliest versions.

612
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,520
 He changes the story for the audience, but it's still a picture.

613
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,360
 I mean, it's a Google Earth photograph of these people's backyard.

614
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:52,060
 And the girl who died, committed suicide, she's one of the members of those families.

615
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,680
 So I would basically be giving out the address of a grieving family whose young daughter

616
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,120
 killed herself.

617
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,920
 And this is why I say me and Timothy are so similar.

618
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,000
 And I hope this isn't super boring for you.

619
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,200
 I hope this isn't super boring for you.

620
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,320
 I look at this and I go, what's the difference between him looking at this and thinking that

621
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,640
 it's a conspiracy theory?

622
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,640
 What we know for a fact is that a young girl died.

623
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,720
 You know, I think she was in her 20s.

624
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,720
 I keep saying her young girl, but I'm, you know, 46.

625
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,120
 He keeps saying that she was murdered and this is a cover-up of the highest level.

626
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,400
 What's the difference between me?

627
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,720
 I remember a long time ago, I did an episode, I'll put it in the show notes, but it was

628
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,160
 about a young couple.

629
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:41,640
 They took a boat off to go to an island in the middle of the night.

630
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,520
 And there's like four photos that were taken on a cell phone of like them on this island

631
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,440
 and her standing next to this lighthouse.

632
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,760
 And then they went missing.

633
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,240
 A couple of days later, they found his body floating in the bay and she's never been

634
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
 seen again.

635
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,720
 It's a true crime story.

636
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,560
 It actually happened.

637
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,520
 It's a mystery to this day.

638
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
 Fairly recent one.

639
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
 I think it's only been in the past couple of years, right?

640
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,840
 Put it in the show notes.

641
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:19,760
 In that episode, I talk about it and then I go, what if she got sucked away by a ghost?

642
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,360
 What if some paranormal darkness was on that island?

643
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,200
 That episode's always kind of stuck with me.

644
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,040
 One, I think it's a really good story, not necessarily the way it's told it, but as a

645
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
 mystery in and of itself.

646
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,160
 But that episode's always stuck with me because at the end of the day, that's a real person

647
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,640
 who's missing.

648
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,120
 And I said a ghost might have done it.

649
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,280
 Now do I believe 100% that a ghost did it?

650
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,600
 Am I going around the internet saying that a ghost did it?

651
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 No.

652
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,800
 I mean, I did announce it on a podcast, but...

653
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,720
 And that's not the only true crime story that I've done that with.

654
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,920
 I do it a lot.

655
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,360
 I do it a lot.

656
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,120
 And so I look at the way I approach true crime.

657
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:10,360
 Dude, the TikToks, sorry, sometimes I can't even keep a straight face when I'm doing one

658
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
 of the true crime TikToks.

659
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,200
 The latest one, I had a little stuffed gingerbread man dancing around.

660
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,320
 It was about this woman, this mother who got brutally stabbed to death.

661
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,360
 I didn't set out to go, let's make the funniest TikTok.

662
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,480
 I just happened to have a stuffed gingerbread man that I got for Christmas and I thought

663
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,600
 he was cool looking.

664
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
 So I held him up in the video.

665
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,640
 And I started laughing at him.

666
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,960
 Anyways, I do look at that and I go, me?

667
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,240
 The way that all kind of spin theories.

668
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,760
 Am I really that different than Timothy?

669
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,680
 I think the difference is that I then don't go around the internet saying this is the

670
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,480
 only theory.

671
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,720
 But I mean, we've covered episodes, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but

672
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,160
 we've covered episodes where people have committed suicide and I'll go, but what if

673
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,600
 what if it was a suicide demon?

674
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 What if it was a curse of the social sciences building, all sorts of stuff, right?

675
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 So I think about that.

676
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,800
 I actually, it's funny, I should keep this article up on my Ready to Go page just to

677
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,880
 remind me that, yeah.

678
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,560
 At the end of the day, what's the difference?

679
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,600
 I guess there's a bunch of different.

680
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,400
 I'm not suffering from a crippling mental illness.

681
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
 I'm not running around the internet trying to promote this.

682
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,960
 I keep saying that but I put out a podcast every single day.

683
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,240
 It's like one of the biggest paranormal podcasts out there.

684
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,960
 I can no longer say, well, you know, more people see that stuff than they hear this

685
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
 podcast and it's not even close.

686
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,920
 I think it's a cool story.

687
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,840
 If I could, I mean, that's basically it.

688
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,360
 I've now told it in as much detail as I can.

689
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
 That's really it.

690
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,800
 The only thing I'm not giving out is the coordinates.

691
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,080
 So you, and it really, it's just photos of this backyard with what look like two big

692
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,040
 splotch stains.

693
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
 He says she was murdered.

694
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,640
 Everyone else says it was suicide at her apartment too, not that she was killed there.

695
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,820
 So yeah, I mean, if I didn't, it's an interesting story.

696
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,760
 That is the story, the snuff film from outer space.

697
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,320
 That's as much as I can tell it because yeah, you just got to be careful because again,

698
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,880
 there's a, there's a chance that the family has no idea that this guy's going around spreading

699
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
 this stuff.

700
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,200
 And it's not just the family, but the friends and the family and the community, they don't

701
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,920
 know that this guy's saying all this stuff.

702
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,600
 And I've thought about it.

703
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,520
 Would you rather not know?

704
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,200
 He's talking about it to this day.

705
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,880
 Like he's still posting stuff all over, trying to get this story to be exposed.

706
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,760
 And I think it does need to be exposed in the sense that it's not true.

707
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,040
 It needs to be exposed for being a lie.

708
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,880
 And I can clearly say that because whatever website he's on, he changes the circumstances.

709
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,880
 If it was true, then it's true everywhere.

710
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,680
 But if he goes to a place that hates Hillary Clinton and he goes, "Hillary Clinton did

711
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,820
 this," then you're obviously just changing the story to get the audience.

712
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
 And they didn't believe it either.

713
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,680
 Politically incorrect, they tore him to pieces.

714
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
 They tore him to pieces.

715
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
 They go, "That's not true.

716
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
 That's not true."

717
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,040
 They shredded him.

718
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,280
 I guess also he was a repeat caller on Info Wars back in 2018.

719
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,760
 There's a bit shoot video of that episode, but a legend has it that bit shoot video is

720
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,200
 still buffering to this day.

721
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:30,040
 I tried watching that bit shoot episode months ago and it will not load.

722
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,320
 It will not load.

723
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,440
 But it's crazy.

724
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
 It's crazy.

725
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,840
 And is there a comparison between me and him?

726
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,200
 I think in a way there is.

727
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,280
 I think in a way there is.

728
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,440
 I think in a way that sometimes I might be a little tasteless when it comes to some of

729
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,800
 my true crime stuff.

730
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,560
 I know that laugh a lot when ghosts, when I'm talking about a kid getting killed and

731
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,480
 turning into a ghost, but a lot of times we don't even know if that kid ever existed.

732
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
 That's one thing.

733
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,980
 Interesting story.

734
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
 Interesting story.

735
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,880
 There's a man out there right now who believes that there's a powerful family that is filming

736
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,200
 a snuff film shot from space.

737
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,720
 He is spending a lot of time trying to convince the rest of us that it is true, but I don't

738
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
 think it is.

739
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,520
 I think it's a sad story.

740
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,720
 I don't know why he's so fixated on it though.

741
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,520
 That's what's so weird.

742
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,320
 That's what's so weird about it.

743
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,200
 And you could go maybe he's fixated on it because he did see something.

744
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:32,080
 It was interesting because on 4chan they pointed out that when he was telling the story he

745
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,840
 goes "Yeah me and my friend just got done fishing and we caught like a 30 pound bass."

746
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,840
 And they're like "Really?

747
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,000
 That's how much of a boomer you are?

748
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,440
 You're trying to explain a conspiracy to us, but you still gotta talk about your giant

749
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,600
 fish you caught.

750
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,680
 What is this?"

751
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,080
 They tore him to pieces.

752
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,640
 Not just because the fish thing, but they're shooting holes in it.

753
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,880
 It's just such a weird story.

754
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,080
 It's not unusual though for what we see.

755
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,600
 We do see people fixate on things when we do the show.

756
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,720
 Then let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carbonicopter.

757
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,560
 We are leaving behind Timothy.

758
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,680
 We hope that he gets the help he needs.

759
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,320
 He's definitely suffering from some sort of obsessive disorder.

760
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,720
 Possible mind melting ray?

761
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,240
 That's the thing I don't ever really understand.

762
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,480
 If these people are so powerful and they know that these two guys saw it because they used

763
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,800
 the mind melting ray or the mind Mindy, whatever it was, on his buddy who then got 30 years

764
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,720
 in prison, why don't they just execute these people?

765
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,880
 If I was powerful enough, I would just kill everybody involved.

766
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
 That's totally what I would do.

767
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,480
 That's what I would do all the time.

768
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
 But anyways, that's actually a good segue.

769
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,160
 Believe it or not, that's a good segue.

770
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,560
 Let's all hop in the carbonicopter, take us up, up and away, fly us out of this morgue

771
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,360
 and all the way out too.

772
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
 The future.

773
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:03,120
 There we are.

774
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,720
 We're just sitting in the cockpit of the carbonicopter and watching the future laid

775
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,080
 out in front of us.

776
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,160
 This is a really interesting place to be.

777
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
 This will be short.

778
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,720
 I'm not going to ramble on for a long time, but it's so funny when I started this show

779
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:25,080
 a thousand episodes ago, a thousand and five episodes ago.

780
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,280
 Never would have thought it would have gotten here.

781
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,200
 It's funny, I couldn't have imagined what it is.

782
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,200
 I could imagine, I don't know what, I imagine I would still be doing a podcast of some sort,

783
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,720
 but the fact that you're listening to it is amazing.

784
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:48,600
 I'm sitting down, came home from a long walk, pulled my microphone up and started doing this.

785
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,480
 It's funny going back to where I was when I sat down to record episodes one, two and

786
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
 three.

787
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,560
 I recorded them back to back.

788
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:02,560
 The idea of sitting down and going, "I'm going to do a daily podcast, a solo daily podcast,

789
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,360
 that's nuts."

790
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,960
 I knew that I had to be daily.

791
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,360
 I knew if it was weekly I would have given up.

792
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,280
 I would have procrastinated and not done anything until the day before.

793
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,040
 I mean, I do that now.

794
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,040
 I do that now.

795
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,240
 I just do it five days a week instead of one, but I know me.

796
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,680
 I was like, "I need to be busy every single day with the podcast."

797
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,800
 If it was a weekly show, I would not be busy for five days.

798
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,800
 I'd be playing Minecraft or whatever, and then I'd rush an episode out.

799
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,440
 Now I rush out episodes five days a week, but ... Now we're here, a thousand episodes,

800
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,640
 four years later.

801
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,680
 In one sense, I guess I could imagine what it would be like, but I didn't imagine it

802
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,240
 would be like this.

803
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,160
 That makes sense.

804
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,360
 I don't even know what I thought it was going to be.

805
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:01,400
 But it's interesting because then I don't really know what it will be in the future.

806
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:12,600
 I know what I would want it to be, is I want this show to pretty much be the same.

807
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,200
 I think if you listen to ... I did an episode early on.

808
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,480
 I don't remember which one it was, but I was talking about my best episode, my worst episode.

809
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:29,920
 I don't have those anymore because I think the show has become so ... I know what makes

810
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
 a bad episode now.

811
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,360
 Early on, I didn't, and I would record them.

812
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,640
 There's a couple of episodes I was like, "Oh, that's awful.

813
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
 That even get released."

814
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,840
 I'll be honest.

815
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,680
 This episode that I'm telling you, this is my second draft.

816
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,480
 I recorded 40 minutes of a other version of this and I didn't like it.

817
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,160
 I sat in this hot closet and sweated out for 40 minutes talking about ... and different

818
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,240
 stuff actually, not even the same stories.

819
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,960
 Talked about the big man of Portugal.

820
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,320
 Then I talked about some other stuff and I said, "No, this is boring."

821
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,840
 I went outside the closet.

822
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
 I didn't go outside.

823
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
 It's like 70 degrees out there.

824
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,840
 I went outside the closet and sat and watched a little bit of YouTube and go, "Okay, let's

825
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,320
 try this again."

826
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,640
 I think now I know ... There's a whole episode about the coronavirus that's unreleased.

827
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,240
 It's a good 40 minutes and this episode came out March of 2020.

828
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,520
 Well, it didn't come out.

829
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,920
 I recorded it and I go, "It's boring."

830
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,200
 There's a lot of episodes like that that are just sitting on my hard drive.

831
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,040
 They're not entertaining.

832
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,760
 I think now I can't think of an episode in the past like 800 episodes that I think wasn't

833
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,760
 good.

834
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,200
 Do I think they're all great?

835
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,200
 No.

836
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,960
 I think some, I love the story about the tree.

837
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
 That's what's funny.

838
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,160
 I'll say, I love the story.

839
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,040
 As far as the way I told it, as far as the episode was put together, I'm not for sure.

840
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,960
 But I love the story about the tree murderer and I love the story about the kids in Miami

841
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
 versus the demons.

842
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,920
 All of these things I can just pick out.

843
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,840
 But it's like, how do I envision the show in the future?

844
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,040
 I want it to be the same.

845
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,200
 It's so funny because if you listen to those early episodes, there's no catchphrases.

846
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,440
 That's one thing I've loved about doing this show is it's evolved so naturally.

847
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,880
 There was this YouTuber I started watching recently and I watched maybe four or five

848
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,040
 videos and I was like, "How long have they been around?"

849
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,240
 And they had just started.

850
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,880
 They had just started, but they had all these catchphrases and all of these funny end jokes.

851
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,440
 And I was like, "This is so artificial."

852
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,720
 This person came in and probably has a team behind her and they had written all, like,

853
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,720
 "This is what you need.

854
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,240
 You need these type of catchphrases.

855
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,560
 You need this sign in and sign off and da da da da da."

856
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,080
 Maybe that is how people do it.

857
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,400
 But like early episodes, we don't have the vehicles.

858
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,720
 You don't have to listen to every episode.

859
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,760
 Welcome back to another episode of DidRabbit Radio.

860
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,720
 All of these things evolved over time.

861
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,240
 And that's what I like about it.

862
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,080
 You can feel it grow organically.

863
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,840
 What's funny is I had completely forgotten about the conspiracy cap.

864
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,440
 Someone recently reminded me of that.

865
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,840
 And I was like, "Oh yeah, do we have a warning conspiracy cap in like 200 episodes?"

866
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,720
 And I didn't get rid of it because I just forgot.

867
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,520
 But yeah, I couldn't have thought that it would be where it's at.

868
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,800
 But now the show seems very settled, right?

869
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,880
 All of those intro elements are the same.

870
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,880
 There's little differences.

871
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,360
 I'm a little more jokey during the intro.

872
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,560
 You know, during the telling you what the two stories are going to be.

873
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,480
 But I couldn't have guessed that it would have taken this form.

874
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,000
 I would like it to just kind of stay this way.

875
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,680
 I would like for the show to have a bigger audience that's nothing against you.

876
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,760
 Because the bigger the audience, the more things we can do.

877
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,280
 I would have always talked about this.

878
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,600
 I want to do on the road stuff.

879
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,840
 Just record out of hotel rooms.

880
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,640
 And visit some of these places.

881
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,320
 That is really, that would be, if anything, and it really wouldn't change anything about

882
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
 the show itself.

883
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,400
 See, we would still be doing five days a week show.

884
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 But imagine if we did a show, did an episode in Dudley Town, Connecticut, or Stole, Kansas,

885
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,400
 interviewing.

886
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
 I mean, it would just be so great.

887
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,880
 I would love to do like maybe every so often, not during the five days, say I like the five

888
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,480
 days a week being the same.

889
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,720
 But maybe we have like a Saturday or a Sunday interview every once in a while with people,

890
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:41,600
 real people, not authors, not paranormal researchers, but real ghost stories from people in these

891
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,680
 towns or them telling us to get out.

892
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,880
 There are no ghosts, all that stuff.

893
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,880
 I love it.

894
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,640
 I would love that, right?

895
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,120
 But I'll be honest with you.

896
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,040
 I might have mentioned this before, but I'm not for sure.

897
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:07,480
 When I came back from vacation this year, the beginning of September, I was so depressed

898
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,800
 that I didn't want to do the podcast anymore.

899
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,160
 And it was nothing against the podcast.

900
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,880
 I had one of those depressions, and these are the worst type of depressions, that wasn't

901
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,880
 caused by anything.

902
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,760
 I was just depressed.

903
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,160
 I just sit there.

904
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,940
 And I started talking about wrapping up the show.

905
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,940
 What would that look like?

906
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:36,480
 I mean, obviously, I make money from the show now that if I quit doing the show, I would

907
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,480
 have to get another job to supplement the money that I'm making from the show now.

908
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,000
 I would have to replace that income because it's become part of how I'm paying my bills

909
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,680
 and getting groceries and things like that.

910
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,720
 And I remember sitting there and I was thinking like, what does the end of the show look like?

911
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,720
 How does this end?

912
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,440
 And it was nothing against the show.

913
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:01,640
 It was just I was in that depression and I remember I kept putting out episodes because

914
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,640
 that's what I do.

915
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,440
 I put out episodes.

916
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,280
 But I was doing stuff on the back end.

917
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,320
 Usually when I do an episode, I keep multiple copies of each episode and I have it formatted

918
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
 in a certain way.

919
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,840
 I'm basically creating these barriers from data corruption.

920
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:22,720
 And I'm also creating versions of this that you can remaster it at some point.

921
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,200
 I have a raw audio.

922
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,720
 Like I have an edited version that's pretty raw.

923
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,140
 So at any point, if we start getting a bunch of money, we can do full remasters of episodes.

924
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,640
 Some of them need it.

925
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:41,520
 And I stopped doing those little things behind the scenes and I because I go, what's the

926
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
 point?

927
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
 What's the point?

928
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,840
 I'm going to be quitting this podcast soon enough.

929
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,640
 But I knew because, you know, I've struggled with depression.

930
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,000
 It doesn't happen as often as it used to.

931
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,720
 But I knew and that's why I kept putting out episodes that I wasn't depressed because

932
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
 of the show.

933
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,720
 It wasn't the show.

934
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,720
 I was just depressed.

935
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,880
 There was something chemical, most likely, and powered through it.

936
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,320
 But I do have to look at what does the end of the show look like?

937
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,840
 Like that is an interesting question to ask.

938
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,600
 What does the end of the show look like?

939
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,880
 And when I say, and I've been saying, you, some of you guys might have noticed it.

940
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,880
 I've been saying it a lot.

941
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,080
 The show is going to go on for much, much longer.

942
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,080
 We're just getting started.

943
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,560
 We're just getting started.

944
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,680
 That's a response to how I felt in September.

945
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,940
 Like, I'm saying that stuff more now.

946
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:37,280
 You guys might notice it now that I've said that out loud because I haven't been saying

947
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,520
 that more in the past couple of months.

948
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,680
 I've been saying it on live stream.

949
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,600
 I've been saying in the episodes, we're just getting started.

950
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,320
 We got so many more episodes coming out.

951
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,480
 I'm saying that because of how I felt in September where I was like, the show could

952
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:55,760
 end this week and I'd be okay.

953
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
 But that wouldn't be true.

954
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,080
 I was just depressed.

955
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,840
 I could have also said I could have lost my job this week and that would be okay.

956
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,560
 I could have nothing to eat this week and I would be okay because I was just depressed.

957
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,240
 And I pushed through it.

958
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,840
 It was only lasted about a week and a half.

959
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
 Right?

960
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
 I just pushed through it.

961
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,880
 I could have started your episodes because you need to.

962
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,600
 You can't go, I'm going to take another week off.

963
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,240
 I'd just come back from like a, quite a long break actually because I was gone visiting

964
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,240
 my mom.

965
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,480
 So, yeah, I powered through it because I knew what it was.

966
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,480
 It was a chemical depression.

967
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,960
 It wasn't, it caused by any real life events.

968
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,280
 But then I started thinking like, what does the show look like?

969
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,600
 And I honestly don't see the show ending for a long time.

970
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,120
 I have a ton of stories to cover.

971
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,160
 There's more stories all the time.

972
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,560
 Maybe some of them may be fake like the big man.

973
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,440
 But there's always more stories to cover and I love covering them.

974
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,640
 I do.

975
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:07,800
 My fear, and we'll wrap it up like this, is the last episode will come abruptly.

976
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:13,800
 There were so many times when I record an episode and I go, what if I die now?

977
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,720
 What if I died before I even edit this?

978
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,720
 That's a cool episode.

979
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,880
 What if I died before I edit it?

980
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,520
 But obviously, you know, dying is something that I have to take into account.

981
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,440
 I want this show to outlive me.

982
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,320
 Not just because I'm egotistical about the show.

983
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,680
 It's the research I want to outlive me.

984
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,040
 All of those show notes, all of those stories that people can then find stuff about.

985
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,840
 Maybe disprove a story they thought was true or maybe go down a rabbit hole of a story

986
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,520
 they never heard of before.

987
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,760
 So that's something that I've been trying to work on.

988
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:54,680
 You know, with Lipson, my podcast provider, once my bill stops getting paid, I believe

989
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,720
 everything disappears within 30 to 90 days.

990
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,520
 Like the website just, everything's gone.

991
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,400
 This isn't like a YouTube channel.

992
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,280
 You pay to have your podcast hosted.

993
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,200
 So I'm putting, you know, measures in place like that.

994
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,040
 I have relatives that have passwords and something happens to me.

995
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,680
 They can log in, maybe change it from, I pay $40 a month hosting, you know, drop it down

996
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,560
 to five or something like that.

997
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,760
 I'm currently trying to get my stuff up on the Internet Archive, but you know, I have

998
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,160
 a thousand episodes.

999
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,880
 It's taken a while.

1000
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,360
 But I am, I'm trying to look at what the show, the future, right?

1001
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,360
 The future adds to the show.

1002
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,520
 I hope it's the same.

1003
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
 I love doing the show.

1004
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,920
 I think it's a great format.

1005
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,480
 I think it definitely can be improved.

1006
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,560
 I think definitely there are things, the show's not perfect.

1007
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,880
 When I say I want it to be the same, I mean more like the feeling of it.

1008
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:56,680
 Like if all of a sudden we're bringing in 50,000 views an episode, we're making $10,000

1009
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,080
 a week.

1010
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,960
 I don't want that to change the feeling of it.

1011
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,960
 You know what I mean?

1012
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:15,400
 We may, I'd be like, okay, let's go someplace, let's get a recording studio set up.

1013
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,600
 But the man behind the mic, I can't be different.

1014
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,040
 I'll grow, I'll mature.

1015
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:27,240
 I think when I listen to those early episodes, I sound not tonally, but I get some of those

1016
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,720
 things, they sound immature.

1017
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,000
 We've done a lot of grown in four years, Jason.

1018
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
 You know what I mean?

1019
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,640
 Some of the stuff is like, dude, that's super cringe, bro.

1020
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,480
 Why'd you say that?

1021
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,360
 But I think the tone of the show is the same.

1022
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,640
 It's the story of a dude, like I've always said.

1023
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,600
 And I think this is the same thing from that very first episode to this one.

1024
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,800
 It's your friend you work with who walks up to you during lunch and goes, dude, you won't

1025
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,160
 believe what I saw on the internet today.

1026
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,200
 That's Dead Rabbit Radio.

1027
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,160
 That's the show.

1028
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,680
 And I think it's always been like that.

1029
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,760
 And I don't want that to ever change.

1030
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,840
 The recording equipment can get better.

1031
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,600
 The audio quality can get better.

1032
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,280
 You know, know how to mix stuff better.

1033
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,960
 I think I've gotten better by just doing two stories in episode.

1034
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,240
 Three stories was way too much.

1035
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,120
 I didn't have confidence.

1036
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,200
 Generally that meant that I didn't have confidence in one or more of those stories.

1037
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
 So I crammed three stories into it.

1038
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,840
 Right now the episodes are about 45 minutes long and I do two stories each and that's

1039
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,080
 perfect for me.

1040
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,880
 Those are changes that work.

1041
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,640
 I don't interrupt the story so much anymore.

1042
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,960
 You listen to early episodes like Sam the Sand Down Clown.

1043
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,840
 I step all over myself that whole episode.

1044
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,040
 I'm interrupting.

1045
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,040
 That's a really cool story.

1046
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,120
 I spend the whole time interrupting myself.

1047
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,120
 So changes like that.

1048
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,160
 And I saw those errors now.

1049
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,800
 Who knows, you know, 500 episodes from now.

1050
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,520
 Am I going to look back at these episodes and go, you made a lot of errors.

1051
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
 Hopefully, right?

1052
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
 You want to grow.

1053
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
 But anyways, I'm going on too long.

1054
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,240
 I'm going on too long.

1055
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,560
 I know you've done doing your dishes and now you're just sitting there.

1056
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,800
 But I'm trying to death-proof the show.

1057
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,800
 That's kind of something I'm in the mood.

1058
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,800
 I don't plan on dying anytime soon.

1059
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
 But nobody does.

1060
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,240
 I don't have any health problems.

1061
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,800
 I'm actually fit as a fiddle.

1062
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,880
 But it would be nice to death-proof the show.

1063
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,440
 Have it somewhere where it won't just disappear.

1064
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
 But yeah, that is the...

1065
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,560
 I kind of gave up the ghost of future.

1066
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,560
 Did he show up?

1067
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,560
 I don't remember.

1068
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,560
 I don't remember the ghost of future.

1069
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,560
 Whatever.

1070
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,720
 Is it ghost of future past?

1071
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,720
 That's X-Men.

1072
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,920
 The ghost of future Christmas.

1073
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,920
 Christmas future.

1074
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
 Whatever.

1075
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,500
 You can hear my voice is starting to get hoarse because I've been talking too long.

1076
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,080
 But I love, I love you guys.

1077
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,080
 I love you guys.

1078
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
 I really do.

1079
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,840
 I die after this episode right after I'm done editing it.

1080
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,160
 You know that.

1081
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,440
 That I love you guys.

1082
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,440
 And this has been an awesome journey.

1083
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,440
 And we are just getting started.

1084
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,440
 And I hope you guys believe that.

1085
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,440
 Because I believe it too.

1086
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,160
 I do believe the show is growing.

1087
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
 I actually know that's a fact.

1088
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,160
 I can look at the graphs.

1089
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,160
 But it's, it's...

1090
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,000
 It's going to be an awesome journey.

1091
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,400
 And I hope you stay with us.

1092
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,240
 You don't have to listen to every episode honestly.

1093
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,880
 If you pop in every couple months, check out an episode.

1094
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,640
 See if we're still here.

1095
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,640
 That's fine too.

1096
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,080
 Just keep us in your thoughts as you go to bed.

1097
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,040
 Go, "Who Jason's doing okay?"

1098
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,040
 Because I think about you guys.

1099
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
 I really do.

1100
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,040
 I really do.

1101
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,360
 I think about you guys.

1102
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,240
 I know some of you guys on a first name basis.

1103
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,400
 I know some of you guys on an internet name basis.

1104
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,920
 And some of you guys I just know are out there.

1105
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,960
 We may never interact with each other.

1106
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,680
 But I know we're part of something bigger.

1107
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,280
 And that thing is called Dead Rapper Radio.

1108
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,280
 And I appreciate.

1109
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,200
 I appreciate you being on this journey with me.

1110
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,680
 Let's go ahead and wrap it up.

1111
