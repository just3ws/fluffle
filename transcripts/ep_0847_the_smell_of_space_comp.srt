1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 What would you do if one day you woke up and you found yourself in another person's body,

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
 Zoinks?

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to outer space to take a look at a bizarre new conspiracy theory.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,180
 Astronauts have often complained about how stinky space is.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,240
 Is it possible their smelling are violent past today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:45,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
 I'm your host Jason Garvider.

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
 This is the last week before my break.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,000
 AKA, this is, I'm so sore.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Everything hurts.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,680
 I'm sitting here in a recording booth, my body aches.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,160
 I went for this big walk today.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,680
 I walked down to Walmart and got myself some Dipepsi and Batman Hot Wheel.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,360
 That's literally all I bought.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,200
 I walked two miles and got that stuff.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,480
 I'm just sore and tired.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,800
 But here I am, once again, in your eardrum, Lil Jason's hanging out inside of your Cove

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,040
 a Clave or whatever it's called up there, your cockle.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
 I don't know.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,080
 I'm dancing around in there bringing you some more paranormal news.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 And I'm not alone.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,040
 I'm not the only voice in your head.

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,200
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,200
 Let's give it up for one of our Christmas livestream contributors, Thuja Magus.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
 Thuja Magus, everyone give a big round of applause as he magically appears in your other ear.

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,120
 Thuja, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,840
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

30
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
 Or the show financially, I get it.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,800
 Just help spread the word about the show.

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
 Tell your friends, tell your family.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
 That really helps out a lot.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,160
 Yes, I said on yesterday's episode I had already done all of my Thanksgiving livestream

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 contributors.

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
 That's not true.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
 I actually made a mistake.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
 I have a couple more of you guys.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
 So if I haven't called your name yet, do not fret.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
 You'll be coming in up coming episodes.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,680
 But Thuja is our pilot today.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,440
 And Thuja, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,160
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,680
 We will drive all the way out to a small town in suburban America.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,120
 I found this story on the X-Board the other day.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,680
 It's absolutely fascinating.

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,360
 And we're going to take a look at it and say, that's, seriously bro?

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,960
 This is clearly made up.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,960
 I know you need to take a break and all, but don't get this.

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,880
 When I read this story, it did seem your initial inclination is this is impossible.

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,800
 But so funny is we cover the impossible every single day on this show twice.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
 We do two impossible stories each day.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
 And I think the limits of what, why is this story impossible?

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
 Keep that in mind.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,680
 Keep that in mind, because I tell you this incredibly impossible story.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,800
 So the other day of hair and this happened very, very recently.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
 There is this dude.

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
 We're going to call him Bin.

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,120
 So Bin is hanging out at his house and his best friend and his girlfriend show up.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
 They'll call the best friend, Marcus.

61
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,000
 We'll call him Marcus and we're going to call her Tracy.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,480
 Tracy is the girlfriend and Marcus and Tracy are standing there and they said Bin.

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,560
 You're not going to believe this.

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
 We barely believe this.

65
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,040
 If you've ever seen a Disney Channel movie, you'll probably believe it maybe.

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,240
 Or you'll find it even more unlikely because it's a Disney Channel movie.

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,480
 We've switched bodies.

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,080
 So you see me here.

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,240
 I am Marcus talking.

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,680
 I'm actually your loving girlfriend, Tracy, stuck in this body.

71
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,720
 And that over there, that should be my body and it's waving.

72
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,640
 It's doing a little waving thing.

73
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,840
 Hi, I'm Marcus.

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
 I'm Marcus.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,880
 I'm trapped in Tracy's body.

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 We switched.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,480
 At some point last night, we switched bodies.

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,960
 Now Bin doesn't believe this, right?

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
 How could you believe this?

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,040
 If your best friend and your girlfriend showed up and tried to convince you that they had

81
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,280
 switched consciousnesses.

82
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
 Conscious knee?

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,840
 What's the plural of conscious nigh?

84
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
 Anyways, that happened.

85
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
 Right?

86
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,560
 So they switched souls and they're in their new body.

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,840
 And the only, I mean, obviously you'd think they were making it up, right?

88
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,520
 Because the only time you ever see anything like this is in the movies.

89
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,440
 With aliens and ghosts and demons, we have tons of literature and religious scripts and

90
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,400
 all sorts of stuff and science, maybe with the alien thing.

91
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,680
 There's not a lot of religious scripts about aliens, but you know what I mean?

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,160
 We have all this other stuff plus movies.

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,760
 But with people switching bodies outside of Freaky Friday and then that Zac Efron movie

94
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,040
 where he switched bodies with Matthew Perry and they were hanging out.

95
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,000
 Or did they switch bodies or did he go back in time?

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I don't remember.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 It was a good movie.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,080
 I don't remember the name of it or the plot, but other than that, it was a good movie.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,160
 Very rarely outside of a Disney Channel original movie do people switch bodies.

100
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,440
 I've never read this type of account in the literature before.

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,600
 So you'd think it was fake and you would do what Ben did.

102
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,400
 He thought it was fake.

103
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,320
 And then he goes, well, I have to quiz you, right?

104
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
 Because I saw it in Freaky Friday.

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,560
 We have no other testing for this.

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,600
 So he started asking Tracy questions that only Marcus would know.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,960
 He brings Tracy aside and he's asking Tracy questions that only Marcus would know.

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,840
 And Tracy is answering questions only Marcus would know.

109
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,800
 So he's like, well, maybe Marcus is in this, but no, no, this is too weird.

110
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
 So then he pulls Marcus aside and starts asking him questions only Tracy would know.

111
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 And so on and so forth.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 And he, oh, he goes, this went on for hours, right?

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 I'm starting to run out of questions to ask him.

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
 This went on for hours.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,960
 And finally, I'm not entirely convinced, but this would have to be one of the most elaborate

116
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,760
 pranks ever set up.

117
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,760
 Like they know stuff that only their original soul person would know.

118
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,200
 I don't know what to make of this.

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,760
 And that's not even the weirdest part.

120
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,120
 Ben goes on to explain to the export.

121
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,320
 When they first showed up, they were panicking about this.

122
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,760
 They were really, really freaked out.

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,720
 As I think most people would if you woke up in someone else's body.

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,200
 But he goes, it's been about four or five days since this has happened.

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:41,880
 And over that amount of time, Tracy, who has Marcus's consciousness in her body, is starting

126
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:49,000
 to at first was acting like Marcus in Tracy's body because it is Marcus's soul in that body.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,760
 But over the past four days, Tracy, instead of acting like Marcus in her body has started

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,920
 to act like Tracy.

129
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,080
 And the same thing is happening with Marcus at first.

130
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
 This was acting like my girlfriend.

131
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,360
 But over the past four days, now Marcus is starting to act like Marcus again.

132
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,000
 What is what's going on?

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,320
 Is there any way to reverse this?

134
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,400
 I mean, obviously the answer to this would be who was a prank and they're getting tired

135
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,400
 of the prank and they're slowly reverting out of the prank and they'll explain it somehow.

136
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,760
 But he goes, I kind of want them back.

137
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,520
 I kind of want them back to normal.

138
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,080
 I don't know how to fix this.

139
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,800
 And I guess in a way they're kind of turning back to normal, but I don't understand that

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,160
 because it's still Marcus in Tracy's body.

141
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,200
 She's just starting to act like Tracy used to before the body swap.

142
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,880
 What's really interesting is someone then responded on the expert.

143
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,040
 Actually everyone first off was talking about sex.

144
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,680
 Now you get to have sex with your best friend in the body of your girlfriend.

145
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
 Could you ask for anything better?

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,440
 And that's when he goes, well, it's actually turning back into my girlfriend like personality

147
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,760
 wise is starting to act like Tracy did before the switch.

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
 Someone jumped on the export.

149
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 I thought this was really interesting.

150
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,720
 Someone jumped on the export and said, listen, what's going on is their souls did switch,

151
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:16,440
 but muscle memory is so powerful that when you take a consciousness and put it into a

152
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,760
 body that is not its own, if you took Tracy's soul and put it in Marcus's body, at first

153
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,800
 it will act 100% like Tracy simply inhabiting a new body.

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,920
 But over time, the muscle memory of that body, everything that body has done for the past

155
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,960
 19, 20 years, however old these kids are, has been Marcus related.

156
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,400
 All the little white blood cells in there had little pinnets that said Marcus and they

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,600
 were all like, yay, it's his birthday, which means it's our birthday.

158
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,360
 They were very Marcus centric.

159
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,400
 So when a new soul moves in, it's basically that's the alien part of the body.

160
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,680
 And it shows up in this guy saying the soul is so malleable.

161
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,560
 It's such a malleable force that when you put it into a new body, it will in a very

162
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,080
 short time begin to conform to the rights and the logic and the muscle memory of the

163
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,760
 old body to the point that while the personality of Tracy will never completely disappear.

164
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:26,200
 It will, for the most part, revert to being the Marcus.

165
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,480
 And every show often this new Marcus may have a glimmer, may have a vision or a memory of

166
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,120
 being a woman at some point, but it'll seem like a dream.

167
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,400
 It'll seem like not part of the reality.

168
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,880
 It will be more Marcus than Tracy.

169
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,120
 Like if you don't reverse this, you will lose pure Tracy and you will lose pure Marcus

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:57,240
 and what you'll get is something that is 98%, 95% Marcus with a 5% of Tracy remaining.

171
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,280
 That soul remaining.

172
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
 And the same thing going on.

173
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,040
 He didn't actually give the percentages, but fascinating.

174
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,360
 And we don't know how this ends, right?

175
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,520
 This was just a post on the export.

176
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,680
 We haven't seen anything to come else out of it.

177
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,160
 But I think it's so interesting because it does answer one of the questions that I've

178
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,840
 had a lot about the soul.

179
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,440
 Not "Can I switch bodies?"

180
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
 We'll get to that in a second.

181
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,400
 But I've always thought if you take a baby, if you take a human baby and I believe that

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:35,000
 humans have souls, what happens when the body itself has something different about it?

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,400
 Whether that be something like a mental deficiency or a physical deficiency or something like

184
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
 that.

185
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:49,560
 How does the soul go into a body that can't process things in a logical way?

186
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
 How does that work?

187
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
 I've always figured the soul is such a powerful, undying force and then you take it and you

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,320
 put it into a tiny body whose brain is just not working on the level of a human brain

189
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
 should.

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,840
 The brain's only capable of having like say an IQ of 65 or whatever like that.

191
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,880
 The soul itself is in there.

192
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,640
 How come the soul, this eternal being, this eternal life force, how is it trapped in this

193
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,240
 body that can't process language, like even basic language?

194
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,440
 But this would explain that.

195
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,600
 It's because the soul conforms to the physical form.

196
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,680
 The soul goes into a body that is not working at a basic human level.

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,840
 The soul is still perfectly normal, but it won't like you can't, why can't you take

198
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,360
 this soul that's been around since the dawn of existence and put it into a frail little

199
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,480
 body and then it have the knowledge and the wisdom of a human soul.

200
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,160
 Like that's something I've always been curious about because I've always thought like when

201
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,560
 these people die, like when somebody dies, if you had all of these disabilities through

202
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,000
 your life, your soul is not also disabled.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,480
 It's like back to its normal soul form.

204
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,680
 So why if you took something that was that powerful and raw and put it into something

205
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:18,320
 so frail and I don't want to use the term broken, but you know, just like not operating

206
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,760
 on a normal level, whatever that is, you know, there's all sorts of levels of physical and

207
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,080
 mental disabilities and stuff like that, whether it's like hardcore schizophrenia or you just

208
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,440
 have math disability.

209
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,360
 I wish my soul can do advanced trig, but I can't.

210
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,040
 My brain just doesn't process math as easily as it does everything else.

211
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,360
 So this would this answers that that there doesn't matter what the power level of the

212
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
 soul is.

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,640
 It's it part part of it is it gets stuck.

214
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,000
 It conforms to the physical limitations of the body.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,320
 So that's an interesting answer to that question that anyone else was asking.

216
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,200
 I've always been curious about that.

217
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,240
 Souls are powerful enough to survive after death and haunt locations for hundreds of

218
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
 years.

219
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,480
 But if you if a soul that is that powerful is in a body that can't ever really speak,

220
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,200
 you know, it just mute.

221
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,440
 How does the body not how does the soul not override the body's limitations?

222
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,640
 So that would answer that it just it doesn't.

223
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,120
 It's almost like takes the path of least resistance in the physical form.

224
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
 So I thought that was an interesting whole side of this.

225
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,280
 And then you also have the thing is, is this possible?

226
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,320
 I've never come across anything like this before.

227
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,040
 Like how common is this?

228
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,000
 And I'm wondering if that suggestion is true, like within four days, you may actually just

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,440
 revert back to the your soul is still in that other body.

230
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,960
 But you don't remember after four or five days, you spin panicking and trying to figure

231
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
 out a way to stop it.

232
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,960
 But then eventually you just become Tracy, living Tracy's life.

233
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,640
 And if you didn't interact with her in that time period, you might never know something

234
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
 happened.

235
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,200
 I wonder how common this is.

236
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,520
 I wonder if this is more common than we think and people switch bodies and then they get

237
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
 used to it.

238
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,080
 And then every so often they'll have a dream about that's weird.

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,440
 I remember waking up one day and I was like, get ready for this track meet.

240
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,400
 But it was like, I was like, dude, and I never really did track.

241
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
 I don't know.

242
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
 It's weird.

243
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,240
 And they're actually, they had swapped bodies at some point and they'd gone on with their

244
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 life.

245
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,800
 Maybe this is super common.

246
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,200
 And this is one of the few times this has been caught.

247
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,440
 This has been recorded like this dude who's into the paranormal was there right when it

248
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,520
 happened because imagine if the friends didn't have a third party that they trusted and they

249
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
 were trying to talk it out amongst each other.

250
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,720
 And then over time they just got used to it and then they forgot that they had even swapped.

251
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,960
 And who knows, they may even swap back at some point.

252
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,980
 And then they also go back through that thing where they just kind of forget and their souls

253
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,760
 kind of go back for this might be incredibly common.

254
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,080
 If it is a phenomenon like alien abductions, one of the key things about alien abductions

255
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,360
 is you forget about it.

256
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,960
 Like almost every alien story, unless they're they're just like talking to the aliens, the

257
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,480
 aliens come down and some farmer sees them in a field.

258
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 The aliens wipe people's memories.

259
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:21,360
 Alien abductions may be far more common than we know of, but 98% of them get their memory

260
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
 wiped.

261
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,320
 For all of them get their memory wiped, 98% of them never ever have an inkling that anything

262
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 happened.

263
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,040
 I wake up all the time with little scratches on my body and dots behind my ear.

264
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,520
 I used to for the longest time wake up with blood coming out from behind my ear.

265
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Not from my ear.

266
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 I know that's the thing.

267
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
 But yeah.

268
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,200
 I mean I'm just like whatever.

269
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,000
 I figured I'd cut myself shaving.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,280
 I can never answer the question was I shaving in the middle of the night, but you know it

271
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,700
 may be super common and this may be super common.

272
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,800
 We may have all at some point in our lives switched bodies with someone else and panicked

273
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,420
 about it for a couple days and felt out of place and felt like depersonalization or whatever

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,160
 and then we got used to it and kept going on with our lives.

275
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,420
 Fascinating story even though it sounds absolutely impossible because it's something we only

276
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,920
 see in the movies.

277
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
 Who knows?

278
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
 Who knows?

279
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,380
 I would love to come across other stories like this honestly.

280
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,880
 But yeah and I really love the export.

281
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
 I know a lot of people hate it.

282
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,640
 Sometimes I hate it because they just have the same stuff that suck you just threads over

283
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 and over again.

284
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,480
 But we've been getting some really good stuff out of there recently.

285
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,880
 Really really dig the export.

286
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,480
 Overall I think it is a pretty good spot to hang out.

287
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,760
 Thuja Magus, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

288
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,160
 We're leaving behind this befuddled young couple in suburbia.

289
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,740
 We can't help them right?

290
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,620
 We hope they figure it out somehow or they just get used to it.

291
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,140
 We're leaving them behind.

292
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,620
 We're headed all the way out to outer space.

297
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,360
 I know in the intro I made a comment about the smell of outer space.

298
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,760
 And even when carlos was talking about this, you saw the same comment pop up a lot.

299
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,700
 Now in the world, can you smell outer space?

300
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,420
 You got space suit on, right?

301
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,460
 If you don't have a space suit on, your lungs are outside of your body and your blood's crystallized

302
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,180
 and your eyes have exploded and all sorts of other things I saw happen in a documentary

303
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,140
 called Event Horizon.

304
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,940
 How can you smell space?

305
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,980
 It's actually some people consider it an urban legend.

306
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:56,360
 And I pulled up this YouTube video called Astronaut Chris Hadfield debunks space myths.

307
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 He's talking about one of them is what happens in human body when you're in space.

308
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,380
 And he's talking about all this stuff and he goes, "So, one of the urban legends about

309
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,340
 space, put it in urban legend, one of the solar legends about space, is that you can

310
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,840
 smell outer space."

311
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,400
 And he goes, "That's true.

312
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,440
 You can smell outer space."

313
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
 So what happens?

314
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,440
 We go, we put on our space suits and we go for these space walks.

315
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,140
 Johnson, Johnson, get back in here.

316
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,640
 He's like, "No, I'm going back home.

317
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 I'm running away.

318
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
 You guys don't like me."

319
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,420
 Little dude is space walking out, but he has that little tether and they're just holding

320
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
 it.

321
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
 They're holding it.

322
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
 He can't get too far.

323
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 They wheel him back in.

324
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,260
 You just throw in another tantrum.

325
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,140
 What happens is when you go on your space walk and then, so you have the airlock.

326
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,000
 When you put on your space suit, you go out into the, you go out into space and then you

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,880
 come back into the airlock.

328
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,920
 The door shuts and then you take your space suit off.

329
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,680
 You don't have to wear it for the rest of this time up in space.

330
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,920
 It's full of poop and pee by the time you get home.

331
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:09,040
 You take your space suit off and what you can smell immediately is the smell of space

332
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,800
 on your suit.

333
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,140
 So when you are in outer space, it does collect a smell.

334
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,820
 You can't smell it in space because you would die.

335
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,260
 But when you come back in from a space walk, so you know what your space suit smells like

336
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,500
 before you go out.

337
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
 You wash it.

338
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 You wash it with Dove detergent.

339
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,380
 It's the best detergent for astronauts.

340
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,780
 And then you know what it smells when you come back from outer space.

341
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:42,400
 It smells like burnt steak or welding material.

342
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,560
 It smells like gunpowder or brimstone.

343
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,080
 It's not a pleasant smell, but it definitely has a smell.

344
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,520
 Being in outer space, when you come back in and you take your space suit off and you smell

345
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:04,200
 it, burnt materials, welded metal together that instant like shh, that oxidized metal,

346
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,900
 a seared steak, a lot of times it's a smell of burned meat, brimstone, all of this stuff,

347
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
 right?

348
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,260
 They don't know why it smells like this.

349
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,620
 It's very interesting.

350
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,700
 This YouTube video, he says this is his theory.

351
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,500
 This is what astronaut Chris Hadfield said.

352
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,980
 He says that he believes that when you go out into space, the vacuum of space is actually

353
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:35,440
 pulling micro materials, trace metals out of the space station or the space shuttle or

354
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 whatever.

355
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,640
 And it's pulling that stuff off of your ship and it's attaching to your suit.

356
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,720
 It's just this slow off gassing of all of this man made material up in space.

357
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,040
 And when you come back in, that's what you're smelling.

358
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:58,260
 That's why it smells very metallic or very, very oxidized brimstone-y smell.

359
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,980
 I don't know what it makes space shuttles out of.

360
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,780
 I don't know if it's real cheap labor in hell or something like that.

361
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,020
 That's why they smell like that.

362
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,900
 But he goes, that's what I think the smell is.

363
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,140
 I think it's all the off gassing that comes off the vehicle.

364
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,220
 He goes, if for some reason you found yourself in space and you weren't near a vehicle, I

365
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,620
 don't think you would smell like anything.

366
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,740
 I think you're not smelling space.

367
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:24,280
 You're smelling the effect of space on the ship that you're near.

368
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,480
 And they actually do have a space candle.

369
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,760
 There's a candle you can get that you can get if you've always wanted to smell seared

370
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,920
 steak and brimstone at the same time in the comfort of your own home, not in the void

371
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
 of space.

372
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,160
 You can buy a candle for that.

373
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,720
 So that's his theory.

374
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,760
 You're not really smelling the air.

375
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,720
 You're smelling repressurized space when you're coming in and it's all the off gassing.

376
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,820
 That's the way it is from the vehicle itself.

377
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,100
 Very very interesting, right?

378
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,780
 The smell is real is Chris Hadfield's theory real.

379
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:04,580
 Well tattoos, a guy who goes by the name tattoos by Carlos has his own theory and it's a chilling

380
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
 one.

381
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,020
 It's very, very good, creepy theory.

382
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,660
 But I wanted to make sure I explained the science before at first because I know a lot

383
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,660
 of people were wondering space doesn't smell, space doesn't smell and it does.

384
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,440
 People who have been up there have said it does have a smell that attaches to your suit.

385
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
 That's how they smell it.

386
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,880
 I wanted to get that out of the way.

387
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,440
 This is what Carlos is saying.

388
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,760
 When everything is repressurized and the astronauts come back in and there are space suits and

389
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:38,600
 they take their helmets off, they smell a combination of molten metal, organic material, this seared

390
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,080
 steak smell, cling into their suits.

391
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:58,780
 He goes, "What if you had a planet teaming with organic life, an advanced planet, a technologically

392
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,700
 superior planet to what we have here on Earth.

393
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:11,140
 Maybe this planet was in our own solar system at one point and it exploded.

394
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,960
 A massive explosion tore a planet apart, creating the asteroid belt that we now see in our

395
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,560
 own solar system.

396
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:30,960
 What we're smelling is the organic material of the inhabitants of that world pulverized

397
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:39,280
 into un-viewable, unnoticeable atoms just floating around through space.

398
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,020
 All of their technology, all of the mighty wonders that they had crafted on their planet,

399
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,460
 reduced to nothing.

400
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,620
 What if that is the cause of the smell?

401
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:03,160
 When you go out for a space walk, you're actually smelling a dead civilization.

402
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,540
 Those little materials attached to the suit.

403
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,060
 In great enough numbers that when you step back into the space shuttle and you take that

404
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,080
 suit off, you get a whiff of seared steak.

405
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:22,240
 But there was really billions of humanoids living on a planet that was vaporized.

406
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,200
 You get that oxidized metal smell.

407
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,200
 These buildings, these vehicles, this technology that had been overheated to a point that it

408
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,280
 had disintegrated, but enough of those can still gather together on your space suit.

409
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,420
 It just smells weird.

410
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:53,340
 What would it smell like if a planet on that technological scale just exploded?

411
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,380
 Millions of years ago, where would all of that matter go?

412
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,740
 Where would all of those things go?

413
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,820
 They wouldn't just evaporate, even though I used that word and disintegrate multiple

414
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
 times.

415
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,740
 They're somewhere out there.

416
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:13,280
 I think you could even go so far that maybe it wouldn't even be a planet, but if some

417
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:20,440
 giant vehicle at some point exploded in our orbit and these trace minerals and these trace

418
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,000
 smells are still floating around, because they're not going to go away.

419
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,040
 They're actually preserved by space.

420
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,760
 They're going to stay in orbit.

421
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,480
 You would smell them when you're out on your space walk.

422
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,040
 What we're smelling is not off-gassing of a ship.

423
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,820
 It's actually the ghost of a long, lost, and now dead civilization.

424
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,060
 I think it's a really interesting theory.

425
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,940
 Does it hold water?

426
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
 You know what's interesting?

427
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
 I've talked a lot about this.

428
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,100
 I'm 45 years old.

429
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,140
 When I went to school back in the 80s and the 90s, but I'm talking now in elementary school,

430
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,620
 my education was ridiculously out of sorts.

431
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,740
 I changed schools every two years.

432
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,040
 I moved around all the time as a kid.

433
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,800
 I tried looking this up online in the computer, but I don't know what you're looking at, dude.

434
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,120
 Google's like, "Uh, you're an idiot."

435
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,500
 I was taught when I was a kid that there was a theory.

436
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,100
 In the theories change, right?

437
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,300
 There was a theory that between Mars and Jupiter, there's this huge asteroid belt.

438
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,740
 That's not a theory that exists.

439
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,540
 But between Mars and Jupiter, there's an asteroid belt, and I was taught that it's possible

440
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:40,180
 there was a planet there at some point that got ripped to pieces by Jupiter or some other

441
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,260
 force, most likely Jupiter, right?

442
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,660
 And then it disappeared.

443
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,980
 Well, it's still there.

444
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
 It's just a bunch of asteroids.

445
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
 I had heard that.

446
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,740
 And then when I tried looking it up today, everything said, "Well, Jupiter might have

447
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
 flung."

448
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,100
 There's evidence that there used to be another planet that Jupiter kind of bullied out of

449
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
 the solar system.

450
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
 Get out of here.

451
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
 No one lives here.

452
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
 It's like, "Aww."

453
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
 It's flown away.

454
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,660
 They think that a planet may have been here in its infancy, and it got turned into an exoplanet

455
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,460
 and just floated away through the solar system.

456
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:17,100
 But I was taught that now Google, my type of Google is not being my friend.

457
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,100
 It doesn't seem like that is a theory nowadays.

458
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,540
 But I was also taught that whales lived to be 500 years old and Venus had jungles on

459
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
 it.

460
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,420
 So I know that my education as a kid was not the greatest.

461
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,260
 But even that aside, let's say it wasn't a planetary explosion, just a large enough

462
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,940
 vehicle in our orbit, if that had some sort of calamity, would it still leave these odors

463
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
 around to be detected?

464
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,620
 Very, very interesting story.

465
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,060
 I love coming across these theories like this, right?

466
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,140
 It's something I never would have considered.

467
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:52,580
 And I personally didn't know that space had a smell.

468
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,060
 But could it be because of this?

469
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,940
 And then, you know, we'll wrap it up like this.

470
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,900
 I had a little personal theory of my own.

471
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,900
 The idea when Chris Hatfield said, "It smells like brimstone."

472
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:13,060
 Brimstone is usually a smell that the paranormal and the religious associate with the devil

473
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
 and with hell.

474
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:20,980
 I don't know how much of that is listed in religious texts, the actual smell of brimstone.

475
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:27,260
 I don't know how much of that is added on by Renaissance authors later on, honestly.

476
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,740
 But there is a thing, like when you look at the original definition of hell, it's separation

477
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,740
 from God.

478
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:40,380
 It's not necessarily this place of fiery torment and the original versions of most religions.

479
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
 It's not actually on fire.

480
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,580
 It's something that is kind of added in later books and definitely added in by Renaissance

481
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,420
 authors and stuff like that.

482
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,100
 It's complete separation from God.

483
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,380
 It's being alone.

484
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,860
 Like you die and you're in an infinite void alone and you don't get to see anyone and

485
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,900
 you don't get to be near the Creator.

486
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,220
 Because who cares if you're burning for eternity?

487
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,300
 Like pain, eventually you'll get used to it.

488
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,300
 You're like, "Oh, I'm waking up."

489
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,980
 You're like, "They didn't make it a little bit out of the flames."

490
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,420
 But the loneliness never goes away.

491
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,020
 So the idea was that when you die and you go to hell, you're going to be separated from

492
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,020
 God forever.

493
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:29,360
 I can't think of anything that sums that up any more than you dying.

494
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,820
 You having some sort of trip or fall or someone shoot you or, I mean, you're not to keep listing

495
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
 ways that you die.

496
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,380
 You're like, "Great, Jason, really uplifting episode.

497
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,740
 I'm already afraid that I might have switched bodies three or four times throughout my life

498
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
 and now this."

499
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,980
 You die and you don't end up with some devil and red tights poking you with a pitchfork.

500
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,860
 You're like, "Ah, you're floating through space."

501
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,700
 You die and the next thing you know, you're in the void of space.

502
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,860
 It's cold and it's vast and it's lonely.

503
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,060
 I'm not saying your actual body.

504
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,900
 I'm not saying if you got hit by a car, you go, "Woo!"

505
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,340
 Your body floats up there, but your soul is there in space.

506
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,900
 You go, "Jason, that's kind of cool, man.

507
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,140
 I've seen Star Trek and stuff.

508
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,540
 I can see Nebulae floating there and I can see like Supernovas."

509
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,740
 Those things are so rare.

510
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,180
 The universe is so huge that I could pick you up and throw you into space and the chances

511
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,900
 of you ever being able to see another planet with your naked eye as you leave Earth would

512
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,620
 be slim to none.

513
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,700
 All those photos of Nebulae, first off, Star Trek, science fiction is not real.

514
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,940
 Secondly, all those photos of the Crab Nebulae lens, that's so photoshopped.

515
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,980
 A lot of that is all of these data points that they interpret into some sort of image

516
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,660
 and then they do all sorts of color corrections.

517
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,360
 If you were in the Starship Enterprise, you wouldn't be like, "Whoa, look, we're flying

518
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,940
 by the Crab Nebulae."

519
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,740
 You would obviously know that it wasn't there.

520
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,140
 They're not idiots, but it wouldn't look like it does.

521
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,940
 And again, if you just went in a random direction, the chances of you ever seeing anything like

522
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,660
 that, you would most likely fly through the void forever and never come across another

523
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,860
 planet or a star.

524
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:29,100
 You would just be in the blackness of space floating forever.

525
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,060
 And that does sound like the original version of hell.

526
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:39,100
 Really, just being alone outside of God's presence without seeing any of his works floating,

527
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,900
 that is actually saying that you float, right?

528
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,820
 It doesn't say like aliens will laugh at you.

529
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,380
 It doesn't say that in the book of Job.

530
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
 But you know what I mean?

531
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,100
 Like just floating through the emptiness of space, not seeing anything else.

532
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,820
 Your consciousness just leaving the planet that you loved so much and you were taken

533
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
 so quickly from.

534
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,540
 And there you go.

535
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,420
 That is hell in space and that would match up with the whole brimstone idea as well.

536
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,300
 Just a theory, just something I came up with when they mentioned the word brimstone.

537
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,980
 Just something that popped in my head.

538
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
 Fascinating theory.

539
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,300
 You know, my mind's creepy.

540
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,140
 Carlos, that one is very evocative that there was a previous civilization somewhere around

541
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,140
 here.

542
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,540
 I'm not adverse to that, honestly.

543
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,700
 I think there's a chance that Earth wasn't humans' actual home.

544
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,140
 We did an episode on that not too long ago.

545
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,180
 Like the fact that humans have back pain and we don't react well to the gravity here and

546
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,660
 the way we age does make it look like we didn't evolve here.

547
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,820
 I find that a very interesting theory.

548
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,460
 Or just the idea that even astronauts up in space, they can go on these spacewalks and

549
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,300
 even they are confronted by mysteries every single day.

550
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,900
 These people who are literally on the final frontier.

551
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,580
 Even they go out on these spacewalks and they come back in and they take their high-tech

552
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,100
 space suit off and they're standing in this billion-dollar space station and they go,

553
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
 "Hmm.

554
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:03,060
 Wonder what's causing that smell?"

555
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,340
 Even they, with all the technology at their disposal, they're doing these spacewalks,

556
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,180
 they're in a billion-dollar space station.

557
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,860
 Even they take out their space suit and they get a whiff of that smell and they're confronted

558
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,020
 with these mysteries.

559
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,300
 These people who are putting their lives on the line to expand human knowledge.

560
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,800
 Even they don't know everything.

561
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,180
 Even they can go, "Hmm.

562
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,180
 I wonder what causes that smell?"

563
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,660
 No one knows the answer.

564
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,140
 It's one of those true mysteries that doesn't really affect our lives in any meaningful

565
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:39,420
 way, but makes us wonder, "What is the truth?

566
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,780
 Will we ever know it?

567
00:33:41,780 --> 00:34:08,080
 Even if we discover it, will we admit that it's true?"

568
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:26,480

569
