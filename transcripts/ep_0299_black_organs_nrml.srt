1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A German fairy tale tells us what happens when a man learns the language of animals.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a look at a bizarre conspiracy theory that has traveled around the world.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Is it possible that every time a black person dies,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 it's really a white person killing them to steal their organs today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 One more day till dimensional merge.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Not actually the dimension is gonna merge tomorrow,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 but I'm putting that off one more day.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 It's a fairly complicated story.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 If people know who Chris Chan is,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 you know there's like what, a decade and a half worth of material involving Chris.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So you can understand why this story is taking a while.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 But anyways, we're gonna definitely do that one tomorrow.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 But before we get started, we got two new Patreons I want to give a shout out to.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We have Backdoor Burglar, famed for all of his break-ins using the backdoor.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 And I assume there's no sexual connotation there.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And then William Thompson.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 He is also a Patreon supporter.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 So I wanted to thank you guys so much for supporting the Patreon.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 It means a lot.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Really takes a lot of weight off of doing the show.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 I think I'm gonna invest in some gear.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I think I'm gonna use the money to invest some gear.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I really wanted to start doing interviews,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 but I'd rather have in-person interviews.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I would need, I just need like a little mixer to do that.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And I've made enough money on the Patreon to buy a mixer.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I appreciate that. It really is being used for the show.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So let's go ahead and get started with our episode here.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Again, thank you guys so much.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And thank you to all my listeners, actually.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Whether or not you donate to the Patreon,

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I really, really appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And word of mouth helps a lot.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 If you can't donate to the Patreon, just get the word out.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Totally cool, man. I totally get it.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 So let's go ahead and get started with our first story here.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Now, our first story, I'm gonna tell you the story of the language of the beast.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And I want you to try to predict the ending.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 The moral of this story.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 I want you to try to predict it.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 There's a lot of twists and turns.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So I think every time there's a pivotal moment in the story,

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 you're gonna have to reassess what the ending is.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But I want to see if you guys can predict it.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 If you can accurately predict the ending or the moral of the story,

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I'll buy you a Coke.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 We're going back.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 This was written in a book called The Crimson Fairy Book,

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 which obviously a little ominous.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 This is an actual German folktale that was collected in a book back in 1903.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So this is totally legit.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 This isn't something someone busted out on the internet.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 This is totally legit fairy tale that existed long before 1903.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And then some guy got together and wrote them all down.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 So let us travel back into rural Germany.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Little German hill.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 There's no specified town because, you know, it's a fairy tale.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 You kind of want it to be a universal.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 We're on a little grass hill.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And there is a bunch of sheep coming up, walking up over the hill.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And then a shepherd, a magnificent shepherd.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He's just an ordinary guy. He's not magnificent.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 He's just a normal shepherd.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 He's walking over the hill.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I want this to be all cinematic for you guys.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Blue sky in the background.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 He's walking up over the hill.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 So the shepherd, he doesn't have a name.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So we'll call him Wilheim.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And then we got William.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I guess that's kind of the same thing.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Right.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Anyways, Wilheim, we'll just call him Will, whatever.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Will is walking up over this hill with all of his sheep.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Right.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And he's spying.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He's looking around and he's like, yeah, I'm a job.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 You know, it's a job.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's a job.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Like this isn't what I wanted to be.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I always wanted to be a potter, but I'm a shepherd.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 So what are you going to do about it?

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 He turns to the camera and gives that little dialogue.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I don't know where that came from.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 That doesn't happen.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That's not in the story.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 The shepherd comes over the hill with his sheep.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 That's what I'm trying to say.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I can't throw you too many curveballs.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Otherwise you'll be like, I can't predict the end of the story.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 You made up half of it.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So the shepherd is coming over the hill.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Now he sees off in the distance a forest fire and he's like, oh dude, that sucks.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Like there's pairs over there and like, okay, think about it.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Nowadays when there's a forest fire, you're like, oh, you know, I have to deal with smoke

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 in the area for a while and it kind of sucks.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Back then a forest fire would be the equivalent of every Walmart burning down.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Like you needed the forest to get your food and to forge for stuff.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Nowadays when there's a forest fire, people were just like, okay, to be fair, unless you

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 live in that forest, if you have a house in that forest, you're a little more than,

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 but for most people it's just kind of like, oh, that sucks.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 So anyways, he's watching the livelihood burn.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Someone else's livelihood.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 He's just a shepherd, you know.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 But anyway, so he runs into the burning forest.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Now he has his staff and he leaves all the sheep up on the hill, right?

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And he runs in the forest and he sees a snake in the tree or in a tree because it's a forest.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 There's a snake in a tree and all around the tree that the snake is trapped in is on fire.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And Will's like, oh man, that sucks.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Like I feel bad for that snake.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 If only there was some way I could get to save the snake.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And he thinks about it for a second and he goes, aha, I have this staff.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I have this six foot long staff.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So he holds it out and the snake hops onto the staff.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Like he's holding it out over the fire, obviously.

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And he's not holding it through the fire.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 The snake jumps on the staff and like slithers down the staff.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And Will's like, oh, that's perfect.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I have saved this snake.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And then he realizes there is a snake slithering down his staff.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And it slithers up his arm and then coils itself around his neck.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And he stood there quietly.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Actually, he slowly walked away because there's a fire raging.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He leaves the forest.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But he's thinking this snake's going to kill me.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And then the snake goes, thank you so much for rescuing me.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm not going to do that.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 I'm not going to keep doing that voice. That's annoying.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And then goes in a normal human voice.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 My father is king of the snakes.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And because you rescued me, if you take me home,

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 my father will give you anything you ask for.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But I'll tell you what you should ask for.

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 You should ask for the language of beasts.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I can't really say that word correctly.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So the language of animals.

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 You can talk to animals, right?

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And so William goes, that, okay, that is fair.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 First off, he's like, whoa, it's talking snake.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And then he goes, oh, so you know this, you're related to the king?

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Yeah, sure. I'll take you home.

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I'll get some treasure.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And the snake's like, yes.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But ask for the language of beasts.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Beasts.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 That's what the snake does.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And then from then on, I use this word animals.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 So he ends up walking.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 The snake shows him where the kingdom is of the snakes.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And they get to this giant archway that's made of nothing but snakes,

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 which would be a lousy job.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Because imagine if you were like emperor of Rome

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 and then you hired a bunch of people to just be your door.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And they just saw how to climb all over until it got showed up.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So they show up the snakes, move out of the way.

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 The shepherd and the snake walk through.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And the king's like, oh, thank God, well, he sees him first.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 He wasn't just having an orgasm in the corner.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 The snake looks over and sees the pair come in the room.

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And he goes, oh, yes. Thank you.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Thank you so much. You brought my daughter home.

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Now at this point in the story, I stopped and I go, that's interesting

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 because when I was reading the story, I wasn't picturing a female snake.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 The snake, there was no clarification what the gender of the snake was

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 when it first showed up.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But then once the dad said, oh, thanks, you brought my daughter home,

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I immediately imagined the sexiest snake possible.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Like this hot princess snake with like big eyelashes, like a cartoon snake.

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So anyways, once the story said that I was like, oh, it was a girl.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So then I mentioned they walk in, his hair is all messed up.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 She's smoking a cigarette. She's smoking with her little tail.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And the dad's like, oh, thank God you brought my daughter home.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Took you quite a long time. Where were you guys for a couple of hours?

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And the shepherd's like, listen, man, it was a crazy night, crazy night.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And the daughter snake's all relaxed. She's like, oh, thanks.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 So she falls off. She's, she can't even move at this point.

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Yeah, I was just now imagining a sexy snake with big eyelashes.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But anyways, it doesn't matter because he's not banging the snake.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 That's not a subplot of the story. Again, I had,

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I had a subplot of my fan fiction where they like go off on this jaunty and adventure.

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 John, what the hell is that jaunty and adventure? Anyways, anyways,

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 so the snake goes, dad, I was saved by this handsome, strong, well endowed shepherd.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 You have to give him anything that he wants. And this, the king goes, yeah, of course, dude, what do you want?

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 He shepherd goes, I want the language of the animals and the king goes, now I don't want to give that to you.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Like I will, you, you won't, you don't want that because if I give you that, there's a big catch to it.

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And the shepherd's like, I really want the language of the animals.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And then we don't, that went back and forth for a while and the king says, okay, listen, I will give you the language of the animals.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 But here's the catch. If you tell any other human that you can speak to animals, you will die on the spot.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 There's no wiggling around that. I'm a snake and I know wiggling. You can't do it.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And the shepherd goes, fine, dude, totally, I will do that. I will never tell anyone else.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And the king was like, okay, but you will and you will die on the spot.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 So then the snake goes open your mouth and dude opens his mouth. The snake spits in his mouth.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And you know, it's a German fairy tale. So of course, there's going to be some weird fetish stuff in here.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And the snake, the king goes, now spit in my mouth. The shepherd's up, and the snake is like, okay, I'm going to spit in your mouth again.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And then the king goes, you can now understand the language of animals.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Now a little bit of a weird thing. He hasn't seemed to have a hard time talking to snakes.

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 So I don't know, like, why these dudes are able to talk to him. But I guess the story has to start somewhere.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 That's just the beginning. So the dude, I'm going to try to catch this up because that took much, much longer than I thought it would.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Shepherd leaves and he starts walking through the countryside and he hears all the animals talking just about random stuff.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Very boring. Because if you walk through town, what do people talk about? Random stuff.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He goes back to his flock and his sheep are stupid. So they're not really saying anything. And he goes to take a nap.

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And he hears these two ravens flying. They land on a branch nearby and they go, look at that shepherd there.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Sleeping away. If only he knew underneath him, like a couple feet underneath him, was a vast treasure.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 The shepherd heard that, jumped up, dug up the treasure and became the richest man in the land.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 More money than anyone else had. The story then fast-forwards 10, 15 years.

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 He's married. He has a bunch of land. Well respected in the area.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And there's a giant party going on. This is a weird subplot. There's a giant party going on.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 There's a giant party going on. He goes to the party with his wife.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And there's a key detail about his wife, too, that is also not listed until later.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 But they go to the... She's not a snake. They go to this big party and while they're at the party,

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 the shepherd's walking around. He's not a shepherd now. He's a rich, rich man.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He's walking by and he sees some dogs, like some guard dogs and some wolves conversing.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And the wolves go, hey dude, dude, hey, I got a plan. Let us in tonight and we will kill all the sheep.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And the dogs are like, that's a terrible plan. And the wolves are like, you didn't let me finish.

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 We'll kill the sheep and then you get to eat half of them and we eat half of them.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And the dogs are like, it has been a long time since we've actually had a real bloody meal.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 So they're conspiring and then he sees this old hound dog walk up and go, as long as I have two teeth,

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I will defend my master's property. And the shepherd's like, very, very good.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So then he goes to the owner of the property and goes, hey listen, man, I got a jet.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I got to bounce out, but kill all your dogs, except for the old one.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Dude, what are you talking about? He's like, trust me. And then he leaves. That really has nothing to do with the story.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's almost like this weird and spiritual wolf drool can't melt wooden fences.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Like why is this just like an inside job? And I'm wondering if that was like a common fear in Germany back in the time,

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 where that you're a cheap would get attacked and you'd be like, oh, that's weird.

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 I have some of the best guard dogs in the business.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And I wonder if people thought their guard dogs were like sleeper agents with the wolves,

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 because that has nothing to do with the rest of the story. That's a bizarre detail.

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So the dude, the shepherd is riding home from this party, right? He's riding home with his wife.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And his horse is probably a good, I don't know, 10, 15 feet in front of his wife's horse.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 They're just riding down this trail. And so the shepherd's riding this horse and he looks back and he sees his wife's horse.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And again, it's a bit back. And shepherd's horse looks back and goes, what's taking you so long, dude?

236
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Why are you like, why are you 10 feet behind us? Why aren't you caught up with us?

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And the wife's horse goes, are you kidding me? Look at the guy that you're carrying.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 He's very thin and healthy. I'm carrying someone who weighs as much as three ordinary humans.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And at that, the shepherd looks back, he looks at his wife, he hears what the horse says and starts laughing super loud.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 He thinks it's the funniest thing he ever heard. Now again, they never revealed that the wife was overweight.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Like they left, that's another bizarre detail they left out until the quote unquote punchline.

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He's laughing and then he stops himself and he's just riding his horse and the wife makes her horse, poor horse, catch up to him.

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And she goes, why are you laughing? And he goes, that's nothing. There's nothing. There's just nothing.

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And she goes, no, why are you laughing? Like I saw you look back at me and you started laughing really hard.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And he's like, it was nothing. I was remembering about that time I had all those dogs murdered and she's like, well, okay, that was kind of funny.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But no, why were you laughing? I saw you look back and you were laughing.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And he's like, listen, I was just thinking of a joke that I heard. I wasn't laughing at you. I was just laughing.

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And this goes on for miles where she keeps saying, why were you laughing? And he's like, dude, just drop it.

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 She's like, why are you laughing? Come on, just drop it. And so they, so eventually they're getting closer to the house and he goes, listen,

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 if I tell you why I was laughing, I will drop dead.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So can we just just end this like, I can't tell you why I was laughing because I will die on the spot.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And that makes her want, obviously that makes her want to know why he was laughing even more.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And he's like, I can't tell you I will die. Yes, I was laughing at something, but I will die if I tell you.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And she is now there. You got two miles left to get home. Tell me why you're laughing. Tell me why you're laughing.

255
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Tell me why you're laughing. So he gets home, gets off his horse, pets it.

256
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And then he tells one of his servants, go get me a coffin. Go get me a coffin.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Servant runs, apparently they have these things sent around his farm. They go, they fetch him a coffin, they set it out on the front porch.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And to end this story, I can't paraphrase it, but let me just read it to you.

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 That was written down in 1903 in a book of German fairy tales, known as the Crimson Fairy Book.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 See, I will lay myself down in this coffin and will then tell you why I laughed.

261
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 For as soon as I have told you, I shall surely die.

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So he lay down in the coffin. And while he took a last look around him, his old dog came out from the farm and sat down by him and whined.

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 When the master saw this, he called to his wife, bringing a piece of bread to give to the dog.

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 The wife brought some bread and threw it to the dog, but he would not look at it.

265
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Then the farm rooster came and pecked at the bread.

266
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 But the dog said to it, "Ritchard Glutton, you can eat like that when you see that your master is dying?"

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 The rooster answered, "Let him die if he is so stupid."

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I have a hundred wives, which I call together when I find a grain of corn.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And as soon as they are there, I swallow it myself.

270
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Should one of them dare to be angry, I would give her a lesson with my beak.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 He has only one wife, and he cannot keep her in order.

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 As soon as the man understood this, he got up out of the coffin, seized the stick, and called his wife into the room,

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 saying, "Come, and I will tell you what you so much want to know."

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And then he began to beat her with the stick, saying with each blow, "It is that wife, it is that."

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And in this way, he taught her never again to ask why he laughed.

276
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 The end.

277
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 What is up with that story?

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Why does that story involve talking animals at all?

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 I get the fact that he had the chicken, the rooster, whatever it was, had to explain to him how to take care of your wife.

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That story takes place over the course of 15 years, and the moral of the story has nothing to do with him.

281
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 What does?

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 The moral of the story is, don't let your wife ask you why you laughed.

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 The moral of the story is, you shouldn't let women push you around.

284
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 That has nothing to do with saving snakes from the tree.

285
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 There's nothing to do with stopping an inside job involving the murder of sheep.

286
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Well, that is a German fairy tale.

287
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Could you imagine hearing that when you were six?

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 You're like, "Oh, can you tell me the story about the talking snakes, Papa?"

289
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And he's like, "Yes, I will. I will."

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And the mom's like, "Howering in the kitchen?"

291
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 She's like, "No, not this story again."

292
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 We are leaving Germany. We do stop him. We go in there the last minute.

293
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 We're like, "Dude, don't do that. Put the stick down. Don't listen to the chicken."

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 He's like, "What? You know the language of beasts?"

295
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 We're like, "Yeah, yeah, we're silent observers."

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 But we can't let you chase your wife around with the stick.

297
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Don't do that. We sit them down. They go to marriage counseling. Everything works out.

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And I'm like, "I'm taking this rooster with us, because this rooster is just going to keep giving bad advice."

299
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Rooster hops in to the carbonar copter with us, keeps his bread. We're taking off.

300
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 We're leaving Germany. And that's when you notice I have a suspicious, like, moving bag.

301
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 You're like, "Snake Princess isn't in that bag. Is it?"

302
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Anyways, we're flying. I'm moving the bag away. We're flying. We leave Germany.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 We are going to a hospital. General hospital.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 All the doctors are hot, and all the nurses are super sexy. That show's still even on.

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I'm sure you're up watching that show. But anyways, we go to General Hospital.

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 The lighting is really soft, and the music is really annoying.

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But we're walking around General Hospital. And in General Hospital, most of you guys are like,

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 "What the hell is General Hospital?" We're at Grey's Anatomy.

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 We're at Grey's Anatomy Hospital in Milwaukee. I don't know.

310
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 So we're in a hospital, is what I'm trying to say.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And we're walking around, and we see a white ward. And we're like, "Oh, what's that? Interesting thing."

312
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 We see a white ward, okay? And it is a ward of the hospital that's only dedicated to white people.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's what I'm trying to get at. We go in. We have a talking chicken and a sexy snake.

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So I admit I have a snake. We sneak into... The snake is disguised as one of those medical staffs.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 We're doctors, right? We walk into the white ward. There's a bunch of white people there.

316
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And pretty self-explanatory. And they're like all going, "Oh, my guts. I need a liver transplant.

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I am super rich, and I'm wealthy, and I'm white, but my liver is shot.

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 My liver sucks, right? I need a new liver, and all the white doctors are standing around,

319
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and they're like, "Man, all of these white people need these organs, but not just any organs.

320
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 They need genetically superior organs." And there's only one way to get a genetically superior organ.

321
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 We have to take it from a black person.

322
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 So the white dudes who are losing their organs, their organs don't work, right?

323
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Then the white doctor... Well, the white patients go, "I really need this liver, but I want it to be a black dude's liver."

324
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Because, one, they're genetically superior to us whites, and two, they're easy to get.

325
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 They will then call up what is known as a researcher.

326
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 So then someone will go through all the DMV files, find out if you have an organ donor card, and then you will have an accident.

327
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And then a couple days later, a black man's liver is delivered to the white wing of the hospital.

328
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 The doctors sew him up, and the guy's like, "Oh, man, my liver feels so good.

329
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Now I can go and be racist for another 20 years. Thank you, white doctors.

330
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Thank you for saving my very, very precious white life."

331
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Now, as ridiculous as that scenario sounds, it is a growing conspiracy theory in parts of the black community.

332
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And when I first came across it, it was on a YouTube video, of course, and I was like, "There's a little YouTube video.

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It's a clip of some... Dick Gregory, who was a comedian, an African-American comedian, was in the clip.

334
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 He's talking about, "Yes, black people are being killed for their organs."

335
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And then you have some other people. It's a clip from something longer, but I don't know what it's a clip from.

336
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 But the theory is that it has all of those things. Black organs are genetically superior to white organs, or really any other race,

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 that if a black person has an organ donor card, they actually become target for assassination.

338
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Drive-by shootings, car accidents, suicides. These are all tricks to get the organs out of black people, to put into white people,

339
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 because they want those organs.

340
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And so I'm watching the YouTube video and I'm like, "This is hilarious. This is an obvious conspiracy theory.

341
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 There's nothing to back this up at all, because just by really not even investigating it, there's a couple key problems with it.

342
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 One, just because you can pull... Oh, and they also say that, and this is an interesting part of it too,

343
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 when the police swab your... So anytime you get arrested in America, at least, they can...

344
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And it might depend on different jurisdictions, but for the most part, when you get arrested, they take photos of you,

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 they take photos of any tattoos you have, and they swab your mouth for DNA. Put you in a DNA database.

346
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Now, there's been a lot of controversy, because you get arrested, you get your DNA swabbed, but then if you are found not guilty,

347
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 they don't destroy the swab. They still have your DNA on file, and there's been a lot of lawsuits trying to get it,

348
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 so if you're found not guilty, they have to destroy all that stuff.

349
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 But anyways, they take your DNA, and they say, this is part of the theory too, they put your DNA into a system,

350
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 and what it does is not only does it help them when a murder happens, they can go through your DNA,

351
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 or if they want to frame you for a murder as well, but they put it in a system, and then it goes, "Bip, bup, bup, bup, bup!"

352
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 The computer says that this is your blood type, and this is what your organs are like, not like whether or not they're healthy,

353
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 but whether or not they're compatible with someone else. So then you have these giant...

354
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So then you have, go back to the hospital, the white wing, and when someone comes in and they go,

355
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 "Oh, no, I need a new kidney." You know, Nog from Deep Space Nine just died the other day?

356
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 He actually had kidney failure. I guess he only had one kidney, and it was all jacked up, so he's on dialysis for a long time.

357
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Little Nog, if you haven't watched Deep Space Nine, you're doing yourself a real disservice.

358
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 That's one of the best sci-fi shows on television, far, far better than Next Generation, far better.

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 But anyway, so sorry, sorry Nog, and sorry that you had to be involved in this bizarre conspiracy theory,

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 but the idea is that when they take your DNA swab, they're actually selling your information to these white body brokers.

361
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 So you have genetically superior black organs, you have all of your DNA on file so they can do analysis to see if your organs will match,

362
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 if you'll be the perfect donor, and you have an organ donor card, and so then these guys come out and kill you.

363
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Now, I'm reading the conspiracy theory, and I go, "This is foolish for a couple reasons.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 One, if you're involved in murdering people for their organs, you don't care whether or not they have organ donor cards."

365
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 That wouldn't be a stumbling block for you.

366
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Oh no, I really want to take all this human life, but they haven't filled out the appropriate paperwork.

367
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Ah, shh, that just doesn't wash.

368
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Two, I don't believe that any particular race has superior genetic organs as opposed to any other race.

369
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I think that's biologically not true, and I dismiss that out of hand.

370
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So I dismiss that out of hand as well, I dismiss the fact that they would wait for organ cards,

371
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I dismiss the fact that the DNA analysis is being sold to these white body brokers, stuff like that.

372
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 So, as I'm researching it though, I research it.

373
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Keep looking to know it, right?

374
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I stand by all my original statements, absolutely.

375
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 But, there is one thing as I was researching it, and as I was dismissing it in my head, there was one very, very sad fact

376
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 that wasn't mentioned in the YouTube video, but is pretty much well known, and that is unfortunately

377
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 that poor life is cheap, and there's a lot of poor people in Africa.

378
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So we're going to leave America, we're going to leave the conspiracy theories there behind.

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 We're going to go to Africa now.

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 There's been a lot of people, a lot of migrants leaving Africa to try to make their way to Israel

381
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 to get some hope of a better life.

382
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 But a lot of them don't make it.

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Now some of them don't make it because they stop and they find somewhere else along the way.

384
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Some of them don't make it because they run out of supplies and die in the desert.

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 But, there's been issues where you had a journalist who was working in the regions surrounding Israel and Israel.

386
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And locals were saying, "You want a story? Come look at this."

387
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And they'd lead the journalist to this thing, it was a pit of bodies.

388
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Pit of bodies of migrants from Africa.

389
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And the journalist was like, "What happened here?"

390
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And they're like, "Well, there's a tribe in the area that Jason is going to mispronounce. It's called the Betawin."

391
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Betawin? Betawin.

392
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And what happens is they are attacking groups of African immigrants

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and cutting out their liver and their kidneys while they're still alive and then just rolling them into these pits.

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And the journalists saw like five of these pits in five different locations.

395
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And he actually interviewed this guy named Dr. Fakri Saleh.

396
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 He was the former head of Cairo's forensic department.

397
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And that he had been looking at these bodies because these reports had been coming in.

398
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 He'd been looking at these bodies.

399
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And he says, "Yes, you can tell from these cuts that they were made before they were dead

400
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and the cuts are in the area of the kidneys and the liver."

401
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 So, it's very, very likely that these guys were being waylaid, that they're migrants,

402
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 that no one would notice they were missing and they were being harvested for their organs.

403
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And there is this quote, "Organ trade is the second most profitable trade

404
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 behind only weapons trade.

405
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 It brings in more money than drug dealing and prostitution."

406
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So, you go, "Okay, Jason, so you, of course, there is going to be issues of people having their organs taken out."

407
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Because you always hear the story about the guy who goes to Mexico and then he wakes up in the bathtub full of ice

408
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 and his liver's missing and stuff like that.

409
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 It's an urban legend because really, why would you let him wake up?

410
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 You just take all his organs out, throw them in the water or bury him or something, right?

411
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But you go, "Of course, there's organ trafficking. It's a horrible world sometimes out there."

412
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But does that mean that white people, you said this was some sort of tribe.

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 This was a nomadic tribe of Arabs and you're saying that this has something to do with the white hot...

414
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Again, I'm reading and I go, "Huh, yeah, that is interesting,

415
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 but it doesn't tie into that original conspiracy theory."

416
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Chad 2007.

417
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 There's a French charity known as Zoe's Ark.

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And what they want to do is they want to take kids out of the war-torn areas surrounding Darfur

419
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 because all of that warfare was going on over there.

420
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 It still is. It's a horrible situation.

421
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 But all these orphans, all these war orphans, were pouring over the border into Chad.

422
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And Zoe's Ark, this French organization, says we are going to take them to France for a better life,

423
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 giving them a shot at actually becoming part of a normal, peaceful world.

424
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 They're getting their plane ready.

425
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 The French people are like, "Oh, yeah, dude, this is awesome.

426
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I don't know why I have an Australian accent all of a sudden."

427
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 But we got 103 kids.

428
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 We rescued from these war-torn nations, 103 orphans, that we will help out.

429
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And that's when the military shows up and they didn't let the plane leave.

430
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 The Chad military shows up and says, "We've gotten a couple reports about you guys."

431
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And Zoe's Ark is like, "These are orphans from Darfur.

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Like, are you really going to keep us from taking these kids and giving them a better life?"

433
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And they go, "Yeah, we are, because we've gotten reports that these aren't from Darfur.

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 They're from Chad. They're not orphans.

435
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And some of them you tricked by saying, 'Come with me and we'll give you candy.'"

436
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 So it turns out that these aid workers actually did tell some parents,

437
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 "Hey, listen, we're going to take your kids across the country in Chad to go to school."

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And the parents are like, "Great, take my child to go learn."

439
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 None of them they told, "Hey, we're going to take them out of the country."

440
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Other ones were kids walking on the street and these aid workers were like,

441
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "Hey, come here, kid. I'll give you some candy.

442
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Here, let me give you a hug. Let me feel those nice juicy kidneys of yours."

443
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 So they took these kids, they applied fake blood and bandages on them to make them look like they had just escaped a war zone.

444
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 These were kids who were previously like playing kick the can down the street.

445
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Unless it was a particularly rusty can, they were not suffering from these injuries.

446
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 They get arrested. The aid workers get arrested. They get tried. They get found guilty.

447
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And they're sentenced to eight years in prison.

448
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Now at this point, Chad and France actually have semi-good relations with each other.

449
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 France was had a humanitarian mission going on in the area at the time.

450
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 France said, "Listen, can we get those guys out of Chad?"

451
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Like, "You send them up to here. We'll put them in our prison."

452
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Well, we will admit that they were up to no good.

453
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 We will put them in French prison for eight years, but you know, can you send them up here?

454
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 The president says, "Yeah, sure."

455
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 The president, Idris Debi, says, probably Debi, I don't think his last name's Debi, but he said, "Yes, I'll send them up there."

456
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And then after about six months, the president calls up the president of France and says,

457
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 "You know what? We can let them out of that prison. However, we want a civil payment for our kids suffering."

458
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 So the defendants, not the government of France, the defendants and the charity itself had to pay each victim $87,000.

459
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And so it would make sense you would want them out so they could actually earn money.

460
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 When this all happened, the president Debi, President Debi said, this was his quote,

461
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 "Clearly, their goal was to kidnap and steal these kids from their parents and sell them to pedophile organizations in Europe or kill them and sell their organs."

462
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So it's kind of an interesting comeback to where we were at in the original story, is that, yes, it does seem like they were trying to kidnap 103 kids.

463
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And yes, you do have black men and women dying in America.

464
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 You have people of all races dying in America, but you have this thing that you know as a fact.

465
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 These kids were being taken out of the country through trickery.

466
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But do we really know they were trying to take their organs? Is the conspiracy theory true?

467
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 I don't believe in the genetic superiority thing. I don't believe in the police state and the DNA swabs and the match and all that stuff.

468
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I don't believe in any of that stuff. But I think at that point we're kind of quibbling about it.

469
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Because the conspiracy theory is one thing, but then the facts are another.

470
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And the fact is, is there was one organization caught trying to pull this scheme off.

471
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And they got caught. And there's how many charity organizations out there around the world?

472
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 How many are just in Africa alone?

473
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 You tell me if there's anything more chilling than finding a young girl, than finding a young child and saying, "I will give you a better life. Just follow me."

474
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Put them on a plane with a dozen other kids, a hundred other kids. You fly them off.

475
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Child's first plane ride, watching the landscape disappear underneath.

476
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 And then land in a country they've never even heard of.

477
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And as they're getting off of that plane, they're not being greeted by a loving family.

478
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 They're not being greeted by a schoolteacher.

479
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But they're being prepped by a doctor for immediate surgery.

480
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And the scariest thing about that story is as that child is stepping off that plane,

481
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 and there's an inkling in the back of their head that something isn't right.

482
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 They look out of the airfield and see dozens of other planes that also have hundreds of kids disembarking headed off to their own demise.

483
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Second most profitable trade in the world?

484
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
