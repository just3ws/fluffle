00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
 An urban legend from the end of World War II should send shivers down the spine of even the most battle-hardened veteran.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,800
 And then we travel to South Africa to take a look at the story of two humanitarian workers who lose contact with a village.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:28,000
 As they head out to this village, they have no idea they're about to come face-to-face with blood soaked insanity today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys had a great weekend.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right off by announcing our newest Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 It's Ryan Joseph Breen. Everyone give a round of applause for Ryan. He's walking into Dead Rabbit Command. Everyone give him a big stand in the ovation.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 You're driving your car. You're like, "Oh, why do you always make me do this stuff?" You don't have to stand up if you're in a vehicle.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But if you're not, head over on your feet for Ryan. Ryan, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot of this episode.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Well, everyone you know about Dead Rabbit Radio, let's help this show grow. Cause that's really how we all want to see it.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Ryan, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jet. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna take a journey all the way out to Pullin'.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Ryan is flying us out in this Jason Jet. He's wearing his brain helmet. You didn't know that. He's a villain from Deep Space Nine.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Technically, I don't know if they were ever villains. I always figured they were gonna turn on the Dominion at some point.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Ryan's like, "What are you talking about? That's my real last name. I'm not an alien. Uh-huh."

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Ryan's flying us out there, we're keeping a suspicious eye on our brain pilot. He's flying us out to Northern Pullin', to be specific.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We're headed to the town of Baby Dolly. That's a real place. Baby Dolly. I guess I wrote it down on my notes and never set it out loud.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Baby Dolly is like Babby Dolly, but it's written Baby Dolly and that's near a city named Gdynia. The year is 1945 and this is the end of World War II.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 The Soviets are advancing on the city of Baby Dolly. This was a strategic choke point. They're like, "If we can get to Baby Dolly, if we can get to the belly button ridge, we will have a perfect view over Ihi Valley."

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Soviets are coming over Cupid doll canyon. It's just a bloodbath at Baby Dolly. And you have the Nazis trying to retreat as far west as they could because they're like, "Okay, we lost, but we can either lose to the Soviets or we can lose to the West.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 The Soviets are gonna murder us and the West will just become NASA scientists. It'll all be great." So they're trying to run west, but they're also like blowing up their supply depots along the way because the last thing they want to do,

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 they don't want these Soviets to find these supply depots, eat a bunch of carbs, and then run after them even faster. So they're like throwing grenades at supply depots.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Some guys are like, "Dude, this is my house. It doesn't matter. I used to eat there. That's technically a supply depot." And one of the supply depots they blew up was this.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Like it was a secret under... No one even knew it was there except for the Nazis. It was like this hobbit hole of a supply depot. Take that Bilbo.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 The Nazis leave. Soviets come in and they take over Poland and Poland's like, "Oh, great. We just had to do with the Nazi Empire. Now we gotta deal with the Soviet Empire, but hey, whatever."

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That happens all in 1945. In May of 1951, these guys are doing construction in Poland. They're like, "Yeah, bring the forklift over here. Eat, eat, eat."

28
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And they're like moving rubble around. I don't think they were still rubble six years later, but I don't know.

29
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 They're actually like doing some construction in an area and while they're moving this stuff around, they find the door to this underground secret Nazi supply dump.

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And the workers look at each other and they're like, "Dude, I did not expect there to be a door here. I can see in the dirt. We didn't expect there to be a door going underground."

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 So they open the door and they see a hand reach out of the darkness. I don't know his exact words. I don't know if he moaned once or twice, but a man crawls out of the hole and he has a beard that goes all the way down to his feet.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And he just walks out of the hole and he kind of just stands there. And then behind him, another guy, "Ugh, again we don't have his exact words."

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 He also crawls out. The construction workers are dumbfounded. They didn't expect to find a door. They definitely didn't expect one person to walk out.

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Now the second guy goes, "Ugh!" and he looks up and he sees the sun and he goes, "Ugh!" and he dies. He dies on the spot and the construction workers are like, "Someone call a boss. I don't have to deal with this. I should have called in sick today.

35
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Someone get the foreman down here because this is way outside of my pay grade." What happened? This was reported in several newspapers.

36
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 The Associated Press covered this. So the news article went all around the world, Time Magazine did a story on it. In May of 1951, this door opens up and two Nazis pop out.

37
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 They had been in there for six years. What had actually happened was in 1945 when this whole retreat was going on. Some people were still following orders. Some people were moving as units.

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 These six dudes said, "Hey, remember that hidden supply shelter that we had a hard time finding and we were the Nazis?"

39
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And every time someone said, "Hey, go get some flour. We'd walk around aimlessly for an hour looking for this door on the ground. Let's go hide there."

40
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And then after the Soviets show up, you know, we'll just pop up, learn a little bit of Russian. They'll never know the difference.

41
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So they go into this underground shelter and then the rest of the Nazis, they go, "Hey, we better blow up the entrance to that supply shelter that no one's inside."

42
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So they started hurling grenades at it and blew it up and caused all this rubble to collapse on it. And so the people inside this shelter were trapped.

43
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Now at first, they go, "There's no way we're getting out of here." But eventually the Reich will rise again, the Fourth Reich will once again take Poland. All we got to do is wait maybe a year or two and we'll be back, baby.

44
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 We got candles for light. We have tons of food. We have enough food here to feed battalions. That's what it was here for. There's only six of us. We can do this, but they couldn't.

45
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 It would be really hard for any human to do this because they are completely sealed into this underground room. They do have unlimited food.

46
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 They're able to get water from, like, moss. Like, there's moss in the caves and waters leaking through cracks. It's not the most well engineered underground Nazi bunker you can have, but I guess there's, like, cracks in it and they're drinking water.

47
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 They said the ventilator never got damaged. All those multiple grenades didn't damage the ventilator or the air conditioning unit. I don't think air conditioning is the right term. I'm sure it was always, like, just 70 degrees in there because it's underground.

48
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 But what I'm saying is they never had a blockage to their oxygen supply. So they had the oxygen, they had the water, they had the food. What they didn't have was every other thing a human needs.

49
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So within the first few months of being trapped in here, two men killed themselves. So now you've got four left and they were living in this place with these candles and they have all this.

50
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But the candles, they only had four years worth of candles. So eventually they're living in pitch blackness. And hopefully they memorized the layout by then. They're like, "Oh, no, where did I put the pork and beans?"

51
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 They're scurrying around like rats and two of the other men died of unknown causes, which it would be hard to tell how they died.

52
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Because you would just be, like, waking up in the pitch black and then you'd trip over a body. You can't really do an autopsy, right?

53
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Even if you did have candles, I don't think these guys would be like, "Oh, he died of a broken heart." Like, they're not surgeons. They want to be able to, or coroners, they want to be able to tell.

54
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 But two people died of unspecified causes. That left two men left living in utter darkness for two years, eating food. It sounded like it was mostly like flour.

55
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Maybe some MREs of those existed back then. Probably a lot of beans, frankenfurt or beans and stuff like that.

56
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And one day, six years after they entered, the doors opened up and they pop out. And the one guy was so overcome by being outside.

57
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 He died of shock. He sees the sunny sky for the first time in six years. Very, very interesting story, but when I'm reading it, I go, "Is it true? Is this story true?"

58
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Now, it was reported in the Associated Press. It was reported all over the world.

59
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 The question is, did any of this happen? And that's really the hardest question to answer. There was one source I could find.

60
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 It was this guy on Reddit by the name "Kami Space Invader." He said, "No, it didn't happen." And he referenced the Der Spiegel article in 1958.

61
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I couldn't find that article. He said, "They said it was a hoax."

62
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Now, apparently, there was a website, a Polish website, called Nieridagon.

63
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And they interviewed the person who made the discovery of Wladyslaw Dodowski.

64
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And this makes it suspicious. He said that the story's real. He's the guy who found the door in the first place with his construction worker buddies.

65
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But he said it didn't happen in 1951. It happened in 1948.

66
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And it was covered up by the Polish authorities and by the German authorities and the Soviet authorities for years, and then the story got out.

67
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 That's a little suspicious because the date is so off, which makes you think it's more of an urban legend.

68
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But two, that would only be a three-year term trapped in that bunker, and that's more realistic, honestly.

69
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Three years when you're trapped in a bunker wouldn't make sense, and maybe their candles went out after two years.

70
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 They're one year in the dark and all this stuff. The point is, though, is that we don't know.

71
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 At this point, the person who popped out of the bunker, the Nazi guy who popped out of the bunker, he went to Academy Hospital for a bit, and they just disappeared into history.

72
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 There's no article back then saying what happened to him.

73
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But what's creepy about this story? I love it because we have this possible urban legend getting into the press, which does happen.

74
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It's always funny that when you have mainstream press fall for these urban legends, so it could be that.

75
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 But it's also creepy because this happened, but not with a happy ending.

76
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 There were soldiers that were hiding out in these underground bunkers or trying to pillage these underground bunkers, and they got blocked in.

77
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Because this would be your tactic. You destroy your own supply so the enemy can't get them. It's called scorched earth. The Soviets were perfect at it.

78
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 But as you're retreating, you don't want them to get all your flour. You don't want them to get the four years of candles.

79
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So you'd blow up the entrance, and I'm sure this happened a lot. I'm sure that they're throughout Europe, and Vietnam, and Korea, any battlefield, really.

80
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 There's probably these bunkers that people were in, and other people destroyed the entrance to them.

81
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 But they didn't get out. There wasn't a construction team working over the doorway. They were trapped in the darkness until they died.

82
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And to this day, they're not discovered. To this day, these underground silos, unmapped, unmarked, in some jungle, or some cave, or deep within a forest, contains skeletons of people who were looking to hide or looking to pillage, and then became entombed and just died.

83
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They were considered missing in action, but really they held out as long as they could, deep underground, begging for help while slowly going mad in the darkness under the earth.

84
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Ryan, Brain, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the Carpenter Coptor. We are leaving behind this super dark, spooky tunnel, and we are headed on out to South Africa.

85
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It's July 2010. We're headed towards the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. I found this story online from a person named Bangan Choonz. So, Bangan, thank you so much for bringing this to my attention.

86
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It's actually Bangan's story. They were the one who was a humanitarian worker in Eastern Cape at this time period in July of 2010.

87
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Where they're headed is in the middle of nowhere. Bangan, we don't have his real name, so we're going to call him Tony. Tony is driving out there with Piat. They're both humanitarian workers.

88
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Piat has been here much longer than Tony. He's seen it all. And Tony has started to see some stuff as well. One of the stories he said that I remember once I was standing there, and Piat was standing next to me, and then there was a third guy there, a sorcerer who was burning chickens alive.

89
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And it freaked me out, but Piat just stood there and didn't even flinch as this guy was setting chickens on fire for this ritual. Tony's from a little quiet England town, so this is quite a culture shock for him.

90
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 But it's been a while, and he's been working in Eastern Cape South Africa, and he's gotten to really love the people of the region. In this particular part of Africa, they're working with the Boza people.

91
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 But Piat's a little concerned because he has a contact in this remote village that he hasn't been able to get a hold of. So he says, "Hey Tony, we've got to drive out to this village. I just, I have a funny feeling about this. I can't get a hold of this guy. I want to make sure everything's going okay. Yeah, sure, let's go.

92
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Hop in the Jeep, we're going to drive on out there." And as they're headed out to this village, it seems deserted. And sure enough, the Jeep pulls up, they get out. There is not a single person walking around the village.

93
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 So they begin to go house to house. "Hey, it's Piat and Tony. You in there?" No answer. They go to the next house. "You guys in there? It's us. It's Piat and Tony." No answer.

94
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And they're starting to get really concerned, as anyone would if they ever entered an abandoned village. This goes on for some time. And Tony sees movement out in the distance. He says, "There's a building at the farthest edge of town. And the movement I see is jarring to my senses."

95
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 He turns and he looks and he sees a woman in a full sprint coming towards them. She apparently was hiding behind the building because as he looks and he sees that movement, he sees her at first come around the back corner of the building.

96
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And he's running at Piat and Tony in a full sprint. And Piat sees this and goes, "Get in the truck. Get in the truck." And Tony's just watching this woman run right at them.

97
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 He can tell she's completely nude. She's covered in blood. Tony, get in the truck. The woman is now flailing her arms as she's running towards them. But the panic in Piat's voice is what really scares him.

98
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Because he's seen Piat in some stressful situations. Never heard him nervous before.

99
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 They begin running towards the truck. And she begins running on all fours. Right when they get to the truck, she begins slamming her hands against Tony's window.

100
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Not only is she covered in blood, she has slices on her face, on her body. She's been cut open multiple times. And she's banging on the window and she lets out such an inhuman screech that Tony can't believe any person can make a noise like this.

101
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 He said she was so bloody that he thinks one of her ears were missing. But he couldn't tell. She was just soaked in it.

102
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Piat has to back up the car. The car is not parked to have to outrun someone or make a quick getaway. Piat has to back up the car. And as he's doing that, she's scratching at the windows.

103
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And then she's actually scratching at the metal of the car itself. He gets the car angled right and he begins taking off down the road. And the woman is now chasing the car.

104
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Tony's watching this whole thing in the rearview mirror and he goes, "I knew for a fact that she couldn't catch up to the car. But I felt like she could."

105
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Like he knew no human could run as fast as that car was going, but something in his gut told him if anything could catch this car, it was her.

106
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He said, "I've never seen a human run so fast barefoot, ever." They're silent. They leave her far behind and they just continue driving down the road.

107
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And they're silent for a while. Piat and Tony don't really say anything. They're just trying to calm themselves down.

108
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And Tony finally asks, "What was that?" Piat's just driving the car and he goes, "If you gotta ask me, I think the most likely answer is that woman had some sort of psychotic break.

109
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I don't know if we saw anything supernatural. If you are asking me, I think she had a psychotic break. But here's the thing.

110
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 I'll bet you anything this is what happened. She went nuts. And the townspeople, if they're alive, like this is my most hopeful scenario, the townspeople must have all hid in one building for safety.

111
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And she was just roaming the village this whole time. That's why I wasn't able to get a hold of my contact. It's my best case scenario.

112
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 But here's the thing. I think she probably had a psychotic break. But the people in the village aren't going to think that. And if she doesn't kill herself tonight by like running and jumping off a cliff or just bleeding to death, continuing to cut herself, they will kill her within the next day or two.

113
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 She's dead, one way or the other.

114
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 The day later, he is able to get a hold of his contact in that village. "Hey, how's it going?" Piat says. And the guy goes, "Well, yeah, sorry, I couldn't pick up the phone the other day. We had a bad presence in our village. But don't worry, don't worry, we took care of it."

115
00:19:38,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And Piat said, "I never asked what happened with her. Apparently the people in the village did not see this interaction between the girl and Piat and Tony. They were all hiding somewhere. They didn't see what was going on. But Piat says I never asked what happened to the girl. Never saw her again. So I can only assume that they killed her."

116
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Now, Tony thought about this whole interaction and he goes, "On the one hand, if this woman's having a psychotic break and she's in the presence of a bunch of superstitious people, like obviously she'd been able to be taken to a hospital if she could have been treated with anti-psychotic medicine or held in an area until she wasn't a danger to herself or others.

117
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But because AIDS is so rampant in South Africa, he said the blood was one of the scariest things about the whole situation.

118
00:20:38,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Because yes, a woman flailing her arms running on all fours, screeching and unholy screeching your face, that's all terrifying. If any of that blood gets in your eyes, if she does scratch you and it gets inside your skin, there is no way either of them were going to try to wrestle this girl.

119
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 There is no way these people were going to try to restrain her. Because the chances of her having AIDS was high and she was covered in blood.

120
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 It's a terrifying story all around. There's multiple ways that it's terrifying. One, just the physical idea of this naked, bloodied woman running at you, trying to injure you. And we don't know where these cuts came from.

121
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Where they self-inflicted. Where the villagers trying to defend her attacks earlier, we don't know. There's just a bloody naked woman running towards you. Like any one of those would be bad.

122
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Any woman running towards you, that's fine. She's bloodied, no. If she's running on all fours and she's bloodied, no. It just keeps escalating. So we have the physical threat.

123
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And then we have the idea of her side of the story. She lost control. Whether it was a psychotic break or the villagers were right and it was some sort of supernatural attack, some sort of possession.

124
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 She is no longer in control of her body. She's no longer in control of her fate. She's a mad woman. And I always find that very terrifying as well. We see that a lot in true crime stories. People just snapping.

125
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Grabbing a pair of scissors, killing somebody. It happens a lot. And that's always terrifying as well. But I actually want to wrap this story up with a third thing that's very terrifying about this.

126
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And something we don't really touch on in this podcast or just I think in true crime in general. We have the story of Tony and Piat trying to outrun this mad woman.

127
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And we have the story of the mad woman herself. But what about the loved ones of this woman?

128
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Imagine we are in this village and we've watched this young woman grow up and everything seemed to be fine. But in the past week, she started to act a little weird.

129
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 This young woman is a member of our family. We're getting a little concerned for her. And then one day, she lashes out. She attacks someone at random. They fight her off.

130
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 She begins attacking other people in the village and you're watching this. You're watching your family member get sliced open. But she won't stop her assault.

131
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And so you all have to run. You have to hide from this young woman that you've seen grow up her entire life.

132
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And as you're all running to barricade yourself in a single building, you can hear her screeching in the now empty village.

133
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Eventually, the village elders go, "We can't hide in here all day. This isn't a Nazi bunker. We don't have five years worth of food.

134
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 We're going to have to go and take care of this situation." And you plead with them. Listen, I know she's acting weird, but this isn't her.

135
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 This isn't her. You guys know her. She's a member of my family. Like, let me vouch for her. And the village elders go, "Listen, she's possessed. Like, the woman that you raised is gone.

136
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 There's only one way to take care of this."

137
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And so because you don't want to see her get hurt, even though you know that is what is coming down the pipeline, you're one of the first people out of this building to find her, to restrain her.

138
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And you catch her, let's say, in a moment of peace. She seemed to have calmed down whatever affliction affected her. It seems to be over.

139
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 But the village elders have already spoken. She looks at you with pleading eyes, but you know that her fate is sealed.

140
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 As she is executed the next day, you wish you could have done more to help her. But the superstitions of your culture wouldn't allow you to take her to a hospital.

141
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 She was possessed. She needed to be put down. This was the order of things.

142
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 You have to sit there and watch her be executed due to old superstitions.

143
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Tony and Piet were able to outrun the monster.

144
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 But to the people of the village who knew this woman before this incident, they will never be able to outrun the memories of the life that was lost.
