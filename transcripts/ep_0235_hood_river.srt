1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 A miracle drug is revolutionizing the way that parents take care of their kids.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,680
 And then we journey back into Jason's Vault, a big old repository of personal creepy weird

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,640
 stories that have happened to me.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,600
 But instead of just looking at a single event, we're going to look at a single place, the

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:32,320
 city of Hood River. Nice little tourist town, but when the sun sets, it becomes darker than

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,320
 you could ever imagine. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:46,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,000
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Also, great

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,680
 news. You know, I make fun of a lot of nerds on this show. I'm always like, oh, science

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,560
 is for nerds, geologists, but Jolamos with rocks. That's true. I'm not taking any of

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,440
 that back. However, found out a couple days ago that the Russo brothers are now going to

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,840
 make a Magic the Gathering and Media Television series for Netflix. And I was like, yeah,

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,880
 all right, some MTG getting in there, getting that pop culture. I played Magic the Gathering

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,960
 when it first came out when like 93, played it for a couple years, took two or three decades

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,240
 off and got back into it when I think it was right after, I think it was right before Innistrad.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,480
 I was running an infect deck, so I became super popular at the hobby shop. I just moved

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,800
 up to Hood River here. Hey, this actually works, because we'll talk about Hood River

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,880
 at the end of the episode. But when I moved to Hood River, I had no friends at all. So

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
 I was just looking for places to like meet like-minded people. Instead of going to a

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,320
 bar like a normal adult, I'm like, I'm going to go to the hobby shop. Let's see what type

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,240
 of fun people are down there. And there actually were a lot of cool people down there. But

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,720
 went down there, built an infect deck and became super unpopular. Because if you don't

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,000
 know, infect deck is the cheapest, most maniacal- Oh dude, my infect deck is on point too. It's

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,640
 like a round three win, maybe round two if I get the right card. But anyway, so I'm looking

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
 forward to that cartoon. Not a big fan of cartoons, but I'm a big fan of Magic the

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,160
 Gathering. And I don't play as much now because I really don't have time to do anything else.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,960
 But yeah, no. And then I eventually got into the theater. That's where I made a lot of

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,560
 my friends too. So, happy ending to that story. Jason has friends now, but let's go ahead

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,560
 and get started here with our first story. I wonder what the theme song is going to be

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,480
 like for Magic the Gathering animated show. I wonder if it's going to be like a magic

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,080
 gathers every night. If it's going to be like a hard rock one, or if it's going to be like

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,240
 a dubstep, as they're showing Jace spinning around, like stealing your cards. I don't

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,280
 know. I don't know. I'm very interested in this cartoon. It'll probably suck. The Rooster

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
 Brothers are doing it, so I have a little kind of high hopes for it. I'm sure they're

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,320
 just executive producers. Let's move on to the topic here. So, I found this story recently.

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:09,760
 It was one of those things that I read and it kind of like got under my skin. And I was

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,320
 like, "Uhhh." And then I was like, "Uhhh, maybe I'll cover it. Maybe I won't." And then

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,480
 I went and I reread the article a couple of days later and I said, "This is really just...

39
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,720
 these people are insane. So, I'm going to cover it. This is totally nuts." So, there

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,200
 is this article written for The Guardian, which is a British newspaper. And I'll just

41
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,320
 read the headline to you, because it's really just the best way to jump into this. "It makes

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,280
 me enjoy playing with the kids. Is microdosing mushrooms going mainstream?" So, what this

43
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,760
 article does is it interviews a bunch of women, a bunch of housewives and working women, and

44
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,040
 they take mushrooms. So, they microdose mushrooms. So, what it is is they're taking 0.1 gram of

45
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,480
 shroom and eating it and then being like, "Oh my God, life is so awesome. My kids aren't

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,120
 like totally annoying me anymore. I see the beauty of life." And this article is like,

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,600
 "Listen, it just profiles women... No men get profiled in this article." And I think

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,720
 there's a reason why, and we'll get to that in a second, but the profiles this woman after

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,400
 woman after woman and really the undercurrent of the article is, "Shouldn't shrooms be legal?"

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,560
 Because look at how much it's helped these women. A lot of the stories of the women go,

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,800
 "Yeah, I actually do a lot better at work now and I enjoy being around my kids. They're

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,440
 usually like showed a little douchebags, but now I can like hold them and not want to drown

53
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,520
 them in a bathtub." And I love them. I love them so much. "Hey, you don't have any more

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,480
 shrooms than you do, you name reporters." Like, "No, I don't." And they're like, "Ah, you

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,760
 sure? You sure?" They're like digging through the carpet. No, so they take, apparently they

56
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,080
 take 0.1 gram of shroom every two or three days. This is what's known as microdosing.

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,520
 You can't take it too much because then you get a tolerance for it, but it allows you

58
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,560
 to kind of experience things, kind of trippy. And then other people are like, "Yeah, I do

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,600
 the shrooms. I also do a little acid, a microdose acid, and the reporter just totally glosses

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,920
 over the fact that the drug has changed." Yeah, yeah, I do acid. Now, the article basically

61
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,440
 as it goes through, these women are saying, "You know what? My life is so much better

62
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,840
 now that I'm taking drugs and interacting with my children and doing my job." But I

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,160
 face up to seven years in prison if the British police catch me with this mushroom kit. And

64
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,640
 is it really such a crime for me to ingest drugs and then interact with children? I don't

65
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:43,240
 think it is, world. I don't think it is. So there's a lot of stuff to unpack here. It's

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,440
 kind of an interesting article, but the first thing is the people that they picked for it,

67
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,080
 I think is an interesting look at it, is that they picked all women. They picked all women

68
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,920
 like so you have, when you're reading this article, you envision like this harried housewife

69
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,760
 or this single mom. They're all single, by the way. The one woman was actually married

70
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,960
 and then the mushrooms made her divorce her husband. Like she's like, "It gave me a clarity

71
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,320
 of thought that things just weren't working out." So I think if you turn this article

72
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,640
 around and it was like, "Single dads, take shrooms every couple days." It would come

73
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,680
 across totally differently. Single dads trying to have fun with their kids or drop an acid.

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,160
 It shouldn't be legal. People would be like, "No, absolutely not. Single dads should not

75
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,040
 be doing any drugs around their kids." But when you craft a narrative around like this

76
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,120
 single mother trying to like have a corporate life and then raise three kids, it comes across

77
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,480
 as more sympathetic, which is weird when you really kind of dig into the media. It's not

78
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,900
 a matter of being like, "Oh, fake news, fake news." Like sometimes when you just look into

79
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,920
 how a story is crafted, it's always kind of interesting to see the different emotional

80
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,320
 pull. Secondly, it's the same thing. What if this article was like, you know, single

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,080
 moms like to drink and drinking, drinking like, shooting back glasses of wine makes their

82
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,500
 kids so much more adorable. People would be like, "That's horrible. That woman obviously

83
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,760
 has a drinking problem. She shouldn't be drinking around her kids." But when you frame it in

84
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,400
 this way of like, "These women are kind of rebellious," and this unknown substance, which

85
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
 has been heavily studied, but this unknown substance that you take and makes everything

86
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,200
 feel groovy and cool, again, it sets it differently in the minds of the readers. I'm one of those

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,080
 guys who, I know they're talking about legalizing mushrooms in Colorado. I'm surprised they're

88
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,880
 not legal in Oregon. I've never done a psychedelic. I have no interest in doing psychedelics.

89
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,420
 If you guys lived in my brain or listened to every episode of my podcast, I think you

90
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,060
 would go, "That's one guy who probably shouldn't do psychedelics," because his grasp on reality

91
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,140
 is already so slim. At any point, you can just slip through my fingers. The last thing

92
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,380
 I want to do is push that to the edge. So, if other people want to do psychedelics,

93
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,460
 that's cool. I just don't necessarily think it's something that we should make openly

94
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,880
 legal, recreationally legal. I don't know. It could be part of some sort of religious

95
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,900
 ceremony or something like that. Because I just think it's one of those things that

96
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,340
 if you don't have a strong sense of self, if you don't really know who you are, introducing

97
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,860
 alien substances into you, and that's a conspiracy theory we'll get to, but introducing these

98
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:27,060
 substances into you can fracture that identity even more. But whatever. If it is recreational,

99
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,180
 if it isn't made legal, I'm not going to go protesting in the streets about it. I don't

100
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,400
 think that, first off, I don't have kids, but from my experience around kids and knowing

101
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,040
 lots of people with kids, being a parent isn't supposed to be super duper fun. It's supposed

102
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,480
 to suck. It's supposed to be a little bit of fun, but it's also supposed to suck. If

103
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
 you have to do drugs so you can tolerate your kids, your kids are probably pieces of shit.

104
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 If you can't, if your kids irritate you all the time, then imagine what they're doing

105
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,900
 to everyone else in the world. Now I understand kids are going to get on your nerves some

106
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,100
 of the time, but if you're like, "Oh, I have to do drugs to tolerate, to have fun with

107
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,420
 my kids," then your kids are not good kids, and you have to do something about that. Because

108
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,500
 we all can't get on shrooms too. It's just so bizarre. It's such a bizarre thing, and

109
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,580
 it's being tabled, like, "Hey, let's make this stuff legal so these women can keep

110
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,420
 getting high." Not the dudes, we're not going to profile any dudes, and we're not going to

111
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,520
 talk about any other drugs except mushrooms and kind of acid. They just throw the acid

112
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,680
 in there halfway through the article, because nobody wants that stuff. I did watch a Joe

113
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,480
 Rogan podcast the other day when I was doing research for this, and he said he knows a

114
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,720
 fighter, an MMA fighter who microdoses shrooms, and when he fights, he's too high. Like, he's

115
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,800
 on shrooms when he fights, and Joe Rogan says he feels like he can see the punches coming

116
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,080
 before they come. He goes, "He feels like it actually gives him an advantage." That's

117
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,780
 cool. I'm totally down for that. But again, that's different. You're not doing MMA matches

118
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,860
 against kids, and actually, if you do too much shrooms, you might. You might think the

119
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,380
 kids are like ninjas coming into your house, and you got to take them down one by one.

120
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,100
 So I don't know. I just think it's such a ridiculous trend. And I don't know how much

121
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,540
 it's trending, but the article definitely made it sound to be this good thing that mothers

122
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,040
 are getting high to be able to go about life. And also, they've done studies on this, and

123
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
 the studies go, "It seems like a placebo. It seems like there's actually not enough

124
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,320
 shrooms to have any effect whatsoever. They think it's just placebo because they think

125
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,120
 it's a magical, groovy thing, dude. I'm like taking my shrooms." Did you imagine this article?

126
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,880
 They're like, "People microdose meth. People microdose cocaine. You're not going to see

127
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,960
 articles being like, "Dude, I got so much stuff done today because I microdose some

128
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,260
 methamphetamines because I took crystal meth, but I only took 0.1 gram every 10 seconds.

129
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,220
 You're not going to see those articles." So I just thought it was an interesting article

130
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:06,260
 about culture and the way journalism is crafted. And just, I don't know, man. I would have

131
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,900
 a hard time. I would feel bad if I turned out that after I grew up, I was like, "Hey, mom,

132
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,780
 Memruan used to read me all those books." So she's like, "Oh, dude, I was so ripped."

133
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,640
 I'm like, "What?" She's like, "Oh, yeah, dude, I was tripping balls when I was reading

134
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,720
 you those books. I wasn't even reading those books. I forgot you existed. I was just reading

135
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,400
 The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and I turned around, and then there was this little

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,200
 kid here, and I was like, "Oh, yeah, you're right. I'm a mom." And I'm like, "What?"

137
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,440
 That would kind of hurt my feelings if my mom had to get high to hang out with me. But

138
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,880
 anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

139
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,720
 Now, our next story is a request in a roundabout way because the other day on YouTube, we

140
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,660
 had Charles Tucker, and he goes, "Hey, you got any more personal creepy stories?" And

141
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:59,180
 I was like, "Well, of course. Of course." The question always is when to tell him because

142
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,620
 I always envision the show going on for years and years and years. And I think we've covered

143
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,180
 a lot of the big conspiracy iceberg stuff really, really early on in the show. When

144
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,180
 I only thought the show was going to last 50 episodes, I was doing as much stuff as possible.

145
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,200
 And now I'm thinking, "Well, there's not a lot of really good conspiracy iceberg stuff."

146
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,000
 "McCamey Manor" is a snuff film. That was the last episode. That's actually on the

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,480
 conspiracy theory iceberg, but it's the same thing with the personal stories. I don't want

148
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,720
 to blow through all of them in the first 250 episodes. And then when we're on episode 1,050,

149
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,480
 be like, "Ugh, I don't have any more cool stories to tell." Because what's happened

150
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:43,160
 is they kind of have slowed down. Now, there's a lot of creepy stories that I have, though.

151
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,580
 I wouldn't say a lot. There's probably like 8 or 9 or something like that. If I sat down

152
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,060
 and really thought about it, I would probably come up with more. But "The Blue Boy" is

153
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,620
 a very popular story that I've told my friends, the story of "The Blue Boy." The man with

154
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,700
 the knives is actually a story I haven't told many people about. There was one time, actually

155
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,500
 there was witnesses for this one. There was a time I fought a witch. And it's funny because

156
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,220
 I totally forgot about fighting this witch. I told somebody about the story and we thought

157
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,840
 it was funny. And then maybe two or years later, I was talking to that friend and they

158
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,800
 were like, "Yeah, remember that time you fought a witch?" And I go, "What? What are you talking

159
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,120
 about?" She goes, "Remember you fought that witch?" And I was like, "I have no idea what

160
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,360
 you're talking about." And then she told me the story and then I started laughing so hard.

161
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,040
 I was like, "Oh my God, I totally forgot about that. I fought a witch." Because my life is

162
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,200
 so weird that sometimes the stuff like that, I just totally forgot. Because I was like,

163
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:39,280
 "Oh yeah, there's this other craziness." One time I fought a witch. The portal. The portal

164
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,980
 in the hotel. That's always an interesting story. It's fairly short. Giant Jesus. Giant

165
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,580
 Jesus I think I've talked about in passing on the show. But I'll do a segment on Giant

166
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,580
 Jesus coming up. But those are all stories for another time. Those are all stories for

167
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:01,060
 another episode. What I want to talk about right now is the city of Hood River. That's

168
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,380
 where I live. Hood River, Oregon. Now I moved here. I moved up and down California my entire

169
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,560
 life. My dad was a minister. We traveled all the time. We grew up on college campuses while

170
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,560
 my dad was going to school. Ended up in Sacramento as an adult and was there until I was about

171
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:25,560
 34, 35, somewhere around there. Moved up to Hood River. There's a street in Hood River

172
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,280
 called Wasco Street. And it basically cuts through the entire bottom half of the town.

173
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,180
 There's basically you have Hood River proper, like downtown. You have State Street that

174
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,740
 goes from that all the way through. There's only like 10,000 people in town. Very small

175
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,860
 town. There's a State Street that goes all the way through from one point of the city

176
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,020
 all the way to the other end of the city. And like out onto the freeway. There's Wasco

177
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,540
 Street which is the same thing. It's just farther down into town. If you can imagine

178
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,100
 towns broken up into three portions this would be the bottom portion. It takes you by like

179
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,600
 the brewery district. Takes you by like the industrial stuff. And then we have the Heights

180
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,520
 which is up a giant hill. You have a hospital and you have tons of residential stuff and

181
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,960
 that's where you have like 10 different Mexican restaurants and grocery stores and stuff like

182
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:22,180
 that. So that's kind of how the city is divided up. Now Wasco Street is probably the most

183
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,960
 isolated of all the streets. Wasco Street you can be walking down at 8 p.m. and not

184
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,920
 see anybody even though there's houses everywhere. Such a weird town. Now I used to live on Wasco

185
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:42,080
 Street. I used to have to walk down Wasco Street all the time. And I hated it. Absolutely

186
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,960
 hated it. It always felt off. So these are we're going to tell these stories in sequence

187
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,220
 because I think that builds up to something. And the first couple you're going to be like

188
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,020
 Jason you're just an idiot but stay with me here. It was four in the morning. I leave

189
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:02,720
 my house on Wasco Street. I had my headphones on because I always got to listen to my music.

190
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,880
 And it's so dark. If it wasn't for the street lights it would be pitch black. There is no

191
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:18,520
 moon present this night. And I'm walking by this car. And so the car is like facing downhill

192
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,320
 and I'm walking uphill. And when I get to where the trunk of the car would be so imagine

193
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,620
 the car is on the side of the road and I'm walking past it. I'm walking in the street.

194
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:34,700
 Very rarely walk on sidewalks. I like to have a little more maneuverability room. So not

195
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,620
 super safe but anyway so I'm walking by the car and right when I get to where the trunk

196
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:46,220
 is I feel wind on my face. Like so and now have my headphones on. Listen to music and

197
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:56,600
 I felt a whoo. And as I mean it was like someone just blew a big gust of air right into the

198
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,360
 side of my face. And as I'm turning my head to the left to see because I'm passing the

199
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,480
 car on the left as I'm turning my head to the left to see what it is. I see these two

200
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,560
 massive I wouldn't even say two. I would say I saw at least one massive wing come into the

201
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:27,220
 field of my view and just go whoo. And something shoots up off the top of the car. And I see

202
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,900
 that wing you know how like it was furling in to get like some thrust and kind of pick

203
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,540
 itself up up here. That wing had to have the wingspan of me. It felt like it had a good

204
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:45,360
 three four foot wingspan. And I didn't see it. It was too dark. I looked up. I couldn't

205
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,280
 see anything. I felt it and saw that wing while I was still illuminated by the light

206
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,960
 the street light and it just took off out of the air. So this is what I think it was.

207
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,920
 I think and I've never seen anything this big but the logical answer is it's some sort

208
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,200
 of giant owl was sitting on this car for whatever reason. And when I walked by it I scared it

209
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,540
 as much as it scared me and it unfurled its wing and it was so close to me that when it

210
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:18,380
 flapped its wings it made me I was able to feel the force of the air hit my head. And

211
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,860
 it terrified me and I go well Jason again you're a city boy it was probably just a giant

212
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:29,220
 owl hanging out on the top of a you know Chevy sedan or something so easily dismissed.

213
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,220
 Probably I'm sure Alice can get that big. One day I'm walking down State Street. Again

214
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:40,320
 that's kind of the other major thoroughfare. It's five in the morning. And there is a little

215
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,960
 like stoplight. There's basically one stoplight in town. So you cross the street from the stoplight

216
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,620
 there's a little restaurant called Aig River and they're pretty good but they're really

217
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,480
 expensive and then you go past Aig River and then there's basically two hotels or an apartment

218
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,400
 complex hotel apartment complex that's where we have a lot of places a lot of residential

219
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,420
 places and there's always cars lined up along that road because people there's not a lot

220
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,380
 of parking in the river so there's always cars pretty much lined up along this road

221
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:16,180
 and I'm walking it's like four or five in the morning. And I always have this thing like

222
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,940
 whenever someone's walking towards me I like to be out in the street I don't want to be

223
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,460
 walking on the sidewalk with someone else at five in the morning because I have no reaction

224
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,740
 time. I don't know what they're going to do I'd rather kind of walk and walk alongside

225
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,600
 the cars as they're walking on the sidewalk. But anyway so I'm always just kind of looking

226
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,640
 for movement down the road and I got my headphones on and listening to music and this is what's

227
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,880
 so weird about the story is that I can't remember seeing it begin. It's like I either must have

228
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,720
 been looking at something else and then turned my head or it's simply blinked into existence.

229
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,320
 I think what's most likely is that I think what's most likely is I was looking at something

230
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,380
 else and I turned my head to look back in front of me because what I see in front of

231
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,340
 me maybe 25 feet away and again this is like four in the morning. I see something that

232
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:16,060
 is about four or five feet high. Just the back of it I see these two long back legs and right

233
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:22,740
 when I look at it the back legs walk behind a car that I have to pass. So there's a car

234
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,720
 that I'm walking down the street. I'm walking on the sidewalk there's a car farther up and

235
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,520
 I see something. Now I know that's a vague description because that's all that I saw

236
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:39,360
 but basically what it looked like it was a four legged creature and I saw the hind quarters

237
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,600
 move I didn't see what the front of it looked like. You're thinking Jason maybe that was

238
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:52,720
 some big old dog. This is what creeped me out. One it had no hair whatsoever at all. It was

239
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,820
 if it had hair it had the worst mange possible because it was just basically cadaver white

240
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:06,500
 skin that wasn't super tight to the body it was almost just kind of lumpy. It had really

241
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:15,620
 long back legs and the creepiest part was it actually walked and looked like a man would

242
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,540
 if he tried walking on all fours. You know how when people try to walk on all fours their

243
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,720
 legs are longer than their arms obviously so they do like that weird. It looked like

244
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,000
 someone was bent in such a position they were walking on their hands and feet so their butt

245
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,640
 was sticking way up in the air and they were walking with their hands and they were walking

246
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,920
 behind this car. Now obviously that to me is far more disturbing if it was some old

247
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,240
 naked man walking on his hands and feet hunched over like that walking behind a car that I

248
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,620
 have to walk past that's far more disturbing than a ghost because this is some real thing

249
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,120
 I'm gonna have to deal with or even like a dog or a wolf because I can take on a dog

250
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:05,140
 maybe a wolf. I'll tell the dog story someday but it unsettled me but what was weird is

251
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,180
 there is this weird moment where I didn't panic where I was like what in the world was that

252
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:16,180
 and I actually then step off the sidewalk to see if I could watch it walk across the road

253
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:22,660
 to see what it was and it didn't walk out from behind the car so now I'm like now whatever

254
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,100
 it is is behind that car that I have to walk past so I then kind of am walking across the

255
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,880
 road and trying to like look at the back of the car as I'm like moving so I'm like moving

256
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,140
 in an almost a semi-circle motion to get to the other side of the street and at the same

257
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:48,980
 time keep an eye on whatever that was nothing was there there was nothing behind that car

258
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:55,380
 whatever it was couldn't have fit under the car where I wouldn't have noticed it. The

259
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,780
 hair looked like a pale naked mole rat hair that's what it looked like but it was again

260
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,840
 it's butt was about up to the size of my belly button so if it's when I said it was about

261
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,440
 three feet high that was the part I could see if it stood up it would have easily have

262
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,880
 been my height or taller. It was skinny with really long skinny legs and the skin kind

263
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:26,080
 of held like folded up like hung in folds I guess is the way I should say it. Pale white

264
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,300
 nothing was there when I walked around. Now obviously I go I must have been imagining

265
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,140
 that or that must have been an hallucination or something like that. Must have not seen

266
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:44,140
 that right. Maybe a week or two later I walked down State Street the Walmart used to be open

267
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:49,060
 24 hours a day it's gonna do some shopping buy some stuff for the day where I probably

268
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,780
 had nothing planned I was probably just buying chili beans and rice and all of that stuff

269
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,320
 said at home watch YouTube and pretend I was an author like I used to do for years. I'm

270
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,200
 walking basically State Street and Wasco Street eventually collide and then there's a staircase

271
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,080
 that takes you down and there's hills everywhere so there you the Wasco Street and State Street

272
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,560
 collide and then there's the Walmart and I get to the Walmart I start to walk down the

273
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,380
 stairs now because everything's kind of a series of hills a lot of times you don't have

274
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,600
 straight shot vision which is another thing I'm not used to in Sacramento you could basically

275
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,300
 look from one end of Sacramento to the other until your vision didn't work anymore it was

276
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,440
 completely flat but here you you don't know what's coming up I'm walking down State Street

277
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,820
 I'm turning to where it collides with Wasco I get to the top of the staircase that will

278
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,220
 take me down to Walmart and now I have a straight shot because basically Walmart is the you

279
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,340
 know what a Walmart is it's just a giant box building and it basically sits 10 feet from

280
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,220
 a freeway so I'm at the top of the stairs and I can see everything from the freeway

281
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,840
 to the stairs where I'm at and what I see come out of the darkness near the freeway

282
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:11,920
 is a giant I would say again maybe three four feet high white quadruped run full speed from

283
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:21,940
 the freeway towards the stairs wasn't a dog wasn't a coyote it wasn't anything I couldn't

284
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:33,280
 even tell you what the head looked like it it was fairly triangular which originally

285
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,880
 as I'm watching it run it felt like it was some sort of canine but its behavior was what

286
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,460
 was kind of making me think that's not what it was it didn't kind of have like a snout

287
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:54,880
 like face but it was charging me from a good hundred yards away and it was fast and the

288
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,380
 way this is so bizarre and the way I'm positioned is that I'm approaching the top of the stairs

289
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,000
 and I can see this thing run full speed along the front of Walmart headed towards the stairs

290
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,880
 but I'm still approaching the stairs I don't get to see the staircase myself now I immediately

291
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 gird myself for some sort of attack like I'm like whatever this is I can't outrun it and

292
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,200
 I remember again a very calm sense as this was going on I remember thinking I can't stop

293
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:33,120
 this and it reaches it reaches the bottom of the stairs which is out of my view because

294
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,080
 I'm still kind of walking towards the stairs so I'm watching it run and run and run and

295
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,520
 I see it fall out of my field of view so now I know it's right at the bottom of the stairs

296
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:52,240
 and I'm waiting for it to run up those stairs completely disappeared nothing was there at

297
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,760
 all never saw that thing again I remember when I first moved up here I was on 4chan

298
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,600
 and someone happened to post hey does anyone know whatever happened to that story about

299
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,400
 that black dog I think it was in some town called Hood River in Oregon and it was and

300
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,840
 it was someone just posted it on a creepypasta thing on 4chan no one ever responded to that

301
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,880
 and I looked valiantly for more information about this creature and couldn't find anything

302
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,240
 couldn't find anything at all I was wondered if how that came about but there definitely

303
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,200
 was this white creature running around Hood River couldn't really understand what that

304
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,720
 was so that was the only two sightings of that thing but for me that was enough for

305
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,000
 me that was enough because whatever it was it didn't have a problem getting close to

306
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,600
 people definitely didn't get have a problem getting close to me but I have one more place

307
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,960
 to talk about this episode might run a little long sometimes these personal episodes do

308
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:53,480
 run a little long this isn't a cryptid as much as it is a place and it's so funny because

309
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 the name itself is so ridiculous it almost precludes it from being scary but it's a

310
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,560
 place in Hood River that is known by me at least I've tried spreading the legend catches

311
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,200
 on here and there the haunted frisbee golf course the haunted frisbee golf course is

312
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,760
 this well it's kind of what it says there's a frisbee golf course that's haunted and it's

313
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,880
 on Wasco Street now again Wasco Street is easily the most unsettling stretch of land

314
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,200
 in Hood River across the from it there's a skate park where there's I always keep wanting

315
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,680
 to go off on these segways and the episode's already running too long I'll do this one when

316
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,040
 I first moved up here I was a much heavier I was walking down Wasco Street and I had

317
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,000
 bought subway and I'm walking down subway street cannot subway seat I'm walking down

318
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,440
 the street by the skate park and I'm carrying my subway I'm this big guy I was wearing glasses

319
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,200
 and some 12 year old kid 14 year old kid whatever goes hey look it's Jared from subway and I

320
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:01,120
 I was shocked I was shocked because where I came from you would get your brains blown

321
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,680
 out you wouldn't when I grew up if you yelled out something to a random stranger you wanted

322
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,200
 to get in a fist fight and or you're you were stupid in your brains just got scattered

323
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,320
 everywhere I was floored that some kid would yell because I'm thinking this guy doesn't

324
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,960
 know who I am like you would never do that in Sacramento unless you were looking for

325
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,120
 a fight and I knew in Hood River people are just like again it's just like this super

326
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,240
 it's just a weird town up here you get a fist fight cops show up like what seriously like

327
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,960
 the cots in the newspaper fist fight breaks out downtown I'm like seriously this town's

328
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,720
 weird but anyways that can't I was like I can't believe anyone would say that to a random

329
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,600
 stranger if he doesn't know who I am Sacramento you would never do that if you did that that's

330
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,360
 you were looking for a fist fight or you I could say you were an idiot but anyways I

331
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,560
 just kept walking because I was like you can't be the shit out of this kid because I'm in

332
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:05,000
 Hood River Sacramento might be different story so the Frisbee golf course is right across

333
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,520
 the street from the skate park and it is basically just a ton of trees and there's a couple little

334
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,280
 poles set there and you can throw your Frisbee and go like hole in one guys yay ultimate

335
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,440
 Frisbee let's do this it's the poor man's version of golf and the lame man's version

336
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:29,320
 of every other sport ever invented Frisbee golf so Frisbee golf course now I had had

337
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,720
 to walk past the Frisbee golf course all the time because I lived on Wasco Street and I

338
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,640
 didn't really think anything of it but when I was walking by it after again 10pm to like

339
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,960
 4am I've been to like places where I've been to like flop houses I've been to places where

340
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,520
 junkies hang out I've been to crime scenes I've seen body parts I've been to some pretty

341
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:03,920
 messed up places no place has ever filled me with such despair as walking past that

342
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:13,240
 Frisbee golf course utter hopelessness for half a block it is the most terrifying walk

343
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,920
 I've ever done and I used to have to do it all the time I worked late started early had

344
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:29,960
 to walk by this stretch it was so unnerving to me that it actually like I would I didn't

345
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,520
 even want to think about walking by it and to walk past that I had to go up the super

346
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,840
 steep hill so it was this question of do I want to walk up this hill and like blow my

347
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,600
 knees out because again I was much heavier back then or do I want to face my worst fears

348
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:54,400
 when you walk down that half a block it's like you are in you know the true definition

349
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,840
 of hell isn't the flames and the burning but it's just separation from God that's what

350
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,520
 that street feels like to me there's one street light that if you're lucky works somehow the

351
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,000
 light doesn't even illuminate the whole area you're walking through pretty much pitch darkness

352
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,840
 and you feel separated I remember once I was walking through I was I was walking through

353
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,960
 this street and I remember thinking if that light blows out if that light gave out right

354
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:31,320
 now I would assume that God was punishing me for something I felt soulless when I was

355
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,480
 there and I was in a state of panic every single time and you're thinking chasing just

356
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,040
 a pussy but see here's the thing this is one of the theories I came up with you know when

357
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,160
 you go to church or when you go to a special place you go to a meadow that you really

358
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,640
 love or there's a particular classroom you enjoy something like that but I think the

359
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,280
 church is the best example when you go to church and the singing is going on and the

360
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,640
 praising is going on and stuff like that you actually feel your spirit start to get lifted

361
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,120
 up like oh this place it makes me feel good now they've always there's always been that

362
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:11,720
 idea that belief and I'm sure it's true to some extent but when the Catholics when basically

363
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,400
 the European Christianity movement was taking over they were destroying pagan temples places

364
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:23,240
 where the pagans hung out and building churches right on top of them and part of the logic

365
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,880
 is that way the pagans would know where to go they're basically having their whole culture

366
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,080
 co-opted but the other thing is that maybe that place for whatever reason has some sort

367
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,240
 of spiritual energy and the Christians moving into the area go this place is perfect to

368
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,520
 put a church this place has all this positive energy from all these years of the pagans

369
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,720
 doing this stuff it just has a has all this positive energy let's build a church here

370
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,520
 if you accept that there are places on the planet that can harness and store powerful

371
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,280
 energy or you just accept that when you go to a place that is holy to you you can feel

372
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:07,600
 the spirit inside of you there's an inverse to that there are places that are dark and

373
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,520
 dreary and charged with negative energy and if you want to be around that negative energy

374
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:25,760
 you will go to that place like it was a church you will go there to refill your your stores

375
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,800
 of negative energy this frisbee golf course a lot of times has like RVs parked outside

376
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,760
 of it it's not really patrolled by police that much and that always terrified me as

377
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,360
 well it has straight access to the freeway it's maybe a five minute drive you can get

378
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,720
 on the freeway you can do any sort of creepy nonsense weirdo stuff you want there and be

379
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,920
 gone on the freeway within five minutes but I was thought it was weird I'd walk by these

380
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,360
 RV campers and I'm thinking the logical part of me is saying they're here because the police

381
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,520
 don't patrol this area much but then the other thing is like if you were a negative person

382
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,720
 this is where you'd want to hang out the frisbee golf course itself you go there day or night

383
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,760
 now this has been my experience every single time but if you go there day or night it's

384
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,200
 completely quiet it's next to us neighborhood so you'll maybe hear like a dog barking on the street

385
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:29,200
 no bugs no birds no squirrels no nothing the place there's something wrong with it we do have a lot

386
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,240
 of homeless people in hood river not like compared to like LA which is like 65,000 or something maybe

387
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,600
 it's not that high but we have maybe like a hundred 200 homeless people in town they don't camp there

388
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,320
 I'll see him camping in other places they don't camp in there because I've gone through with groups

389
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,800
 of friends and there at night we never ran into a homeless person ghost hunting never saw anything

390
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,080
 with them brought in cameras never saw anything but there is something off about that area so you

391
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,360
 have the frisbee golf course itself that whole area just seems really off it doesn't really help

392
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,040
 that there's a memorial to a dead teen in the skate park next to it so you have the skate park the

393
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,680
 road and the frisbee golf course right before I moved up here some young kid named Forrest was

394
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,760
 was skateboarding down wasco street and a car slammed into him and then they built like a

395
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,240
 memorial form so when you're walking by there for in the morning that doesn't make you feel any better

396
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,640
 you got that memorial on one side of you frisbee golf course on the other side of you to top this

397
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,040
 story off they're tearing down the frisbee golf course they're building some apartments there

398
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:36,560
 and if that set of apartments is not haunted I'll eat your hat you pick out a hat and I'll eat it

399
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,960
 but only one of you and it has to be a tasty hat has to be made out of pizza so we have all of these

400
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,360
 stories stories of cryptids that I've seen one of them was probably just a giant owl but the other

401
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:57,840
 one was that white beast you just have the haunted little section of wasco street that kind of

402
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:05,440
 perfectly sums up how creepy this town is overall now like I said in the beginning I've seen tons

403
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:14,240
 of things in my life tons of ghosts and demons and creatures and things you just can't explain

404
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:24,000
 but it wasn't until I moved to hood river that I saw something that I didn't think I'd ever see

405
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:32,720
 I saw something that while I knew was real thought I would never see one

406
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,200
 it wasn't until I moved to hood river and was living on wasco street

407
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,800
 that I saw an angel

408
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,440
 but that's a story for another episode
