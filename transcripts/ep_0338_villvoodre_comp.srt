1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 Police investigate a daycare center and make a bizarre discovery,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,100
 and then we travel to Brussels,

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,600
 where we meet a man who one day noticed an alien in his backyard.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:21,800
 But things got really weird when the alien noticed him back today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,300
 [music]

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,300
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,100
 I mentioned on the Monday episode that I'm going to start doing some Brazilian jiu-jitsu training,

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,800
 and it's weird. I did the one night, I rolled around on the ground a bit,

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,900
 learned how to like fall down, and I'm learning how to get back up,

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,200
 and you really got to rethink the way you move. It's quite odd.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,100
 But anyways, I've also developed a new fangled taste.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,400
 Is that even a word? I know it's a word,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,900
 but I don't know if I'm using it correctly.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,500
 Not the word taste. I know I'm using that correctly.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,100
 A new fangled respect for new metal.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,200
 Now I've listened to a little bit of new metal in the past,

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,500
 and I heard that was the collective sound of every listener doing a face palm like,

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,700
 "Oh my God, not new metal, Jason, not new metal."

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,800
 I used to listen to it a little bit in the past,

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,100
 but now I'm like, "I need some good like pump-up fight music."

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,600
 So I can get ready to throw people on the ground.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
 So I went home and I downloaded a bunch illegally,

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,500
 downloaded a bunch of new metal music,

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,100
 and I was watching the video for...

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,300
 This segment is not to brag about new metal music.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,800
 This segment is this.

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,100
 This segment is because my job, this job, never stops.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
 I'm watching music videos, watching YouTube videos and stuff like that,

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,400
 because I never really listened to this stuff,

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,600
 so I kind of got to hear it and go, "Oh, I like that song," and then get it.

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,000
 And so I was... I know this song actually.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,400
 I've already listened to the song a hundred times, but the song "Rollin'" by Limp Bizkit.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,900
 I was like, "Oh, you know, I do like Limp Bizkit.

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,300
 I do like a little bit of the bisque."

37
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
 That's what I always called them, "Give me the bisque."

38
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,700
 And so I never called them that.

39
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,300
 Anyways, I was watching the music video for the song "Rollin'."

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,400
 Now some of you guys know exactly where this is going now,

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,100
 because some of you guys are huge Fred Durst fans.

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,000
 I put in the video and it starts off with Fred Durst sitting in New York City

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,800
 and then Ben Stiller and Stephen Dorf think he's a valet.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
 It's kind of a dumb setup.

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,200
 But anyway, so then he gets this Mercedes Benz and he's like, "Oh, yeah, baby.

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,700
 You know what time it is. It's time to roll."

47
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,600
 [imitates drumming]

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,800
 And then they start showing shots of the World Trade Center.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,900
 And I was like, "Hmm, that's interesting.

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,400
 I'm going to assume this video was shot before the year 2001."

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,700
 Just a guess. Just a guess.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,400
 And they show a shot of the Statue of Liberty and I go...

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,500
 And then the cameras flying towards the Statue of Liberty and I go, "Oh,

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,700
 are they going to be CGI performing on the torch of the Statue?"

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,000
 No.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,800
 There's no CGI at all.

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,400
 They're not performing on the torch of the Statue of Liberty.

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,100
 They are performing on the roof of the South Tower.

59
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,000
 It's kind of a fake out.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,800
 You think they're going to be on Statue of Liberty and then the camera pans over to

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,400
 the World Trade Center and they filmed it actually on the roof of the South Tower,

62
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
 the song "Rollin'."

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,000
 And it's...

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,900
 That is still like...

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,200
 I know a lot of you guys weren't alive when 9/11 happened or were so young.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,900
 It didn't matter.

67
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,500
 But I still have a good size of the audience that is closer to my age

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
 that does remember that.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,100
 And so just seeing the imagery, just seeing the World Trade Center,

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,500
 I was like, "Hmm, that's interesting.

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 I haven't seen that in 19 years."

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,300
 And...

73
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,200
 Or 18 years, whatever.

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,700
 And so it's always odd.

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,300
 But then to have a band...

76
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,900
 [imitates band music]

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,100
 You know, destroying the mic and the turntables and all that stuff

78
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,200
 on a building that would eventually be destroyed.

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,100
 Not just destroyed.

80
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
 It wasn't an earthquake.

81
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,500
 It was a terror attack.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,300
 It was an enemy attack against the United States.

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,400
 To see a band on there breathe in to breathe out now, up now, da da da da da.

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,100
 And they won the award.

85
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,200
 They won like a VMA.

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,100
 They won like an MTV Music Award on September 6th, 2001

87
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,800
 for like best rock videos, what they won.

88
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
 At the 2001 VMAs, remember when all that stuff was cool?

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 Remember when MTV was actually really cool?

90
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,700
 In 2000, you guys were like, "No, I wasn't alive.

91
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,200
 You just said most of us weren't alive during 9/11."

92
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,300
 We don't remember when MTV was cool either.

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,900
 2001 MTV Music Awards.

94
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,800
 The video where they're on the South Tower, they win.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,100
 That was on September 6th.

96
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,500
 So five days before the towers come down, they're like,

97
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,900
 "And best rock video, woo, Olympic.

98
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,800
 Yeah, yeah, I'm so awesome being up on that tower.

99
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
 It's American icon that will never fall."

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:15,300
 The day before the towers were destroyed, were attacked and destroyed,

101
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,000
 they actually, the band Limpiscate received a letter from the World Trade Center.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,300
 Now the building itself didn't, dear Fred, the building didn't write it itself,

103
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,500
 but like the World Trade Center Commission, the people in charge of it,

104
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,000
 wrote a letter to Limpiscate saying, "Hey, thank you very much for filming your video on our tower."

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,200
 On September 10th, 2001, they got that letter.

106
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,800
 So long story short, no matter what I do,

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
 whether I'm just looking up old, new metal music,

108
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,500
 I am constantly reminded of conspiracy theories and plots against the United States people.

109
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,200
 Was Limpiscate part of the inside job while,

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,300
 maybe while they were playing their instruments West Boiland was hiding bombs inside the towers?

111
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,900
 We don't know.

112
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,400
 No one's ever looked into the Fred Durst connection.

113
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,900
 Did he know Larry Silverstein?

114
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,700
 Did he get a piece of that sweet, sweet insurance money?

115
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,900
 Nobody's asked these questions before.

116
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,900
 Was there a single red hat found taunting the police,

117
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,100
 hanging off of a girder, the remains of the North Tower?

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,900
 We don't know because no one's ever asked these questions before,

119
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,100
 except me, your intrepid journalist, Jason Carbner.

120
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
 But I don't believe that 9/11 was an inside job, so it doesn't matter.

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,900
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story though.

122
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,200
 So we're saying goodbye to Fred Durst and company.

123
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,000
 Goodbye, good sirs.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
 Keep on rolling.

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,300
 You know what time it is and they're like, yes, we know what time it is.

126
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,600
 And we move on to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

127
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
 We borrowed their car though.

128
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,900
 We're rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling, what?

129
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,300
 Keep rolling, rolling.

130
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,900
 And I play that song the whole way and I'm wrestling you.

131
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,500
 And I'm trying out Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves.

132
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,200
 You're like, Jason, you took one class.

133
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
 You don't even know moves.

134
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
 I'm about breaking your arms.

135
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,500
 I'm like, I don't even, I don't know what tapping is yet.

136
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,000
 So I'm just getting you in a hold until you pass out.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
 You're like, Jason, I tapped you like 10 times.

138
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,700
 I'm like, yeah, what does that mean?

139
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,400
 Anyways, we're going to Colorado Springs, Colorado.

140
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,100
 I take your prone unconscious body out of the car,

141
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,600
 lay you on the grass, and then I just continue on with my story.

142
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,500
 You will wake up at some point from the chokehold you were in, I hope.

143
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,800
 Colorado Springs, Colorado, this just happened.

144
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,100
 November 13th, 2019.

145
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,200
 These police get a call.

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,900
 People in the neighborhood are complaining.

147
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,300
 There's a lot of children at this home.

148
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,100
 It's a daycare.

149
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,500
 There's an awful lot of kids here.

150
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,300
 So the cops go, that's kind of an odd complaint.

151
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,800
 A lot of kids at a daycare.

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,300
 What next?

153
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,600
 Are you going to let us know that the elementary school has a ton of dudes running around?

154
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,300
 And three times a day, they all run outside and make a ton of noise

155
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,800
 and then go back and like, okay.

156
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,600
 But anyways, the cops are like, okay, let's go see what's going on here.

157
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,500
 So they show up at Play Mountain Place.

158
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,100
 Play Mountain Place, it's a daycare in Colorado Springs.

159
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,400
 This is all alleged, by the way.

160
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 Cops show up.

161
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
 Knock, knock, knock.

162
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,100
 And then the other cop goes, you can't just say that.

163
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,300
 You actually have to knock on the door.

164
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,300
 The cop's like, oh yeah, I do.

165
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,700
 Someone comes to the door, opens it up, a bunch of bats fly out.

166
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,600
 Spiderwebs everywhere.

167
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
 Spooky spooky house.

168
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,300
 They go, cops go, hey, so we got a report.

169
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,300
 There's a bunch of kids here, little probably more kids than should be at a residential daycare.

170
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,000
 We're going to come in and take a look around.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,500
 And then the worker goes, yes, master, come in.

172
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,000
 Come in.

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
 We are glad to have you.

174
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,100
 Would you like some bubbling lemonade?

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,400
 It's all steam.

176
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,900
 It's Igor working there.

177
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,800
 Police are like, no, no, no, no bubbling lemonade.

178
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
 So they walk in.

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,700
 Now, it's a normal house.

180
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,400
 It's not spooky spooky mansion.

181
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,700
 There's not Igor there.

182
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,500
 But the cops realize there's something really weird about this daycare center.

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,300
 It's the middle of the day and there's no kids.

184
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,000
 I'm like, what?

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,900
 Is there like kind of looking around, looking around living room, like in the bedrooms, stuff like that?

186
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,500
 No kids.

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,200
 Nowhere.

188
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
 They're like, isn't this a daycare center?

189
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
 This is the right place, right?

190
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,700
 And the worker's like, yes, yes, it is the right place.

191
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,800
 Where are all the kids?

192
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,200
 And the worker's like, well, I don't know.

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
 I don't know.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,500
 What do you think I do?

195
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,300
 Work here?

196
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
 They're like, yes.

197
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,400
 He's like, I don't know.

198
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
 I don't know where the kids are.

199
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,600
 And so the cops are kind of scratching their head because they got to report that there's a lot of kids here, but they can't find a single kid.

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,800
 But to make things even more bizarre, this whole story is weird.

201
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,100
 The cops are sitting in this house, middle of the day.

202
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
 They got to report there's a bunch of kids at a daycare.

203
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,700
 They show up.

204
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,600
 There's no kids here.

205
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 But they can hear kids.

206
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,800
 They hear kids in the house.

207
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
 They hear a lot of kids.

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,800
 So at this point, the cops are really suspicious.

209
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,100
 They end up tracing the sound of the children to behind a wall.

210
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
 So the cops look at each other and they're like, this wall's coming down.

211
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
 Like there's something really bizarre.

212
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,600
 So they smashed the wall and it was a false wall.

213
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,400
 And on the other side of the wall was a door.

214
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,000
 Now again, November 13th, 2019, this is not some crazy conspiracy theory on Reddit or something like that.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,100
 This happened.

216
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,000
 This is a true story.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
 The cops open the basement door.

218
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
 And there's a bunch of kids in the basement.

219
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,400
 So the owner of the place gets arrested.

220
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,700
 Her name was Carla Faith.

221
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,300
 Because she wouldn't even cooperate.

222
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,000
 They call her up before they even find the false wall.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,100
 They say, we want to talk to the owner.

224
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,000
 What's going on?

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,800
 And the owner's like, I don't know.

226
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,500
 What do you think I do?

227
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,100
 Own this place?

228
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,300
 And they're like, yes, you're the owner.

229
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,400
 So they eventually have to get the kids out.

230
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,000
 They call the parents up and say, hey, come pick your kid up.

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 There's something weird going on at this daycare.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,300
 And one of the parents gives us an idea of what the place is like.

233
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,400
 She says that the staircase leading down to the basement was very narrow.

234
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,000
 And she said it smelled like stale smoke.

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And she said when we went down there,

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 I love this description, she says they went into a room,

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,200
 a quote that had probably 10 to 15 metal cribs

238
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
 lined almost like you'd see in movies,

239
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,100
 an orphanage, an orphanage not in the United States,

240
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,300
 with trash everywhere.

241
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,500
 So not just an orphanage, not just an orphanage,

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,400
 a third world orphanage in a movie about how bad orphanages can be

243
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,700
 with these metal cribs and garbage everywhere.

244
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,400
 So nobody's really talking.

245
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,900
 The adult workers and the owner apparently haven't really said anything,

246
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,400
 but they are all under arrest for doing this.

247
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,800
 Just such a bizarre story.

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
 I'm trying to think like the only there's obviously a logical reason behind this.

249
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
 So this is an interesting story because one,

250
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,000
 there you can go the ridiculous route and put this as part of a pizza gate.

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,300
 Like, oh, they had this false wall.

252
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,000
 So that way when the Democrats came over to eat a baby that they could do it in the privacy of the basement.

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,700
 And that's where they kept all the kids.

254
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,200
 So when Hillary Clinton showed up, she could eat their brains and whatever.

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,900
 What's most likely happened is that she did have a ton of kids there,

256
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
 more kids than she could fit into her living room.

257
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,900
 So she threw them all into the basement like a witch, like a fairy tale witch,

258
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,400
 and then built a fake wall over it to prevent what basically the plan was.

259
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,700
 The cops had come over.

260
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,600
 There'd be no kids there.

261
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
 The cops would leave, but instead the cops could hear.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,900
 There was 28 kids down there, 28 kids down there.

263
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,700
 They would hear all the kids running around hitting the metal cribs, falling in garbage.

264
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,200
 But even that seems theological because what happens when a parent shows up to pick their kids up?

265
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,500
 Are you gonna be like, oh, here, I'll be right back and then you disappear as well?

266
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,200
 You're warm.

267
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,400
 You like walk through a holographic wall.

268
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,700
 And the parents sit in their living room and they just hear a ton of kids having fun underneath their feet.

269
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,100
 And they're like, well, that's weird.

270
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,300
 And then their kid magically reappears from the wall.

271
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,200
 Like, and none of it makes sense, but everyone got arrested.

272
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,900
 And I predict, I predict, and not only do I think this is a funny story.

273
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,600
 That's why I covered it.

274
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,600
 I predict that this will be used as pizza gate proof pretty soon is the story.

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 So, oh, look at, there was that one day care in Colorado.

276
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,000
 What you'll hear is there was a day care in Colorado just this year that was found with a fake wall.

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,100
 And they're hiding kids behind it.

278
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,300
 That's all you'll hear about it.

279
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,200
 And then as you're reading a bunch of stuff about pizza gate, you'll be like, what?

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,500
 That's weird.

281
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,900
 And then you keep reading instead of actually looking into the details and using your mind to figure out why someone would do this.

282
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,200
 But anyways, let's go.

283
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,500
 I did think it was a pretty funny story.

284
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,100
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.

285
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,100
 And so let's go ahead though and say goodbye to Colorado.

286
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,000
 A bunch of kids are waving at us as we're driving away and you're like, Jason, Jason, look at, look at, look at that.

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
 And I'm like, I know, isn't that cute?

288
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
 They're like waving at us or waving goodbye.

289
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,500
 There's thankiness for telling such a good story.

290
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,600
 And you're like, no, no, no, dude, they're still trapped.

291
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100
 They're waving from the basement windows for us to help them.

292
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,000
 I'm all keep rolling, rolling, rolling, what keep you're like, no, dude, turn around.

293
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,300
 We drive over the hill.

294
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:23,600
 So we are now driving all the way in Fred Durst's stolen cart to Brussels, Brussels, Belgium,

295
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,200
 where specifically go into a little town or whatever you want to call it, province.

296
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:38,000
 Vilvoord, Vilvruud, Vilverde, Vilverde, Vilverde.

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
 That's what we're going to call it.

298
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,900
 The year is 1973.

299
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,300
 It's December 19th, two in the morning.

300
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,200
 There's this unnamed dude.

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,900
 So let's call him Mr.

302
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,000
 Let's call him Mr.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,500
 Bobby.

304
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 Let's call him Bobby.

305
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
 I don't know why I said Mr.

306
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,700
 There's this guy named Bobby living in Belgium.

307
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,200
 Okay, this dude's name is Bobby.

308
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,100
 It's the year 1973, December 19th.

309
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,400
 This guy's waiting for Santa Claus, but he's a little early.

310
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,300
 It's 2am.

311
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,900
 Not that Santa Claus comes later in the evening.

312
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,700
 It's December 19th.

313
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,500
 Santa Claus is coming on December 25th.

314
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:19,600
 Now, little known to Bobby, there have been multiple UFO reports in the area.

315
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,700
 For the weeks preceding this event, people had seen a particularly strange UFO.

316
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,300
 And I say that because it was kind of like a, it was basically like a flying dome.

317
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,300
 Like it had a dome on the top, a dome on the bottom.

318
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,400
 And the dome on the top was generally described as being orange.

319
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,700
 And the dome on the bottom was generally described as being black.

320
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,000
 And people have seen this all over Belgium starting from December 3rd.

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
 People have been seeing this crap.

322
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,700
 But now it's December 19th.

323
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,800
 It's 2am.

324
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,400
 And Bobby, week seven in the middle of the night, is like, oh, I got to go to the bathroom.

325
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:57,100
 Now, I guess I should back up here and tell you that this is in a rural area, farm area.

326
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
 So it's not like you and me where we get up and we walk five feet and go to the bathroom.

327
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,700
 He has to go to an outhouse, which is gross.

328
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,500
 Those things are filled with spiders and sometimes perverts crawling into the toilets.

329
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 Dude, you know how many stories I found about like people hiding in porta-potties?

330
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,000
 Okay, I found two.

331
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,400
 But that's still two more than should ever exist on the planet.

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,500
 Now, to be fair, no, there's nothing to be fair.

333
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,300
 Like you crawl into a porta-potty, like you know what you're getting into.

334
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,000
 That's a weird fetish.

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,200
 I don't think people do it at 2am, but still, the idea of using an outhouse is gross.

336
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,700
 Also, there's a bunch of spiders underneath the toilet seat.

337
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,100
 Normally you have to like bang the toilet seat.

338
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,300
 My question is, do spiders eat poop?

339
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,900
 Like why are spiders attracted to toilet seats?

340
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,300
 And if you think I'm making that up, just Google spiders in outhouses

341
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,000
 and you'll see all sorts of horrific videos.

342
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,300
 Makes you not even want to use a real toilet.

343
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,500
 But anyways, better course, too.

344
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,900
 I'm not pooping in the shower.

345
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,500
 What did I see something the other day about this guy who was so overweight?

346
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,000
 He would break his toilet.

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,700
 Toilets are kind of fragile.

348
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,800
 I mean, they're made of porcelain and all that stuff.

349
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,200
 But the heavier you get, though, you know, it doesn't have a lot of give.

350
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,000
 And so this guy was afraid he was going to break his toilet.

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,700
 So he had a beanbag chair he was pooping in.

352
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,600
 He was like 600 pounds.

353
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,400
 So when he sat down and created this weird vacuum seal,

354
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,100
 he would just poop into the beanbag chair and then wash it off.

355
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,500
 And the problem was is that he also used that beanbag chair to sit in, watch television, stuff like that.

356
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,400
 And he also said that he tried pooping in a...

357
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,900
 I don't know what any of this has to do with the story,

358
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,600
 but he tried pooping in a mini fridge.

359
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,300
 He would plug in a mini fridge and turn it sideways and poop in it,

360
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,600
 hoping that the cold of the fridge would make it easier to clean the poop up.

361
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,900
 But he didn't.

362
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,000
 None of that has anything to do with aliens.

363
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,300
 Just has to do with the idea of pooping outhouses.

364
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,100
 All this stuff is so weird to me.

365
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,400
 The dude walks out, Bobby walks out to go to the outhouse.

366
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,500
 He doesn't want to wake his wife up so it doesn't like turn all the lights on in the house.

367
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,700
 But he does grab a flashlight or as they call it in Europe, a torch.

368
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,600
 And as he gets into the kitchen, he sees a weird glow coming from outside.

369
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
 He's like, "What is that?"

370
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,800
 And he hears a "Karchuk, karchuk, karchuk."

371
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,700
 And it sounds like metal hitting stone.

372
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,700
 Now, outside his house, he has like a 10-foot wall surrounding his property.

373
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,900
 And he's thinking, "Is someone banging on my... banging on my wall?"

374
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
 He can't figure it out.

375
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,100
 And that's actually the least of his worries because there's that weird green glow coming from outside.

376
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,700
 So he kind of like sneaks up to the kitchen window that looks outside.

377
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,700
 And what he sees is a 3-foot tall man.

378
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,500
 So right off the bat, you're like, "Okay, this dude's an alien."

379
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,700
 Like, it would...

380
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,600
 Yes, 3 feet tall humans exist, but they're so rare that when you see...

381
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:03,000
 Okay, I'm not saying that when you see a 3-foot tall person, you should assume they're an alien.

382
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But, to be fair, if he's also glowing green or he's in your yard at 2 in the morning,

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,300
 it's a pretty good guess that this guy is not from this planet.

384
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,400
 He sees a 3-foot tall figure at this point.

385
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,200
 He's wearing a green from like neck, covers his entire body, green jumpsuit.

386
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,800
 And it's glowing.

387
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,400
 [Wooing]

388
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
 Well, it's so green, it's putting off its own light.

389
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,200
 Now, apparently like the pants were like treated like it was a jumpsuit.

390
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,600
 And he said you could actually see the boots and the pants kind of tucked into the boots.

391
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,500
 But there was no seams anywhere.

392
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,600
 Like you could see how the pants bunched up by the boot.

393
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
 But you couldn't tell where the boot was separate from the pants.

394
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,900
 You couldn't tell where the gloves were separate from the hand.

395
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,500
 But again, like if you tucked your shirt sleeve into your gloves, they kind of puff up.

396
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,100
 The sleeve kind of puffs up.

397
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,000
 It was that, but there was no seam separating the shirt from the glove.

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,500
 The creature had on a clear domed helmet, like wearing a fishbowl on its head.

399
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,800
 And from behind, it looked like it had long black hair.

400
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,400
 This creature was also wearing a big glowing green backpack.

401
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,500
 And it's holding this, what was described, it looked like a vacuum cleaner,

402
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,900
 but he was using it like a minesweeper or a metal detector.

403
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,000
 So he has this long rod and it has a flat base

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,700
 and he's just kind of waving it over this pile of broken bricks by the guy's wall.

405
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,100
 [Metal Detector sounds]

406
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:51,100
 And Bobby's looking at it through the window and he's like, "What in the world is going on?"

407
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,100
 Now, at this point you have a couple different options.

408
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,000
 You can go outside and talk to it.

409
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 You can throw water in your face to make sure you're not dreaming, pinch yourself.

410
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,300
 I think it's interesting because I don't know, honestly,

411
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
 I don't know what I would do in that situation.

412
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,700
 If I looked out the window and I saw what was an alien outside my window,

413
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,000
 that has not noticed me yet.

414
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,900
 Bobby has a novel idea.

415
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,300
 He has a flashlight in his hand.

416
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,400
 Now, the kitchen he's in is pitch black because he hasn't turned on any of the lights.

417
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,300
 He just has on his flashlight.

418
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:26,600
 But he's looking through the window and he goes, "Hmm, I wonder if I can get its attention."

419
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,300
 Now, again, that seems very, very dicey.

420
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,400
 He holds the flashlight up to the window and begins flicking it on and off.

421
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,200
 And it does get the alien's attention.

422
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,000
 It immediately turns and looks at him.

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,600
 And this is where we see what the front of the alien looks like.

424
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,900
 On its waist, like on its stomach, waist, it had a belt

425
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,700
 and had a red box, a glowing red box on its belt.

426
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,900
 And its face, it didn't have long black hair.

427
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,800
 Its entire head was pitch black.

428
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,500
 We can assume that the creature itself was also probably all pitch black.

429
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,100
 And it turns and it has no nose.

430
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,900
 It has no nose, no mouth.

431
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,900
 It's just a pitch black head with long pointy ears

432
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:22,400
 and two giant yellow eyeballs that have like a green rim around them, surrounded by black.

433
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
 And the alien turns and looks at Bobby.

434
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,500
 And it's blinks every once in a while.

435
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,000
 And Bobby says, "When it blinked, its face went completely black."

436
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,900
 Because the eyelids were pitch black as well.

437
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,400
 And so he's looking at this alien.

438
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,600
 This alien's looking at him.

439
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,100
 Alien has now stopped searching for whatever it's looking for.

440
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,700
 And then the weird stuff, the really weird stuff happens at this point.

441
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,400
 First off, the alien looks at Bobby.

442
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,300
 And then he throws up the peace sign.

443
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300
 Throws up two fingers, the V salute.

444
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
 Now that is weird in and of itself.

445
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,900
 That kind of makes me think not that it's fake,

446
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
 because the story could obviously totally be made up.

447
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,700
 But if it is true, it's weird.

448
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,300
 It makes me think that this could either be a human pretending to be an alien

449
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,900
 or an alien who's well versed in human culture.

450
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,100
 Because that, again, like I,

451
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
 that is a universal sign for peace.

452
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,100
 I know other countries consider it like the middle finger and stuff like that,

453
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
 but whatever.

454
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,800
 For the most part, if you see someone and they throw up the peace sign,

455
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,200
 it's like, "Hey, buddy, like everything's cool here."

456
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,100
 It's weird to think that an alien would see someone and to go,

457
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,700
 "Oh, dude, don't worry about me," and throw up the peace sign.

458
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,000
 Like, I've actually done that in situations too,

459
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 where I'm like, "No, throw up the peace sign."

460
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Like, "I'm cool, like whatever's going down here."

461
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,500
 I've used that in situations that were escalating out of control.

462
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
 They're like, "Hey, man, and then you're kind of allowed out of the area.

463
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 I'm not part of this situation."

464
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 So it does work, and I found that very odd.

465
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,000
 As far as an alien knows, that guy could be flashed in the light

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 and then get scared and have some sort of firearm and open fire.

467
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,500
 The alien wanted him to know that I come in peace.

468
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 Which, again, is a very common thing, a stereotypical thing,

469
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 that aliens say, they don't really say that, but, you know, in sci-fi,

470
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 you have an alien actually throwing up the human sign for peace.

471
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:25,000
 So I thought just from an anthropological view of things, that was bizarre.

472
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Then, if you were like, "That's kind of over-reading it,"

473
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,500
 then the alien turns and steps on the wall and then walks up it.

474
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,000
 Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot.

475
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Like he's walking along the ground.

476
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So, it's a 10-foot wall.

477
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And it's the equivalent of a Fat Boy Slim video.

478
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Was that guy's a Fat Boy Slim?

479
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,500
 Yeah, yeah, where Christopher Walken was dancing around.

480
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,000
 Now, I'm sure I could have given 100 different visuals for that,

481
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 but it would be, or like, I don't know, something else.

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Something that's more age-appropriate, where somebody's walking up the wall.

483
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 The point is, is that he defied gravity and all-known logic,

484
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,500
 as far as the way matter works on this planet or this plane of existence,

485
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
 and is able to turn and walk up a wall with no problem.

486
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,000
 Now, when he walked before, when Bobby was watching this whole thing,

487
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 he said the alien kind of walked like a wobble,

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 which we've heard that before with other alien stories we've covered.

489
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And the question is, is it because of some sort of gravity thing?

490
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,500
 Is it because of their shoots are bulky and that's the only way they can move around?

491
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,000
 But as the alien turns and starts walking up the wall,

492
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 he's still walking wobbly, he's still kind of wobbling back and forth,

493
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 but he walks up to the top of the wall, he walks onto the top of the wall,

494
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 and then Bobby's watching him, he doesn't jump down,

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 he actually turns and begins walking down the other side of the wall out of view.

496
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And as Bobby's watching this, so right there, again, that's absolutely fascinating as well.

497
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 We've seen aliens outrun people and blink into and in and out of existence and stuff like that,

498
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,500
 but here we have one actively defined what we know as gravity, able to walk up a wall.

499
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,000
 Bobby's sitting there, he has no idea what he just saw,

500
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 and then he hears a woom, and on the other side of a wall,

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,500
 I think it was like 20 feet away, he starts to see a UFO ascend into the sky,

502
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 and it kind of goes up a bit and pauses, and he describes it as an orange dome on top,

503
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,000
 a dark dome on the bottom, and in between was a translucent area,

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 and he's looking in there and he could see the creature, the alien, sitting in there,

505
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 and everything's kind of, has a green glow still because he's in there now.

506
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 He kind of can look into the control room, and just is a control room, he doesn't go into details,

507
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 and I was like, there was eight buttons on one side, it just looked like something that would control a UFO.

508
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 As the UFO starts to take off, he notices an emblem on the bottom,

509
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,500
 a black circle with a yellow lightning bolt through, kind of cliche, kind of cheesy,

510
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 and then the UFO speeds off into the night sky.

511
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 Bobby then, this is where I get a suspicious about this story, okay?

512
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,000
 But again, I don't know what I would do in this situation,

513
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Bobby then makes a snack and sits down in the kitchen and eats his dinner,

514
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,500
 or eats his little late night tune the morning snack, and then goes to bed.

515
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,000
 Now, when I read that, I was like, "Ugh, that's a little, I think I probably would have woken up my wife,

516
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,500
 but like, Brittany, Brittany Spears, wake up," and she's like, "What? Jason, I love you."

517
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 And I was like, "I know, I know you do, but I just saw an alien, you gotta come out here,

518
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,000
 and maybe we can go find some alien artifacts."

519
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 She's like, "Okay, I love you so much, I'll do whatever you say."

520
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 That's what I would do in my world, but I could also, I guess I've had experiences with ghosts,

521
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
 and then I went out and ate a pizza.

522
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,000
 Like, I guess it's not that, I guess because I've never seen an alien, I figured I'd get more excited about it.

523
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,500
 But anyway, so Bobby sits down and he just eats a snack, and he thinks about what he just saw,

524
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,000
 and then he goes and goes to bed.

525
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,500
 The next morning, he tells his wife, "Now, this story is a little suspicious again,

526
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 because we don't have any real evidence, it's one person saying this story,

527
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,500
 he doesn't use his real name, this story took place a long time ago,

528
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 it's hard to verify any of these facts, but it's interesting nonetheless.

529
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,000
 If we assume it's true, the idea that an alien would know our symbol for peace,

530
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 which would be a very valuable symbol to know.

531
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,500
 Like, if you're going to another country, probably the first words you should learn in their languages,

532
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:47,000
 please don't, or no stop, or something like that, or please, just in case, just in case.

533
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,500
 So, you know, you would want to know that if you're going to a planet where, you know,

534
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 it's most likely the population is hostile towards you,

535
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 you heard about your buddies getting shot down in Roswell,

536
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,500
 and you know they love to make movies about your people being obliterated by Will Smith,

537
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 you may want to learn a certain skills and techniques to not get, you know, blown away with a sawed-off shotgun.

538
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 I personally think the alien throwing up the peace sign is more bizarre than it walking up the wall,

539
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 because aliens do alien things, I'm used to that at this point,

540
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 like I said, like, magically appearing out of nowhere, freezing people in place,

541
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,000
 blowing up planes, those are things that aliens do,

542
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 but when aliens exhibit human-like behavior, that to me is more interesting,

543
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,500
 because it means that not only are they watching, not only are they visiting us,

544
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:49,000
 that they're learning from us, they're learning techniques and skills to avoid bad endings.

545
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,500
 Sometimes people have encounters with aliens, it terrifies them for the rest of their life,

546
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 sometimes people have encounters with aliens,

547
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 and they wish more than anything they can meet those aliens again,

548
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,500
 and sometimes people have encounters with aliens, and after it's over, they prepare a light snack and go back to bed.

549
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 And I think the difference between those types of encounters is how the aliens interact with the humans.

550
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,000
 And when you meet an alien who just happens to be bumbling about your backyard,

551
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,500
 notices you're watching him and throws you up a little peace symbol and kicks bricks out of there,

552
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
 that's a good alien.

553
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 That's an alien you would want to meet again,

554
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,000
 that's an alien that you could even call a friend.

555
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,500
 And maybe borrow his UFO someday and go rollin', rollin', rollin' through the galaxy.
