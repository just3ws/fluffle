1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Is the Mongolian death worm still hunting its prey today?

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,200
 And we take a look at an infamous film

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,360
 Detailing an infamous event today on Dead Rabbit Radio

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:22,440
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,640
 I hope you're having a great day that my great day comes with a little bit of

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,680
 quotation marks

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,680
 The heat's getting to me man

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,800
 Dang it. I just realized I have to talk about the desert for like 10 minutes in this episode because we're talking about Mongolian death worms

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
 You know I did

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 Let's see. Let's see if my brain can

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,360
 Process what I want to talk about

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,000
 death worms

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,800
 Walking around

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,640
 Okay, here's a question for you

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:03,000
 Why is hot sauce why does hot sauce taste so different from other hot sauces, but all ketchup tastes the same I

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,300
 Don't know let's start the episode. It's just way too hot

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,360
 Actually that is a good question, but you know what I mean like all I did never mind. Let's get started with the episode

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,160
 Oh, yes, the Mongolian death worm

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,040
 So the Mongolian death worm is one of those legends that have seeped into the current day

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
 so we have creatures like

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,960
 Gnomes and fairies, which you know like I think Iceland still believes in gnomes and stuff like that

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
 But for the most part people go. Oh, you know gnomes may have been around back in the day

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,480
 I don't think most people think gnomes are around, but you know what I mean like there are

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,360
 Creatures that are considered far far in the past that we don't have to deal with any more dragons is a good idea of that

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
 And then there's creatures that have old

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,200
 Old legends about them and they're still being seen and that would cover stuff like bigfoot

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,720
 And that also would cover the creature the Mongolian death worm now if you're not familiar with what the Mongolian death worm is

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,800
 It's interesting because just like the Jabu foe fee

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,480
 The giant spider we talked about on Tuesday, I believe

30
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,800
 The Mongolian death worm

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
 All the sightings are secondhand

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,040
 There's been no Western Explorer to actually be able to say oh we saw that not like it's important that it has to be Western

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
 but you know what I mean like most of the

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,040
 sightings we have is someone talking to someone else and then being like oh, yeah, I saw that and the

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,840
 The descriptions are all fairly the same

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,000
 If I saw a monster and then you saw a monster

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,760
 Independently we may have different versions of what that monster looks like but if we both saw a tiger

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,120
 I may see it from behind and I may describe it a little bit differently than you but you could compare both

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,440
 Events and say well, they're probably talking about a tiger

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,440
 They're probably both that they one person saw it in the shadows

41
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,560
 So it just looked like a giant cat with a certain type of ear structure and the other person saw it in the day

42
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
 And they had stripes, but he couldn't really see his head because he was I don't know drinking water or

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,040
 eating an ostrich and

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,880
 So the Mongolian death worm all I won't say all but most of the descriptions are the same

45
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,920
 It's it's not you'll you'll watch movies and

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,080
 Mongolian death worm is I've seen it in a couple movies

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,200
 I actually saw one really good one that I'm gonna put the link to it's not a movie so much. There was a

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,040
 Television show. I don't know if it's still around. I don't think so called the Lost Tapes

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,960
 And it was basically a found footage television show. It was really good

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,680
 It was about I think it was these three young men on ATVs

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,520
 Doing some cross-continent race and they their ATVs breakdown in the Gobi Desert

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,280
 And the Mongolian death worm stalking them

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,340
 So kind of has this tremors vibe because as long as they're on the ATV and totally immobile

54
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,880
 The Mongolian death worm doesn't know that they're there

55
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,280
 So it was really good. I'll put that link in there. I recommend you watching him

56
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,880
 But generally in movies they portray this Mongolian death worm as this giant creature the size of a graboid from tremors and

57
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,120
 The local descriptions of it or it's about three meters long

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
 I don't know what that is in English

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,240
 Because you know the only real measurement system is feet and inches, but I think three meters long

60
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,480
 I think is something like four feet or something like that. I don't know but anyways, so it's relative

61
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,880
 I mean that's the size. That's a size of a medium-sized snake. That's fairly believable

62
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,040
 What makes people doubt that it exists is that it has two other attributes that people are like

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,820
 And maybe that's just made up one is it spits out some sort of toxin

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,480
 So you have this three foot long worm that it burrows underground and

65
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,680
 When somebody's walking over it it jumps out at you and bites you it can also jump out at you and spit a toxin at you

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,300
 And you're like well, you know, there's animals that do that. There's animals that shoot out toxin. They're definitely toxic animals

67
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,000
 The Mongolian death worm has another attribute is that it can release electricity

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,400
 It can shock people near it

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,360
 So if you're or animals if you're walking on the ground the first thing you may feel as opposed to walking in the sky

70
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,280
 I guess but as you're walking the first thing you'll feel is a sharp electric shock

71
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,060
 It kind of stuns you and you'll fall down and then it can kind of take its time with you spray the poison in your face

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,400
 Eat what's left

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,440
 Now this creature has had sightings going back as long as there are people in the area

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,580
 It came to the West's attention. I believe like back in 1920 and at that time

75
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,560
 So the Mongolian Prime Minister at that time was like I've seen the death worm

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,680
 He could describe it and what's funny is that for a long time?

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,920
 There was actually a ban in the country for hunting the death worm

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,120
 They just didn't want to deal with people going out there now. It's not the most

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,360
 I'm sure they're having a bunch of crackpots going out there and dying of dehydration because it is a desert after all

80
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,320
 But I always think it's just for interesting when governments enact rules. I think it's in

81
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,600
 Nepal or

82
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,120
 Somewhere out there out east where it's against the law to harass a

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,400
 Yeti you can't go yeti hunting. They're like a protected species. So sometimes it's a publicity stunt

84
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,840
 I actually think it's illegal to hunt bigfoot in Washington as well. I might be a publicity stunt

85
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
 It might just be you know

86
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,200
 And it might be publicity star. It may be real. They're like man

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,280
 We don't want people going out there and getting killed by these Mongolian death worms. It's most likely publicity stunt

88
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,740
 But so you have this creature. It's blood red because what happens is it lays its eggs inside a camel's

89
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:44,520
 Intestines and they eat up the I'm assuming dead camel they eat it up and it just like gives them this red coloring and

90
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,240
 They say that it's just a silent predator. It just lives in the desert

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,300
 It'll kill anything. It'll eat anything. It just like most cre- and this is an interesting fact of it too

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,440
 when you're making stuff up

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,280
 If it's made up you can make up whatever it does you can be like yes

94
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,680
 It's the size of a house and it will swallow your firstborn child and it'll come over to where you work

95
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,280
 And it'll start knocking pins off your desk like you just make it up

96
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,600
 If you're making up that's actually a fairly relative size for something that's

97
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,840
 You're like, well, how big was it? You're like, I don't know three meters. I mean, you know, that sounds more realistic

98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,160
 Also, they generally don't hunt humans. They prefer to hunt animals, but will kill a human if need be

99
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,520
 So again when we look at stuff like the Groot Slang and they're like it was created by the gods

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,940
 And it's one of the most intelligent creatures on the planet and it steals people's gold

101
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,080
 That sounds far more made up than there's a really big worm in the desert

102
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,660
 That shoots acid and can shock you and it will usually eat an animal, but it might eat you too

103
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,040
 so

104
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,840
 The Mongolian to see the stuff like the Groot Slang. I

105
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,500
 Like the idea of it. I don't think it exists the giant spider from Tuesday's episode and the Mongolian death worm

106
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,360
 I think are very likely to exist if not existing today

107
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,760
 Existed at some point in human history and that's why those legends have been passed down. I'm not saying you can you know

108
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,720
 Book a flight to the Gobi Desert right now

109
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,920
 Parachute in and find one because no westerner has ever seen one or at least ever seen one and survived to talk about it

110
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
 But again if this creature isn't necessarily hunting humans and it is under the ground

111
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,520
 What are the chances of you trying to find it in a desert? It's a massive desert. They don't know how many of these things are

112
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,080
 But this is one of those cryptids that if we found evidence of it

113
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,920
 I want to be surprised at all if we found giant spiders and you know giant spiders have exoskeletons

114
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,640
 But when they die, I wonder how they fossilize. I'm sure we found fossilized spiders from the past

115
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,120
 But I wonder how they oh and that's dope about this thing too

116
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,080
 Mongolian death worm actually has an exoskeleton as well and

117
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,560
 When it's damaged when it's attacked it can actually molt off its armor and grow new armor

118
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,080
 So they're fairly difficult to kill. They're not impossible. I mean obviously if you shot one it's dead

119
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,320
 But it's mostly built for protecting against like animal attacks where if I don't know what else lives out in the Gobi Desert if a

120
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:24,320
 Paku-paku attacks it it can be like ha ha ha and then just like drop take off that piece of broken armor

121
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,520
 Have some new one and then he shocks him

122
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,840
 And eats him

123
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,220
 So I don't know the mongolian death worm

124
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,640
 Mongolian death worm I'm gonna put in the possible category of

125
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,000
 My cryptid category. I just made up for this episode. I'm gonna count it as possible

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,280
 It may not have the elect I think the least likely thing out of everything. It's described is the electrical ability

127
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,380
 I don't think the size is ridiculous. I don't think the venom is ridiculous

128
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,880
 I don't think the environment or what it hunts and all that stuff the electric electrical shock thing is probably the most

129
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
 fantastical thing

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,480
 But the only thing that really makes people doubt this is they've never seen one

131
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,000
 Everything else fits into how big of these type of creatures can be what it would eat

132
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,240
 How it would live and things like that and again with the giant spider the only every it acts like a spider a hunts like a spider

133
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,360
 Does everything like a spider the only thing people debate is I can't get that big

134
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,000
 As opposed to the Groot slaying which is completely mythological or the Atowah the tiny tiny ant sized humans

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,520
 I mean those aren't just on its face

136
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,520
 completely untrue so I

137
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,960
 Do recommend I haven't watched I said I seen those other death war movies as in I've seen they exist

138
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,160
 I haven't watched any of the other death war movies, but actually I probably am going to but I recommend you guys watch the

139
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
 Lost tapes and again, I'll put that link in below

140
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,320
 Now we're gonna move on to our next story

141
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,940
 Which is actually currently being made into a movie

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,260
 But you guys are gonna get a little spoiler on that you guys don't have to wait for the movie to come out

143
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,480
 Back during World War two

144
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,680
 Joseph Goebbels I think that's how you pronounce his last name if I if I'm wrong I apologize not to him

145
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,880
 To you he I don't care about him

146
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,640
 Goebbels and might be Goebbels. I don't know any anyways Joseph you got he was propaganda minister for the Nazis

147
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
 so he

148
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,760
 believed that film was one of the greatest propaganda tools around

149
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,360
 Available and it was it was it is still to today

150
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
 So he made a movie one of the movies he made was called suss the Jew and

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,480
 It was a drama about an innocent German girl being raped by a Jewish man and audiences around Germany loved it

152
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,080
 And he's like okay. I'm on to something. I just need to make propaganda films to keep the Germans because this is like in

153
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,400
 1942-1943 so things weren't going well

154
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,720
 He's like well, I'm gonna make these Nazi propaganda movies keep the spirits up

155
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,400
 This is how we're going to keep people fighting keep people in line with the Nazi idea

156
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,920
 So it dawns on him

157
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,680
 What is one of the greatest tragedies in recent human memory other than the whole Nazi Holocaust thing?

158
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
 It was the sinking of the Titanic

159
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,320
 And so Goebbels I'm gonna mispronounce his name every single time I say it so let's just go on there

160
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,640
 But he decides to make a tight movie about the Titanic with a twist

161
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,600
 He wants to put the onus on

162
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,400
 Capitalism the reason why the ship sank was capitalism the Nazis were national socialists

163
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,520
 They were a socialist movement who believed that the government should control everyone gets a job the government controls the economy

164
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,280
 Capitalism is not something that they were too fond of

165
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:52,600
 so they basically wrote this script where it's these businessmen in New York and Britain who realized that the

166
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,880
 Company that owns the Titanic, which I think was the red star line was not doing well

167
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,560
 So they go what if we take we take this new boat?

168
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,160
 We built the Titanic and we race it across the ocean as fast as we can and it will win this award

169
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,960
 And what we'll do right now is we're gonna short sell our stock because the stock is low and then once it completes the race

170
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,960
 We will buy the stock back or something like that. Oh, they were gonna cover it or whatever

171
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,880
 They were going to make a ton of money once it won the race

172
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,680
 So basically girl bulls is figuring this to be like it's a mad mad mad mad world

173
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,000
 But with the Titanic just this wacky race

174
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
 so

175
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,640
 That's the plot so that's the start of the plot and then they inserted they created a German character

176
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,880
 Who's like an officer on the ship and he's like as the captain's who's like speeding across the ocean the German guy's like

177
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,600
 We shouldn't go so fast sir and the British captain's like you don't understand anything German

178
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,680
 We're we we're gonna make it and this is gonna be the fastest boat right ever

179
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,120
 And so then of course spoiler alert the boat ends up hitting an iceberg

180
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,280
 so his girlfriend was this the the

181
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,920
 German first officer had a love interest and

182
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,800
 He's like he has to get to her to get off the boat and they show all like the rich people on the boat like totally cowardly

183
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,760
 They're just like no no save me first save me first

184
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,240
 While this German guy is like running through the boat saving poor people and all the Germans are like come with us

185
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,080
 We're all on this together and we'll take care of you and at one point

186
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:34,640
 The German officer the star grabs this little girl because the boats starting to like go under and there's like this

187
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:40,520
 These little girl is trapped in her cabin because her parents are like capitalism rules. See you later kid

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,400
 The German guy gets the kid he then jumps off of the boat and

189
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,560
 Lands on the water and his girlfriend shows up in a rowboat and they get in and the Titanic falls into the water

190
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,360
 And then there's this whole thing at the end where the Germans like the company was trying to make us go fast

191
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,840
 And the courts are like well we're capitalist too so you're innocent

192
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:07,080
 And it was this whole thing about how the system is rigged against the working class and how Germans are noble and the British

193
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
 New Americans are all about money

194
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,880
 So as a propaganda film that would work that was the plot

195
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,360
 But what happened was when they were making the movies when the weird stuff started to happen

196
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,400
 Gobbles gobbles. I can't believe okay. Anyways, he

197
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:29,400
 Personally picked the director to do this film. He had worked on other propaganda films for him. He goes. I want you to direct this the movie

198
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,880
 Cost at its time a hundred and eighty million dollars

199
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,360
 Well with inflation or maybe not inflation. Let me check

200
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,460
 Yeah with inflation a hundred eighty million dollars. Remember there were there a war. This is not like in

201
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,160
 1937 they're in war. This is in 1942

202
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,960
 They got other stuff to spend their money on

203
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,120
 anyways, he personally picks this director they're shooting the movie and

204
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,720
 the Nazis send over a bunch of

205
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,160
 Advisors to the film to be like this is what it's like being on a boat and the advisors are constantly drunk and

206
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,520
 They're sexually molesting or assaulting the women working on there and the directors like okay guys

207
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,920
 Let's get it together and they won't listen to him. So he starts complaining now

208
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:20,200
 That's one thing you don't want to do in a totalitarian state because it gets back to Gobbles

209
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,840
 he

210
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:29,600
 Personally pulls in the director and says did you say this stuff and the director's like looks him goes. Yeah, I said that stuff and that really made

211
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,440
 I'm just gonna stick with Gobbles. It really made Gobbles mad

212
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,200
 I really hope that's how I say his name anyways

213
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,680
 It really made him mad because this was a guy he personally picked and now he's basically like throwing that in his face

214
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:49,200
 He sends him to jail, but luckily for the Nazis that he hangs himself the next day

215
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,920
 So the director's dead and it's real to suicide

216
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,000
 so then the cast is like what you know, that's not he didn't die and they kind of get upset and

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,040
 Gobbles is like hey listen man

218
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:09,480
 You can complain all you want. I got a nice jail cell with an extra bed sheet. So the cast was like, okay, we're done

219
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
 We're done with this

220
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 So they get another director

221
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,920
 We continue to make the movie he gets finished. It's way over budget

222
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,760
 Gets finished now and also there they actually had like they were shooting it on a real like liner a real big boat

223
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,480
 And there was Lena obviously pick up shots other place

224
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,960
 But the set was an actual boat that was sailing out in the ocean

225
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
 so they shoot the movie and

226
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:43,400
 Gobbles is watching it at one point. It's all done and there's scenes to show how like uncaring the capitalist are towards the

227
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,760
 Poor people in on the boat

228
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,160
 So there's a few scenes of like, you know

229
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,280
 They'll pull down gates and lock them so the poor people can't get out and you saw that actually in the James Cameron movie

230
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,840
 Titanic like the safety gates came down and they'd lock them

231
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,680
 But he prevented people from getting out to surface so they could not drown

232
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,320
 So there are scenes of these gates coming down and like families being separated and like reaching through the gate

233
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,760
 Like the German mothers like come to me my daughter and the German daughters like I'm so scared

234
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,280
 I can't get through the gate. I can't get through the gate and

235
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,240
 They think that's one of the reasons why this movie was never aired in Germany

236
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,680
 Because that's kind of like what was going on in concentration camps and in ghettos and on trains

237
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,840
 people were basically having gates put in between them and crying as

238
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:40,080
 In this movie was the capitalist the uncaring capitalist and in reality. It was the uncaring

239
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,800
 national socialists

240
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,360
 They also say that it wasn't released another reason why it wasn't released was that

241
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,360
 it made

242
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:58,160
 It was coming towards the end of the war and it was basically a movie about a hopeless event and a few people surviving a hopeless event

243
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,200
 and

244
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,120
 Historians feel that it might as gerbils was watching and he might have thought they the German people might

245
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,880
 think more of the Titanic being this horrible hopeless event and

246
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:18,080
 Making that the equivalent to what they were going through like they're literally on a sinking ship both sides of two different armies

247
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
 Are just pushing them in

248
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,000
 So the movie was never released in Germany

249
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,400
 After the war it should it was aired in Russia sometimes and they called it a trophy film

250
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,840
 Which I think it was almost like that's almost like a hate song like they

251
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,840
 Destroyed Germany and then they would watch this movie and laugh at it about how stupid it was

252
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,080
 There was a VHS copy that was floating around Germany for a while

253
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,600
 They say would air on television every once in a while and it did start to get shown in other places because

254
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,240
 German films

255
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,080
 The cinematography is pretty good like they they really pioneered some filmmaking techniques

256
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,120
 And eventually did get restored and you can watch it now. I haven't seen it

257
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,560
 I'm assuming it would be all in German, but that could be a bad assumption

258
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,480
 So what happened to the boat? What happened to the boat that they filmed the Titanic on well apparently

259
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,040
 It was towards the end of the war. It's like almost over and

260
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,080
 The Germans were like, oh man

261
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,560
 You know, it's all we're almost out of here. What can we do?

262
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,680
 We're almost done. What do you want to do and the other guys like, you know what I want to do

263
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,760
 I want to kill some more Jewish people

264
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,760
 So they loaded a bunch of Jewish people onto this boat turned it into a prison boat and sent it out

265
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:44,680
 Going okay, two things are gonna happen with the wars ending two things are gonna happen either the British are gonna blow it up

266
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,120
 or we're gonna sink it

267
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,040
 one of the two and

268
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,160
 Some British bombers spotted a Nazi ship in the water and they dropped bombs on it and killed them

269
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,840
 And it would they kill ended up killing three times the amount of people who died on the actual Titanic

270
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:07,960
 That is the history of it's generally called the Nazi Titanic and it was actually the first movie on the subject that was called

271
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,840
 Titanic or the Titanic before they were called like a night to remember. I think was the first big

272
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:22,120
 Titanic film this one was just called the Titanic or no actually was just called Titanic. I don't know how many times I have to say that

273
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,520
 This one was called Titanic. It was the first movie about the event called Titanic

274
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,200
 There had been other movies about that. I know one of them was called the night to remember

275
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,640
 Which sounds romantic, but it's not as much people drowning

276
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,280
 Movies are a very good propaganda tool

277
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,120
 but you may want to think

278
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
 long and hard

279
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,040
 About what you're trying to prop gan propagandize

280
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,320
 because obviously they had some things in mind about

281
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
 corruption in the government and

282
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,680
 uncaring bureaucrats separating families and

283
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,480
 the hopelessness of being surrounded by darkness and

284
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,120
 slowly drowning

285
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,600
 Probably aren't messages you want to give to people who live in a brutal totalitarian regime

286
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,560
 where they've seen families separated and

287
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,120
 They are getting bombed daily probably not a good idea

288
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:29,560
 Nazi Germany was full of bad ideas. This was probably their least bad idea. I

289
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,280
 Do have to say I would I would watch this not the movie Titanic because again

290
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,080
 It's probably on German, but I would watch a movie about the making of Titanic

291
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,480
 I think that sounds far more interesting than the movie they made. I think I would watch that

292
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
 I'm not a big fan of World War two movies in general. I

293
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,040
 Think they're all kind of the same

294
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,680
 It's saying private Ryan was okay. Same Ryan Ryan actually only had one good

295
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,680
 Scene and that was the beach scene everything else was kind of lame honestly

296
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,720
 And it made every game be washed out gray after that call the dude and all that stuff

297
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,720
 It's like they just put grace around wrap over their graphics and said hey

298
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,920
 It's like saying private Ryan. I'm not a big fan of those that era

299
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,720
 That storytelling era. I'm not a big fan of it

300
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,560
 But I had watched this maybe if it was on stars or something like that on YouTube

301
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,160
 We'll find out when it comes out if it ever does

302
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,000
 Dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to be oh, I have a I am curious

303
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,200
 So what happens if when they're making this movie about the Nazi Titanic?

304
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,920
 That boat sinks - that'd be crazy

305
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,400
 You know a guy died making James Cameron's Titanic. Maybe just that story is cursed

306
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,520
 I'm not gonna make a slain Dion joke either. That's kind of low hanging fruit

307
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,440
