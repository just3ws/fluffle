1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A mystery, possibly a meaningless mystery, but a mystery nonetheless, pops up on YouTube.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,740
 Are grey aliens as fragile as they look?

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,740
 And then we travel to Africa to look at the story of the Leopard Society.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,800
 They started off fighting the slave trade, but in the end, did they turn on their own

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,160
 people today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:32,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
 I'm doing little finger guns.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
 At you.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 I like them cool and point at you.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
 It's not cool if you have to explain it.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,400
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest supporter on Patreon, Andrew Light.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
 Andrew.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,000
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,600
 You are going to be our pilot, our robo captain, whatever vehicle we use today.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,880
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,640
 Just help get the word out about the show really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,720
 So Andrew, we're going to take the Dead Rabbit Durgible up for this first story.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,640
 This story can almost be summed up in two or three sentences.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
 Very, very interesting one.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,920
 I don't really know if I'd use the word interesting.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,040
 That's why I don't want to spend a long time on it, but it's definitely perplexing.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,080
 On the Unresolved Mysteries subreddit, a user named Ganesha811 pointed this out.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,480
 Pixar's YouTube channel has their YouTube videos listed in most popular, most viewed.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,160
 Number two is the Incredibles 2 official trailer.

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,920
 It came out two years ago.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,120
 136 million views.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
 That's fine, right?

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,280
 I'm actually surprised it's not bigger.

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 Their official trailer, I honestly thought more people would watch it.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,920
 What makes that even more puzzling is the number one most viewed video out of all Pixar's

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,200
 YouTube videos is up.

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,480
 But it's not even the trailer for the animated movie Up.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,120
 It's the trailer showing that the DVD and Blu-ray is going to go on sale soon.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
 It's a minute long.

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,240
 Each character in the movie floats by on balloons.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
 There's almost no talking.

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,720
 The only person who says anything is the dog.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,240
 It's just like the old man floats by, the kid floats by, the bird floats by, the dog

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
 floats by.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,600
 Then it says, "It's almost completely silent for a minute long."

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
 And then it says, "Available on Blu-ray and DVD soon."

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,040
 Almost half a billion views.

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
 477 million views.

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,160
 It's more than double the amount of the Incredibles official trailer.

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
 That's bizarre.

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,920
 And no one can really figure that out, but that's not even the tip of the mystery.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,880
 It also has a very, very small like to dislike ratio.

50
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,520
 Normally, you have a ton of likes and a little bit of dislikes.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,480
 There's usually a pretty vast difference.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,920
 This one, 1.2 million likes.

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
 766,000 dislikes.

54
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,920
 Odd.

55
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,640
 It's an odd detail and it's funny because that's the mystery.

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,800
 That's it.

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
 It's something that could be some sort of glitch.

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,480
 If you go to the subreddit, there's a lot of different theories.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,040
 Some people say it was added to a popular play--a children's playlist in Asia.

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,680
 And it was in conservation.

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,320
 Some people said it may have been played in electronic stores across the country where

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,400
 you have it just on repeat.

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
 But nobody knows.

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,240
 Other people say that it has some sort of hidden Illuminati message, that it's an MK

65
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,760
 Ultra, mind control thing.

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,240
 I mean, I'm at a loss.

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,800
 I think it's--I mean, that's really the whole mystery.

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
 There's not much to it that we know.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
 But I think it's always interesting to stumble across this type of puzzle.

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
 Is there an answer to it?

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
 Was it a computer glitch?

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,120
 Was it on repeat somewhere?

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
 Who knows.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
 A very simple mystery, but a mystery nonetheless.

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,040
 Andrew, let's go ahead and leave behind that very short mystery.

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,000
 We are headed out now to Riverview, Kentucky.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:52,960
 This is another fairly short one.

78
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,120
 This is a story I got from thinkaboutadox.com.

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's very short, but it might be one of my favorite UFO alien stories.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
 You'll figure out why in a second.

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,240
 It's Winter 1985.

82
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
 It's 3 AM.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,120
 This is another story I got from thinkaboutadox.com website, which has a lot of UFO stuff.

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,600
 A lot of really interesting stuff.

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 It's dark now.

86
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 It's spooky.

87
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,480
 It's 3 AM in the morning.

88
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,640
 There's a dude.

89
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,120
 He's laying in bed.

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 Ugh.

91
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 Ugh.

92
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,200
 I don't know why he's making those noises.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
 Maybe he just ate Taco Bell.

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 He's all, "Ugh."

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,680
 That would actually explain the upcoming vision.

96
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,240
 He's sleeping in bed and he hears a low humming sound.

97
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
 And it's just annoying enough to wake him up.

98
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,760
 And as his eyes are opening up, there's a bright light.

99
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,920
 And he begins just screaming, which I think would be a natural reaction, right?

100
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
 Maybe not.

101
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,080
 Like maybe if you lived with someone and they get up out of bed and they turn on the bathroom

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
 light, you're not going to be like, "Ahhh."

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,400
 And if you're living alone, if you know one, there should be no lights on in your house

104
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,960
 and there's definitely should be no low humming, he just immediately starts screaming.

105
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,920
 It's like a natural defense mechanism.

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
 "Ahhh."

107
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,640
 He sees three great aliens walk into the room.

108
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,120
 He said their skin was gray, so he had a tint of green to it as well.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,720
 But he watches them walk into the room and he goes into, you know, there's fight, flight

110
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,360
 or freeze mode.

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,760
 This guy goes into fight mode on overdrive because he basically he's woken up, he's

112
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,920
 in this deep sleep, Taco Bell, he's still trying to digest that Taco Bell.

113
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,040
 Bright light, humming sound, jumps out of bed.

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
 Like in one fluent motion, three great aliens walk into the room.

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,680
 You know, before this happened, they were probably like, "This is a routine, you know,

116
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
 snatch and grab, right?

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
 We're going to take this dude up, we're going to stick a couple things of them, drop him

118
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
 off.

119
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 It'll be totally fine.

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
 Why are you so nervous?

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
 Barry and Barry the aliens.

122
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 Like, I don't know, I just have a bad feeling about this.

123
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,040
 I mean, we are telepathic creatures.

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,400
 I can sense this guy's intentions even though he's asleep.

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
 I don't think this is going to turn, oh, come on Barry, it'll be fine.

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,620
 This is your last abduction too.

127
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,840
 After this, you're going to retire and you can hang out with all your space babes.

128
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,400
 Yeah, yeah, I just have a bad feeling about this one.

129
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,000
 They're walking into this guy's room and he in a single motion jumps out of bed and

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,160
 wraps his hands around one of the aliens' neck and squeezes as hard as he can.

131
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,440
 Barry, the other aliens yell because right when he squeezes this great alien's neck,

132
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,480
 he said the head snapped like a twig.

133
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,920
 It just fell completely backwards.

134
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,480
 And he let go out of shock, right?

135
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
 Out of shock.

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,000
 You don't imagine that's going to happen, right?

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,560
 You're going to throttle him for a bit, maybe punch him a couple of times in his big

138
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,040
 little eyeballs, then you're like getting held down by the other two and then the guy's

139
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,440
 like picking up a bat and you figure it can go a lot of different ways.

140
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,600
 You don't imagine that you're going to squeeze something's neck and it immediately break

141
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
 like a twig.

142
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,400
 But the alien's head just snaps back like he shattered every bone in this creature's

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
 neck.

144
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,880
 The other two aliens stop advancing on this dude, on this unnamed witness.

145
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,720
 And then they grab their buddy, their now broken neck buddy, and he says they begin to

146
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,680
 walk like robots back towards the light.

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
 They disappear.

148
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,320
 Light goes away, humming stops.

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,880
 And this man is standing in his own bedroom going, "USA!

150
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
 USA!

151
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,600
 I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep after that, right?

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,040
 I mean, first off, I'd be afraid the aliens would come back with reinforcements.

153
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,160
 That aliens big brother shows up and be like, "Yo, whatcha do to my brother?"

154
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,480
 Plus, I'd be too amped up to go back to sleep.

155
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,520
 You just want to fight against an extraterrestrial.

156
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,520
 It's funny because there's been so many times on the show I've said that, you know, a lot

157
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,000
 of people are afraid of gray aliens, but they actually look really physically weak.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,240
 And I think that's why they use a lot of their mind tricks, a lot of their hypnosis.

159
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
 I don't know why.

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
 I don't know if they tried it on this guy and it didn't work.

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,760
 I don't know if they didn't even have a chance.

162
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,080
 They're like, "Hey, you ready to do that?

163
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
 The fine thing is like what?

164
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,960
 Oh, sorry, I was thinking about doing my taxes.

165
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 I was totally distracted.

166
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
 Ah, my neck!"

167
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,000
 Like, maybe he just caught them unaware.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,760
 Maybe they didn't expect him to have the moves of a jaguar or a leopard.

169
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
 That'll be a segue.

170
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
 I'm not done.

171
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 I'm not ready yet.

172
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,400
 But maybe they didn't expect him to have the moves of a jungle cat and attack them.

173
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,400
 But anyway, somewhere out there, Barry the alien is sitting there with his neck in a little

174
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,600
 cast and he's at the bar and the space babes are coming up and they're like, "Hey, Barry,

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 how did you get that?"

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,840
 I don't know why they sound like they're from Fargo, North Dakota.

177
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,960
 "Hey, Barry, how'd you get that cast on your neck?"

178
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,640
 And Barry's like, "Oh, do I have to tell this story again?"

179
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,600
 And then Barry has to make up the story about how he tried to abduct Conor McGregor or something

180
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
 like that, not just some random dude sitting in a Kentucky household.

181
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,520
 He's like, "Yeah, and then, you know, like I was fighting off all these Secret Service

182
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,240
 agents and I was this close to getting the president.

183
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,720
 But one of them slightly touched my neck.

184
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,560
 You know how our anatomy is and the space babes just kind of like roll in her eyes."

185
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
 So there we go.

186
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,680
 Andrew, we are going to give this Kentucky guy a high five.

187
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
 That's us giving him a high five.

188
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 He's looking at her neck.

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
 He's like, "I've killed once."

190
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,480
 They always say the second kill is far easier.

191
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,680
 No, no, no, let's run.

192
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
 Let's run.

193
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
 Andrew, call in that carbonar copter.

194
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,400
 We're being pursued now by this crazed Kentuckian.

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,920
 We're taking off in the carbonar copter.

196
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
 We are headed out.

197
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
 We're taking this carbonar copter.

198
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,160
 We are headed out to West Africa.

199
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,560
 We're flying over Western Africa.

200
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
 We're also going back in time.

201
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,800
 We're going back to the 1930s.

202
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,480
 So we're flying over.

203
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,800
 There's a village in Liberia.

204
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,880
 And in this village, there is a German doctor named Dr. Werner Jung.

205
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,680
 So Werner was working in Africa to help prevent like childhood diseases, render medical aid.

206
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,720
 He was there for about 10 years.

207
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 He kind of traveled around the country.

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,560
 Now at one point in his travels, he's invited into a house.

209
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,600
 He goes into this house and he sees a young girl dead on the ground.

210
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,120
 And he wrote this in his book.

211
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,920
 He wrote this in a book later on in his life.

212
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
 He wrote about his travels in Africa.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,880
 But he has this passage in his book, quote, "There on a mat in a house, I found the horribly

214
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,400
 mutilated body of a 15-year-old girl.

215
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,080
 The neck was torn to ribbons by…"

216
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 Let me pause here.

217
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
 You might.

218
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,400
 This gets a little gruesome.

219
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,040
 So we'll start this over.

220
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,040
 There on a mat in a house, I found the horribly mutilated body of a 15-year-old girl.

221
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,280
 The neck was torn to ribbons by the teeth and claws of the animal.

222
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,280
 The intestines were torn out.

223
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,040
 The pelvis shattered and one thigh was missing.

224
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,440
 The part of the thigh nod to the bone and a piece of the shin bone lay near the body.

225
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,760
 It seemed at first glance that only a beast of prey could have treated the girl's body

226
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
 in this way.

227
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:08,960
 But closer investigation brought certain particularities to light, which did not fit in with the picture.

228
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,640
 I observed, for example, that the skin at the edge of the undamaged part of the chest

229
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,800
 was torn by strangely regular gashes about an inch long.

230
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,320
 Also the liver had been removed from the body, with a clean cut no beast could make.

231
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,240
 I was struck, too, by a piece of intestine, the ends of which appeared to have been smoothly

232
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
 cut off.

233
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:38,160
 And lastly, there was the fracture of the thigh, a classic example of fracture by bending.

234
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,520
 So Werner goes, "Lepid society?"

235
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:49,240
 And invited him into the house, looks around, nods his head, "Lepid society."

236
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,640
 The leopard society is the oldest secret society in Western Africa.

237
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,240
 And like a lot of groups, it started off with good intentions.

238
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,320
 Originally, it was a group of elites, a group of elders, who saw slavers and westerners

239
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,800
 coming in, taking over their land, selling their people off.

240
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,560
 So they formed a group built to protect their people.

241
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,080
 What they would do is they would wear the skin of a leopard.

242
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,600
 We actually still have these pieces of clothing.

243
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 They're pretty badass.

244
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,920
 They're quite frightening if you really look at them.

245
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,800
 There'll be links in the show notes, you can see photos of this stuff.

246
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,400
 They wear a leopard mask, leopard skin clothing.

247
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,320
 They're usually armed with short spears, but they always have iron claws.

248
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,880
 Sometimes they'll throw a net on you as you're traveling late at night.

249
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,520
 They'll throw a net on you and then descend from the trees, kill you on the spot.

250
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,200
 A lot of times they hunted in packs of six to eight, and they would just watch and wait

251
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 till their enemy walked by.

252
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
 You couldn't put up a fight against them.

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,040
 They would spring out of the darkness.

254
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,640
 There was a lot of government investigations into these guys because they operated for

255
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,760
 decades.

256
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,040
 Their initial target was slave traders and westerners coming into their country.

257
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,880
 And to add to the whole mystique of it, there was a lot of rumors of them also being cannibals.

258
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,920
 Now, they eventually did a big government investigation in 1915.

259
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,360
 They had this massive government investigation.

260
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,360
 When the government investigation concluded, we cannot prove that they practiced cannibalism.

261
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,840
 We can prove they exist.

262
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,200
 We can't prove they practiced cannibalism.

263
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,280
 A lot of people said they did.

264
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
 A lot of people said no, that wasn't the case.

265
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,280
 Whatever it was, though, they would pull out human fat and use it to cover an item known

266
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,600
 as a borfima, which is like a spirit bag.

267
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,520
 It was basically a sacred relic to them.

268
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,000
 They each had one.

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,640
 What gave them the ability, the powers of a leopard.

270
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,800
 So you have this religious icon that they carried with them that was powered by human

271
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,960
 fat.

272
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,880
 So you would go out, you would kill a couple slave traders, render their fat, coat the bag,

273
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,720
 do the magic, and that would give you the ability to continue on your crusade.

274
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,120
 But we see this happen a lot.

275
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,880
 You'll see it in America.

276
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,800
 You'll have a group of immigrants come over, the Italians come over.

277
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,720
 And first off, we gotta protect our own.

278
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,000
 We gotta protect our own from those scummy Irish and the government and all that stuff.

279
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,760
 And so you have basically a neighborhood watch program.

280
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,680
 And eventually they go, well, we need more resources to keep our operation up.

281
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,320
 So you guys should be chipping in to help.

282
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
 What?

283
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,520
 Yeah, you need to chip in.

284
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,080
 And then eventually the group begins to prey on the community they were originally set

285
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 up to protect.

286
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,280
 There's the same thing with the crypts.

287
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,600
 The street gang, the crypts, started off as basically we're tired of getting picked on

288
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,960
 by all these other neighborhoods.

289
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,520
 We're gonna form a neighborhood protection unit.

290
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:08,640
 But at a certain point, you need more money and resources to continue fighting the external

291
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,160
 threat to gather those resources you turn on the people in your community.

292
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,640
 I did that episode about the street gang, the Decepticons.

293
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
 It was the same thing.

294
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,280
 It was a group of kids who wanted to stop getting beat up by other gangs.

295
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,480
 And eventually they began preying on their own neighborhood.

296
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
 It happens all the time.

297
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,000
 Whenever you have these groups set up, they almost always turn on the community that they

298
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,360
 originally were protecting.

299
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,840
 So that's what happened here.

300
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,680
 You had the Leopard Society realizing their war against the West was requiring more resources,

301
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,320
 more fat.

302
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,040
 So then they began attacking people in their own territory.

303
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,640
 They began attacking other Africans.

304
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,360
 That's where we have this story with this young girl being found.

305
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,880
 People feared the Leopard Society so much that when investigators would, because you

306
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,280
 had the local African government trying to figure out what was going on, you had local

307
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,440
 leaders trying to figure this out, and then you had Western governments trying to figure

308
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
 out.

309
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,200
 So you had all these investigations going on.

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,760
 It really came to a head in the early 1900s.

311
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,200
 But you would have entire villages deny the group existed.

312
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,160
 They could end up killing someone's kids.

313
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,800
 And the parents would go, "I don't know what you're talking about.

314
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,520
 There's no Leopard Society here."

315
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,520
 Now the leaders of the Leopard Society, oh really all the members were the elite?

316
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,080
 Because they caught a couple people and they actually held trials.

317
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,880
 And it would be, one of them was a missionary.

318
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,120
 And they held a trial and he was found guilty of being a member of the Leopard Society of

319
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
 killing people.

320
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,040
 They just exiled them, sent them to another country in Africa.

321
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,360
 That's what would usually happen to people who were found guilty of these crimes, even

322
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,600
 though these crimes should be capital crimes.

323
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,240
 They were just kicked out of the country they were in.

324
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,800
 I mean that's one of the benefits of being in the elite, right?

325
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
 The judge that's judging you probably knows you, right?

326
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,880
 Ah, he's a stand-up guy.

327
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
 He doesn't always render human fat.

328
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,800
 Ah, give him another chance.

329
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,040
 And then of course it's a secret society.

330
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,920
 What's to keep you from melding back into it?

331
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,440
 There was a report when I was looking into it.

332
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,040
 So I thought this was quite terrifying.

333
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,040
 This 18-year-old kid is walking around late at night in between towns.

334
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,320
 It feels safe.

335
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,320
 This is his country.

336
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,140
 This is his land.

337
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,800
 Maybe he had heard of the Leopard Society.

338
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,920
 I'm sure he was vaguely aware of it.

339
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,280
 This 18-year-old kid, he may or may not have ever heard of the Leopard Society.

340
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,560
 But as he's walking along at night, he sees someone in the bushes and he doesn't even

341
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 think twice about it.

342
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,360
 And then he realizes there are eight people in the bushes.

343
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,960
 And he goes, "Ah, this is not good.

344
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
 This is not good."

345
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
 They take him captive.

346
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,480
 They actually bring him into this separate area.

347
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,440
 They bring him into this clearing.

348
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,200
 And he said he was sitting up against the rock and he overheard them saying, "We got

349
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,320
 to kill this dude.

350
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 We got to kill this dude."

351
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,000
 And here's this 18-year-old kid, man, he's just out for a walk.

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,320
 He's hearing these voices on the other side of this big boulder saying, "We got to kill

353
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 him."

354
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,080
 And what was interesting was he's hearing this conversation and they say, "Well, first

355
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,040
 off, we already have a sacrifice.

356
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,920
 So why would we kill him other than to just keep him quiet?

357
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,880
 Like, we already have our sacrifice for tonight."

358
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,640
 But more importantly, I also know this kid's dad.

359
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 I know this kid's dad.

360
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,240
 He's a very, very important person in his town.

361
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,920
 So if we kill this kid, we're going to get a lot of heat.

362
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,480
 A lot of people are going to come looking for us.

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,480
 Like, we shouldn't kill him unless we have to.

364
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,400
 So he overhears this conversation.

365
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,360
 And when they come over and talk to him, they go, "Okay."

366
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,000
 Because he is, his dad's an important person, he would be considered one of the elite.

367
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,120
 These guys come over, they're wearing their leopard skins.

368
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,600
 They go, "Here's the deal.

369
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 You can join us.

370
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,480
 You can join the Leopard Society.

371
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,360
 You have to take this oath of silence.

372
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
 You have to take part in all of our rituals.

373
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,120
 Or we'll kill you on the spot."

374
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,720
 Even with everything that you know about the Leopard Society, and again, he may not have

375
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,920
 known half of what we've talked about in this short segment, but given that chance, given

376
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,560
 that chance of joining a group that you know kills people, or being killed right there,

377
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
 what do you do?

378
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,280
 And again, it's not like you could go like, "Sure."

379
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,080
 And then you just move out of town the next day.

380
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 They're going to find you.

381
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,440
 It's an elite secret society.

382
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,160
 What would you do in that moment?

383
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,320
 Someone says, "Join us or we're going to kill you on the spot."

384
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,600
 And knowing that they will.

385
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,880
 It's a really interesting question.

386
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,560
 I know for being 18 years old, the answer I think would always be yes.

387
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,240
 I think as an older person you could go, "I've lived a good life.

388
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,520
 I'd rather die now than join a murder cult."

389
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
 He says, "Yeah.

390
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
 I mean almost on the spot."

391
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
 He goes, "Yeah, I'll join.

392
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
 I'll join."

393
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,020
 So he joins right there and they go, "Okay."

394
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,320
 And they have one of those Borphemas.

395
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,320
 I don't know if they carry spares around, but they had one ready.

396
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,440
 They said, "This is your mother.

397
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,000
 You have to take care of this.

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,600
 This is your identity.

399
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,720
 It is your creator.

400
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,960
 This is what powers us.

401
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,720
 This is what now powers you.

402
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,200
 You need to respect this like you would respect your mother."

403
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,360
 And then this 18-year-old kid who was just a couple hours ago out on a walk is then forced

404
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 to...

405
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,480
 They said they had another sacrifice.

406
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,200
 He's then forced to watch them murder a young girl.

407
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,560
 And then he says they forced him to eat the flesh of the girl.

408
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,080
 Now, it's interesting because you do have first-hand accounts like that where people

409
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,960
 were like, "Yeah, we did eat flesh."

410
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,600
 But when the government paper was done and the government paper was being written for

411
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,280
 the British government, they said there's no proof.

412
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
 We don't know how much this stuff is anecdotal.

413
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,240
 We have that kid's story because he was on trial.

414
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,400
 That kid didn't come forward and go, "Oh, you won't believe the night I had."

415
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,320
 These people weren't getting arrested, but a lot of times when they were found guilty,

416
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,480
 they were just exiled to another part of Africa.

417
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,040
 They weren't being executed.

418
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,080
 You imagine if anyone else was admitting to murdering people, ritually murdering people,

419
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
 they'd be executed.

420
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,760
 But again, these are the elite.

421
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,800
 They say over time the Leopard Society kind of just fell to the wayside.

422
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,960
 And there were other groups.

423
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,720
 There was the Baboon Society.

424
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,560
 And that one, you had a single member who would wear a monkey suit.

425
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,560
 Don't tell Hans about this, but he would wear a monkey suit and then they would take a victim

426
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,360
 and the monkey would smash the victim down with his bare hands and begin eating the body.

427
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,240
 And then all the other people would stand around the Baboon suit and feel like the energy was

428
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
 going into them.

429
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,800
 They had a crocodile society, a devil society.

430
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,520
 There was a lot of these secret groups.

431
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,320
 They didn't work together.

432
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,040
 They were all adversaries.

433
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,000
 And I've stated that before, like my idea of conspiracy groups, cults, is there's hundreds

434
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,160
 of them and they're constantly fighting among each other.

435
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,480
 I don't believe there's one central Illuminati group.

436
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,040
 There might even be 15, 20 groups that use that name.

437
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,640
 But I think it's a lot of small groups fighting against each other for regional domination

438
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,920
 or world domination.

439
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,560
 The reason why I like this story, one, it's a secret society.

440
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,960
 I find those fascinating, too.

441
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,240
 It's a historical look back on what could be happening today, where you have these groups

442
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,320
 of groups of elites doing whatever they want, getting away with it, really.

443
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,360
 And when they do get caught, it's kind of brushed under the rug.

444
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,080
 Basically, you can look back and see the historical precedent.

445
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
 You can see the precedent.

446
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,360
 And I'm sure a lot of secret societies do start off with good intentions.

447
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,600
 I don't think there's probably a whole lot of them who says, "We're going to start off

448
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
 doing evil."

449
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,120
 I think most of them go, "We want to enlighten people.

450
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,320
 We want to come out of the dark ages and we want people to be enlightened."

451
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,960
 That's where the term Illuminati comes from.

452
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,640
 And then over time, it just becomes corrupted with new leadership or the goals change or

453
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,140
 greed.

454
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,240
 I think a lot of groups start off with really, really good intentions.

455
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,200
 And then over time, they just fall prey to basic human desires.

456
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,480
 This is-- I would be shocked if the Leopard Society isn't around today.

457
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,480
 I would be shocked.

458
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,880
 They may not continue to be gutting people traveling from town to town.

459
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 They might.

460
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 They might.

461
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
 You think it would be a lot harder to hide nowadays.

462
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 Actually, no.

463
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,300
 I guess if they're elites, it'd probably be fairly easy.

464
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,440
 But I would be shocked if they're-- it's the oldest secret society in West Africa.

465
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,400
 I would be shocked if around 1920s or '30s, they're like, "Ah, you know what?

466
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,720
 We had a good run."

467
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,920
 It wouldn't be hard to imagine somewhere in the world right now a group of elite power

468
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,240
 brokers meeting in the middle of nowhere.

469
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,320
 It's so remote, nobody notices the stretch limos driving down the barely maintained roads

470
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,360
 or the private helicopters landing in the clearing.

471
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,060
 But here are some of the most powerful men and women in West Africa.

472
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:52,580
 They are the descendants of the Leopard Society.

473
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,260
 Taking part in an age-old ritual.

474
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:03,900
 A victim is pulled out of a car, struggles, but can't get free.

475
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,420
 This ritual has been practiced countless times.

476
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:36,280
 And even today in 2020, it's time once again to refuel the Boer FEMA.
