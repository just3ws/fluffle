00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
 This episode is brought to you by the American Egg Council.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,520
 Can you have a conspiracy if nobody cares?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,200
 And then we travel to New Jersey to take a look at the bizarre story of a woman who tried to expose a murder and

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,200
 ended up becoming a beast today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys have a great weekend. This is our Friday episode.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,260
 I want to give a shout out to one of our legacy patreon, Bennett Grappone.

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,840
 Bennett Grappone, that's how you pronounce your name. I hope I'm close.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,800
 Thank you Bennett so much for supporting the show. This story we're actually going to use one of his stories.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,600
 So that's cool. That was Saren Dipidus. Bennett, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot, our driver this episode.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,720
 If you can't support the patreon though, that's okay too. Just help get the word out about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,640
 We also have a merch store. Minecraft server is still in operation. Join us on the Minecraft server. Bennett, I'm gonna flip you the keys.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,040
 To the Jason Jalopy. We're going for a little drive. We are headed out to

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,880
 New York. New York and the Sunset Strip. Totally different. Totally different place.

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,240
 There might be a Sunset Strip in New York, doubt it.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,440
 But anyways, we're going to New York. The year is 1985. So hold on to your purse. Check your wall.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,640
 It's the place's a cesshole. It's filled with crime. But not only are we in a crime-ridden hellhole,

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,600
 we're also New York Knicks fans in the 1980s. So I don't know much about sports,

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,520
 but I do know researching the story that the New York Knicks were having a really hard time. They're just not making shots.

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,080
 They're running in the wrong direction. I don't know really what can go wrong with basketball other than missing the hoop,

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,360
 but they were finding a way to do it. Basically every team they played against was globe-trotter level good.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,760
 These guys were having a hard time. So they needed a star player and they're getting ready to do the draft.

23
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,600
 And this is the first time they do the NBA draft this way.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,680
 They took all these envelopes and they threw them in a giant rotating bowl, like a lottery type thing.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,920
 And the NBA commissioner would reach in, pull out an envelope in whichever team he pulled out first,

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,200
 got first pick of the draft. This year was super important because this year, 1985,

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,600
 Patrick Ewing was up for the draft. Again, not a huge basketball fan,

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,680
 but you can always tell like if I know the name of a player, they're either amazing or they've broken a law.

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,520
 That's generally like if I know about the player, I'm like, "Oh, they were in the news or they're so good."

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,800
 I know who they are. Patrick Ewing was one of those guys. I knew that name.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,560
 I thought he was on Dallas, but he is considered a one in a generation player.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,720
 And everyone knows it. When he's coming up for the draft, everyone's like, "Whatever team he's on,

33
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,600
 it will change the future of that team." So the commissioner has a...

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
 They have this all filmed.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,520
 They're moving up the the envelopes. They're mixing it up and the commissioner reaches in,

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,240
 pulls out a random envelope, opens it up,

37
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,560
 New York Knicks get first pick.

38
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,320
 And of course, they pick Patrick Ewing. This is an interesting story because this is a conspiracy theory that literally everybody believes in.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,280
 People go, "There's no... the chances of New York Knicks who really needed a player like him."

40
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
 The chances of them getting them would... what is it? Like one in 36?

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,480
 How many teams were around back then? I guess I should have looked that up, but the odds were not in their favor.

42
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,920
 But they got it. They got their first pick. They picked Patrick Ewing and he took the team to new heights.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,920
 Everything worked out. What's interesting about this conspiracy theory is everyone's like, "Yeah, it's probably rigged."

44
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
 But

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,600
 everybody understands why. The New York Knicks sucked and they believe the NBA needed a

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,120
 New York team to be winning.

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,480
 They needed the New York franchise to really be on top. I was watching this

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
 segment that they showed on the Bleacher Report. They had a video interview with everyone involved. And

49
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
 people are like, "This is what they think happened. There's a couple different theories. One,

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,800
 that the envelope that had the Knicks on it, when someone knew where it was,

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,640
 they threw it into the drum and it got bent a bit.

52
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,480
 So the commissioner knew which one to grab. The most common theory though is that somebody took that envelope and

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 dipped it in dry ice to make it cold to the touch.

54
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,720
 Because he didn't pull out the first one he grabbed. He kind of shuffled around in there, grabbed the envelope, pulled it out.

55
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 So the theory is they either heated it up, which would not be a good idea,

56
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,200
 because then it's just like crumbly ash and you pick up the ash. You're like, "This looks like the Knicks.

57
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,240
 This looks like the Knicks this year. You're just ash."

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,120
 No, they think that it was most likely dipped in dry ice or just made cold somehow.

59
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,040
 And so when the commissioners reached around on there, he felt the coldest one pulled it out in New York Knicks.

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,840
 They're doing this segment on Bleacher Report and Patrick, they asked Patrick Ewing about it and he goes, "Maybe."

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:18,360
 But I don't care. He didn't care. The guy involved with it, he goes, "Listen, I understand why they would do this."

62
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,320
 It was weird because all this time later people are like, "Yeah, it might have happened.

63
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 It might have been completely rigged."

64
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,920
 But nobody cares because everything worked out in the end. Patrick Ewing was happy on that team.

65
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,480
 The team was very successful. Now if they had been interviewing coaches from other teams,

66
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,560
 they might not-- 30 years has passed now, but other coaches may not have been this happy.

67
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,880
 But all these years later Patrick Ewing was like, "It's just funny that people are still talking about this."

68
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:50,040
 But he was very nonchalant and all these reporters they were interviewing, they're like, "Yeah, it probably was rigged, but everything worked out."

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,720
 It's funny because can you have a conspiracy if nobody cares about it?

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
 Like if you cheat the system and everyone's like, "Yeah, it's fine." And everything worked out fine in the end.

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,560
 It's very rare you come across a conspiracy theory like that.

72
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,440
 I was actually when I-- so I was looking at more sports conspiracies because I recently did that one

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,560
 that I've already forgotten about. What was that? Oh, the balls.

74
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,080
 The balls in baseball were getting juiced and a lot of you guys said, "Oh, do more sports conspiracy theories."

75
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
 So I was looking up some-- this is one of the big ones.

76
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,200
 Actually, this goes into a bigger theory that the draft today is completely rigged.

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,600
 This was kind of like a heartwarming conspiracy. Like, "Yeah, maybe.

78
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,320
 Nowadays people go-- the whole thing's rigged.

79
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 Major sports are rigged, which is a little more sinister.

80
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,080
 I believe once money gets involved, obviously, you could have rigged games and stuff like that.

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,560
 I remember when I was a Sacramento Kings fan in the short time period that I was watching basketball,

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,080
 you would see them get up to the playoffs, but because they're not a nationally recognized or super famous team,

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,400
 it always seemed like the refs were calling bad calls on them because they wanted it to be, you know, New York versus LA or whatever.

84
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,720
 They didn't want the Sacramento Kings. So you can kind of see stuff like that.

85
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,920
 And people get mad about that because people are betting money, they're losing money,

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:12,080
 people have invested a lot of time into a team, and then they're like, the refs are making bad calls and things like that.

87
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,640
 But this is more of a heartwarming conspiracy.

88
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,800
 "Yeah, let's-- let's suck.

89
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,080
 Let's give them the best player in a generation and see how they do."

90
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,880
 And they worked. It worked. He was happy. The team was happy.

91
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,520
 History was made in basketball.

92
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,400
 And to this day, people still swear that that envelope was frozen, and it probably was.

93
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,360
 But literally nobody cares.

94
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,240
 Everyone thinks everything worked out.

95
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,560
 And I'm trying to think of another conspiracy that that's happened.

96
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,920
 I'm wondering if there's another conspiracy theory. Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah, no one got hurt."

97
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,440
 I don't think so. Most of the time, conspiracies involve companies crushing people or nations

98
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,080
 basically doing stuff behind the scenes.

99
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,040
 It's very rare you come across a conspiracy theory that even the victims are kind of like, "Yeah, whatever."

100
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,440
 Like, we still had a pretty good year.

101
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,000
 There's probably one coach out there who would disagree with me.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,080
 One coach who coached in 1985 who can feel free to email me at deadrapradio.com and be like, "I know the truth."

103
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,000
 I should have got Patrick Ewing. But other than that one grump, everything worked out pretty fine.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,480
 So Bennett, let's go ahead and hop in the carpenter copter.

105
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,160
 We are leaving behind New York, New York, and the sunset strip.

106
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,120
 We're leaving. We're saying goodbye to New York, New York.

107
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,720
 Patrick Ewing reaches up.

108
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,480
 We're 500 feet in the air. He reaches up and gives us a high five.

109
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,320
 That's how high he jumps. That's what a great player he was.

110
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,040
 We're leaving behind New York.

111
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,080
 We don't have far to go, though.

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,480
 So we're just going to have Bennett fly around in a holding pattern here.

113
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,320
 Well, I talked to you a little bit about the American egg.

114
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,960
 Did you know that the American egg is the most nutritious food available that comes out of a chicken?

115
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:56,080
 When I want to eat something that's related to a dinosaur that's the descendant of a T-Rex, I eat an egg.

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,720
 Scrambled, baked, baked an egg, scrambled, hard boiled, omelette.

117
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,640
 There's all sorts of different ways to eat eggs. Fried.

118
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,720
 And I think that's it actually, baked. Apparently you can bake an egg now.

119
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,960
 So if you need a little more energy to run away from your worst fear, eat an egg.

120
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,760
 I think your tea will work.

121
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,360
 But as you're falling through Cthulhu level horror is trapped in your own mind, you won't be hungry.

122
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,920
 Bennett, now that that ad is over, we're going to do this.

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,400
 What in the world? What are you doing with this egg council bit?

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,040
 We'll get to it next week. We'll get to it next week.

125
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,120
 Let's just say Daddy Carpenter is about to be Daddy Warbucks.

126
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,160
 Bennett is still looking suspicious at me.

127
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
 He's checking my pockets for eggs.

128
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,720
 He didn't check my back pocket.

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,160
 Helicopter lands were in New Jersey.

130
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,840
 This is a request both from Bennett.

131
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 Bennett sent me a huge list.

132
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,040
 He came out, he was trying to find a pig person in all 50 states.

133
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,520
 He came up with 37 of them.

134
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,120
 So thanks, Bennett. I mean, I'm going to take me a while to pour through it.

135
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,960
 But this is one of them.

136
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,880
 This is actually one of them.

137
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,560
 I got this as a request from both Bennett and Andrew Light, another Patreon supporter.

138
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,640
 So Bennett and Andrew, thank you so much for sending these stories over.

139
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
 We're going back in time.

140
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
 It's September 16th, 1922.

141
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
 So we got on our old timey clothes,

142
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,840
 bowler hats and nice little suits, carrying a dozen eggs.

143
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,600
 Jason, shouldn't you cook those first?

144
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
 Nah, Rocky ate them raw.

145
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,040
 Bennett's like, "Dude, you're not Rocky."

146
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,520
 I'm like, "Not yet. Wait till I eat all dozen of these raw eggs.

147
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,240
 Then we'll see who's Rocky."

148
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,880
 We're in Somerset, New Jersey, it's September 16th, 1922.

149
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,280
 And we see a bunch of cops standing around,

150
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,480
 taking old timey pictures and stuff like that.

151
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,960
 We're like, "Oh, that's interesting.

152
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,400
 Let's walk into the middle of this crime scene.

153
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,600
 Let's interfere with this, what these police officers are doing."

154
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,640
 There's two bodies laying in the field.

155
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,200
 We have Reverend Edward Wheeler Hall, 41 years old, and then Mrs.

156
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,320
 if you're expecting Mrs. Hall, you're wrong,

157
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,600
 Mrs. Eleanor Reinhart Mills, 34 years old.

158
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,400
 They're both laying side by side in the grass, almost spooning.

159
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
 He's laying behind her.

160
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,160
 She's laying in front of him and they're both facing a crab apple tree.

161
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,960
 His hand is placed around her neck, like almost in a carrying gesture.

162
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,000
 It looked peaceful almost, if it wasn't for the multiple bullet wounds in their head.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,360
 He was shot once.

164
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,600
 She had three bullets in her head.

165
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,840
 But that's not where it ended.

166
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,440
 It appears that after she died, her throat was slit and then her tongue was removed.

167
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,760
 Obviously looks like a crime of passion.

168
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,960
 That's normally not something you see in like a robbery or a quote unquote average murder.

169
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,960
 What also made it seem like a crime of passion was there were love letters strewn about their bodies,

170
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,000
 but they were ripped up.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,840
 Someone after murdering these people took the time to rip up these love letters,

172
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,720
 throw them on the ground, slit a throat, pull a tongue out.

173
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,320
 A bunch of people showed up because they just thought this was the bee's knees.

174
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,480
 This was huge news in Somerset, New Jersey.

175
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,200
 Nowadays this would be nothing.

176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,840
 What? Someone got murdered in New Jersey?

177
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,200
 Yeah, I don't know.

178
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,520
 I got other stuff to do.

179
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,240
 But back then it was like, oh my God, two people got murdered.

180
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,720
 This is the crime of the century.

181
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,960
 Actually, this did end up becoming one of the first media circuses.

182
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:38,200
 It wasn't until Charles Lindbergh's baby was kidnapped and murdered that something surpassed this.

183
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,440
 This was a huge media trial.

184
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,360
 But anyways, so the cops are like, this obviously looks like a crime of passion.

185
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,920
 So we can figure it's one of their significant others, maybe.

186
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,880
 Her husband or his wife, they were both married and they were having this affair.

187
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,400
 At this point, a woman emerges from the crowd.

188
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,480
 She's pushing people aside.

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,000
 Hold on.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,720
 She's walking over extra evidence.

191
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 They're like, whoa, whoa.

192
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,760
 Ah, no, I wanted to step on that footprint.

193
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,320
 My name is Jane Gibson.

194
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,400
 Now, people in town knew who she was, but they didn't call her Jane Gibson.

195
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,080
 They called her the Pig Lady, because she was a pig farmer.

196
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,520
 So I mean, she could have been worse.

197
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,640
 She could have been a manure farmer, but she was known as the Pig Lady.

198
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,160
 And she was known for one other thing.

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,320
 And we'll get into that in a second.

200
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,200
 We'll let your imagination run wild.

201
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,880
 You're like, ugh.

202
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,280
 But anyway, she goes, officers, I saw what happened here.

203
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,160
 Step back.

204
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,080
 Everyone step back while I have this flashback.

205
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,120
 It was two nights ago.

206
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,240
 And I was riding Jenny, my mule, through the dark.

207
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,280
 You see, I'd been having trouble with trespassers.

208
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,960
 So I was coming out here to give them a good talking to.

209
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,840
 The officers are like, talking to her?

210
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,000
 Are you going to shoot random people on your property?

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,680
 Yeah, it's the 1920s.

212
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,880
 It doesn't matter what I do.

213
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,600
 I didn't have time to shoot nobody.

214
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,680
 So you see, I was riding Jenny out in the dark looking for trespassers.

215
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,120
 And I see a group of four people standing over that crab apple tree, right?

216
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,640
 There, right?

217
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,000
 There's two people.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
 And then there's another two people.

219
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 You know what four means?

220
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 And I hear them arguing about something.

221
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,120
 And then I hear a pop.

222
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,960
 And down goes one of the silhouettes.

223
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,920
 As God is my witness.

224
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,280
 Now there was only three people standing there.

225
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,640
 Cops are like, we know how math works.

226
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,560
 Okay, just making sure.

227
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,200
 Just making sure.

228
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,520
 And then I see another silhouette standing there.

229
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,960
 And she begins to say, it was a woman, by the way.

230
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,040
 She had a very curvy, curvy silhouette.

231
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,120
 She began to say, no, no, no.

232
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,200
 And then said, Henry.

233
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
 And then I heard three gunshots.

234
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,520
 And now there's only two people standing there.

235
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,120
 And I got scared.

236
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,920
 So after watching, it wasn't the first murder scared me, but that second murder.

237
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,000
 Uh, uh, uh, I ride Jenny back home.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,320
 And here I am talking to you.

239
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 So flashback ends.

240
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,400
 So she tells the story.

241
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,840
 Now the cops go, that is good enough for us.

242
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,880
 We still have more investigating to do, but that actually gives us a good lead.

243
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,560
 Because the minister's wife was Francis Noel Stevens Hall.

244
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,000
 Very well connected woman in town.

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,400
 She was connected to the Stevens family.

246
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,240
 She was a member of that.

247
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,000
 She was also connected to a family known as the Carpenters, but they spelled it with a D.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,960
 So that's weird.

249
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,920
 The Carpendeers.

250
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,520
 Anyways, the Carpenters, but they spelled it with a D.

251
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,080
 I have to keep emphasizing that because we were not involved in this crime.

252
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,600
 People also connected her to the Johnson family, who you may know as Johnson's and

253
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,400
 Johnson's.

254
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,840
 So she actually was pretty high up in the community.

255
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,480
 The police are suspecting her for two reasons.

256
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,240
 One, her husband was killed having an affair.

257
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,000
 The violence done upon the woman's body, as opposed to the man's body, makes them think

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,320
 that whoever killed them had more animus towards the woman.

259
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,200
 And there's two different men named Henry that are connected to Francis.

260
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,520
 The minister's wife.

261
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,360
 So they think it's her and she got some people to do it.

262
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,520
 So they round them up.

263
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,840
 They round up Francis.

264
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,280
 They round up one of the Henry's.

265
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,760
 The other one had a pretty good alibi.

266
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,640
 They round up four people in total who are part of this conspiracy.

267
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
 They hold trial.

268
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,800
 And you got the pig lady.

269
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,240
 As the main witness, she was there at the scene.

270
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,960
 She can say the woman called out Henry.

271
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,360
 She must have known Henry.

272
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,880
 Francis has a relative named Henry.

273
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,920
 So I'm done.

274
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,600
 Pig lady comes down with cancer, really bad case of cancer, as opposed to those

275
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
 normally good cases of cancer.

276
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,200
 Right.

277
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,480
 But it's pretty fast acting.

278
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,920
 It gets to the point that during the trial, she has to be brought in via ambulance

279
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,600
 and has to be in a hospital bed in the trial.

280
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,400
 As she's testifying against this family, she's a, I saw the stand in there.

281
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,560
 I saw these shadows, right?

282
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,440
 Saw these shadows stand in there.

283
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
 And one of them goes, my name's Francis.

284
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,680
 And you've been having an affair with my husband.

285
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,800
 And one of the courthouses is like, what?

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 She's like, and then I heard a voice go, no, Francis, wife of my lover.

287
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,280
 You are truly the one who was about to murder me.

288
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,680
 She's like, what?

289
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,160
 The police are like, wait, that's what's going on.

290
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,680
 She lied all the time.

291
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,000
 She was known for two things, raising pigs and being a liar.

292
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,640
 And her story changed so much from her first interview with the police to during the trial.

293
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
 She was changing her story.

294
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,280
 They said she had more details during the trial than she had during her first interview.

295
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
 Normally people forget stuff.

296
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,000
 You don't go, oh, by the way, she left me this driver's license.

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,840
 And it's like a hand drawn card.

298
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,160
 The defense attorney actually was bringing up the pig ladies neighbors and the neighbors

299
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,080
 would go on the stand.

300
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,280
 Defense lawyer goes, what do you think of a pig lady?

301
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,800
 And the neighbors would go, she's the biggest liar in the world.

302
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,280
 You can't trust anything she says.

303
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
 She's such a huge liar.

304
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,160
 Next neighbor would come up.

305
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,800
 Do you have anything to say about the pig lady?

306
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,920
 Oh, yeah, she lies all the time.

307
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,600
 You can't trust anything about her.

308
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:02,640
 During the trial, as the pig lady was delivering testimony from her deathbed, the pig lady's

309
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,440
 mom, the 72 year old elderly woman was sitting in the audience.

310
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,240
 And as her daughter was giving her testimony, her mother was going, she's alive.

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,840
 She lies.

312
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
 She lies all the time.

313
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,760
 She's totally not telling the truth.

314
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,840
 Like when your own mom is yelling at you while you're dying, telling you what a liar you

315
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,960
 are, the jury is looking at all this stuff and they basically go.

316
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,920
 Not guilty.

317
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,520
 A 100% not guilty.

318
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,840
 Now the prosecution, they were like, we know that these guys did it.

319
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,240
 Nobody else had a motive for this.

320
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,320
 Nobody else would take the time to remove the tongue.

321
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,880
 It was funny, it's not funny, but the tongue removal, they didn't even realize that until

322
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
 like four years later.

323
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,600
 The damage to the body must have been pretty intense.

324
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,720
 And that's the thing like you can tell when someone's been stabbed once or twice versus

325
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,960
 80 times, it usually means the difference between a fast acting crime as opposed to a

326
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,920
 crime of passion where you're really taking time to chop somebody up.

327
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,480
 It took time to mutilate this woman's body and not the man's body, which made them think

328
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
 it was not her husband, but his wife.

329
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,560
 But anyways, she was such a liar that even on her deathbed, her own mother was saying,

330
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,480
 don't trust the word she's saying.

331
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,400
 If she's saying they did it, they didn't do it.

332
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,000
 Everyone was found not guilty and the prosecution never, this is an unsolved crime.

333
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,160
 The prosecution never brought charges against anyone else.

334
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,480
 Cops continue to investigate it for a bit, but they're like, dude, it was them.

335
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,120
 We just got the worst witness possible.

336
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,400
 The one witness that people, the one person in the world that's such a liar, people

337
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,960
 were yelling she was a liar as she was dying.

338
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,000
 And she did eventually die, which is awful.

339
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,840
 But then the story takes a truly creepy turn as opposed to the two people being

340
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,520
 murdered in one horribly mutilated.

341
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,960
 Because to this day, a few miles away, we have Royce Field Road.

342
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,080
 So, minute, let's hop back into Jason, July, we're going to drive down this road late at

343
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,480
 night.

344
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,360
 I'm down to three eggs.

345
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,680
 We might have to stop and buy more American eggs.

346
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,920
 See, I'm not feeling sick yet.

347
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,200
 Dude, I'm feeling totally fine.

348
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,560
 I'm lying.

349
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,520
 I'm all, I mean, American eggs are delicious.

350
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,600
 We're driving our car through Pig Lady Road.

351
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,920
 Pig Lady Road is a couple miles away from where the murders actually took place.

352
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,160
 And this is a ghost phantom, a creature, a cryptid.

353
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,000
 It's kind of hard to classify the Char Man or Bandage Man.

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,480
 Char Man's in California, Bandage Man is in Oregon.

355
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
 Those are more of road phantoms.

356
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
 They jump in your car, they harass you, they beat you up.

357
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
 We've covered both of those.

358
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,040
 I love those stories.

359
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,120
 This one kind of falls in line with that, but it's a little more of a cryptid thing.

360
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
 Pig Lady Road, if you drive down Pig Lady Road, there's a couple different ways to summon

361
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,080
 this creature, but you drive down Pig Lady Road and you see a red tree.

362
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,040
 And you yell Pig Lady, Pig Lady, Pig Lady, and then a woman appears from behind the tree.

363
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:10,160
 Pig Head, holding a bloodstained axe and she comes running at your car and you gotta speed away,

364
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,000
 otherwise she's gonna chop your car up.

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
 Your insurance does not cover harassing Pig Ladies.

366
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
 Now that's an easy thing to disprove, obviously, right?

367
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,920
 You just drive up, we'll do it.

368
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,480
 Pig Lady, Pig Lady, Pig Lady, nothing.

369
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,320
 Hopefully you're not listening to this podcast as you're driving down Roy's Field Road.

370
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
 That's a very easy myth to disprove, because you just do it.

371
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
 The myth has been modified a bit.

372
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,240
 Some people say you have to drive down the road to where this red tree's at.

373
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,640
 One person has to get out of the car and then you continue to drive until you can't see them

374
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,160
 anymore and then you turn around and then the person outside the car has to yell Pig Lady three

375
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,920
 times and then you turn back around and the person's totally traumatized.

376
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,400
 That's super easy to fake, obviously, but it's a lot harder to disprove,

377
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,080
 because the one person who's staying out on the road could tell you whatever story they want.

378
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
 And if you're gollible, you'll be like, "Gulp! I'm not gonna do that again!"

379
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
 And the other person in the back says, "Hehehe."

380
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,400
 These are classic American myths, right?

381
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,720
 You go down this road and you stop and then little kids push your car,

382
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,160
 assuming you're not actually broke down outside of an elementary school,

383
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,280
 because they might actually help you.

384
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,440
 But you know those old stories, you drive down the road and you'll be on a hill,

385
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,160
 like an incline hill, and your car will go up and you'll see little handprints.

386
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,040
 Those type of myths and legends are all over America.

387
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,080
 And I really argue all over the world there's different versions of that.

388
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,920
 There's two versions of the Origin of the Pig Lady.

389
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,960
 I'm gonna pause at a third one, but one of the origins is quite lame.

390
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,360
 This young baby, this supposed to be an old baby, this baby's born...

391
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,560
 The baby's born with the head of a pig.

392
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,720
 And then it grew up to a woman with the head of a pig and actually walks around with an axe.

393
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,520
 Eh, it's super not exciting.

394
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,720
 One of the versions too is just a floating pig head floating down the road.

395
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
 That's not, that's not, that wasn't even worth me mentioning.

396
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,680
 That's so dumb, I didn't even include it in the, yeah, whatever.

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,400
 Anyways, do you have this woman who's born with the head of a pig and then she just grows up

398
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
 to be a pig lady?

399
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,240
 That's not very imaginative.

400
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,520
 There's another story who go back in time, there's this little girl who's super ugly.

401
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,080
 I mean uglier than being born with a pig head, right?

402
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
 And her father is so disgusted he can't even look at her.

403
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,520
 So he goes, "Ah, there's, you know what, being an improvement over your disgusting old mug."

404
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,720
 He's a pig head.

405
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
 So he goes out and he chops the head off a pig.

406
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,200
 Or maybe he just had the pig head already laying around.

407
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,640
 He's like, "Hmm, I could wear this for Halloween or I could torment my daughter."

408
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,520
 Hmm.

409
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,680
 He takes the pig head and puts it on his daughter and goes, "There, now you're better looking."

410
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,480
 And she grows up with this pig head on and she's just like, "Oh, I must be totally hideous

411
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,840
 if I have to wear this stinky head."

412
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,280
 I wonder if he kept cutting off pig heads because eventually it's gonna rot, right?

413
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,240
 Eventually he's gonna be like, "Pew, wait, time to kill you another pig.

414
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
 Get you a new mask.

415
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
 Look at you, you're growing."

416
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,160
 They're like marking, putting marks on the wall as she's getting taller,

417
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,160
 but they're marking it to the pig's ears.

418
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,680
 "Daughter, you're becoming a woman.

419
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,880
 Someday you're gonna kill your own pig and put the head on yourself."

420
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
 She's like, "Oh, the little pig head is blushing."

421
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,800
 Anyways, her mom eventually dies of some unknown illness.

422
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,840
 And the girl has it, she's like a teenager at this point.

423
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,800
 She's had enough of it.

424
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,760
 Her mom's dead.

425
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,160
 She takes an axe, kills her dad.

426
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,160
 And then she's just walking around with the pig head for a while still for whatever reason.

427
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,000
 She's like, "Ah, you know, I'm used to it."

428
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,520
 And then some kids are teasing her in town and they put a pig head on her porch.

429
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
 So she murders these two kids.

430
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,960
 And then eventually she just kind of like dissolves, dies of swine flu.

431
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
 She dies somehow.

432
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,920
 And when the police search her property,

433
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,480
 they find her mom who had died of natural causes.

434
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,680
 And then the butchered remains of her father and the two boys.

435
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,400
 That's enough.

436
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 I did forget there's one other origin story,

437
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
 which might actually be the funniest,

438
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,520
 is Pig Lady is actually a maid, was a local maid for a rich family.

439
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
 And there was a fire in their mansion.

440
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,440
 And she's like, "Oh no, how do I get out?

441
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,080
 How do I get out?"

442
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,520
 And everyone runs out and they left her on the second floor of this house.

443
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
 And she's like, "Oh no, and the flames are getting higher."

444
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
 So she goes, "Well, she jumps out the window."

445
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,000
 She jumps.

446
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,680
 Think about the two stories we just had.

447
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,320
 A woman who was so hideous that a pig head looked better than her normal face.

448
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,400
 Or someone who was just born with a pig head.

449
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
 At least those are slightly fantastical.

450
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
 This one's just, I don't know if it's bizarre and cruel,

451
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,680
 or both.

452
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,360
 This woman's like, "Oh no, I'm gonna burn."

453
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
 She jumps out of the building.

454
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,240
 It's a two-story house.

455
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,560
 She falls, she falls right on her face.

456
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,600
 Like, she doesn't brace, what was she doing with her hands?

457
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,080
 Sewing?

458
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,800
 Like, she doesn't brace herself at all.

459
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
 She doesn't land on her shoulders.

460
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,040
 She doesn't land on her back.

461
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,000
 She doesn't break her ankles.

462
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,360
 She doesn't even put her hands out.

463
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,800
 She falls two stories right onto her face.

464
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,880
 And she hits the ground and it instantly mangles her face.

465
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
 After falling 20 feet straight onto her face,

466
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,360
 she jumps up and runs into the wood, forever being known as Pig Lady.

467
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,960
 Why does she have a pig head?

468
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,600
 I don't know.

469
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,960
 She's just horribly disfigured.

470
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,760
 Even if your nose got bent up and you had like a chief wig on pig nose,

471
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,200
 you can still get a job.

472
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,600
 So that one's, I guess at some point in the wood,

473
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
 she just finds a dead pig and she's like, "An important storm!"

474
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,680
 Puts it on.

475
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,480
 I don't think if you, if you feel 20 feet on your face,

476
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
 first off, I don't think you're jumping up and running away.

477
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,280
 I don't, Ness, one, I don't think you're thinking at all

478
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,560
 your thought process would be, your brains are scrambled, but two,

479
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,360
 I don't think you're going to hop up and go, "Oh no, my face!"

480
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,760
 As your ears are bleeding and your eyes have burst open.

481
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,280
 Anyway, so that's another legend.

482
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,360
 Here's my theory and we're going to close it out like this.

483
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
 Here's my story.

484
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,120
 Lying is one of the oldest sins.

485
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
 It's the thing that holds humanity together,

486
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,040
 societies together.

487
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,080
 If everybody lied, we could do nothing.

488
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,200
 You couldn't have a contract.

489
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,040
 You couldn't even have a conversation.

490
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,200
 Now people do lie.

491
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
 People do lie.

492
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,440
 But it's one of those things that you can get a bad rep for really,

493
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,160
 really quickly.

494
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:09,280
 The lying is the one sin, the one wrong that everyone does the most.

495
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,040
 Most of us aren't habitual liars,

496
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,200
 but think about how many times you've lied versus how many times you've stolen something.

497
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,640
 How many times you've lied versus how many times you've broken a law.

498
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,400
 Lying is something that we do.

499
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,480
 It's super innate in children.

500
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,160
 It's really the original sin.

501
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,320
 I mean, of needing the apple and causing the world to crumble.

502
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,360
 But you know what I mean?

503
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,040
 Lying is the first thing that humans do that is wrong and hurtful.

504
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,440
 And here you have a woman who was such a habitual liar

505
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,000
 that murderers got away.

506
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
 She had spent her whole life fantasizing.

507
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,920
 She spent her whole life weaving tales.

508
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,760
 She spent her whole life deceiving everybody to the point where her mother,

509
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,280
 I have to nail this point home,

510
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,680
 as she was dying, her mother denounced her as a liar.

511
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,400
 Because of her lies, murderers got away.

512
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,000
 Because of her lies,

513
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,920
 two people who were shot down in cold blood did not find justice.

514
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,840
 She was known as the pig lady while she was alive.

515
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,000
 What if she's known as the pig lady after death?

516
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,400
 Her sin was so great she wasn't allowed to ascend to the next level.

517
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,720
 What's so ironic about this is that a woman who lied all of her life is now sentenced to damnation

518
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,600
 as a physical manifestation of a cruel nickname.

519
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,240
 You can summon her forth.

520
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
 She appears full of rage, full of vengeance.

521
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
 But she can't get either of those things.

522
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:49,040
 Because she's in that role, she's tormented in that body, between life and death, in these woods.

523
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,560
 She can't get vengeance, she put herself there.

524
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,000
 And the most ironic thing about this whole story is that someone could summon her

525
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
 and she's pulled into our world,

526
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,760
 snarling and in pain, and they drive off and she slowly fades from view.

527
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,240
 And when the people in that car go back to school the next day

528
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,320
 and tell all their classmates that they did it, they summoned the pig lady, they saw her.

529
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,280
 What is everyone gonna say?

530
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,720
 You're lying.

531
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:33,360
