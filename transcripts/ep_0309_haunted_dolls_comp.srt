00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
 Dolls. A multi-billion dollar industry that's been going on since the beginning of time.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:17,340
 Every civilization has had their own form of dolls. Whether they are the fertility statues

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:25,260
 they made out of clay a long time ago, or today's pussycat dolls, they've existed since the

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,760
 beginning of humanity. But for some people simply saying the word dolls feels them with

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,260
 fear. There are some people who listen to this show who won't even click on this episode

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,120
 because it is called Haunted Dolls. What is it about dolls that people find so terrifying?

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,960
 Can dolls actually be haunted? And I just ordered a haunted doll off of eBay today on

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:04,820
 Dead Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,960
 your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,500
 too. First off I want to say thank you so much to everyone who sent me birthday wishes.

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,700
 All day long I was getting them via email, YouTube comments, Twitter. It was awesome.

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,700
 It was really really cool to just be walking around my phone like do do do and it would

13
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,360
 be like happy birthday Jason. It's a really really cool feeling so thank you everyone

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,760
 for making me feel loved. That was just awesome. Totally awesome. I really appreciate that.

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,720
 If you'll see my cover art for today's episode it was a birthday card that Veronica's son

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
 made for me. Little Finn. I don't think he probably wants to be called Little. But he

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,840
 drew me this. It's a Halloween/Birthday card. It does say him 45 on there and Veronica thought

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,540
 that was funny. But all she did was guarantee me. Guarantee me three extra years of life.

19
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,400
 No jokes on you. And then very briefly non-spoiler Joker review. It's alright. It's alright.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,440
 It was good. It wasn't great. But I enjoyed it. It was really entertained. It flew by.

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,800
 It seemed like it was only like an hour long. Didn't have a lot of fat to it. It was really

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,000
 good but it's not one of those movies that you oh no no I know you don't like comic book

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,200
 movies. You gotta see this one. It wasn't like that. If you want to see it go see it pretty

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,520
 quickly because otherwise stuff's going to get spoiled for you and there's some weird

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,100
 twists and turns. And if you don't want to see it I don't really think you're missing

26
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,180
 much by not seeing it. That's my review. So I enjoyed it though. I really really enjoyed

27
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:37,060
 it. But let's go ahead and start our descent into the madness of dolls. Little doll people.

28
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:43,780
 It's funny because there is so much to cover in this episode and it's frankly stupid. Not

29
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,940
 the idea of haunted dolls. That's idiotic. But the idea that there's so much stuff written

30
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,440
 about these dudes. It's really really bizarre. And I have some interesting thoughts and conspiracies

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,860
 regarding that but let's go ahead and get started with really what started this whole

32
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,440
 thing last night on online. I'm like oh my god I got an episode tomorrow. Just typing

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,860
 random words hoping something spooky shows up. No I'm going through and I go I've never

34
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,640
 covered haunted dolls before. I think I've talked about them here and there. But I've

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
 never actually like done an episode on them. Which is weird because they're kind of like

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,460
 a horror mainstay. Let me tell you a personal story. So when I was probably like 20 something

37
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:28,780
 23 maybe. Living with my grandma. Chilling with my grandma. I come home from work one

38
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,780
 day or I was probably just out messing around with my friends but I came home to my grandma's

39
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:41,420
 house and there was this dirty busted up doll sitting in one of the chairs. And my grandma

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,120
 was in the other chair watching the Drew Carey show or whatever. And I walk in I'm like

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,800
 hey guys what's up. Hey grandma. And then I look and I'm like what's that doll doing

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,360
 there. My grandma looks over at this house was the one where all the shadow people were

43
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,440
 chilling and all the creepy stuff was happening. My grandma was watching Drew Carey show. She

44
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,600
 turns over she looks at the doll she goes oh the dog brought it in. And I go did the

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,060
 dog put it in the chair. And she doesn't respond. Now you could say oh she's possessed by the

46
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,140
 spirit of the doll. Let us come. Now she probably just is too busy watching the Drew Carey show.

47
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,020
 She knew I believed in all sorts of creepy nonsense. She probably didn't want to entertain

48
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,260
 the thought. Because obviously I was saying did the doll walk in here. So I went out and

49
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,500
 I talked to the dog. So it was weird because I thought the dog never brings first off my

50
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,600
 grandma never let the dog inside the house unless it was like a rainstorm too. He never

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,720
 brought in stuff in three. You're telling me that doll was sitting in the backyard this

52
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,920
 whole time. The dog's like ten years old at this point. But anyways so the doll was super

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,080
 spooky and covered in mud and had like an old fashioned dress on it and its hair was

54
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,720
 all matted. Basically looked like a girl had picked up from a bar except more age appropriate.

55
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,440
 They are usually quite filthy. I think they just come home with me so they can use my

56
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,180
 shower. But I take the doll and I go to I don't think I did it immediately that night. I think

57
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,100
 I just kind of like kept an eye on the doll. I was like I'm keeping an eye on you and the

58
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,060
 doll just sitting there. The doll won that staring contest but later like the next day

59
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,860
 I believe I took the doll over to my friend Josh's house. So you got Josh and Jackie and

60
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,700
 Joanne and they've all shown up in other ghost stories that I've told. Personal ghost stories

61
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,320
 I've told. I was like hey guys look I got this haunted doll. Now Joanne wanted nothing

62
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,540
 to do with it at all. Josh was playing in PlayStation 2 but Jackie was like haunted

63
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,280
 doll haunted doll. And so we gave it a bath and we took it into the bathroom and we started

64
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,100
 like cleaning it off and like washing off the dirt. And then we're like she, Jackie

65
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,840
 was I think like 13 or 14 so she had dolls of her own. So she goes and she gets little

66
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,360
 doll hairbrushes and she's like here you go she gives me it's a piece of pink plastic

67
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,580
 with little prongs on it. It wasn't like from the doll set soon but anyways we both have

68
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,540
 these doll brushes right? And we're running the doll under the water and we're like brushing

69
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,100
 the doll's hair. We're just brushing it. And we're doing it and a good amount of time

70
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,700
 is passing. We hear Josh in the other room beating up the undertaker on the PS2. The

71
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,500
 undertaker hadn't actually shown up. Give me my doll kicking down the door. We hear

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,680
 him he's doing his PS2 thing. Joanne's doing whatever. And me and Jackie are just in here

73
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,880
 washing this doll off. And at a certain point Jackie turns to me and she goes I can't stop.

74
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,880
 I need to get this doll clean. And it was weird because maybe it's just her saying it like

75
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,920
 put it in my head and I hadn't thought of it before. But I was feeling the same thing.

76
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,680
 Now sometimes that happens. I can walk in a room and it feels fine and then someone goes

77
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,020
 this room's kind of creepy isn't it? And then I will retroactively believe that it was creepy.

78
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,500
 Human mind is very easy to mess around with. But she goes I can't stop doing this. I need

79
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,900
 to clean it off and I turn to her and I agreed. It was really weird. So either she put that

80
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,300
 thought into my head and I hadn't thought about it or in the moment I felt like I was

81
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,980
 also having a hard time stopping. Like we had to get this doll clean. And eventually

82
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,780
 we did. And then I thought it was hilarious because I would put the doll in the passenger

83
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,120
 seat in my car. I took it everywhere with me. I thought it was so funny because people

84
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,400
 knew that that doll was super creepy. They knew it's Providence. So they knew like it

85
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,120
 had appeared in my grandma's house. And me and Jackie couldn't stop cleaning it. And

86
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,680
 so on and so forth. And then the doll I remember one morning I woke up and I was like time

87
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,320
 to go to work. I'm putting a little uniform. I'm putting a little Godfather's Pizza uniform

88
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,880
 on the doll. I'm like oh you look so precious. Carrying it everywhere. People's pizzas

89
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,420
 are covered in muddy footprints. I remember one day I woke up and doll was gone. And I

90
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,220
 wasn't like oh the doll must have walked away. I thought oh I must have put it somewhere.

91
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,300
 I looked all over for that doll. Couldn't find it at my place. Looked in my car. Couldn't

92
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,380
 find it. I ended up going to Jackie's house and I go hey Jackie where's the doll at? And

93
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,700
 she's like what? I go where's... I wonder if we ever named it now that I think about

94
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,540
 it. I go where's the doll at? Where's the doll? And she's like I don't know. Your doll you

95
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,500
 should have been the one who had it. And we looked all over her house. Never saw that

96
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,840
 doll again. It hung out with us for about six months right? This doll was on these adventures

97
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,520
 with me. Now do I think the doll was haunted? It was creepy and it magically appeared and

98
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,920
 disappeared. Not magically. I was pushing it a little too much. The doll was creepy. It

99
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,600
 appeared one day and disappeared a couple months later. Never to be seen again. Does that mean

100
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,440
 it's haunted? No. Does that mean it's magical? No. Does that mean that I never cleaned up

101
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,980
 after myself and it's very possible that the doll, if it did become animated, fall into

102
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,340
 a pile of dirty clothes, got thrown into the washing machine and just dissolve? Possible.

103
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,300
 More likely. I guess except for the walking part. But that's really been my only interaction

104
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,820
 with a quote unquote haunted doll. A creepy doll would be a better term for it and possibly

105
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,180
 possessed us so we would brush its hair and clean it up. And then it went on its own way.

106
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,820
 The doll could have been wanting to possess us and take over our bodies until it realized

107
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,040
 all we did was play PS2 and eat Pop John's. The dolls like this will not end well for

108
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,720
 any of these people involved. I'm researching last night and I go, "Yeah, I want to do a

109
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
 story about haunted dolls." So I started looking up like the most haunted dolls or the most

110
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,200
 dangerous haunted dolls and there's not a lot of them. I honestly thought there would

111
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,580
 be, there's basically two levels of haunted doll stories. There's the ones that people

112
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,900
 know and then there's the ones that happen to your aunt when she's six. And you go, "Jason,

113
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,700
 that's the same thing with haunted houses. You have the Amityville Horror and then you

114
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,140
 have the haunted house in your neighborhood." But generally the difference is that haunted

115
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:58,580
 houses, abandoned asylums, creepy roads, they're shared experiences. The haunted house is there

116
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,680
 and it lasts through generations. Your grandfather was scared of the house, your father was scared

117
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,520
 of the house, you're scared of the house. It's generally a generational thing. You know

118
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,320
 the house at the end of the lane that the old lady like chopped up a bunch of trick-or-treaters

119
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,920
 and then handed out their body parts to other trick-or-treaters. The story gets passed on,

120
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,280
 mutated and things like that. But haunted dolls are a family story and it's quite an interesting

121
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,500
 phenomenon. Let's look at some of the famous ones. Now Annabelle and Robert the Doll are

122
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,620
 the two most famous ones. Annabelle, briefly, because I think that I, let me go ahead and

123
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,940
 say all the stories I'm about to tell you are completely ridiculous and stupid. Annabelle

124
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,940
 involves the Warns, which I've talked about them before. You have the psychic woman who

125
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,340
 believes she can talk to ghosts and Bigfoot and then her husband who probably didn't believe

126
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:55,680
 in any of it but just liked being in a rich chick who made money scamming people allegedly.

127
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,440
 And then so Annabelle was a doll that some girl, a raggedy end doll that some sorority

128
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,000
 girl bought. And then at the same time the house was haunted and they was of a little

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,960
 girl and the sorority girls go, in my version they're sorority girls, I think they were

130
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,160
 just in college but I want to make it a little sexier. They said, "Hey, you can jump into

131
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,200
 the body of this doll." And then the doll started moving around. It wasn't like doing

132
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,780
 the robot or like, you know, doing the chicken dance or nothing. It was just like you'd

133
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,180
 come in one day and the doll would be in a different room. Which when it's you and two

134
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,060
 roommates, everything moves all of the time. Oh no, where did I put this last slice of

135
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,460
 pizza? I don't know, it's a girl with the pizza-stained face and you're like, "Ugh,

136
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,780
 it's a ghost." So stuff will move when there's three people, three college-aged girls living

137
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,620
 in an apartment. Things are gonna move around. That's just, oh and the doll's so evil that

138
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,360
 now it's in some laboratory, not laboratory, it's in some museum or something like that.

139
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,200
 But hey, here's a question. If Ed and Lorraine Warren were really good at this ghost stuff,

140
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,440
 how come their ghosts haven't shown up yet? Because they're dead. They've been dead for

141
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,440
 a couple months now. Where are their ghosts? Like shouldn't they be on talk shows and stuff

142
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,960
 like that? Shouldn't they be inhabiting dolls? Anyways, so that was kind of rude. They've

143
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,100
 lost their lives and I don't like it when people die, but if you were a parapsychologist,

144
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,780
 you'd think they'd be making the rounds right now. Zach Baggins should be walking around

145
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,540
 with the EVP reader talking to these dudes. So Robert the Doll is a doll. He's just some

146
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,740
 creepy looking doll who was that the guy, Robert the Doll, if I remember correctly, was the

147
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,460
 dude in the Rocky chair that his face changes or like they actually have video footage of

148
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,600
 his head moving. So you know, there's that. I mean you're like Jason, that's kind of

149
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,520
 a big detail to gloss over. Here's the thing. If there is actual video footage of an inanimate

150
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:54,080
 object moving its head, and it was 100% legit, it would be studied in every single science

151
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,840
 laboratory, biologists would be getting rid of their equipment to say how is it possible

152
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:07,940
 that this inanimate object moves. So it either has, and it is the biggest discovery in human

153
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,660
 history that an object that was crafted by humans that was made to not move moves on

154
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:20,260
 its own, proving either life after death or that inanimate objects can come to life.

155
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,700
 That would be the biggest news ever. It would revolutionize the rocking chair industry.

156
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,840
 It would revolutionize every single ping pong table out there because you would have to

157
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:38,120
 wonder, am I picking up a sentient object and hitting it against another sentient object?

158
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,280
 We would be paralyzed as a nation. Now I know that's a stupid analogy, but could you put

159
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,720
 your shoes on if you knew your shoes were alive? So there's that, there's that part of

160
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,440
 it, or if it was actually proof that there is life after death, which is what everyone

161
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,580
 wonders. Some people believe they have the answer, but I think everyone is a little

162
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,940
 doubtful in those dark moments. Like is this right? If there was video evidence that this

163
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,460
 doll moved on its own, it would be the biggest news story in human history. This is what

164
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,620
 Robert the doll does. He has a bunch of different origin stories, either he was some voodoo

165
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,780
 stuff or some girl went into the body of the doll or whatever, but this is what this doll

166
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:27,320
 is supposedly capable of doing. Car accidents, broken bones, job loss, divorce, and a cornucopia

167
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,280
 of other misfortunes. That's from Wikipedia. I normally don't use the word cornucopia

168
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,720
 in what I'm talking. And then museum visitors, because he's chilling at a museum now, have

169
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,160
 post-visit misfortunes for failing to respect Robert. So considering I've been talking trash

170
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,000
 about this dumb doll for the past 10 minutes, who knows what's going to happen to me, but

171
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,860
 the doll doesn't cause car accidents. And then this is where I'm going with this. We

172
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,780
 have these like super dolls, these dolls that have all these magical powers that are able

173
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,380
 to do stuff. Because here's the truth. Would you go to a museum to see a doll? Because

174
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,260
 these dolls you have to pay to go see Robert the doll. Would you pay to go see a doll that

175
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,500
 if you walk by to make cut the brake lines to your car or it makes your wife leave you

176
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,000
 because she's finally realized that for your vacation you wanted to go look at a 100 year

177
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,960
 old doll or just walk into your sister's bedroom and there's like a creepy doll. Like most stories

178
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:34,160
 of dolls, of haunted dolls are super mundane. Super mundane. And then you have these mega

179
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,920
 ones. You have, here's some of the ones that are less known. I found some other ones here

180
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,240
 that are less known. Let's look at these guys real quick here, these haunted dolls. We have

181
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,620
 Peggy. These are supposedly famous. Peggy, it's a little girl doll, a little cute girl

182
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:55,500
 with blonde curly hair. She's known to cause nausea, dizziness and heart attacks. So it's

183
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,420
 Taco Bell in the form of a doll. It can also is known to drive you mad. Now you go, how

184
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:08,780
 can a doll give you a heart attack? Ah, non-believer. If you just look at a photo of Peggy, you can

185
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,320
 have a heart attack. When you, there's a YouTube video that starts off with a warning saying

186
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
 you've been warned by, look, watching this video you may have a heart attack. We're about

187
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,520
 to show you a picture of Peggy the doll. People take this stuff quite seriously. This doll,

188
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,020
 apparently, according to scam artists, say that this doll is possessed by the ghost of

189
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:36,920
 someone who died during the Holocaust, which is bizarre. This story was eventually retconned

190
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,620
 because that's just good. Listen, man, you can make your scam artist, right? That's how

191
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,120
 you make your money is telling people that their pipes are haunted and stuff like that.

192
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,460
 There's certain things that you don't say ghosts come from. You don't want to say the

193
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:57,180
 Holocaust for one. Here is a haunted box. Ooh, if you open it up, bad things may happen.

194
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,060
 Ooh, the person who had that died during a horrible, horrible, worldwide genocide. I

195
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,520
 don't want that. Don't include genocides in your fake ghost origin stories. I would

196
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,040
 say that is a bad one. Come on, do you want... Here's a pair of haunted shoes. Fine. I found

197
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,680
 them in the rubble of World Trade Center. Like, there's certain things that you're making

198
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:25,000
 it up, so make up something less horrifying. Chew it up by an escalator. Okay, I'll buy

199
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,440
 those. That's terrible, but they're haunted. Shoes, right? You're gonna have somebody die.

200
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,980
 You're gonna have a Holocaust? Seriously, bro? So, this one died on the Holocaust, apparently.

201
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,660
 And the psychic who was taking notes on trying to figure out what it was, what was in Peggy.

202
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:47,460
 Peggy the doll stole the notepad. So then the psychic was like, "I don't remember what

203
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,900
 other stuff I made up. I mean discovered during our saiyans." You give me some time to think

204
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,540
 about it, and she's like pulling out her book, a fiction writer's workshop book. I'll

205
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,000
 remember it, sure enough, and it's like Chapter 4. But anyway, so that's why we don't have

206
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,520
 much information on Peggy, other than the fact that she can give you a heart attack

207
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,480
 if you just look at her. We have Harold. He's a scuffed up baby doll. He's like a little

208
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,680
 baby doll. His head's all jacked up. But, so it's funny that his head's all scuffed up,

209
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,600
 because this doll... I think it's funny, because it's not funny. It's actually quite tragic,

210
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 but this doll, his head's all scuffed up, right? And he was passed from haunted doll collector

211
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,700
 to haunted doll collector. So anyways, I mean that's a whole other thing we'll get into,

212
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,660
 but this dude buys it, buys this stupid plastic doll that's supposedly haunted, and then he

213
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,400
 invites his buddy over to see the doll, and his buddy comes over and then shortly afterwards

214
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,620
 is diagnosed with a brain tumor. Therefore, the doll gave him the brain tumor. But here's

215
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,200
 the question. What about the dude who actually bought the doll? Where's his brain tumor?

216
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:06,320
 Like I come in contact with a haunted object, right? And I have 30 friends. One of those

217
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,120
 friends gets in a car accident. Is the doll cursed? Now, I would leave out, if I wanted

218
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,360
 to say that, I would leave out the other 29 people who visited me and saw the doll and

219
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,940
 focus on the guy who got in the car accident. So this is total cherry pick and stuff. Yes,

220
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,900
 when you have 30 friends, one of them is going to have a health problem or a broken bone or

221
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,420
 a heart attack or something like that. We live in a mortal universe where things unfortunately

222
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,060
 break down. Also with Harold, we did have an owner have some unfortunate luck. One of

223
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:47,460
 the original owners of Harold got it, and his cat died, and his girlfriend left him for,

224
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:54,520
 according to this article, his girlfriend left him for the pool man. What's a pool man?

225
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,280
 I understand the word pool boy, but if we become that sensitive in society that pool

226
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,160
 boy is, is there actually a like an age range? Like let's say you're 18 to 25, you're a pool

227
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,480
 boy. But after that, uh-uh-uh, pool man. I've never heard that term before. Pool man. Anyways.

228
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,460
 Okay, that was a weird rant. Last one we're going to talk about here is Letta. These are

229
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,780
 the famous ones, Letta. It's an old marionette doll, some dude, some bloke in Australia, found

230
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,660
 it under the floorboards. Don't believe that story at all. Totally made up. It's convenient

231
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,700
 because he doesn't have to really show any origin story for it. Apparently it's 200

232
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,580
 years old. Don't believe it. It has real human hair possibly. I, I, I, that is a more believable

233
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,400
 detail than a 200 year old piece of wood underneath an abandoned house in Australia. And he throws

234
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,840
 it in his car and he's driving away. Why he was in this house in the first place, he was

235
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,120
 just like a scavenger. So basically he's a war pup. He just escaped Mad Max's assault

236
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,400
 on his fortress. He's digging through a house and finds a doll. He's a scavenger again. He's

237
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,320
 not like some meth head breaking off copper pipes to recycle them. He just breaks in houses

238
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,380
 and looks for garbage under the floorboards, totally made up. He gets the doll out of there,

239
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,500
 throws it in the trunk of the car and as he's driving away, here's a voice go, "Let

240
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:24,020
 him me out!" So very, very stereotypical Italian ghost. That's why it's named Letta,

241
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,840
 because it said, "Let him me out!" What? Totally fake, totally made up. Now, I'm not

242
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,420
 saying that again. He wouldn't keep the doll. I think most of us would keep the doll because

243
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:41,040
 it was spooky, but I would try to see if it repeated itself. Not kept saying, "Let me

244
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,560
 out!" because then it's just Teddy Repskin. I would be curious to think, is this doll

245
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,760
 actually talking? I'd have video cameras and tape recorders around it all. I probably want

246
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,080
 to sleep for the first couple days to try to see if I was going insane, which to be honest,

247
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,000
 not sleeping for three days is a sign of insanity, but I would want to know, and if it didn't

248
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,540
 say anything else, I'd just must have heard it. It's not doing it again, but anyways,

249
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,620
 people go around it, they get sick, dogs and kids hate it. Supposed to supposedly be a

250
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,940
 gypsy doll, I don't know why it's speaking Italian, and it may or may not move, depending

251
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,460
 on the person. Some people say it moves around the house, some people say it doesn't, but

252
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,020
 the people who say it does move around the house at least scuff marks on the floor, so

253
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,420
 it's kind of a dick because you just wax those floors and then you got little wood feet going

254
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:58,420
 chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchch

255
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,760
 and obviously, easy way to scam stupid people out of their money, and I'll get to that in

256
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 a second, but easy, easy way to get money from people. eBay actually initiated a rule saying

257
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,000
 you can't sell haunted stuff, so when you buy stuff on eBay it says, "We're selling

258
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,960
 this item as is, we can't make any guarantee that a ghost is actually going to show up

259
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,280
 at your house," because it is such a scam, obviously, but people are buying these things

260
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,120
 for tons and tons of money. You know me, I'm not one who normally make fun of people's

261
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,780
 names, I've never done that on this podcast, but there's a haunted doll specialist. Can

262
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,980
 you imagine putting that on your resume? So what do you do? You're at a bar. Actually,

263
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,380
 to be honest, that would be a good pick-up line. Saddle up to a girl, be like, "Yeah,

264
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,620
 you know, I just got back from day at the office investigating haunted dolls." I think

265
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,660
 that would actually be a really good pick-up line. I should actually try that, but don't

266
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:56,780
 listen to this episode, girl, that I pick up. There's a woman named, there's a woman

267
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:06,000
 who is haunted doll specialist. Her name is Cat. This is very, very juvenile, and I'll

268
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:18,400
 have to admit it's juvenile, but her name is Cat Blowers. Cat, Cat. No, I'm assuming

269
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,200
 she's married, apparently. I guess her husband's name is Nick Blowers or something like that,

270
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,580
 which is a little better. But imagine you're a girl, you're the boy of your dreams, your

271
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,260
 name's Cat. You're the boy of your dreams, you can't wait to fall in love. The only problem

272
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,300
 is you know when you guys get married, your name's gonna be Cat Blowers. Cat, Cat. Cat

273
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:48,260
 Blowers. But anyways, Cat Blowers, she buys these pieces of junk on eBay, and then she

274
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,400
 has this test, she locks them in a phone box with a tape recorder to see if she can hear

275
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,600
 them talking. She says, "Sometimes I record music like from them, and it's weird, right?"

276
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,360
 And then she realizes that it's always the song that she happens to be listening to in

277
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 the living room. She's like, "That's weird. This 300 year old doll loves pink." So anyways,

278
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,280
 she does that, she throws a tape recorder in her phone box. She also sets an EMF reader

279
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:45,280
 out for three to five days, so like, "Doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

280
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,280
 in the room. She's like, "I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna do that." And then she's

281
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

282
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

283
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

284
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

285
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:16,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

286
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

287
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

288
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

289
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,280
 like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's like, "I'm gonna do that." And then she's

290
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 like, "If your house is haunted, you go, "Hey, my house is haunted, dude. Let me out."

291
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 And then they're like, "No, no, no. Your house is haunted because this dude like, blues brains out."

292
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,280
 And now he's like, floating around. His brains are floating around too, so be careful where you step.

293
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 And you would assume that's the same thing with dolls. But no, because this stuff is so

294
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,280
 made up and it's so such a scam, because the people just kind of make stuff up as they go along,

295
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:05,280
 they go, "No, this doll is haunted by a leprechaun. So it brings you good luck." So buy this doll

296
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,280
 and you'll get good luck. We're selling this item as is. We can't prove there's a leprechaun in here.

297
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,280
 That's a scam. You can say this doll is haunted, it makes noises late at night. It's still probably a scam,

298
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:24,280
 most likely. But it's a believable scam. Don't sell me a 30-year-old doll and say that the goddess Artemis

299
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,280
 left some nymph in it and it will give me like sexual energy. Like, that's a scam.

300
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 When I keep using the word "scam," it's mostly in regards to that set. Obviously, here's a piece of

301
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 plastic, pay $30 for eBay on it, it has a ghost in it. It's most likely just a piece of plastic.

302
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,280
 But by then telling me that it has some sort of benefit for my life, that's a scam. It's absolutely a scam.

303
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,280
 Because if it worked, you'd keep it. If I had a doll that had a leprechaun in it, I'm not selling it to anybody.

304
00:27:51,280 --> 00:28:00,280
 No. It has a leprechaun in it. There's no amount of money that I can get on eBay for a leprechaun.

305
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,280
 For a live leprechaun? Well, this is a ghost leprechaun. It doesn't matter. It's a leprechaun.

306
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,280
 Anyways, let's get back to Kevin Kane. He's telling the story. This woman buys this doll that was supposed to have a happy spirit in it.

307
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,280
 But one night, she woke up and she felt tiny little hands around her neck.

308
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:27,280
 Now, she doesn't wake up. The doll's not actually strangling her. She just feels a sensation of ten little tiny fingers around her neck.

309
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:38,280
 Which could not kill you ever. A doll cannot. The thing about how tiny them little hands are, they can't even move their thumbs.

310
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:48,280
 We've gone from the point of dolls that may or may not walk and may scuff up your floor to full digit manipulation able to choke you.

311
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,280
 Why would a doll need to choke you? How could a doll choke you?

312
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,280
 But if the doll was trying to kill you and you woke up and the doll wasn't there, he just felt the tiny hands on you.

313
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:04,280
 So it would be assumed that it was the spirit of the doll trying to get you. One of the spirit of the doll had normal sized hands.

314
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:12,280
 The ghost in the doll was a normal sized human. The doll itself doesn't have a doll sized ghost.

315
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,280
 Actually, now that I think about it, if you were a ghost and you haunted a doll, it would be extremely cramped in there.

316
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 Anyways, luckily, here's a quote from this article. "Luckily, he," this is Kevin Cain, "Luckily, he knew how to..."

317
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:33,280
 He, he's an expert at this stuff, "Luckily, he knew how to bind the demonic spirit, ultimately sealing the doll in a box."

318
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,280
 Like just regular old boys from the factory, cardboard box will do.

319
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:48,280
 "Ultimately sealing the doll in a box coated in holy water and storing it on the highest shelf in his home where it remains."

320
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:57,280
 You can't really coat a box in water. Now, assuming the box, and I'm nitpicking now, but I'm getting really kind of irritated at this stuff, box?

321
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,280
 If it's cardboard, you put water on it, it is no longer a box. And the ghost, the monster easily escapes. The doll gets out.

322
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:11,280
 But if the box is made of wood, I guess you could coat it. You had a wood, you put water on it, but eventually the water dries evaporates, stuff like that.

323
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:20,280
 Whatever, holy water on a box. I love the line. "He stored it on not just any shelf, the highest shelf in his house."

324
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,280
 That'll show you demon. That'll show you creature who can manipulate the body of an inanimate object.

325
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 You're on the highest shelf, and it's like, "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

326
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:03,280
 All of my Patreons are giving me the ability to spend money on useless stuff.

327
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:10,280
 I had a choice. I had a choice between these two dolls. Let me explain. This episode is going to go long. Haunted Doll Special. It's Halloween.

328
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,280
 Also Dead Rabbit recommends, because I want to do one every day, Child's Play. The new Child's Play movie. It's going to be really brief.

329
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:25,280
 Check it out. Chuckie is an extremely bizarrely sympathetic villain in that movie. It's a very, very well done horror movie. It's dolls. It fits the theme.

330
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:35,280
 I just watched the other day. It's not the best horror movie I've seen, but it has some really good kills. And the way they portrayed Chuckie in the movie was very, very well done.

331
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,280
 You really, really feel bad for his journey. So check out the new Child's Play.

332
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:46,280
 But let's go ahead and get back to Dead Rabbit Recommends today. Let's go ahead and talk about the dolls that I had the choices from the one I bought.

333
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:58,280
 So I'm on eBay and I find these. We have Coco the Doll. It's a Harlequin doll. So it has like the big old long arms and legs. Not like a marionette, but it kind of looks like a clown with like the puffy clothes on.

334
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:06,280
 Coco the Doll. $30. Here's the description. Coco the Doll has been part of my collection. Not my collection. I'm reading this.

335
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:12,280
 Coco the Doll has been part of my collection since I've started to collect haunted objects, i.e. waste my money.

336
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:20,280
 This porcelain tiny vessel, not just a doll, it's a vessel, seems to be inhabited by the spirit of a mischievous young boy.

337
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:28,280
 He is highly active and has been known to pull girls' hair and hide objects. So at this point I'm thinking I'm leaning towards this one.

338
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 Pulling girls' hair. That would be hilarious. And hide objects, especially when guests are over. There have been occasions where the doll has been, that's not, I'm correcting it, that's not what they wrote, but has been in a different area of the room than I had left it.

339
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:52,280
 Shadows have appeared around the doll as well. Coco isn't harmful, however. He just seems to love the attention. I'm the only attention whore here, Coco.

340
00:32:52,280 --> 00:33:03,280
 We'll think about it. We'll think about getting you. Let's move on to the other one that I had a choice of. Veronica, a rubber baby doll toy. So, may or may not be more creepy, but rubber doll toy.

341
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 $30. Veronica is a vintage rubber doll. She actually has a squeaker. I would compare it to a dog toy sound. The doll itself does have an old haunted look. This again, I'm reading this from eBay.

342
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:24,280
 I collect haunted dolls. I'm currently downsizing my collection, i.e. I want an episode of hoarders coming up and I want to make my apartment look a little bit nicer.

343
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 Veronica is an active spirit. Active, so apparently, eBay terminology, you have very active and active and then just haunted doll. And active means stuff happens quite often.

344
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,280
 Very active means it happens so often it's bordering on annoying.

345
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:51,280
 So, when you're searching for a haunted doll, you want to look for the words active or very active. If you're a beginner in this collecting, you might want to start off with a few active ones before you start getting to Dennis the Menistals.

346
00:33:51,280 --> 00:34:05,280
 Veronica is an active spirit. I've experienced vivid dreams that's completely useless to me. Doors opening and closing, flickering lights, perfume scents in the room she is located, a woman whispering hello.

347
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,280
 She's like, it's weird. Whenever I pick up the phone and it's my mother on the line, I hear a woman say hello. It's so weird.

348
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,280
 I believe her to be an active yet positive spirit. She has scared me a few times with her whispers or opening a door on me.

349
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,280
 Like, opening a door. She's like walking the doors or slamming her face. Life turns into the naked gun.

350
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:35,280
 She's scared me a few times with her whispers or opening a door on me. Put, I think she meant but. I hope she did. Opening a door on me but she is not a negative spirit.

351
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:46,280
 So I had the choice between those two and I thought I got one of them that pulls girls hair which is awesome and it walks and moves around the room and it makes shadow people appear.

352
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:54,280
 Or shadows appear around the doll. She's like it's so weird whenever a light is pointed at the doll I see a shadow behind it. What?

353
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:02,280
 And if you move the light, depending on the time of day, the shadow moves. So I have that choice and the other one is an old rubber doll that sounds like a squeaker toy.

354
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:12,280
 She doesn't move. Doors open and close, lights flicker and you can smell perfume and then a woman says hello every once in a while.

355
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:21,280
 I bought Veronica. I bought Veronica for $30. Show again guys thanks for supporting my Patreon. Because I would have never spent this money.

356
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:30,280
 I would have never spent any money that I ever like earned in my life to buy a rubber doll from the internet.

357
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:37,280
 And somebody's saying it's haunted. The reason why I chose Veronica was because I don't like stuff moving around my apartment.

358
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,280
 And I don't mean like if I woke up and there was a doll walking across the floor it would scare me but I'd be fine with it.

359
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,280
 I don't like it when I can't find my keys. That was the deal breaker. Like I was like that would be so funny.

360
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,280
 A girl comes over to my apartment and she's like dude who keeps pulling my hair? I kind of like it.

361
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,280
 And I was like yeah yeah Coco giving me a high five. He's always there to like test me if a girl likes her hair being pulled.

362
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:07,280
 And I'm like go go he's my ultimate wingman. But I didn't want to deal with some dude moving my stuff.

363
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,280
 You go to sit on the toilet there's no toilet paper. You go to sit on the toilet there's no toilet. It's in the bedroom.

364
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:21,280
 I couldn't deal with that. So I went with Veronica which is funny because I have two friends who both go by the fake name Veronica for different reasons.

365
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,280
 They use fake names but I got two Veronica's and now I got a third one.

366
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,280
 And this doll I'm wondering we're going to get it. It'll be a guest on an episode. We're going to set it up.

367
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:38,280
 But in front of a microphone I have an extremely sensitive microphone and we're going to go ahead and we're going to see if we get a hello.

368
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 Now here's the thing. I've been trash talking haunted dolls the whole time and really let me circle back to that.

369
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,280
 I got two more things to say. I know this is a long episode but I got two more things to say. One.

370
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,280
 I believe in ghosts obviously. I've been very very clear on that but that doesn't mean I believe in every single ghost story.

371
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:01,280
 Whenever people are more into the money side of it the more you are into selling me stuff other than like I can read a book about ghosts.

372
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,280
 I'll pay you for the hard work putting that book together. But when you try selling me junk and telling me it's haunted I'm very very suspicious.

373
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,280
 Now there's a chance that Veronica, this Veronica doll is haunted. That this is one of the authentic ones. It is. It's possible.

374
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:27,280
 Anyways we're going to get it here and let it hang out in my apartment, show it around, we'll record it and then I think it'll probably just end up in the corner of my room or something like that.

375
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,280
 To scare people when they come over. I mean I don't really expect anything to come out of it.

376
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:39,280
 The idea of haunted dolls is very very interesting to me because it really comes out of nowhere.

377
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:47,280
 Like why are people scared of dolls? It's interesting because it's a very very recent fear.

378
00:37:47,280 --> 00:38:02,280
 People go oh you know haunted dolls have been around since the days of Ramses. All these articles quote a Wikipedia page and they mention this fact with really no attribution but apparently Ramses the second had these dolls made of his enemies and they would like kill the dolls and the enemies would suffer battle.

379
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:11,280
 That's not a haunted doll. When people think of haunted that's a voodoo doll. It's something completely different. When people talk about haunted dolls it's kind of a narrow definition. It's a pretty narrow definition.

380
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,280
 A ghost or a leprechaun or something is inhabiting a doll and that doll is capable of doing things or just being creepy. Or both.

381
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:36,280
 So haunted dolls are actually very very recent phenomenon. People being scared of dolls. When we look back I had to do a ton of research for this. For this absolutely ridiculous subject but probably one of the most well researched topics recently.

382
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:50,280
 When we look back we didn't see haunted doll stories really start to appear until the Twilight Zone's episode of Talking Tina. Or Talking Tina apparently. I always thought it was Talking Tina.

383
00:38:50,280 --> 00:39:04,280
 But anyways you would have a short story here and there about a haunted doll. You had Talking Tina though and then you had Prey which was from the trilogy of terror. I think it was called Amelie or Amelie or something like that in the television show.

384
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:17,280
 But you had a short story about a little Zulu doll. It had a spirit in it trying to kill a woman from trilogy of terror. One of the scariest movies ever shown on television. If you haven't seen trilogy of terror watch it. Watch the last 30 minutes of it.

385
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:30,280
 The third story. But anyways you had that you had the Twilight Zone episode and then there seemed to be an explosion of fear of dolls. And I'm not saying there weren't haunted doll stories or people talking about haunted dolls going back farther than that.

386
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:45,280
 But it was not a phenomenon like it is today. And even when you look at like there was a movie like in the... I was looking at these movies that came out like in the 40's and 50's that are about haunted dolls. And again they weren't about dolls being possessed by spirits.

387
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:57,280
 They're about people being turned into dolls or people being controlled by dolls. And then after the Twilight Zone and after the trilogy of terror there's a huge explosion in haunted doll movies.

388
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:08,280
 I think this is the reason why I keep pooping all over haunted dolls as opposed to other ghost things. Is I think it's 100% a cultural creation.

389
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:18,280
 Now again you could probably find a myth of a haunted doll or a story here and there of a haunted doll. But to explain now why kids don't like walking by their sister's bedroom because she has a bunch of dolls.

390
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:30,280
 And that's the kid who drew me that drawing Finn. He's like "Oh I hate my sister's American girl dolls. They're super creepy." But the reason why they're super creepy is because of movies and television that make dolls creepy.

391
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:42,280
 I don't think it's an innate fear. An old abandoned house on the end of town is an innate fear. It's the fear of the darkness, the fear of the unknown. It's a fear of dogs and hobos and a fear of ghosts.

392
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:53,280
 Creepy Woods, same thing. There are certain fears that you can go "Oh I get it, like you just add ghosts to an already creepy location." But dolls themselves.

393
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,280
 And you could say "Well they look like tiny people." People aren't scared of haunted GI Joes or haunted Tonka trucks. They don't look like people.

394
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:10,280
 But people aren't scared of other toys. Like if you walked by a room that had a bunch of GI Joes in it you'd be like "I would be like "Oh dude this is totally awesome. These are like Generation 1 GI Joes."

395
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:20,280
 But I would never be scared to go in there with the lights off. But if there was a room full of dolls I would be like "Ugh dolls are creepy." Even though I know that they're just plastic.

396
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:30,280
 But because you're told that dolls are creepy it's reinforced. I read this thing before and they said "Kids find skeletons creepy because parents tell them that skeletons are spooky."

397
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:38,280
 But before skeletons are used in Halloween decoration kids don't find skeletons creepy. Because it's kind of a goofy figure.

398
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:45,280
 But once people go "Oh and then the spooky skeleton came out of the jungle then kids start to find them creepy."

399
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,280
 So I think it's a learned behavior. I think it's a phenomenon, it's a haunted phenomenon that is 100% created by society.

400
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:03,280
 Which is really really bizarre. Because I have a printer here that I haven't fired up in a long time and I had to so I could scan in Finn's picture for the cover art.

401
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,280
 I'm gonna play this for you and tell me that this doesn't sound like some sort of haunted printer.

402
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:34,280
 [Sounds of the printer]

403
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:48,280
 [Sounds of the printer]

404
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,280
 [Sounds of the printer]

405
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:05,280
 [Sounds of the printer]

406
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:14,280
 Now what's interesting is it has all the hallmarks of like tension. You have a repeated "denenen" "denenen" "denenen" "denenen" noise.

407
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:25,280
 And then it does it again "denenen" "denenen" "denenen" and then it does it a third time. And then when you expect the pattern to be repeated it makes a whole new set of really loud noises.

408
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,280
 There's like those awkward kind of creepy silences where you hear "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

409
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:42,280
 There's like those awkward kind of creepy silences where he had going on. It's obviously not haunted. It's obviously not haunted. But it sounds creepy. I remember when I was first trying to do it I was like "Dude who previously owned this jigsaw? Like why is it making such weird noises?"

410
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:58,280
 But if you were like six and your dad's printer like every time you walked into his office, his little den, and you were six and every so often you'd be like "Hold on honey I gotta print this out." And it made that noise.

411
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:14,280
 It would probably be unsettling because it's quite loud. But let's say you're six years old and you hear that noise and your older sister goes "Oh no that means that it's hungry and it's going to eat your hands. You better leave."

412
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:27,280
 The noise takes on a level of menace to it because it definitely has this weird tone to it. It doesn't sound like a normal machine doing something. It definitely doesn't sound like a normal printer. I gotta get a new printer.

413
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:40,280
 But by adding a story onto it, it makes the noises more startling. If I had just played the track normally and didn't say "Here's my haunted copier" you would be like "Why is this noise happening? It sounds like a broken printer."

414
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:53,280
 But if I say "Hey let me play for this." I think I said it was creepy or haunted or something like that. It adds a layer to it. Now imagine if there was a movie about a haunted printer and it made that noise.

415
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:02,280
 During the trailers people were running down the hallway and the printer. You hear the noises and you hear the noises.

416
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:09,280
 And you see it hiding in the closet. This office building has a closet you're looking through the gap and you hear the noise and it's getting louder and louder.

417
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:23,280
 And then it crescendos and then it just title card and it just says "Printer 300 DPI. Deaths per instant." Coming July 29th.

418
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:33,280
 And obviously people would laugh and they'd think that was hilarious but the movie is a success. It actually makes a printer terrifying. People would start believing their printers were haunted.

419
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:46,280
 That's really what I'm getting at. You can make anything creepy. I know there's kind of a long about way to do that. I don't think dolls can be haunted. I think that 99.9% of them aren't.

420
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:53,280
 I think that if you looked at haunted houses, houses that were believed to be haunted, I would say it's probably 50/50.

421
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:00,280
 I would say that people, a lot of times the house is just derelict. It's creepy. There may be something going on there. There may not be something on there.

422
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:07,280
 If someone says this house is haunted and it has this ghost and it'll give you 100 bucks if you spend the night, I'd be like "No, I'm good."

423
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:14,280
 Maybe a thousand. But if someone says this doll is haunted and if you look at it, it'll make you feel like you just ate three Taco Bell meals.

424
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,280
 I'd be like "Let's do it!" Not eat the three Taco Bell meals. Bring the doll over. Bring them all over.

425
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,280
 I think the chances of you stumbling across the haunted doll is incredibly rare. Incredibly rare.

426
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:34,280
 I think it's something that people, I think it's something that society has said was creepy and created a phenomenon.

427
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:42,280
 The woods are naturally creepy. Haunted houses, abandoned houses are naturally creepy. Dark hallways are the light flickers.

428
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:50,280
 I think that's another thing that was created by this society, by media. It's creepy because it's affecting your vision.

429
00:46:50,280 --> 00:47:00,280
 But again, I think that's also because of horror movies and stuff like that. But you start to get, and I think dolls are completely from short stories horror movies and your big brother or sister being jerks.

430
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,280
 I think that's where all of the fear comes from. Clowns, kind of in the gray area. I think part of it's because you can't see their faces.

431
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:14,280
 But the idea of the creepy clown, 100% the invention of the media. Even what's his face? That stupid John Wayne Gacy guy. He wasn't running around in a clown outfit.

432
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:21,280
 That was like his side gig. He had a bunch of them. Killing boys was one of them, but he was like a general contractor was really his main job.

433
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:28,280
 Creepy clowns, killer clowns. Complete invention of the media. You can say it's because you can't see their face. It's creepy.

434
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:40,280
 Yeah, I guess. I guess. I've always wanted a bang a chick that looked like a clown. Not like she had giant feet and a big red nose, but like girls, like hot girls in clown makeup, I find extremely attractive.

435
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,280
 Like there's photos online of like hot girls, but they're like wearing clown makeup and I'm like, "Ugh."

436
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:57,280
 Anyways, that aside, I think there are things that are naturally creepy because it's an evolutionary thing. Dark, run-down places where humans used to be and now you don't know what's in there.

437
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:09,280
 That's something, it's basically the evolutionary equivalent of a cave. We didn't go into unknown caves when we were cavemen, so you don't want to go into unknown houses as a, who we are today.

438
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:19,280
 Dolls completely made up. I have no problem with haunted dolls. So Veronica is on its way. We're just going to chill. We're going to hang out, put a microphone in front of it.

439
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:32,280
 A quarter-couple episodes, I'll have Veronica nearby. We'll see what we pick up. I will either be completely vindicated and prove that this doll, this $30 doll, which I'm not going to be mean to and throw it down the river or do anything stupid like that,

440
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:42,280
 it's not haunted, I'll put it with the rest of my dolls, I'll have a funny story to tell people when they come over that I spent $30 from my Patreon on this doll that's supposedly haunted.

441
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:51,280
 I'll either be completely vindicated or I'll be wrong. Doors will open, lights will flicker.

442
00:48:51,280 --> 00:49:00,280
 But I've got to be honest, the thing that does kind of make me nervous about the doll isn't the fact that, oh, you know what, if the lights flicker, okay, I don't care.

443
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:11,280
 I've already talked about my apartment being haunted in real life, I've done episodes on that, and I've mentioned that I kind of feel like there's a peace treaty between me and the ghost of the old man in my closet.

444
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:21,280
 But I bought the doll last night and I went to bed. And when I woke up this morning and I was shutting the lights off in my apartment because I leave for work quite early,

445
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,280
 the sun hasn't come up yet, I'm shutting the lights off, it's pitch black in my apartment.

446
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:33,280
 As I was walking to the door, for the first time in a long time I felt uneasy in my own apartment.

447
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:46,280
 I felt like I may have a truce with this thing in my closet, but what happens if I bring something else here?

448
00:49:46,280 --> 00:50:00,280
 This doll does happen to be legit, and I have one spirit in my apartment, and now I'm introducing another spirit, willingly bringing it in.

449
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,280
 What is possible?

450
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:17,280
 God admit, that part of it makes me a tiny bit nervous. And as I was walking through the darkness to get to my front door, this morning I walked just a little bit faster,

451
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:27,280
 because I felt it was a little more tense and a little darker than it normally was when I leave in the morning.

452
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:33,280
