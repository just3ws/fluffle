1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 When a man in New Delhi has a dream that Lord Ganesh wants some milk, he decides to bring

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,840
 some milk to the local Hindu temple.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
 Little does he know he's about to set off a worldwide firestorm.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:22,080
 Then we travel back in time to discuss a personal paranormal story of mine to end Cursed Episodes

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
 week.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,160
 I've never told this story in full to anyone.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,280
 I can't promise you will be safe after listening to this episode.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,380
 Could be a figment of my imagination.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,600
 Or he could be real.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:51,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,240
 I really do and I hope you guys have some fun plans for the weekend.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,200
 We actually have a really good episode today.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,960
 We have a nice story and then a story that may, they may redefine the idea of a cursed

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
 story.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,200
 But we'll talk about that in a second.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
 I'll give you some fair warning and sit back and enjoy this first episode and look who's

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,280
 enjoying it right now coming into Dead Rabbit Command sliding on a slip and slide.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
 Wee!

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
 It's our newest Patreon supporter, St. Canid.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
 He's wearing like an old old timey swimsuit.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
 It's like with the stripes.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,800
 It's like the tank top with the stripes.

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,160
 Everyone give a round of applause.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,760
 He's spinning around on the slip and slide.

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,440
 Don't worry, you'll get your turn.

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
 We're all going on the slip and slide now.

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,960
 St. Canid, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you don't have old timey swimsuits, that's

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
 fine too.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
 Just help spread the word about the show.

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
 Really really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,480
 Now you'll notice something as you're taking your turn on the slip and slide.

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,360
 St. Canid has a big smile on his face.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,200
 He's having a lot of fun with this.

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
 Because it's not water.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
 It took you a while to realize this.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,680
 It's not water on the slip and slide.

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,080
 He's been pouring milk on the slip and slide the whole time.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,920
 We obviously aren't very observant because we wouldn't have gone down a slip and slide

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 full of milk.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,280
 The rest of the episode we're swatting ants off of us and flies.

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,760
 But it is theme appropriate.

47
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,120
 St. Canid, I'm going to toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dreadnought.

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
 We're going to leave behind dead rabbit command and we are headed out to India.

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,720
 Pfft.

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,360
 Pfft.

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,280
 Dreadnought is cresting the waves of the Pacific Ocean as we make our way out to India.

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,920
 I found this story just the other day and I'm shocked by it.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,840
 I'm shocked by it for a couple reasons.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,600
 We'll get into it.

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,440
 Understand the story itself but I don't understand the moving parts around the story.

56
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,440
 But I stumbled across this article that was written by Michael Grosso.

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,360
 I'm sure that's not how you pronounce his name.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
 Maybe.

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
 Michael Grosso writes for this website called Consciousness Unbound.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,240
 It's his own website.

61
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,600
 This article was called a Mass Scientific Mystery in India.

62
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,520
 It's September 22nd 1995.

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
 Very very recent story.

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
 Well let me rephrase that.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,200
 It's actually close to 25 years old.

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,360
 But I was alive in 1995.

67
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,520
 So that makes it very very recent.

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,920
 We're in the city of New Delhi.

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,440
 A man is sleeping in bed.

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
 And he's rolling around in the bed.

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
 And then he wakes up.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
 You like this theater of the mind?

73
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
 You totally pictured that didn't you?

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,560
 And this guy had just had a dream that Lord Ganesh, the elephant headed god of wisdom

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
 in Hinduism said I want milk.

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,520
 He's the god of wisdom.

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,800
 I think he might have been able to say it with a couple more five dollar words.

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
 He just needed a little more like snazzy.

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
 He just didn't stare at the man.

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,000
 The whole dream was just this elephant headed god staring at the man going milk, milk, milk,

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 milk, milk.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,320
 And the guy's like how long is this dream?

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,680
 Basically Lord Ganesh says I want milk.

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
 I want it.

85
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
 I want it right now.

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
 So the dude wakes up and he's like oh dude that was a super weird dream.

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,720
 There's a god in my dream.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,200
 How often do you actually dream about?

89
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,040
 I've had one dream with Jesus in it.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
 That's not even correct.

91
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 I've had a dream where I've told this story before.

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,840
 I've dreamt about Satan a lot.

93
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,200
 Like I've had a lot of dreams where Satan was the bad guy.

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
 But I had a dream and it had nothing.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,160
 It was just a normal dream.

96
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,040
 And then something happened and there was a knock on my door and I opened the door and

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,560
 Satan was standing at the door and he had sliced off Jesus' face and was wearing it

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
 like a mask.

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,640
 And he did this little toe tap routine.

100
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,120
 And it wasn't like the devil with like the red horns and the pointy tail.

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,400
 Like it was this slender man who I just instinctively knew was the devil.

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,040
 And he had like these two big buff bodyguards standing behind him.

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,880
 I opened the door and I just see this kind of slender man in a really really nice business

104
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,520
 suit do a little toe tap.

105
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,320
 And my eyes are just drawn to the face of Jesus Christ had been carved off.

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
 Like you could you know like the eye.

107
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
 Like leather face basically.

108
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,760
 And it was very visible and recognizable that it was Jesus' face on this guy.

109
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,480
 And I woke up screaming.

110
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,720
 It was tear it was a tear.

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
 I remember screaming in the nightmare and I was screaming in my sleep.

112
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
 I woke up.

113
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,640
 I was screaming so loud I woke myself up.

114
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,800
 But other than that, that horrifying story.

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,120
 I don't know how often people dream about religious figures.

116
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,240
 But this dream was he obviously doesn't have this dream a lot.

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,320
 He jumps up.

118
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,240
 He gets some milk out of the kitchen and he goes to a local temple.

119
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
 And let me read you this quote.

120
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,960
 Let me read you this is the first part where things start to go sideways for me.

121
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,440
 Let me read you this quote from Michael Grosso's article quote.

122
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,880
 The man dashed out to the first temple to make a milk offering to the statue of Ganesh.

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
 Much to his amazement.

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,840
 He watched the milk disappear before his eyes.

125
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,880
 The impossible nature of what he saw was obvious.

126
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,560
 Unquote.

127
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,520
 So guy brings in the milk and it disappears.

128
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,480
 Now that's impossible.

129
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,080
 Well nothing just disappears.

130
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
 Nothing just disappears.

131
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,600
 I mean stuff can evaporate over time.

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,440
 But even if you took like a water into a sauna it's not like you gotta take a drink you're

133
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
 like "uhh".

134
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
 But of course I keep reading because I love paranormal stuff.

135
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
 I immediately go "what?

136
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
 That's lame!"

137
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 Throw it away.

138
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
 I'm like "what?

139
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
 It doesn't conform to normal science."

140
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
 But it put a little pin in my brain.

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
 I go "that's impossible.

142
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,440
 I have to fact check that later.

143
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,440
 I have to see."

144
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,720
 Because in 1995 I'm thinking there has to be other sources on this.

145
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,560
 Or it's just creepypasta.

146
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,880
 The word gets out.

147
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,800
 Dude did you hear the new thing?

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
 Did you hear that new boy band?

149
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
 Milk disappears.

150
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
 Everyone's like "what?

151
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
 Oh no it sounds totally awesome."

152
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,320
 Word gets out all over New Delhi.

153
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,400
 If you bring milk to a statue of Ganesh and eventually they find out you can bring milk

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,640
 to any statue of any Hindu deity, the milk will disappear.

155
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,480
 So all over town two things are happening.

156
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,360
 People are bringing milk to shrines and temples.

157
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,720
 And people who sell milk are jacking up the price.

158
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
 Ka-ching!

159
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,600
 I guess it's the point where people are leaving their work.

160
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
 It's a once in a lifetime thing right?

161
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,800
 You're not going to be like "hey boss I really want to go see if our gods are real but I

162
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
 gotta do these reports.

163
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
 Can I go find out?"

164
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 No.

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,120
 Charlie you gotta keep doing those reports.

166
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,760
 People are leaving their jobs.

167
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,480
 The stock market in Mumbai, back then it was called Bombay, but the stock market in Mumbai

168
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,360
 shut down.

169
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
 People were leaving the stock market.

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,800
 They're like "we can make profits tomorrow.

171
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,960
 Let's go find this out."

172
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,840
 Word began to spread around the globe.

173
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,600
 "Hey Joe remember when you left New Delhi?

174
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
 What a rube.

175
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,280
 The gods here are drinking milk."

176
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,560
 You never expect that phone call right?

177
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,560
 And it turns out in Hindu temples all over the world, if you bring milk to one of these

178
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,480
 statues the milk disappears.

179
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,400
 This thing spreads worldwide and at this point journalists from around the world are covering

180
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 it as well.

181
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 They're doing new segments on it.

182
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,520
 They're sending reporters out to these temples to see if there's any truth to this story.

183
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,600
 And you start to have some journalists go "I've never seen anything like this.

184
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,920
 This milk is being brought to the temple, the milk disappears."

185
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,120
 Many of other journalists go "I've never seen anything like it either, but this is a

186
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
 waste of milk."

187
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,360
 But that's a little short-sighted right?

188
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,240
 You're seeing proof of a world full of deities.

189
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,640
 But don't waste that milk.

190
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,840
 It's like all of a sudden your mom is running a newspaper.

191
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,520
 This goes on for 24 hours.

192
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,120
 You bring milk to a Hindu temple it will disappear.

193
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,200
 And then after that it stops.

194
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,360
 Apparently it's happened a few more times, but that was the time when it was the most

195
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
 widespread.

196
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:59,760
 And that's the story about the milk drinking statues of the Hindu gods.

197
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,320
 Now I read that and I just told you that story and I'm sure you have the same questions

198
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,200
 I had when I read it.

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,720
 My main question was obviously is it true?

200
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,400
 And I go "if all these journalists are covering this there has to be footage of it."

201
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,640
 But it was a gamble because it's 1995.

202
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 They didn't have an internet.

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,000
 As we know it back then they weren't saving as much video footage so when I went to go

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,920
 look for video footage I thought this might actually be very difficult.

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 I was wrong.

206
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,840
 There's a lot of video footage of this, but it is not what we thought.

207
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
 I'm not at least what I thought.

208
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,600
 You'd probably be like "dude of course it wasn't that.

209
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 Dork?

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 Dork?

211
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
 What were you thinking?"

212
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
 Let's go back to that original quote.

213
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,560
 The man dashed out to the first temple to make a milk offering to the statue of Ganesh.

214
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,880
 Much of his amazement he watched the milk disappear before his eyes.

215
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,920
 What does that imply to you?

216
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,120
 You don't know what you're going to have to do over in this episode.

217
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,400
 What does that imply to you?

218
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,760
 Because at this point after I got done reading the article I thought this is an amazing miracle.

219
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,720
 This is on the level of the Fatima, the visitations of Mother Mary.

220
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
 This is on the level.

221
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,680
 I mean there's I'm sure there's a lot of Catholics that would disagree, but if you

222
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,600
 strip away your own personal biases, whichever religion you practice, you would be hard

223
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,880
 pressed to say that a vision of Jesus like just like a shape of him in the clouds, that's

224
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,880
 nothing compared to all these statues drinking milk.

225
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
 So I was like how do we not know about this?

226
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
 This is how I visualize this.

227
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,920
 This is how I visualize this.

228
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,240
 Man walks in with a cup of milk and the milk just disappeared out of the cup.

229
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,080
 That would be something you could bring people in, totally objective observers and they could

230
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,480
 look at the cup of milk and watch the milk disappear.

231
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,840
 But that's not what they were doing.

232
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,720
 I was so disappointed when I started watching videos on this.

233
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
 What they were doing is they were taking spoonfuls of milk.

234
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,560
 So the smaller amount of milk, the easier it is to make mistakes.

235
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,360
 A gallon of milk disappearing is far harder to explain or hand wave than a teaspoon of

236
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
 milk.

237
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,560
 They would take milk and they would hold it to the mouth of the statue and they would

238
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:17,080
 slightly turn the spoon and then the milk would disappear.

239
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,080
 So that's...

240
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
 I was so disappointed.

241
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,680
 I actually thought like milk was dematerializing, they were spilling it.

242
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,240
 Now here's the thing, I will allow that some of it may have been a miracle.

243
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,240
 I'm not going to say that every single person who did this was spilling it.

244
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,040
 There was one reporter I was watching a video on and they were saying that the guy held

245
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,440
 the spoon for him and he goes, "I saw the milk disappear."

246
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,280
 He goes, "But I noticed he was kind of holding it at an angle."

247
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,480
 So I asked to hold the spoon the second time and he goes, "I just tipped it slightly and

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
 all the milk disappeared."

249
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 The idea was it was going into their mouth.

250
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,240
 But when you're reading reports of this, they were saying like there was no milk anywhere.

251
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,560
 It was like you'd put the milk in the spoon, you'd put it to its mouth, you would tip it

252
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,240
 slightly and then there'd be no milk except for inside the statue's tummy.

253
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,680
 But the videos that are online, there's milk all over the statue.

254
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,480
 Actually, there was one scene I kept rewatching because I wanted to be sure.

255
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,960
 You can see just briefly a drop of milk drop off the statue's chin and then you do see

256
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,160
 milk on the tray the statue's on.

257
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,800
 So that's just spilling milk.

258
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,760
 That's spilling milk on statues.

259
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,840
 But I will say it's interesting because let's put on our conspiracy caps for this one.

260
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,280
 We're going to wrap it up like this.

261
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,560
 This is a really old story and I find it very, very interesting that I had never heard of

262
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
 this.

263
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,440
 Not like I'm the Indulby of paranormal knowledge.

264
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,840
 But like I said, we can talk about the miracle at Fatima where Mother Mary showed up and

265
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,440
 she gave the prophecy to these young girls and we always hear about Jesus and Mary appearing

266
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,360
 in stonework or on toast or in clouds or whatever these visitations.

267
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
 But this event was like a huge global event.

268
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,640
 How come we don't know about it?

269
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,920
 How come it's not even part of it?

270
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,360
 It is just as even with the spilling of the milk, even with the spilling of milk, it gets

271
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
 out in a second.

272
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,760
 But it's on the level of the stain appearing on a wall in the shape of a Christian religious

273
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
 figure.

274
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,560
 It's actually far more witnesses, it's global.

275
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,960
 I just can't understand why it's not a bigger story.

276
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,200
 It could be a big story in India and not a big story in the West.

277
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's definitely possible.

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,120
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps for a second.

279
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,520
 I'm going to say this.

280
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,120
 It's possible, and this is why I don't totally dismiss it.

281
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,720
 It's possible that this was a miracle and it was happening and people weren't spilling

282
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 the milk.

283
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,600
 It was actually going into the statue's mouth and no one could figure it out.

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,120
 And there may be tons of video evidence showing that.

285
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,680
 But we can't let that get out, right?

286
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,840
 In a world where people kill each other over religions, who wants to have proof that one

287
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,720
 religion had this mass global miracle.

288
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,960
 So the only videos that continue to exist based on this are the videos that people could

289
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,080
 use to debunk it.

290
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,960
 The video where they're clearly spilling milk and then turn into the camera and go, "See?

291
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
 I fed it milk."

292
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,640
 So that's why I'm not totally discounting this.

293
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,520
 I was a little disappointed that the milk just didn't magically disappear.

294
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:31,400
 But it's possible that this was such a conclusively proven miracle that not only did they let the

295
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,440
 story die out after a day and they moved on to whatever else they were talking about in

296
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
 1995.

297
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,040
 Not only is the story super obscure even in the world of paranormal research, but the

298
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,840
 only evidence that you can find on YouTube is evidence that would point to it being

299
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
 fake.

300
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,840
 It could be the fact that a bunch of people got whipped up in a religious fervor and bought

301
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,480
 a bunch of milk and spilled it everywhere.

302
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,760
 Or it could be the fact that that is what was caught on video while in temples all over

303
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,560
 the world, believers of the Hindu religion were feeding their gods.

304
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,600
 St. Canid, let's call on that carbonicopter.

305
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,000
 We're gonna say goodbye to New Delhi.

306
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,240
 We got gallons of milk, we got so much milk.

307
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,320
 We got a new slip and slide ready in the back of the carbonicopter.

308
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,360
 Our bones are gonna be super strong by the end of this episode.

309
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,840
 But while we're drinking our own, while we're drinking our body weight and milk, St. Canid,

310
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,160
 I want you to take us out of New Delhi.

311
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,120
 We are headed back to the United States.

312
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,480
 Specifically, we're headed to San Lorenzo, California.

313
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,440
 This is the last warning I'm gonna give for this.

314
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,000
 It's really the last warning I can give for it.

315
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,080
 Because after this the segment starts, I've never told this story in full to anybody.

316
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,840
 I don't know what the implications of this story are.

317
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,720
 This story could be a figment of my imagination.

318
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,240
 It could be the story of a ghost.

319
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,040
 It could be a curse.

320
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,000
 It could be by you hearing this story you may meet this person.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
 I'm not trying to hype this up.

322
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
 I don't do ARGs.

323
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,920
 I don't do lARPs.

324
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,520
 And nothing could come of this at all.

325
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,960
 It could just be some weird experience that I had.

326
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
 Not a lARP, not an ARG.

327
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,560
 I wouldn't waste your time or mine with that.

328
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,000
 But I just don't know what the implications of this story are.

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,400
 So you guys wanna swing back by Monday?

330
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,960
 We're not doing Curse episodes a week.

331
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,760
 I think we're gonna do a Zack Snyder week.

332
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,320
 I'm so excited for Justice League.

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,640
 So excited for Zack Snyder's Justice League.

334
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,520
 I'll tell paranormal stories and I'm just gonna talk about superheroes.

335
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,920
 But I might try to find some cool themes in there.

336
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,640
 Like a zombie one for Don of the Dead of his movie.

337
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
 An old one for 300.

338
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
 But anyways, that's the case.

339
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,240
 Cause again, I don't know about this story.

340
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
 That's the case.

341
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
 I will see you guys Monday.

342
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,480
 But for the rest of you, St. Canid is unfortunately stuck on this episode.

343
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,400
 But it might work out to have a saint.

344
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
 A little bit of backstory.

345
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,320
 The story itself is actually quite short.

346
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,240
 Let me give you a little bit of backstory here.

347
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,640
 A long time listeners of the show know that I've struggled with anxiety and that has

348
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,960
 almost completely disappeared since I gave up caffeine.

349
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,080
 If you guys have anxiety issues, 100% give up caffeine.

350
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,040
 My life has changed stress wise since I've given up caffeine.

351
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,280
 I gave up nicotine and I was still on edge a lot.

352
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,000
 But I gave up caffeine called turkey and I feel fantastic.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,600
 But I've struggled with anxiety since I was a kid.

354
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 I remember originally I would get anxiety attacks about choking.

355
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,400
 I remember when I was a little kid I heard a story about a neighbor.

356
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
 I don't even think it was a neighbor.

357
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,880
 I think I visualized it as a neighbor.

358
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,200
 I think it was a relative of a neighbor.

359
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
 Husband and a wife.

360
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
 They had gotten married recently.

361
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
 The wife goes to bed.

362
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,560
 The husband's staying up to watch movies.

363
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,160
 Eating popcorn.

364
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,880
 When she came downstairs the next morning he was blue.

365
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,080
 He saw popcorn and got stuck in his throat.

366
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
 And he suffocated.

367
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,520
 Or choked I think it's the actual term.

368
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
 That story terrified me.

369
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
 I think I must have been 6 or 7 when I heard that story.

370
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
 It totally stuck with me.

371
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,560
 I visualized her coming down the stairs.

372
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
 I could imagine the whole situation.

373
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,600
 The blue light of the television set.

374
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,720
 Dark room.

375
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,520
 His head looking up at the ceiling.

376
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
 Completely blue.

377
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
 He was just sitting there.

378
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
 Throws the popcorn in his mouth.

379
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,040
 It goes down the wrong pipe.

380
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
 He dies.

381
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,600
 Funny because this is the first time I've really talked about this story.

382
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,360
 I've talked about that story to other people.

383
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
 But I think that's the first time.

384
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,080
 This is definitely the first time I've ever recorded it publicly.

385
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,600
 As I'm telling that story I'm thinking that's not how it would have happened.

386
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,820
 She came down in the morning and found him dead.

387
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,520
 When you choke you don't freeze in place.

388
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,920
 It's not like Flash Gordon shot you with a freeze ray.

389
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,400
 He probably would have been on the ground.

390
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,680
 I mean it's not like it's so funny because that's less scary.

391
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,880
 There's little birds flying around.

392
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
 On the house.

393
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
 But you know outside it's daylight.

394
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,440
 It's still tragic that guy died.

395
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,160
 But I always had this image of this body sitting in a couch turned blue.

396
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
 What I love doing watching movies.

397
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
 I remember I had a big problem with choking.

398
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 I was always afraid I was going to choke.

399
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,200
 I was always afraid to encounter people who were choking.

400
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,400
 I was always afraid to go to stand at comic shows and I'm like oh no he's choking and

401
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
 I'm running out.

402
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,000
 Like this is when I was younger I would over obsessively chew my food.

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,880
 And I remember my dad once said he goes you eat in cafeterias all the time.

404
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,720
 In high school and you know great school you've eaten in cafeterias.

405
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 All this stuff.

406
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,420
 I was like yeah and he goes have you ever seen anyone choke outside of a movie or some story

407
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
 that you had heard.

408
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
 And I go no.

409
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,240
 He goes you have seen thousands of people eat over the years.

410
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
 You go to restaurants.

411
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,480
 You go to parks.

412
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 Eating school lunches.

413
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,080
 You've seen thousands of people eat.

414
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,440
 You've never seen people choke.

415
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,760
 It's actually really really tough or rare for people to choke.

416
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
 It doesn't happen.

417
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,040
 So that was but the thing with anxiety like even though I was told that I go yeah that

418
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
 makes sense.

419
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
 I've never seen anyone choke.

420
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,080
 I've never given anyone the Heimlich maneuver.

421
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,000
 But it's still kind of stuck with me.

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,680
 I remember when I moved up here.

423
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,480
 I must have been like 36.

424
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
 37.

425
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
 No it was probably closer to like 35 36.

426
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:41,440
 I was working on a story about a man named Mr. Slip or Mr. Branch or something like that.

427
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
 Mr. No.

428
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,880
 It wasn't that.

429
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,600
 But I was a huge fan of the Max and they had a villain on it called Mr. Gone.

430
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,640
 And I've always loved just like that imagery and I'm a derivative hack when it comes to

431
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,440
 writing that's why I write leprechaun fanfiction.

432
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,920
 I remember I came with this character who was this diabolical sorcerer who existed in

433
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,280
 the modern age.

434
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,480
 One of the things he would do some of you old time listeners will recognize this something

435
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,440
 else to talk about one of the things he would do is he would put mushrooms in the forest

436
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,600
 and they're like psychedelic mushrooms and then if you ate one you'd get super high and

437
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,560
 it would be like the best high ever and then it would start to turn into this terror high

438
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,080
 like you're getting really really panicked.

439
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,880
 And what you realize during your trip is that when you ate that mushroom you were living

440
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,720
 out someone else's life so you experienced like all the joys of childhood and then it

441
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,840
 starts to get harder as they're going through college and then there's like divorce and alcoholism

442
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,000
 and then the life starts getting more trashy and then you realize at the end of your trip

443
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,880
 you are walking through the forest looking for a mushroom to eat and that person eats

444
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
 the mushroom.

445
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,480
 And basically the point is, what is, is you're the mushroom.

446
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,880
 Like Mr. Sleeve, I don't remember his name, but Mr. Sleeve he would, he would put these

447
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,120
 mushrooms in the ground and you'd eat one and you would turn into a mushroom.

448
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,520
 You're the mushroom.

449
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,280
 So then you're just sitting there on the forest floor totally sentient and you're like locked

450
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,600
 in this state of eternal pain until someone else comes along and eats you and then they

451
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,400
 live your life and now they're shooting people in the mushroom.

452
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
 It was dumb.

453
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 It was stupid.

454
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,480
 Like it was kind of cool, it was kind of cool, but you know it needed to be fleshed out a

455
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
 bit.

456
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,040
 So Mr. Sleeve needed some work.

457
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,320
 I mean Mr. Sleeve as a villain needed some work, but he was just this diabolical person.

458
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,680
 And I remember once I was walking through the parking lot of the local Walmart, nice

459
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,240
 sunny afternoon, was drinking a soda, listening to music and I was working on my book in my

460
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,200
 head and I was thinking about Mr. Sleeve and I remember him giving a monologue to somebody

461
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
 in the story.

462
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:03,080
 It's like a collection of short stories, but Mr. Sleeve was the main villain throughout

463
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,000
 all of them and he was giving this monologue and he goes, "The human heart, it is the thing

464
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,440
 that gives us life, pumps blood through us.

465
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
 It is our friend the whole time.

466
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,640
 When we get scared, it beats faster.

467
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,800
 It's trying to give us more blood flow to deal with the fear in front of us.

468
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,960
 When we're comforted, it slows down.

469
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,040
 It lets us relax.

470
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,080
 It's like our best friend in our body.

471
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,400
 Every other organ can have an adversarial part of it.

472
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,560
 Your liver's full of poison, your kidneys are full of pee, but your heart is your best

473
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,200
 friend.

474
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,600
 And so a heart attack is the ultimate betrayal.

475
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,800
 A heart attack is your heart giving up.

476
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,480
 It's leaving you behind.

477
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,360
 It's done with you.

478
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,200
 It wants nothing else to do with you.

479
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:13,640
 It will kill itself just to kill you."

480
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,960
 I remember I was walking through the parking lot and I played that monologue out in my

481
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,920
 head and I came to a standstill.

482
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,520
 I just stopped walking.

483
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,320
 Up until that point in my life, I never thought about having a heart attack.

484
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,200
 Ever.

485
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,840
 Never occurred to me that I was at risk for a heart attack.

486
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,880
 That was actually back when I was my heaviest.

487
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,920
 I'm like 70 pounds lighter than I was back then.

488
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,480
 Up until that point, so that would put me at 350 if you don't know my weight because

489
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,240
 I talk about it on and off during the show, but 350 pounds.

490
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,640
 And it was not until that moment in my life did I ever think that I could have a heart

491
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,720
 attack.

492
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,160
 And since then, my anxiety exhibits itself as a heart attack.

493
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,760
 Chest pains, the tightness, tingling left arm.

494
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,280
 You're like Jason, you probably should go get that checked out.

495
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,480
 I have been checked out by doctors multiple times.

496
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,440
 And both times, I quit caffeine because I was throwing my heart out of rhythm by abusing

497
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,600
 caffeine and nicotine.

498
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
 I've done it twice.

499
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,800
 But other than that, I'm going in for a stress test tomorrow.

500
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,560
 They're going to put me on a treadmill for 45 minutes and they're going to run all these

501
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,080
 tests and me and my cardiologist are.

502
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,200
 And he goes, dude, you're so young to even have a cardiologist.

503
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,000
 But he goes, we know what's going to happen.

504
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,160
 You're going to take the stress test.

505
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 Everything's going to be fine.

506
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
 You've passed every single test.

507
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
 You have a healthy heart.

508
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,480
 You've got to lose weight because you have a healthy heart now.

509
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,320
 You're not going to have a healthy heart in five years if you're still walking around

510
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
 280 pounds.

511
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,520
 That's just the fact of the matter.

512
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,200
 But right now, Jason, the fact that you're afraid that you might just fall over from

513
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,920
 a heart attack, it's not going to happen.

514
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,360
 They've done all sorts of like the exs- the sonograms on the heart.

515
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,640
 Everything works out perfectly.

516
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,280
 My cholesterol is great.

517
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,400
 But yet when I have an anxiety attack, it exhibits itself as a heart issue because of that moment,

518
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:08,360
 because of that fictional character I created and that monologue.

519
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,760
 A heart attack is the ultimate betrayal of your best friend.

520
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,000
 It wants you to die so badly it kills itself.

521
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,320
 Fictional character that I made up, Mr. Sleeve.

522
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,640
 I think the power of the imagination cannot be denied.

523
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,120
 And the reason why I wanted to start off telling that story is because this story I'm about

524
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,120
 to tell you is quite short and it's very, very possible that it is all in my imagination.

525
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,780
 I actually would bet money that was in my imagination if it wasn't for something else

526
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,520
 that I stumbled across a few years ago.

527
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,400
 But even now I'm just so...

528
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,880
 I just don't know guys.

529
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
 And this...

530
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,040
 If it's in my imagination, it's in my imagination.

531
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,280
 If it's something else, it's pretty, pretty rough.

532
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
 We're in San Lorenzo.

533
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,880
 The year is 1992.

534
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,520
 And this is the year that my parents are getting a divorce.

535
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,760
 I was a sophomore in high school at the time.

536
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,800
 I had a girlfriend.

537
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,920
 I was trying out for the football team.

538
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,320
 Had a bunch of friends.

539
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 It was dope.

540
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
 It was dope.

541
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 Getting really good grades.

542
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
 My parents are getting a divorce.

543
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
 And that's when I was like, "Dude, what's the point of trying to get good grades and

544
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
 stuff like that?"

545
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,040
 I really just started sucking at school.

546
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,000
 I just didn't care anymore.

547
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,720
 But before that, I was like, "Oh, you know, everything's gonna be great.

548
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
 I'm gonna be a journalist.

549
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
 You know, this is what I want to do.

550
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,000
 Gotta keep girlfriend.

551
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,120
 Got a lot of friends."

552
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
 And the divorce didn't really hit me that hard.

553
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,960
 Like I understood because I'd already dealt with anxiety my whole life and the frailty

554
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,760
 of existence and the fact that at any point someone could die.

555
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,320
 I think I always just figured that stuff would fall apart eventually.

556
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,320
 Entropy.

557
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,120
 I'm the biggest optimist you'll ever meet who has anxiety issues.

558
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,160
 So when my parents were getting a divorce, other siblings were totally freaking out.

559
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,600
 They were having their own issues with it.

560
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
 And I just thought, "This is the way things are.

561
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,960
 Our parents aren't perfect people.

562
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,400
 Our parents are flawed people.

563
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
 I love them.

564
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,040
 I still love them to this day, but they're flawed.

565
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
 They're humans.

566
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
 They're flawed.

567
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:21,800
 So they're gonna make flawed decisions."

568
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,920
 I'm not gonna say that it didn't affect me at all, but it was more of a, "This is just

569
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,640
 the way things are."

570
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 Type of moment.

571
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,880
 "My life will be more difficult going forward."

572
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,640
 I knew that being 15, I go, "Things aren't gonna be as easy as they were."

573
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,160
 And they weren't easy before either.

574
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
 And that was the thing.

575
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,480
 I knew that we struggled with poverty growing up as a family.

576
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,040
 So I thought, "Ah, this just, I know how single families are.

577
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,560
 A lot of my friends are in single families.

578
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
 My life's not gonna be great.

579
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
 Probably gonna have to move.

580
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,520
 Probably gonna lose this life that I've built."

581
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,040
 But such is existence.

582
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,480
 It was kind of my attitude when I was 15 years old.

583
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,480
 But I could tell that something was going on in the house.

584
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,640
 I was actually the first kid to realize that our parents were going to separate.

585
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
 Everyone else kind of lived in their own bubble.

586
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,840
 And it could be the fact I've talked about it before that I can sense emotional disturbances.

587
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,880
 I knew something was wrong in that house.

588
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:25,040
 The house seemed perfect, but it was like psychic energy cleaved its way through our

589
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,520
 home.

590
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,280
 That scared me.

591
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,760
 I could understand divorce.

592
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
 I could understand the foibles of human emotion.

593
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,240
 But this was something else.

594
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,520
 I remember one day I came home.

595
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,480
 I was a latchkey kid.

596
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 My mom worked.

597
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
 My dad worked.

598
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 One day I came home.

599
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
 I was all by myself.

600
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,320
 I walked right through the front door.

601
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,880
 Now this was a two story house.

602
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,160
 This was the one time we weren't poor actually when we had a really really nice house.

603
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
 Two story house.

604
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
 It was right next to the high school.

605
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,560
 And right next to a royal high school.

606
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,120
 A nice little park next door.

607
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,360
 I walked into the house.

608
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
 Opened the door.

609
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,360
 I was the only one in the house.

610
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,640
 And I immediately felt that I was not the only person in the house.

611
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
 And then I heard it.

612
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,640
 Shink shink shink shink shink shink.

613
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 The unmistakable sound of a knife sharpening.

614
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
 Now obviously I had never been in a kitchen.

615
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,720
 I obviously been into kitchens.

616
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
 My mom was like get out of here you bum.

617
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,480
 I'm going to chew your food correctly.

618
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,360
 But you know that sound of like someone sharpening a knife.

619
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,280
 I've seen it in movies.

620
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
 Action movies.

621
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,160
 And then we meet again shink shink.

622
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,160
 It was overly exaggerated though.

623
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,440
 It was like something you would see in an action or horror movie.

624
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,600
 And I remember walking into the house.

625
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,280
 And I hear that sound.

626
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,320
 Shink shink shink a knife being sharpened.

627
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,280
 And I just stopped.

628
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,360
 Now the layout of this house was it was like a track house.

629
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,640
 You know they're just like 15 of them built in a row.

630
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,160
 But you had a why someone lives in that house today.

631
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,040
 You'd have a wide open like foyer area.

632
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,080
 Then you had the little like living room the kitchen and then you have the stairs going

633
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,520
 up and then you had mom's bedroom and then our bedrooms.

634
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,400
 You had like a long walkway up there.

635
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:39,160
 And I stopped in this large foyer area and I hear the sound shink shink shink.

636
00:31:39,160 --> 00:32:05,040
 And I slowly look up to the walkway.

637
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:23,080
 I just remembered another part of this story.

638
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
 Great.

639
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,760
 Okay so anyways I'm so anyways I'm standing there and I'm looking up.

640
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,080
 I'm about 15 years old.

641
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,720
 It's the middle of the day.

642
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,720
 And I look up and I'm looking at the walk.

643
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,920
 So you have the walkway and there's like safety railing there with like the the grates in

644
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
 it.

645
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,360
 Not the grates but you know like the slats in it.

646
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,000
 Just like a standard staircase thing.

647
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,160
 You know what I mean?

648
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
 You know what I mean?

649
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,200
 You have the bar to make sure no one falls off and then you have the bars that are going

650
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,160
 vertically to keep it.

651
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,480
 Basically you guys know what I'm talking about.

652
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,720
 So I'm looking up there and it's this walkway and I still hear the sound shink shink.

653
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,880
 The sound is coming from my parents room and it's loud.

654
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,120
 And I remember just standing there and I'm staring up and I can't see into my parents

655
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
 room.

656
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,920
 I can see the doorway but I don't know what's going on in the room.

657
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,920
 All I know is the sound is getting louder.

658
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:34,760
 Shlink shlink shlink shlink shlink.

659
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,320
 Louder and louder to the point.

660
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,400
 No joke.

661
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,600
 It gets so loud.

662
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:48,880
 I remember like in a movie cupping my hands over my ears and the sound is still getting

663
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,560
 louder and louder.

664
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,040
 I'm almost ready to fall to my knees.

665
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:02,680
 The sound is literally deafening me.

666
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,280
 And then I hear a deep laugh.

667
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,800
 Ha ha ha ha ha.

668
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,200
 The sound disappears.

669
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,120
 I don't remember what happened after that.

670
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,920
 I don't throw my backpack down and go watch MTV.

671
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,480
 I don't remember if I went back outside, if I waited for somebody to come home.

672
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,840
 The next thing I remember concerning this story is me shaking.

673
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,560
 I'm 15 years old again.

674
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,720
 I'm not like 8.

675
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,360
 I remember I was terrified.

676
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,520
 I was shaking.

677
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,320
 And my mom and my dad were trying to console me and they were saying you didn't hear anything

678
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
 Jason.

679
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
 You're just stressed.

680
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
 There's stuff going on.

681
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:59,480
 I remember on clear as day both of my parents looking at each other very concerned.

682
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,680
 Very very concerned.

683
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,360
 Not concerned on a paranormal friend.

684
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,200
 And my dad, I've talked about these stories, I'll put them in the show notes.

685
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,360
 My dad has had confrontations with demons before.

686
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,280
 He was a southern Baptist minister.

687
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,760
 He's had issues with demons.

688
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,680
 He's met other ministers and deconsent have had issues with demons.

689
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,160
 He's not someone who's like oh that's poppycock.

690
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,400
 He knows this stuff exists.

691
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,520
 And my mother has had issues with them as well.

692
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,600
 She knows this stuff exists.

693
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,840
 But I remember that look of concern was more like you saw her son going crazy.

694
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,840
 See hallucinating.

695
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,400
 This is the stress of this marriage breaking apart affecting him.

696
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,960
 I don't know what it was.

697
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,280
 I don't know what it was.

698
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,880
 I have an idea though.

699
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,760
 There was a part of the long pause.

700
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,840
 That wasn't planned.

701
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,280
 When I was remembering myself standing on the floor.

702
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
 Which where humans normally stand.

703
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,760
 When I remember myself standing in the foyer looking up I remember this didn't happen at

704
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
 the same time.

705
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,720
 This didn't happen at the same time.

706
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,480
 But I remember looking up at that walkway with the staircase.

707
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,280
 I'm not going to describe it again but it had bars on it.

708
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,040
 I remember looking up at one point at that walkway and someone was crouched down with

709
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,280
 their face pressed against the bars looking at me.

710
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,880
 A big smile on their face.

711
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,480
 A glimmer?

712
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,360
 Imagination.

713
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,960
 It had to be my imagination.

714
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,640
 I didn't even equate the knives with anything paranormal.

715
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,560
 And of course I have an interactive imagination.

716
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,920
 Mr. Sleeve.

717
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,120
 Mr. Sleeve gave me an anxiety attack.

718
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,880
 I am constantly crafting these stories in my head.

719
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,800
 So the fact that a kid who believes in ghosts and believes in paranormal one day is walking

720
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,600
 by and he looks up and he thinks he sees someone crouched down and looking through the bars

721
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,560
 at him with a big smile on his face.

722
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,640
 I never really chalked.

723
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,120
 I actually completely forgot that I had seen that.

724
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,760
 And again I don't maybe didn't see anything.

725
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,160
 Maybe it was just a trick of the light.

726
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,680
 It did look like it was maybe just a couple feet from my mom's and my dad's bedroom.

727
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,360
 But I didn't really equate the two things.

728
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,240
 It was just when I was telling that story about the knives in the bedroom I remembered

729
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
 that.

730
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,560
 And that would have been it.

731
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,360
 I remembered the story about hearing the knives.

732
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,640
 I remember them being really scared of my mom and dad's bedroom for a while.

733
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
 Not like everyone in there.

734
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,840
 But it doesn't matter.

735
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,960
 I imagined, I thought there was somebody in there.

736
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,360
 I didn't equate it as a paranormal event when it happened.

737
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,600
 I thought that someone had actually broken into the house.

738
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,200
 I was up there sharpening a knife to get me.

739
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,840
 But fast forward years later.

740
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,120
 I don't know when this started.

741
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,480
 And it's been a while since it's happened.

742
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,280
 But it lasted for quite a while.

743
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,200
 Overactive imagination.

744
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,400
 I'd call him the man with the knife.

745
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,000
 I never saw him.

746
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,680
 Never saw him.

747
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,120
 But I'd sense him.

748
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,840
 When I got really stressed out.

749
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,760
 I'm really depressed.

750
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
 Which is rare.

751
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
 Which is rare for me.

752
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
 I don't really get depressed.

753
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
 I get really stressed out.

754
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,400
 Above and beyond ending up in the ER from too much caffeine.

755
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,160
 Just life altering stress.

756
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,680
 I'm going to get evicted from an apartment.

757
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,200
 Loss of a loved one.

758
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,880
 Those biggies.

759
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,200
 Not just like, "Oh no, they're canceling the Walking Dead.

760
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,400
 We're not talking about stuff like that."

761
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,880
 There would be a man behind me with a knife.

762
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
 I never saw him.

763
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
 It's not a visual hallucination.

764
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:44,120
 But I would sense a man standing behind me with a knife.

765
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:49,400
 He was wearing a long sleeve black jacket.

766
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,080
 With the tails on it.

767
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,960
 One of those old formal jackets.

768
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,840
 And his hair was black and wild.

769
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,760
 Long black slacks.

770
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,520
 Dole black shoes.

771
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,680
 An erictus grin.

772
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,800
 One of those creepy smiles that seems to dominate the entire face.

773
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,560
 And when I would be in these moments of anxiety he would stand behind me with this knife.

774
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,480
 And it wasn't like a kitchen knife.

775
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,480
 It seemed almost ceremonial.

776
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,040
 And he would just stand there behind me.

777
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,560
 I could sense him.

778
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,000
 I could describe him in detail.

779
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,800
 He had wide eyes.

780
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,320
 But his pupils were tiny.

781
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,080
 And he would just stand there behind me with that dagger.

782
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,160
 If I was sitting in a chair up against the wall it didn't matter.

783
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,080
 He was standing there behind me with that dagger.

784
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,400
 It terrified me obviously.

785
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,200
 And it brought back memories of what I heard in my house.

786
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:06,160
 Because you have the imagery of not only the knife, but the smile, the delight in my terror.

787
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,160
 Years later.

788
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,360
 Years and years later.

789
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,840
 The man with the knife didn't show up until I was an adult.

790
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
 That happened when I was 15.

791
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,640
 I didn't start sensing the man with the knife.

792
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,920
 If I remember correctly.

793
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,520
 Because it's like one of those things.

794
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,640
 When you get a skin tag someone goes when did you get that?

795
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,440
 And you're like I don't know it's been here for a long time.

796
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,000
 I didn't really pay attention until I got this big.

797
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,520
 I don't know I'm pretty sure it was like late 20s, early 30s.

798
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,840
 The man with the knife.

799
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,280
 But years after I started experiencing this thing.

800
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,780
 And a lot of times I just waved it.

801
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,160
 I'm just so stressed out.

802
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,120
 I've created this tulpa in my mind.

803
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,920
 It's a manifestation of my stress.

804
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,960
 I feel like Damocles sword is hanging over my head.

805
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,920
 That's not spooky enough for me.

806
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,000
 So I've created this other image.

807
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,440
 And I've survived all of that stuff.

808
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,040
 All of those anxious moments that I had.

809
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,000
 I've survived them and you will survive your anxious moments as well.

810
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,560
 But years after this started I came across an online comic.

811
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,200
 Which makes the whole story even more bizarre.

812
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,320
 I gotta give a shout out to Twitter user @Delphi1916.

813
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,720
 Because I put out a call for this comic.

814
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,760
 I had come across it a few times over the years.

815
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,880
 But I had lost track of it.

816
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,880
 @Delphi1916 found it for me.

817
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,480
 So shout out to you.

818
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,520
 This comic is actually from a graphic novel called The Damned.

819
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,440
 You guys have probably seen this comic around.

820
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
 It's about a two page illustration.

821
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,640
 It's a story of a killer.

822
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
 Called The Abymor.

823
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,400
 It goes through this.

824
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
 I'll put it in the show notes.

825
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,000
 But it goes through this thing that you are introduced to the story of this killer.

826
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,560
 They show versions of it.

827
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,600
 It's hieroglyphics.

828
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,640
 They show versions of it.

829
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,880
 As writing during like Elizabethian times.

830
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,600
 The point is that the story is the story of a man called The Abymor.

831
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,000
 And if you read the story.

832
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,080
 You have to then show the story or present the story to someone else or he will kill

833
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
 you.

834
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,400
 He basically threatens you to share the story.

835
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,200
 And we see it start off in Egyptian times.

836
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,400
 Then we see it like a Elizabethian times.

837
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,640
 And then it ends with a guy's watching a news report.

838
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,760
 Like a Ripley's Believe It or Not news report on this bizarre story everyone believes.

839
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,560
 And it turns out that the news reporter had also been threatened by The Abymor.

840
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
 And they show a man.

841
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
 Oddly enough.

842
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,080
 This is a very very interesting detail.

843
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,480
 The last panel of the comic is the newscaster going.

844
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,240
 I'm sorry whoever is watching this.

845
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,600
 I was forced to show you this.

846
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,680
 And there is a man he's dead in his living room watching television.

847
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,280
 Blue light illuminating the room.

848
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,640
 Just like my childhood fear of the man who had choked.

849
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,840
 Now this Abymor character is not throwing popcorn into people's mouth.

850
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,240
 He stands behind you with a knife.

851
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,200
 The only thing that's visible on him is he is a black shadow.

852
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
 You see a collar.

853
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,880
 So he's wearing some sort of jacket.

854
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,040
 And a huge grin spread across his face.

855
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,640
 Now obviously the rictus grin is creepy.

856
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,680
 The Joker uses it.

857
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,240
 They actually used it in the cartoon.

858
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,320
 The Max, the Itz, the little creatures that are running around in Max have that.

859
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,360
 It's a creepy image when someone has an overly wide smile.

860
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,280
 I've never seen this comic strip and it just knocked me for a loop.

861
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,640
 I go this is something I have seen myself.

862
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,840
 But in more detail.

863
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,920
 Not less.

864
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,520
 And it made the idea of the man with the knife.

865
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,680
 It made him less of a fictional character by seeing it represented in someone else's

866
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
 fiction.

867
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,520
 Now there's just a few elements that are the same.

868
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,960
 But they're the most important elements of the story.

869
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
 The grin.

870
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,480
 Him sneaking up behind you with a knife.

871
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,760
 And there's one more element to the story.

872
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,680
 One more thing that makes it match this other character, the Abymor.

873
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:16,080
 And one more thing that made me cautious to tell this story to you.

874
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,480
 When the man with the knife is standing behind me holding that knife.

875
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,000
 Like he's ready to strike.

876
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,080
 He's holding it up like he's ready to stab me.

877
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
 I guess I didn't make that clear.

878
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,480
 He's not just like bouncing it on his finger.

879
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,000
 It's like he's about to stab me at any moment.

880
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,720
 He's standing there hand raised ready to stick me in the back with this knife.

881
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,920
 Huge smile spread across his face.

882
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,120
 He's not looking at me.

883
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,160
 He never looks at me.

884
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,740
 I can sense him behind me, but I can't sense the eyes on the back of my head.

885
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,320
 When I see him with my mind's eye.

886
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,740
 Standing there behind me holding that knife.

887
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,720
 Huge smile on his face.

888
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,320
 He's not looking at me.

889
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:25,560
 He's looking at you.

890
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:33,600
 He's looking at you.

891
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,320
 Deadrabbitradio@gmail.com is going to be your email address.

892

 There's not that is not creepypasta either.

893
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,760
 There's not creepypasta either.

894
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,080
 He's looking at somebody else.

895
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:52,120
 He's looking over my shoulder over my head.

896
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:59,840
 His wide eyes are staring not at me, but at you.

897
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:09,400
 So by telling this story have I now invited him into your life as well.

898
