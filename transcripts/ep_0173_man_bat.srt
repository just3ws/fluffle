1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 Can you smell terror?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,320
 That's terror, like spooky stuff.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,360
 Damn, my speech impediment.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,640
 And then we take a look at a hideous winged cryptid.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,400
 No one as the man bat.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,840
 Is this winged cryptid currently stalking the city of Chicago today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,840
 I don't wanna sleep down.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,840
 Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,480
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,280
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,920
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,280
 We're gonna go ahead and just jump on into this again.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
 I got no news to talk about.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,040
 Everything's going pretty good.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,280
 I got a mouthful of nicotine losanges.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
 And I'm feeling great.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,160
 So let's go ahead and get started with the first story.

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,640
 The first story is interesting because I've had this, I have a super super sensitive nose.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,720
 To the point that, and this might discuss some of you guys, but it's natural.

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,320
 It's totally natural.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,640
 I remember I've always been able to do this, but I never was able to tell what the smell was.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,800
 As I got older and learned more about human biology, I started to figure it out.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,760
 But especially when I was in high school, it happened a lot.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,040
 And especially in college, it happened a lot.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,600
 I would smell wet pennies every so often.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,920
 I would smell iron-o- It smelled like iron oxide or wet pennies would be another way to describe it.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,880
 And I can smell when a woman's on her period.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,080
 I can smell the blood.

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,800
 And it was something that I kind of figured out, but I never wanted to be like,

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,640
 "Hey, you on the rag?"

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,720
 Like I didn't want to really like say, so I never really had any confirmation until I was like maybe like 19 or 20.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,240
 I did end up discussing it with a woman.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,200
 I said, "Yeah, I can smell a woman's on her period."

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,360
 And she's like, "Really?"

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,080
 It's like, "Yeah, it smells like pennies."

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,880
 And she's like, "Yeah, that's exactly what it is, dude. You're smelling it."

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
 I have a super sensitive nose.

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
 And again, I'm not saying like I can smell it while they're in the shower.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,040
 Like I can be walking through Macy's and be like, "Oh, okay."

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,400
 So it's on their period in here.

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,720
 It's like really strong.

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,280
 And I don't not try to make women feel uncomfortable or anything like that.

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,040
 It's super rare for people to have such a sensitive nose.

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,680
 Super, super rare.

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,920
 But on the flip side of that, there have been times where I've walked into houses.

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
 I remember this happened not too long ago.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,120
 I was with a friend, we went over to another friend's house.

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,240
 As we were driving back home, I remember going, "Are they having marriage troubles?

50
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
 Are they having troubles there?"

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,440
 And friends like, "I don't know. Like I think everything's okay."

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,480
 And I'm like, "I think they're fighting a lot."

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,400
 And she goes, "How do you know?"

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,000
 And I'm like, "I just have a feeling."

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,880
 Because you walk into people's houses.

56
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
 I can do this too.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,440
 I can walk into someone's house and tell you how good your relationship is.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,440
 Not because half the house is like full of video game stuff

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,080
 and the other house looks like it's out of better homes and garden.

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 Like there's like a straight up like schism in it.

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
 I can go into your house and basically get a sense of how good your relationship is.

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,120
 Not through any sort of trickery, not through any sort of magic.

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,440
 I never really figured out how to do it until now.

64
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,120
 I think I found the mechanism behind it.

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
 And this also plays a lot into ghosts and stuff like that as well.

66
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,640
 In 2015, they're in the Netherlands.

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,600
 And so we're going to the year 2015.

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,760
 We're in the Netherlands.

69
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,080
 And we are visiting Utrecht University, good old UU, home of the fighting boars.

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,880
 And so Utrecht University did this study.

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,640
 And they go, "Hmm.

72
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,120
 I think as much as I crap on scientists, I think they'd actually kind of be a funny job

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
 because you just come up with bizarre stuff and start running scenarios."

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,320
 They said, "Let's see what happens when we expose women to male sweat."

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,920
 But not just any male sweat, we're going to expose them to terror sweat.

76
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,120
 So they had, they brought these guys in, they brought in 30 dudes and said,

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,440
 "Here, we're going to give you a clean shirt.

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,400
 Don't wear any deodorant, nothing like that.

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
 Just come on over."

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
 Sounds like something a serial killer does to prep his victims.

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,800
 But anyways, "I want you pure for the knife.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
 I want you pure."

83
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,560
 But anyway, so these guys apparently have never seen hostile.

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,040
 They go to this place and they have to follow all the instructions.

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,920
 They're given a clean shirt and they're given little sweat pads underneath their armpits.

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,480
 And at that point, they're shown one of three videos.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,040
 Either a scary video, well, I probably like the ring or something like that.

88
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,760
 The actual ring video and they're all dying.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,560
 They're like, "Most of our participants died after seven days."

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,760
 They show them a happy video or they show them a neutral video.

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,080
 And through that little, but they put their sweat pads under there.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,680
 And it's not like then they had them run a marathon.

93
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,280
 Just that little bit of sweat.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,600
 They took each swab out, whether or not they were watching one of those three videos, put

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 it in a vial.

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
 A couple days later, they had these women show up and they had their heads like resting.

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,520
 Again, it's basically serial killer university.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,600
 They had their heads locked into this little like brace.

99
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
 So they couldn't move their heads.

100
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,800
 People are very trusting in the Netherlands.

101
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,120
 And they brought in the, opened these vials up in front of the women so they could get

102
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,400
 a whiff of this sweat.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,120
 Now some of the sweat smelled gross.

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,200
 Some of the sweat was a little B.O.ish.

105
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,120
 Some of the sweat smelled kind of good.

106
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
 The guy had a good fruity flavor to them.

107
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,840
 And some of the sweat, you couldn't really sweat.

108
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
 You couldn't really smell it.

109
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,520
 But that's not what the scientists were looking for.

110
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,200
 They were looking and videotaping directly at the woman's face.

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,760
 And at the moment they got the first whiff of the vial, they recorded the subconscious

112
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,280
 facial reactions of the women.

113
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,880
 And this is what they found.

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,520
 Regardless of whether or not the B.O. was super stank or not.

115
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,440
 Regardless of the actual smell.

116
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,800
 And this was a small sample size.

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,920
 But regardless of the actual smell.

118
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,440
 The women who were exposed to the neutral sweat had no real facial reaction.

119
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
 None of that subconscious facial reaction.

120
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,480
 But the women who were exposed to the fear sweat for a brief second, their face showed

121
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
 fear.

122
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,000
 I don't think their eyes went super wide like loony tunes, but for a brief second they

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
 looked like they were scared.

124
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,240
 And the women who were exposed to the happy smell for a brief second, their face showed

125
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
 the light.

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,320
 And again, regardless of how stinky it was.

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,800
 They're like "oh my god what does this guy eat?

128
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,880
 Asparagus every day.

129
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,280
 This is horrible."

130
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,800
 But in that brief first second they'd be like "puppies."

131
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,480
 And so this is the thing.

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,360
 If your sweat can leave behind that sort of neurochemical trail.

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,160
 If you go into this house where there's domestic violence where people are just beating each

134
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,560
 other up, they're leaving that fear and anger chemical in the air.

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,000
 And when you walk over they're all dressed up and they got dinner ready and the television

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
 showing Peppa Pig or whatever.

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
 Now these women also were more sensitive smellers.

138
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,280
 So they were selected because they have a high sense of smell.

139
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,680
 So I think someone with a high sense of smell like myself could walk into a house and be

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,960
 like "there's something really serious going on here."

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,640
 Like someone's getting the shit kicked out of them here.

142
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,840
 And I can't put it in words.

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,080
 I just walk into the house and I'm like "this house feels oppressive."

144
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,160
 Which is probably how I would express it.

145
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,000
 I probably wouldn't know in detail but I'd walk in and I would get that whiff of that

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 terror scent.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,200
 You walk into the house and everything's super lovey-dovey.

148
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,520
 You walk in and you're like "this house feels like a home."

149
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
 This house feels like everyone inside loves each other.

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,560
 And this is why I think this is interesting.

151
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,280
 I always poo poo on mediums.

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,240
 I think the idea of go- and we actually talked about this yesterday too.

153
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
 This is kind of a callback to that.

154
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,400
 Even mediums don't have any sort of psychic powers.

155
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,840
 But they're just really sensitive smellers.

156
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,160
 So they can go into a house where oppressive acts have happened and they're like "there

157
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,400
 is a dark foreboding in this house."

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,280
 But they don't know why they're having that feeling.

159
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,000
 And then yesterday I talked about the ghost of Wong and how I feel there may actually be

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,040
 a ghost there but someone created a story about that.

161
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,240
 I think it's more likely that mediums have no magical powers but they might just be super

162
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
 sensitive smellers.

163
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,760
 And they walk into a house and they're like "their first reaction is something wrong

164
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,360
 is here."

165
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,920
 And then they make up a story to explain why it's wrong.

166
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,520
 It's completely natural reaction.

167
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,680
 You walk into a house and you're like "this house feels troubled."

168
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,720
 Maybe an old timey guy here chopped the head off his wife and his wife is still floating

169
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
 around the basement.

170
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,360
 Because they're trying to explain that initial feeling they have.

171
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,800
 But I would also argue that I think most people, they got the sense of a smellage for this one,

172
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,160
 but I think most people, whether or not you know it, pick up on the smells of other humans.

173
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
 I think the sense of smell is completely underrated.

174
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,720
 So when you meet a person and they seem creepy or they seem ha- and you haven't really talked

175
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,520
 to them, you're drawn to them or you want to stay away from them, it's most likely their

176
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,920
 scent.

177
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,520
 It's most likely you aren't necessarily being attracted to them or being warned away from

178
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,360
 them because of anything you can really explain, it's probably the chemical that they're putting

179
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,740
 out that you're picking up slightly and your body's either saying "this guy's into some

180
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,440
 weirdo stuff."

181
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,520
 Stay away from him, you're going to end up in his murder basement with your head locked

182
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,560
 into a brace having you smell sweat until he cuts your organs out or he's giving off

183
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
 happy chemicals.

184
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,480
 And you're like "oh, this guy, I think I could chill with this dude, he's pretty cool."

185
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,560
 I think the nose is completely underrated.

186
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,400
 I think this study proves that.

187
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,440
 And I think it may also help disprove or debunk the idea of walking into a house and sensing

188
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
 ghosts.

189
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,020
 Now we're leaving the Netherlands.

190
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,820
 By Netherlands we wave and they're all waving, they've got huge pit stains underneath their

191
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,540
 shirts because they just can't stop running these tests.

192
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,060
 We're coming to America.

193
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,860
 Most specifically, we're coming to the states bordering Lake Michigan.

194
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,580
 And some of them, my geography's not all that good, but we're in that general area.

195
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,580
 So you might be like "that state's not near Lake Michigan, we're in that general area,

196
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,540
 just go with me on this."

197
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,620
 Because this creature doesn't really care about boundaries, doesn't really care about

198
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,040
 state lines.

199
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,120
 And I think it's interesting, because a lot of times we talk about cryptids in the forest,

200
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,840
 a lot of times we talk about cryptids in the jungle, cryptids in the desert, but what

201
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,640
 about a cryptid in the air?

202
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,840
 Not a lot of them, find them fascinating.

203
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
 1969.

204
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,920
 We're in the town of Rowling Prairie, which is an oxymoron, Rowling Prairie, Indiana.

205
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,960
 There's a family living in a trailer, unnamed family, by the way.

206
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,420
 Maybe it might be named, I might not just wrote it down, but anyways, this family's

207
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,940
 living in a trailer.

208
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,420
 A recent storm ripped a hole in the roof of the trailer.

209
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,180
 So I don't know why people live, I don't mind people living in trailers, I think that's

210
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
 totally fine.

211
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,060
 But I don't understand why you live in a trailer in Tornado Alley, or anywhere where there's

212
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
 any sort of high wind.

213
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,900
 But anyways, so these people are living in a trailer, in a place where wind can rip the

214
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,220
 roof off your house at any moment.

215
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,540
 And they haven't gotten it fixed yet.

216
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
 Probably never will.

217
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,480
 So they put a blue tarp over the hole, and now this is a sizable hole.

218
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,640
 It's not like a little like, oh look it, I can see the sunlight.

219
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,520
 It's like, oh look, I can see the entire sun, and the flames shooting off the side of it.

220
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,200
 From my living room.

221
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
 So anyways, there's this giant hole in their roof.

222
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
 They cover it up with a blue tarp.

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
 Which would be, how do you sleep with that?

224
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,120
 Every night it'd be like, plus the bugs.

225
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,160
 But anyways, they're sleeping in their trailer.

226
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,300
 Blue tarp covering up the hole.

227
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,940
 Mom, Dad, Grandma, little boy, little girl, all living in this trailer.

228
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,660
 I'm sure it was a double white.

229
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,740
 One night the boy's sleeping.

230
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,740
 [snoring]

231
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,980
 The can't sleep because the tarp keeps hitting the top, the wind's just driving him nuts.

232
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
 Little boy.

233
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,140
 Parents are asleep, baby sisters asleep, grandmas asleep.

234
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,180
 So the little boy's sharing a bedroom with his baby sister, so her crib's in the bedroom,

235
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,680
 he's laying in bed.

236
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,880
 Here's the tarp.

237
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
 Doesn't hear the tarp anymore.

238
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
 He's laying in bed, wide awake.

239
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,280
 The sound that was keeping him awake is now absent, and he finds it a little more terrifying.

240
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,360
 And then he smells something.

241
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
 Not terror sweat, not happy sweat.

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,080
 Something beast-like.

243
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,540
 Something old and wet and inhuman.

244
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,940
 He rolls over in his bed, looking towards his sister's crib.

245
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,020
 And that's when he sees it, standing in the darkness.

246
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,940
 He described it as seven to eight feet tall, covered everywhere in hair.

247
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,100
 Huge, leathery wings.

248
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,420
 Attached to its back.

249
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,700
 Massive arms and legs, skinny little torso.

250
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,800
 Kind of looked like a moth would if he was hitting the gym.

251
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,320
 He described this as what I thought was, so that description in and of itself, you're

252
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,200
 like, it's kind of like a big old bat, like a muscular bat.

253
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,360
 Bat who doesn't skip leg day, but when he discovered a tiny little torso.

254
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,320
 And the way he describes it, I thought was chilling, he says, it looked like a huge, the

255
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,480
 torso in the head looked like a human skeleton with sharp teeth.

256
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,380
 That's the sound it made.

257
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,940
 And I don't know if that's the actual sound it made, but he described it as a low garbled

258
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
 sound.

259
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,860
 He's in this room, he immediately begins screaming and his grandma runs into the room.

260
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,420
 The creature then turns to the boy, picks him up in these huge powerful arms and starts

261
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:36,140
 running through the trailer and shoots out the top of the roof.

262
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,680
 He's out through the hole.

263
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
 Grandma's screaming.

264
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
 Parents?

265
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
 Dead asleep.

266
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,600
 What's weird is that there's a gap in the story at this point, where the boy says, he

267
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,920
 survived to tell the tale, he says, the next thing I know, I was on the roof of the trailer

268
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
 out in the cult.

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,560
 The parents said, we woke up because we heard something loud hit the roof of the trailer.

270
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,960
 They jumped up and they found their son on the top of the trailer.

271
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,240
 Unconscious.

272
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,900
 The grandma said, a giant bat just flew out of here, like just picked up your son, my

273
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,300
 grandson, which obviously, but grabbed the kid, ran and took off.

274
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,380
 And the boy was up there.

275
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,660
 So you had two witnesses, you had the grandma and the boy who both saw this creature.

276
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,300
 Now they didn't call the cops, which is a little suspicious, but I'm wondering if there

277
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,540
 was something else going on in that trailer, drinking or something like that, or drug use.

278
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,740
 You're going to call the cops if a giant bat tries to steal your kid.

279
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,640
 You're going to call the cops if a tiny bat tries to steal your kid, but they didn't call

280
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
 the cops.

281
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,080
 This story only came to light years and years later when he told this story.

282
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,200
 So there's a little bit of a suspect to it.

283
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,880
 He could just be making it up and saying, oh yeah, my grandma saw it and they're like,

284
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,840
 okay, we interview her and they're like, nah, she's dead.

285
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,560
 But he tells the story later.

286
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,880
 Now this is what I thought was funny.

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,560
 Other than the child abduction by a giant man bat.

288
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,320
 He had this horrible experience as a kid.

289
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 He didn't forget about it.

290
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,100
 He remembered it all of his life.

291
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:07,100
 And then the movie, The Mothman Chronicles came out starring Richard Geer, came out

292
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,220
 like in the late 2000s, and he goes to see it.

293
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,260
 Now generally if you get mugged, you're not going to go watch Menace the Society when it

294
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
 comes out.

295
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
 You're going to be like, nah, I'm good.

296
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,860
 I don't need to see that.

297
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,660
 But he goes to see, he gets abducted by a man bat, and then he goes to watch The Mothman

298
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,780
 Chronicles and he ran out of the theater.

299
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,580
 He got totally scared.

300
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,520
 And then they have this quote in this article.

301
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,680
 He literally had to leave during the scene where the Mothman caused the automobile crash

302
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
 and death.

303
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,520
 He has not attempted to watch the film since then.

304
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,680
 No, duh.

305
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,200
 Really dude, why does this article have to add that last sentence?

306
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,760
 Of course he doesn't want to watch it again.

307
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,240
 He got abducted by a Mothman type creature.

308
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,960
 But anyways, they felt the need to include that quote like he has not watched the film

309
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
 since.

310
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,440
 Of course he hasn't.

311
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
 Of course he hasn't.

312
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,800
 Again, you go through a traumatic event.

313
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,780
 You're not going to be like, hey, what do you want to watch?

314
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,780
 I don't know.

315
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
 Let's watch Irreversible.

316
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,300
 Like you're just going to stay away from movies that replicate the crime that you are

317
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,020
 part of, that you are a victim of.

318
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,260
 So anyways, that's not really notable, but they wanted to notate it on this website.

319
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,300
 So I read that story and I was like, that's probably not true.

320
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,940
 I've been in a lot of trailers in my life.

321
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,500
 I've never found one that an 8 foot tall creature could walk through naturally.

322
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,040
 I've never found one that really anyone over 6 feet tall could walk through naturally.

323
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,520
 I've never, I don't think they could support the weight of a creature that was 8 feet tall

324
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,600
 running around.

325
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,720
 I think the fact that he, they dropped him on the roof was bizarre.

326
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,880
 Like there was a lot of stuff, the parents not waking up.

327
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,840
 The theory was that the creature hypnotized them.

328
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,720
 Then why wasn't the grandma hypnotized?

329
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,880
 Why wasn't he hypnotized?

330
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,080
 So the story didn't really, I was like, I read it and I was kind of like, I don't think

331
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
 it's true.

332
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,100
 Then I decided to look up some more stuff.

333
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,460
 In the Lake Michigan area, in that whole general area of the United States.

334
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
 What are those states called?

335
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,100
 We have the West Coast and the South and the East Coast and then we have the Northwest.

336
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,580
 Then we have Central America.

337
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,700
 No, no, that's a different place.

338
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
 But you know what I mean?

339
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,500
 Like the Great Lakes area.

340
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,380
 Like anyway, so that whole area up there, there's been a lot of sightings of a man bat

341
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,380
 creature or sometimes it's described as a giant insect like creature.

342
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,120
 Which I think this one, even though he was giant and furry, I think the tiny body makes

343
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,380
 it does seem kind of insectoid.

344
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,920
 But I start looking through these different incidents and I was like, oh, these people

345
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,720
 see it flying through here and these people.

346
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
 And I was like, oh, that could probably be explained.

347
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,680
 It could probably just be a big old bug.

348
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,220
 And I keep looking and oh, at a certain point I'm trying to find nothing because I had already

349
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,640
 made my mind up that this story was fake and I still, I'm not 100% on it.

350
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,820
 But I kept finding sighting after sighting after sighting of these creatures to the point

351
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:08,900
 in 2017 alone in the city, in just the city of Chicago, 29 sightings of a man bat creature

352
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,180
 by dozens of witnesses.

353
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,700
 Police officers, news reporters, people just walking down the street.

354
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,880
 They saw one jumping off of the Sears Tower like doing a swan dive and then fly through

355
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,920
 the city.

356
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,300
 People had seen them on the outskirts of Chicago.

357
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,980
 People have seen them within the streets of Chicago flying around.

358
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,560
 Reports of them shape shifting of seeing humans all of a sudden growing wings and taking off

359
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,920
 and flying off into the city.

360
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
 Report after report after report.

361
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,360
 And at a certain point there have been times where a bigfoot has been sighted in an area

362
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,760
 and then all of a sudden there's a ton of bigfoot sightings.

363
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,580
 Then you have to go, those are probably fake.

364
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,960
 Like either that original person was the first person to see bigfoot in the area or everyone

365
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,460
 else now is mistaking everything for bigfoot.

366
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,020
 But these man bat sightings aren't super publicized.

367
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,520
 It's not like one person sees the man bat and is all over the news.

368
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,700
 This 1969 story is way too far back for it to be a viral sensation.

369
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,800
 People, ordinary people, are seen just in the city of Chicago 29 times a giant, bigger

370
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,540
 than a human flying creature going through the city.

371
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,460
 Absolutely bizarre and I think it's interesting because when we think of cryptids, they're

372
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
 hidden.

373
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,300
 Like I was saying in my intro, they're deep in remote areas.

374
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:35,680
 Very rarely do you have, almost never do you have cryptids in super inhabited areas.

375
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,380
 Could be fake.

376
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,500
 Could just be a lot of people thinking that they're seeing a giant flying guy.

377
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 But if it's real.

378
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,760
 Like this is a real cryptid.

379
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,440
 What's interesting about this story is that you know how we build houses and we start

380
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,680
 to encroach on the natural habitat of mountain lions.

381
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,040
 Then mountain to lion start walking.

382
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,120
 We had a mountain lion walking through the city of Hood River a couple months ago or

383
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,280
 cougar or whatever.

384
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
 Whatever the difference was.

385
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
 I think it was mountain lion.

386
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,640
 But anyways, it was walking by an elementary school because humanity keeps encroaching

387
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,760
 on their territory and they're like, well, screw it.

388
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,700
 If I can't find food out here, I'm going to go into your neighborhood and find some food.

389
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,100
 What if the same thing is going to happen with cryptids?

390
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,980
 What if as we spread out and start knocking down their natural habitat, they start coming

391
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,560
 to where we're at?

392
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,120
 We cut down enough forest and eventually bigfoot's like, this sucks.

393
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
 Can't find any more fish.

394
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
 Can't eat any more deer.

395
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,280
 I'm just going to go into this neighborhood.

396
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,480
 What happens when we start building apartment buildings where the melon heads live and

397
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,040
 they're just like, ahhh, they're trying to apply for a loan.

398
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,900
 They all just stack up on each other wearing a trench coat, filling out paperwork.

399
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,420
 That's one scenario.

400
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,260
 That's one scenario.

401
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,220
 That we're basically cutting into their environments so we're going to be seeing more and more

402
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,020
 cryptids in the cities and in the suburbs.

403
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,380
 But there's another theory as well.

404
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,260
 What if the man bat, if it exists, let's assume that it exists for a second.

405
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,540
 What if the man bat says, hmm, my species have always lived in the wilderness and we've

406
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,260
 always hunted lone stragglers.

407
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,040
 People lost in the woods, they disappear.

408
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,180
 Hitchhikers on a dark stretch of night looking for a ride, they disappear.

409
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,220
 Small family picnicking.

410
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,400
 One kid goes running off, never find the kid again.

411
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,540
 And that has satiated my species for a long time.

412
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,480
 But now is the time to no longer just eat.

413
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,980
 Now is the time to feast.

414
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,340
 Now is the time to hunt humans where I know there's a lot of them.

415
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:54,740
 And you have this creature patrolling the skies of Chicago looking for its next male.

416
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,340
 A hiker goes missing in the middle of the woods.

417
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,260
 People are going to go looking for him.

418
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,860
 A young prostitute disappears in the streets of Chicago.

419
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
 They're going to look for her.

420
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,560
 But at a certain point they're just going to figure the city swallowed her up.

421
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:22,800
 It's far easier to feed on prey in a city where people easily just disappear.

422
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,680
