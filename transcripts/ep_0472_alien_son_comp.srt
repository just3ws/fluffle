1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 Did a glitch in the Matrix change the course of the Civil War?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,720
 Is a man stalking the streets of New York City, making women poop?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:18,240
 Then we take a look at an interesting case of when life after death and UFOs collide today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,760
 [Music]

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. So almost time for the weekend

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,680
 and I hope you guys have some awesome plans and if not, if you're just chilling at home, that's cool too.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,520
 I want to give a shout out to our latest Patreon supporter, Platinum Piss. Platinum Piss?

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
 I mean it's an upgrade from a golden shower. It's Platinum Piss. Thank you so much for

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,800
 that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show. That helps a lot as well.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,280
 I totally understand some people just can't do the Patreon thing. Just help people about the show.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,080
 Helps it grow. We also have a merch store if you want to look into that. And if you are a Patreon

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
 supporter, I'm still sending out the stickers. So give me your address. We're going to get you

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,840
 one of these cool stickers. I'm getting emails from people who've received these stickers. I'll

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,720
 reveal the design eventually, but I want to get out a lot of these stickers. So thank you so much

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,880
 for your support. Platinum, we're going to start off in, let's take the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:33,680
 We're going up nice and slow. And then we're back in time. We're floating over Maryland. Now it's

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,680
 old timey cannonballs and muskets. Civil war time. Balls flying everywhere. Deadly balls. And we're

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,560
 just like bouncy balls. Not a balloon party. The North and the South have collided in the field

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,360
 of battle. It's brother versus brother. Dad versus son. Everyone's getting shot and stuff.

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,040
 And like cannonballs. Now we're way up in the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We don't have to worry about

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,880
 none of this stuff, but we're flying over the battlefield. We do kind of have to worry about

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,680
 it because the fate of the nation is decided on this thing. Are we going to be a nation of Freeman

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,160
 or a nation of slavery? It's all going to be decided now. It's fall of 1862 and Confederate

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,880
 General Robert E. Lee has had several decisive victories. We're flying the Durgible up when

27
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,120
 we see General Lee being like, "Ha ha ha. I've had several decisive victories, but I'm ready to take

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,480
 DC itself. I have a plan. We're going to get out of the South because it's kind of muggy down here.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
 It's super hot. It's big old mosquitoes. We're going to move into the North. We're going to take

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,200
 DC. Now he has 50,000 troops. He has to fight through an army of 85,000 Union troops only to

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,280
 face another 72,000 men protecting DC. But Lee thinks he can do it. He has a plan. He's going to hit

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,200
 Harper's Ferry. He's going to take that first. 12,000 troops versus their 50,000. No sweat. He sends

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,560
 out orders. Special Order 191. He decides to split up his forces. So he sends all these messages out

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,720
 to all of his other field commanders. They didn't have Wi-Fi back then. You had to give a note to

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,800
 someone and they ride on their horse and they go to this other dude and they hand him the note. That's

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,680
 how it was done. September 9th, 1862. Corporal Barton Mitchell is with the 27th Indiana Regiment.

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,160
 He's about to change the course of American history. He's walking through a field

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,280
 and he sees a note wrapped around three cigars. He's like, "What? This is kind of weird. He's

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,800
 smoking the cigars. Oh yeah. Nothing like these Virginia Slims, but I'm from the North. So

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,120
 nothing like these good New York Slims. He's smoking these things." Now, he's scanning over the letter.

41
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,880
 He's using this as an ashtray and he sees at the bottom it says, "By command of General Robert E. Lee

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,720
 and it's signed R.H. Chilton, Assistant Adjunct General." So he's like, "I don't know who this

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,520
 Chilton dude is, but I know who General Lee is. He's had several decisive victories. He takes it to

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,600
 his commanding officer. It goes up through the Union chain of command and the dude who gets it

45
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,520
 is Colonel Samuel Pittman." And he's looking at it. He knew Chilton before the war. He knew his

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,000
 handwriting and he's looking at it. He goes, "This is official. This actually came from Chilton himself."

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,240
 It detailed where they were going to attack, locations, numbers. It was basically, it was the

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,200
 battle plan Robert E. Lee sent out to say, "This is what we're going to do to take the war to the

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,720
 north." The Union finds this. Now the north, instead of just sitting there, having to have a defensive

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,960
 posture in this upcoming battle, can make a move. It results in the battle of Antium. It's the bloodiest

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,360
 day on the war and it halts Lee's march on Washington. People predict if Lee had been able to take

52
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
 Washington D.C. would that have been a major political blow? Would it have been a morale

53
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,080
 blow? Would it have been a strategic victory? There's a lot of people who go that losing

54
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,680
 this Special Order 191 to the north was a pivotal moment. Some people go, "Eh, he may not have been

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,280
 able to do that stuff anyways," but this allowed the north to preempt that type of attack. It

56
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,520
 definitely would have bolstered morale in the south. This stopped General Lee from taking Washington

57
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,280
 D.C. So they still have the copy of this letter. And what's interesting was this letter was written

58
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,680
 to General A.P. Hill, because there's multiple of these orders now of Special Order 191. They're

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
 sent out to all these other field commanders. One of them, this one was specifically addressed to

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,120
 General A.P. Hill. It was written by Chilton by command of General Robert E. Lee. This is all,

61
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,640
 we still have this note, because it's an important piece of American history, but A.P. Hill actually

62
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,680
 got his letter. He still has it, and we still have the one wrapped in cigars. Both are authentic.

63
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,160
 What? Each general only had one letter assigned to them. And again, this wasn't like someone ran

64
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,080
 to Kinkos and made a copy of it. These are all handwritten. And A.P. Hill got his Special Order,

65
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,760
 looked at it, goes, "That's a pretty good plan," puts it in his jacket. Why was Hill sent two

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:13,040
 letters? Everyone else only got one. And the one that Hill got said by command of General Robert E.

67
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,360
 Lee, and it was signed Stonewall Jackson. R.H. Chilton, after the war, was asked about this.

68
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,280
 Because again, this wasn't just some, this changed the war. A lot of people do believe this changed

69
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
 the war. They asked Chilton about it after the war, and he goes, "Oh, no, no, no, I wrote that.

70
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,280
 Stonewall Jackson didn't write that letter. I wrote that letter, and I sent it out, and it

71
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,680
 must have not got to him. But I don't remember who I gave it to." Because they asked, "Why was it in

72
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,640
 the middle of the field?" He's like, "I don't know, bro. I did my part. I wrote the letter and gave it

73
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,360
 out, and then it just kind of disappeared into the ether." So it's interesting to think that the

74
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
 letter, there shouldn't have been two copies of this letter. First off, and I should have said

75
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,560
 this earlier, I got most of this information from a very well-written Reddit post by SlutforBacon

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,400
 on the Unresolved Mysteries subreddit. So I wanted to give SlutforBacon a shout out. But I really,

77
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,840
 really appreciate it. And I did some additional research, but I got a lot of it. I had never

78
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,760
 heard of this until I had read that Reddit post, so thank you for that. Obviously, because of the

79
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,600
 scope of the show, and I think what we're interested in, the first thing that I thought of was, like,

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:23,280
 time travel. Right? That somebody interfered with time to drop the... Think about, "Dude, fields are

81
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,800
 no one to be big and like, full of nothing." The fact that this guy was walking by, the time

82
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
 traveler was like, "You know, I should bribe this guy with a couple cigarettes." Actually, maybe he

83
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,320
 put the note, and the dude walked by it, and the time traveler was like, "Ding it." He puts a cigar in

84
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,800
 the note, and the guy walks by it, and the time traveler was like, "Ding it!" Finally, he, going back

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,360
 and forth in time, buying more cigars. He finally adds the three. That's a magical number for the

86
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,200
 guy to notice it picks it up and stops the South marching into the North. It's very, very interesting.

87
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,680
 Harry Turtledove, he writes books about alternative history. This was a plot point in one of his books.

88
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,200
 "Was Special Order 191 a glitch in the Matrix? Was it the result of time travelers setting time right?

89
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,320
 So the United States would remain a union instead of a Confederacy of States,

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,080
 freeing the slaves and creating a path towards a better future? Was it a simple issue of two

91
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,160
 people writing letters and not being aware of anything that's going on? Bad management."

92
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,360
 Maybe that's actually the most likely scenario, but it's also fascinating to think that a simple,

93
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,760
 even on that level, a simple mistake could change the course of a war. But time travel,

94
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,120
 glitch in the Matrix, the Chilton, right it and then hand it to someone who just kind of faded

95
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,760
 faded away. What if the person who was carrying it was abducted by aliens and then Chilton got his

96
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,880
 mind wiped? I can say ridiculous things all day long, but the really important story is that due

97
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,160
 to a small issue, literally the size of a piece of paper, the union prevented military

98
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,480
 catastrophe. So glitch in the Matrix, alien abduction, time travel, or just poorly managed

99
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,160
 military forces. I like the time traveler thing because I just like the idea of a time traveler

100
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,120
 coming from the year 3000 being like, "Dude, if I have to buy this guy one more cigar, I'm done.

101
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,800
 I don't care who wins the war now." But eventually three cigars was enough to get that envelope

102
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
 noticed. But platinum, let's hop back in that Dead Rabbit Durgible, we're actually going,

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,880
 we're leaving behind old, timey America, we're coming to modern day New York City, the glitz,

104
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,520
 the glamour, the muggings, the stabbings, everything you love about New York. If you love those last

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,440
 two, you love the purge. But we're not going to purge New York. That's four years from now.

106
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,680
 We're going to modern day New York, modern day being 2018. On July 31st, 2018, we're going to hit

107
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,640
 the clubs, dude. I'm liking good. You're looking good too, dude. You lost weight. Good job. We're

108
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,000
 sitting there unless you want to put on weight and then, did you put on weight? Are you more muscular?

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,120
 Good job. Insert compliment here. And we're walking around, we're dressed in the nines.

110
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
 We're going to the hottest nightclub in town. We're dancing and stuff like that.

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,960
 We're hanging out, dancing, grooving. And we see this girl walking. We see, it's a club. There's

112
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,320
 a ton of women. But anyways, we have to focus in on this one particular girl. And we see her on

113
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,720
 her phone. She's like, swiping left. Which one's the bad one? I think swiping left means they don't

114
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,160
 like to do it on Tinder. And then they see, ooh, I match him and they do a swipe to the right. And

115
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,640
 then, and then she meets with his dude, right? So he comes into the bar and we see them dancing

116
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
 together and stuff like that. And romance is kind of cute. And then he's like this charming and

117
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,840
 successful. He's this good looking guy. He's no dead rabbit radio host. But you know, he's all

118
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,240
 right. He's all right. They go out on a date. They have a great time. They go out on another date.

119
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
 They have another great time. They go on a third date. And you know, or this is going,

120
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,360
 I can't remember the last time I waited three dates. But anyways, I guess chivalry is not dead.

121
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,440
 This gentleman waits for three dates. He invites her back to his place. So they go back to his

122
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:11,600
 place. The dancing's over. It's time for a little bit of love. Oh, my stomach, she says. Oh, what?

123
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,720
 Oh my, oh, can you give me a second? Oh, you're like, are you really going to make noises for

124
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,520
 the next five minutes? Next seven minutes, maybe. She starts pooping, right? She starts pooping. Now

125
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,280
 she's in the toilet. She's pooping everywhere. And the guy doesn't seem to really care. He's just

126
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,000
 like, okay, honey, whenever you're done. And she's like, oh my God, I don't think I've ever, I think,

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,640
 I think the eye of Cthulhu has opened up inside of me. I think this is my fate for eternity.

128
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,520
 It's okay. Just keep going. Let it come out. She eventually, there's a break. It's like the eye of

129
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,160
 the storm, right? You know, when you're that sick to your stomach, there's a short period of time

130
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,320
 where you're able to at least get up off the toilet and maybe like get some water,

131
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
 maybe some crackers before you have to go back in there. Grab your phone. Sometimes grab your

132
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,440
 tablet so you can really watch a show in there. Before she got into the bathroom, she pooped

133
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,120
 a little bit in her underwear, right? So what happened was she's like, oh, you know, I pooped.

134
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,440
 I pooped a lot. She's like three. That's how she describes it. My tummy made me poop poop.

135
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,840
 She realizes after, she realizes in that short eye of the storm period that she actually pooped

136
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,200
 her underwear. Like she wasn't able to get in the bathroom soon enough. She's like, oh, great. I'm

137
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,600
 going to smell like poop the rest of the night. So, I mean, she has better things to worry about,

138
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,960
 i.e. the storm is moving on. It's going to get bad again. The eyes almost over. But she does hop

139
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,040
 out of the bathroom for a bit, get some water. And when she comes back in her date, her Tinder date,

140
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,480
 the charming successful man, is sniffing her underwear, smelling her poop. And she runs out

141
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,960
 in horror. You can keep the underwear. I don't know how far she got before she had to knock on a

142
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,200
 neighbor's door and be like, I really, really have to go. But anyway, she runs out. Now, she tells

143
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,680
 a friend of hers, I had the worst date last night. Trust me when I say that, you're not going to be

144
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
 able to talk to me. I had the worst day last night at horrible diarrhea and the dude was smelling my

145
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,800
 dirty underwear. That in and of itself is just would be a weird new story, right? Just a weird

146
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:23,600
 new story. But apparently, this is happening all over New York City. Glasgow, Glasgow Leeds,

147
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,000
 District of Columbia. Maybe it was Robert E. Lee. Maybe it was Robert E. Lee's great descendant.

148
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,840
 He goes, if I can't take DC, I'll make him poop. I'll make all those northerners poop their pants.

149
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,480
 This guy is in all these major cities. And the story goes around and people are like, hey, listen,

150
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,920
 my sister's cousin's best friend was on Tinder. And she went on a date and her stomach started

151
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,200
 to hurt and she had to poop really bad. And then the dude was smelling her poop. And people start

152
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,960
 sharing this story all over. And it's weird because nobody has firsthand accounts of this. It's always

153
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,480
 my sister's cousin, this girl that my friend went to school with. No one will admit, which to be

154
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,160
 fair, no one's going to be like, excuse me, I was the one who pooped their pants. Please. It's always

155
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
 this back around stuff. What's interesting though is that it sounds like an urban legend. It sounds

156
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
 like a game of telephone. No one can ever point out. But people have said when you look at those

157
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,560
 cities, New York City, Glasgow Leeds in DC, they've actually thought he may have gone to school in

158
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
 Europe and then moved to the United States. He was working in finance or something like that.

159
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,360
 Maybe Harry Potter. Maybe he's like, I'm done at Hogwarts. Time to go make some people poop.

160
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,040
 But I can't you just use a magical spell. He's like, oh, I'd much rather use that.

161
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,120
 That was the thing. So using that joke as a segue, this newspaper called The Tab in the UK

162
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,280
 did an investigation on this. It was Annie Lord. She actually, because this conspiracy theory,

163
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,040
 this whatever you want to call it, has been going around basically the internet. It's basically,

164
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,720
 it sounds like a game of telephone. The story had been going around. So this journalist, Annie Lord,

165
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,520
 looks into it. She calls the police. The police are like, she actually calls the police in Leeds,

166
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,880
 is where the story first popped up. And they go, we haven't heard any cases of this.

167
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,280
 She did. The journalist also called up a sex therapist. Sex therapist goes, you know what,

168
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,400
 it actually does fit the profile of a type of guy like this. I've heard this before. One,

169
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,720
 scat fetishes are more common than you would think. It's more common than you would think.

170
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,600
 Pooping, making people poop and eating poop. Sorry. Sorry, you're eating your Jello pudding.

171
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,200
 You're like, what's this episode about? I hope it's not about poop. Jason never does poop episodes.

172
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,920
 This week, he's getting a big scoop of it. Anyways, he just melted chocolate barg

173
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,160
 with the peanuts in it. Anyways, it's very common. I've heard that before too. It's probably one of

174
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,480
 the most secretive common fetishes. You know, like people have a foot fetish. People have a hair fetish.

175
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,560
 But poop is like one of the big ones too. But people don't talk about it for a good reason. It's

176
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,000
 super disgusting, right? But anyways, so she said that's actually paid. That actually sounds like

177
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,880
 someone who has that fetish because it's not just about eating poop. It's about degrading the other

178
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,240
 person. Either you're getting pooped or sorry. Platinum piss is like, listen, I know my name

179
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,120
 kind of goes with the theme, but I didn't sign up for this. I didn't sign up for this. Sorry,

180
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,280
 Platinum. But people like to get pooped on. Not me. Don't do this to me. I don't want this to happen.

181
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,000
 Some people like to get pooped on or poop on other people. And making people poop is part of the

182
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,520
 fetish because it degrades them. So the sex therapist goes, that actually makes sense. Like,

183
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,000
 of course, there's no proof this guy actually exists. But it's interesting that it does seem to be in

184
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,480
 those four cities. And they said, like, if you had a job in finance, that might make sense.

185
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,120
 Twitter would be the perfect way because you could fake everything. You could delete accounts,

186
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,680
 things like that. And you get to take the super hot chick back to your apartment. And then she's

187
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,280
 like, oh, her stomach's super hurting. And that is part of the fetish is making her embarrassed,

188
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,000
 making her feel pain, and then eventually making her poop everywhere. It could just be an internet

189
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,920
 rumor going around too. But it does seem to go into, it does seem to be a little bit realistic. So

190
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:19,200
 if you live in one of those four cities, and you are a young woman looking for love,

191
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,960
 always make sure to swipe left if that guy bears a striking resemblance to Robert E. Lee,

192
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,960
 because it might be his descendant. Or, you know, just don't use Tinder. That's,

193
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
 I don't get it. I don't get it. I wouldn't hang out with people. I mean, obviously,

194
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
 I hang out with strangers. That's how you get to know people. But like going on a phone and like

195
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,560
 looking at people or going on the internet and looking, I've had blind dates before. I've had,

196
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,880
 actually, let me phrase it, I've had one blind date before. I think I told you that story. I tried

197
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,720
 to convince her I was like, this date sucks, but I was too nice to end it. So I told her I was a

198
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:58,080
 vampire. And she wouldn't leave. I told her that I could feel the organs shifting in my body.

199
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,280
 She wouldn't leave, dude. I was too nice. And then I told her that I had a cookie

200
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,480
 in the shape of an alien in my fridge that I was like four years old. And I talked to it.

201
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,400
 The funny part was that part of the story was true. I actually did have an alien cookie I bought

202
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,680
 us at Starbucks. It was so, so awesome. I refused to eat it. I named him Grigo, and he hung out in

203
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,280
 my fridge. And I also had a jug of milk that I bought the day I moved into that apartment.

204
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,520
 And then five years later, the jug of milk was still in there and his name was Melky.

205
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,240
 I swear Melky was sentient at some point. Probably wasn't sentient the whole five years,

206
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,480
 but at some point when that cream, oh dude, it was so gross. Did I have to say that? Do I have to

207
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,200
 have that part? You're like, no, what? I didn't think it was gross until you said that part. I

208
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,160
 thought five year old milk was totally normal as you're talking trash about someone making people

209
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
 poop. Actually, you know what? I will talk trash because I didn't make people drink that milk.

210
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,560
 Nobody drank that milk, right? I didn't make you drink that milk. I might introduce you when

211
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,440
 you came over. I'd show you Grigo and Melky, but you know what's funny? I got evicted from that

212
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,840
 apartment and I never threw out the milk. So when they came in, they probably like these people were

213
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,160
 like, oh dude, he got evicted. He's bum. And they opened up my fridge and they're like, oh,

214
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,120
 it's such a long day at work. I'm not going to check the expiration date on this milk. Glug, glug.

215
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,040
 He basically went from milk to butter to some unknown element. I'm sure some scientists in

216
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,200
 Livermore laboratories would have loved to see what was in that milk. It was his own pocket universe.

217
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,080
 So let's wave goodbye to all the lovely ladies of New York, Glasgow, DC and Leeds. We hope you never

218
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,280
 meet the man on the poop patrol. We are headed out to Russia. So platinum, let's take up this

219
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,000
 carbonic hop to reflux out to Russia. So earlier in this week, we did a story about a man who was

220
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,680
 kidnapped by aliens to work on a berry farm. He's like, I'm out of here. The only berry farm I work

221
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,880
 on is knots. And I'm not working on this one. What are you talking about? You're from Russia. You

222
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,200
 don't even know what knots berry farm is. He's like, you're right. I don't. It was just a reference. I

223
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,640
 like Snoopy. So knots berry farm. Man, that was like the second cousin of theme parks. Right? You

224
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,360
 had like Disneyland, which was like the dope one, right? That was like your cool uncle. And then you

225
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,160
 had six flags. I don't even think they're still around. That was your uncle who went to prison.

226
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,840
 And the knots berry farm was your cousin who never really made it. It's like they tried really hard.

227
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,320
 They tried really, really hard. And you saw like kind of struggle through high school and college.

228
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,280
 You're just like, oh man, I know if Barry could get his act together, he'd be really cool. But

229
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,200
 knots berry. It's knots berry farm still around. Anyways, platinum. Let's go out. We're going to

230
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,560
 Ufa Russia. It's nighttime. And there's a woman and her brother walking at night. We'll call her

231
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,040
 Mary. It's a good name, right? Mary and Joseph. That's a bad combination. Mary and her brother

232
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,680
 Hank. There's typical Russian names. Mary and Hank are walking through Ufa Russia. They're

233
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,400
 enjoying the countryside and it's a peaceful night sky. No clouds. Just a bevy of stars in front of

234
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:23,760
 them. And they see a pink star and a blue star. And they start to kind of float around and interact

235
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,400
 with each other. Now, Mary and Hank are looking at each other and they're like, that's kind of weird.

236
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,200
 Stars don't normally do that, right? But they don't really have time to process it because the stars

237
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:42,880
 begin to dance amongst each other. And then a sphere appears out of the pink star and it's coming.

238
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,600
 That vast distance in space doesn't matter. The white light coming from that pink star is getting

239
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,120
 closer and closer. It's a sphere coming down to earth. It flies down. Now it's hovering,

240
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,400
 not too far in front of them. It's hovering off the ground. And Mary, here's a voice. A voice she

241
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:14,480
 hasn't heard in three years. It's the voice of her son who's passed away. Mom, watch. Nothing will happen.

242
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,920
 Mary looks at this hovering light. She says, son, how did you know I was going to be here?

243
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,400
 You like this theater of the mind? Son, how did you know I was going to be here?

244
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,480
 And her son tells her, I knew you and uncle would be here. I just knew it.

245
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:41,760
 The sphere is so bright. It's like daytime in this glen. It's super bright. They can see

246
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,520
 everything. There's a butterfly hanging out. A bunch of crickets are waking up. It's daytime.

247
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,000
 And then her son is standing there holding flowers. Now I'm realizing this now.

248
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,720
 It doesn't say how old her son is. When I first read this, I imagined him, he was like 10 years old,

249
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,520
 right? I thought, that's weird. Not that a 10 year old is coming down from spaceship,

250
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,480
 but what I'm about to explain to you. So reading it now, I'm thinking, oh, he's an adult son.

251
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,160
 Like even when I said his voice, he's like, mama, mama, watch. Nothing will happen. I was reading

252
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,120
 it like a little boy. I'm thinking about it now more clearly. I think he's an adult son. Because

253
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,720
 when I think of sons, I think of like little kids, right? So you can choose to imagine the rest of

254
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,280
 the story as a 10 year old boy, which is how I thought of it. And I was like, what? This is weird.

255
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,760
 Or you can imagine it as what it probably was. So this woman, her son is standing there and please

256
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,640
 wear an Oshkosh be gosh. She's like, Stuart, get away. Anyway, started to ruin the emotional impact

257
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,920
 of the story. Her dead son is now standing in front of her and he's holding a bouquet of flowers.

258
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,200
 The mom is super touched. And then a woman steps out of the sphere holding a little baby,

259
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,160
 little baby. And the son goes, this is our child emotions to the little baby,

260
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,320
 the little daughter that the woman's holding again. I thought he was 10. I was like, that's

261
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,520
 I honestly thought that I was like, why? And I was thinking, is it like time travel?

262
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,640
 Like I know I've totally ruined the emotion of this story. I was thinking, why is a 10 year old

263
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,720
 have a little baby? Why is he married to this adult woman? And I remember thinking, well, you know,

264
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,800
 because he's a space. Space. It's like time travel. For whatever reason, I didn't comprehend an adult

265
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,520
 son dying three years ago. For some reason, I thought I was a kid. Makes far more sense if he's in his

266
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:49,760
 20s, right? And he's 10 year old, if a dead 10 year old showed up in front of his mom and goes,

267
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,720
 this is my adult wife and this is our baby. The mom's going to be like, you have some spleying to

268
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,840
 do. So I think what's an adult son? Anyways, man, I totally plan this to be super emotional.

269
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,840
 Anyways, forget I said any of this. There's an adult son. He goes, mom, nothing will happen. And

270
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,920
 then she's like, what? And then he hops out. We replay the events and he's standing there,

271
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,800
 strapping young lad. And he goes, this is our child points to the little girl. And then the woman

272
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 and the child disappear and then three dudes walk out of the light too. And they're all wearing

273
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,720
 these sparkly clothes. And the son goes, and these are my friends. These are my age appropriate

274
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,600
 friends. These are the old men that I'm hanging out with. I am an adult man as well. I just died

275
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,960
 a couple of years ago. And the mom's like super happy. And then the woman and the child reappear

276
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,920
 and now they're both dressed in super blue sparkly clothes. And the son goes, goodbye, mother. Goodbye,

277
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:54,560
 uncle. I love you guys. You guys like totally rock. And then a cold wind snaps through the area.

278
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,200
 The sphere disappears. And then they look up and they see the blue and the pink star

279
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:08,000
 dance a little bit longer and then they fade from view. Despite the fact, despite the fact,

280
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,920
 I botched that because I thought it was a 10 year old boy. I do think that's a really

281
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,280
 interesting story. One, I mean, talk about the peace that mother must have felt. One, knowing that

282
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,840
 knowing that her son was not 10. That'd be the first thing, right? She's like, that's weird. He

283
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,560
 died in his 20s. Why did he appear as a 10 year old wearing suspenders and not should be gosh.

284
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,800
 That'd be her first sign. Secondly, that even though her son died, which must be the most tragic

285
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,680
 thing, that scares me the most about having kids. One, there are a lot of money to the take a ton

286
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:46,080
 of your time. And three, I can't. Oh my God, I don't have a kid and it paralyzes me with fear,

287
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,840
 the idea of losing a kid. And I don't have one. That'd be like me going, I hope I never lose

288
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,320
 my switch. I don't own a switch. I care less. But like, I can't imagine holding something.

289
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,240
 Like if I lost it, for whatever reason, this podcast disappeared tomorrow, I'd be like, well,

290
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,120
 it was a fun ride. You know, I can't do it no more, but it was awfully fun. It was cool thing

291
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,040
 about some cool people. I'd move on with my life. I can't imagine holding a child.

292
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,160
 And then like losing it someday. Oh my God, I can't imagine that.

293
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:30,160
 And so the piece that this mother must have felt to see her son again in the flesh.

294
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:38,000
 It's an interesting story. I think that there is a big crossover between a lot of people have the

295
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,200
 theory that you know, like the aliens are actually demons and stuff like that. And I don't know if

296
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
 I've done an episode on that. I've mentioned it before. I think it's pretty common conspiracy

297
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,840
 theory. I don't think that's why I've done an episode on it specifically. I've talked about it

298
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 before, but I think there probably is just like we're seeing through the course of the show,

299
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,760
 there's a big connection between Bigfoot and aliens. We've done a lot of episodes on that.

300
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,120
 I think there might be a connection between aliens and spirituality in general. I think the world

301
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,080
 of paranormal, we try to divide it up with ghost hunters and UFO hunters and Bigfoot hunters and

302
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,480
 stuff like that. Demonologists. But it's possible that they're just far more connected than we could

303
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,400
 ever really know. And whether or not this was a visitation of angels that took the form of

304
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:26,800
 extraterrestrial visitors, whether or not this was a simply ghostly activity that took the form

305
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,200
 of UFO visitors. We have to say it's possible that it was demons trying to fool the family and

306
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,720
 taking the form of her. I don't believe that's the case, but you know, there would be people who would

307
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:42,000
 have that scenario as well. But I think it's a very, again, despite the fact that I got the ages

308
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,440
 wrong in my head, I think it's a very touching story. And even if the child was, even if the child

309
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,640
 was, the way I was reading it was that her son died when he was younger, and this was her showing

310
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,400
 that even in the afterlife, life continues. He was able, even though he, this is how I imagined it,

311
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,280
 even though he had died when he was younger, he'd still been able to fulfill his life,

312
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,800
 getting married, having children himself and stuff like that. She was seeing him as a younger being,

313
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,240
 but he had matured in the afterlife. That's how I read it. But again, now saying it out loud,

314
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,280
 I think he was an adult when he died. It was just this weird thing. But again, when I think,

315
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,120
 I don't even like thinking about children passing away, but for whatever reason, I couldn't imagine

316
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,080
 like an adult passing away, a son passing away. When I hear that term, I always think of children

317
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,800
 and it just rips my heart out. I can't imagine. I hate, that's one of the, actually one of the

318
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,920
 things I hate about doing this podcast is the amount of stuff I read. I just read sometimes

319
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:47,520
 some horrible articles, just stuff that, real sad stuff. I try to avoid it at this point in my life.

320
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,640
 When I was younger, you know, you'd be like, oh, let's watch this crazy Syrian war footage and stuff

321
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,440
 like that. And you get to a point where you're just like, it's just, just reading headlines sometimes.

322
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,760
 You just, I can't imagine having to go through that. So the idea that a mother could find peace,

323
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:11,520
 that her mother could see that her son died, but the life didn't end. He got married and had a kid

324
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,280
 and the afterlife he's making friends. He's still able to visit her, not only visit her, but he knows

325
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:25,120
 where she's at. Even if she never saw him again after that, just the idea of having proof that

326
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,840
 not only is there an afterlife, but you continue to grow and live and be happy in this afterlife is

327
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,640
 incredibly peaceful. Incredibly peaceful moment. So I wanted to share that story with you. I want,

328
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:49,200
 I honestly believe that in death, there is a continuation of life. And the passing of us from

329
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,600
 being alive to being dead is similar to us being born. When we're in the womb, the only

330
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:03,280
 universe we know is the womb. It's all we know. We may hear sounds and feelings and hear voices.

331
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,360
 Music we can't really describe as we're in the womb. We don't know what's going on. All we know

332
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,160
 is the womb. And then we come out and everything's colorful and loud and bright. We have these new

333
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:23,360
 sensations. We have taste. We have touch, sight and sound. I think that's what it's like when you die.

334
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,720
 Like you can't, we're in the womb. This is simply another womb. We can't comprehend what it's like

335
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,800
 outside the womb that we're in. And it may be scary. It's very scary, I think, to think this is all

336
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,640
 there is, but just like a child in a womb thinks this is all there is. This is my whole reality.

337
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,960
 And those nine months or its entire existence, it can't comprehend anything outside the womb.

338
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,600
 We're basically just infants. And when we pass from this life to the next,

339
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:03,280
 we're reborn into a reality we couldn't even comprehend. I truly believe that. I truly believe

340
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,760
 that. So I hope that gives, it gives me peace. I hope it gives you guys peace as well to know that

341
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,880
 death is not the ending. It's just the beginning of another adventure. We're being born into a new

342
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,680
 reality. Maybe it's as simple as being reincarnated back onto this earth as a new consciousness.

343
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:34,480
 Or maybe it's something we couldn't even begin to comprehend. But either way, I believe life continues.
