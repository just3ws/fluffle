1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 After a string of murders in Russia, local authorities have to ask the question,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 are they hunting a man, or are they hunting a monster?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And then we take a look at a man who believes that women's boobs have gotten bigger over the last 10 years.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 He's puzzled, he can't figure out why.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Is it possible that the combined willpower of all men on Earth is magically enlarging the boobs of women today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I actually have a root canal scheduled this week, so I'm getting my episodes done early,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 so I don't have to be trying to do this while my tooth is bleeding.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I don't think that's how they do it.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I've had tons of root canals.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I've never left the dentist's office and I clean up the blood on your way home.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 They're usually pretty good.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Speaking of pretty good, now just kidding, this guy's great.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 It's our newest Patreon supporter walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Everyone give it up for James Farrah.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Everyone give a big round of applause.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 He's walking in, shaking his head.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 He's like, "That's nice.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Bring out my name."

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Well, it's the best.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It's the best I got.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 James, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Just tell your friends, tell your family we've got flyers in the show notes you can print out.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Pass out around town.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 All of that stuff really, really helps out a lot.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Now James, I'm going to toss you the hair hang glider.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 We're going to take a nice leisurely cruise all the way from Dead Rabbit Command out to Chalabinsky, Russia.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 James is shaking his head.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 He's like, "That's not how you pronounce that either."

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 He's like, "I don't know how to pronounce it, but I'm pretty sure you've pronounced it wrong."

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Well, just keep gliding us out to Chalabinsky, Russia.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 He's like, "Dude, I can't go to the place if you can't pronounce the place."

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 I'll just point, I'll just keep pointing until we get there.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I found the story online, so I want to give a shout out to Rustmanchik228.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Did a really good write up on this, so thank you very much.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I had never heard of this story. It's a pretty recent story, so be scared.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 This might still be going on.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We get to Chalabinsky, Russia.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 It's May 26, 2011, 5.30 p.m.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And at 34 Linden Avenue, there's a pharmacy called the Klassika Pharmacy.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 It's a chain of pharmacies in Russia.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And inside, everyone's just going about their business.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 The pharmacist is like putting drugs and bottles,

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 and there's like some mom looking at Get Well cards, and there's like some kids.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 There's some kids pushing each other into the pill crusher.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 They're like, "Ah, Billy, no."

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 But as Billy is being ground up and turned into little pills,

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 what's actually going on?

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's not the true crime story.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 It's not about that would be hilarious though.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But no, what happens is a young man enters the Klassika Pharmacy.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Ding, ding, ding, ding.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 The little doorbell goes off, and he walks in.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 People kind of really aren't paying attention to him,

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 but they describe him as being a young man with thick glasses.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 He has pretty thick glasses on, and he's wearing a medical mask.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 A little black baseball cap.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 He's holding a black bag as he walks in.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Now, nowadays, someone walking around in a medical mask,

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 you wouldn't think anything if they were walking into a pharmacy.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 But in 2011, that was weird, right?

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 You didn't really see a lot of people wearing medical masks.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And he's holding in one hand a black bag,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 and in the other hand, a gun.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 So people are like, "I don't know what a protectionist he's picking up,

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 but this is not going to end well."

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And sure enough, it doesn't.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He immediately begins, what they say is he starts throwing out Hollywood movie quotes.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He's saying like, "Everyone put your hands in the air!

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Coppers, get down on the ground!

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Hostel Avista, baby!"

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 The police reported it as it sounded like he had watched so much action movies

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and was kind of emulating them.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 He begins robbing the people.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 He wants all the money out of the registers,

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 plus all the jewelry and the money from the people in the store.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 He's walking around, he's robbing them.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 During the course of this robbery, ding, ding, ding, ding,

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 two more people walk into the store, and he turns his gun on them.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 "Give me your money, give me your cash.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 There's like a box of chocolates there.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Like what is going on?"

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So he starts robbing these people too.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And then, ding, ding, ding, ding,

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Vladimir Shin, a 49-year-old man, also walks into this pharmacy.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It's 5.30 in the evening, this is a busy pharmacy.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He walks in and he sees this guy pointing the gun at him and he goes,

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 "Don't move!"

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So Vladimir decides to do the opposite thing and move and run out of the store.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 [Bang]

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 [Groan]

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Vladimir falls to the ground, clutching his wound.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 He says he's falling, he's grabbing medicine off the shelf and swallowing it.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 "Oh, this will help me."

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 The robber runs out of the store.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Unfortunately, Vladimir dies.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 He is shot in the chest, he dies.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And the police show up and they're investigating this

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 and they get a description of the guy and the people there,

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 because he was robbing them, he's there for probably a couple of minutes, right?

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 He's robbing these people.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And the description is what I said, baseball cap, medical mask,

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 but they also said he was a hundred...

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I love Europeans because they measure themselves in centimeters,

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 which make them all sound like lily-pusheons, right?

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 It makes them all sound like tiny little people.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 They described him as 180 centimeters tall.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I don't ever describe myself in centimeters.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 He's 180 centimeters tall, no matter how many, it makes you sound super tiny.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Which comes out in real numbers.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He's five foot nine and they said he was pimply

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 and the cops are like writing it down and they're like, "No."

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Like super pimply and the cops are like, "Okay, super pimply."

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And they're like, "No, no, no, no, no, that's even more pimply than you're imagining."

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Super extra-duper pimply and the cops are like, "Uh, okay."

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Super duper extra-pimply.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 You have to be pretty pimply if you walk in with a gun

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and you're shooting people and that's what they remember about you,

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 or the pimples.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 The cops can't figure this out, right?

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I mean, they just figure it must be a robbery that gone wrong

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 and he shot this poor dude who was just coming in to pick up a prescription.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 And they had had some other robberies in two neighboring cities.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Not even to be exact, the guy was running around

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 and he was robbing these people, but it was two separate cities

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 and they go, "It might be the same thing,"

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 but they started testing forensics and kind of looking around and they go,

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 "It's probably not the same guy like this. Maybe it's a copycat?"

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 This guy walks into this Classica pharmacy and robs a bunch of people and kills a man.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 August 10th, 2011, so just a couple months later,

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 at 45 Linnon Avenue, there's another Classica pharmacy.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It's 5.30 p.m.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Igor Yustinov is a 30-year-old man and he drove out to pick his girlfriend up from work

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and while he's sitting in this parking lot, he goes,

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 "You know what? I need to get some medicine. I need to go just pick up some stuff from the pharmacy."

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 I know, I'll walk to that Classica pharmacy and go check it out.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 So he walks into the pharmacy, gets his stuff, gets like some Tylenol or whatever,

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 and as he's leaving, he almost bumps into a guy coming into the store,

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 a man wearing a black baseball cap, medical mask, holding a black bag,

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 and the shotgun this time.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 The first time, it didn't specify what type of gun, so I didn't want to assume it was a shotgun,

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 the second one, it specifies that he has a shotgun.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 He walks in with his shotgun and Igor's about to leave.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 This guy walks in, they look at each other for a second,

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 and then the man puts the shotgun right up to Igor's stomach and just pulls the trigger.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Just shoots Igor completely unprovoked.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Igor falls to the ground, clutching his stomach.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 The dude racks in another shell of the shotgun,

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 shoots into the pharmacy just randomly and then runs back out.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 The people in the pharmacy don't know what to make of this,

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 some of them run out of the store, so they might see you later, dude, I'm out.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Other people ran to Igor to help him, I mean, it's a stomach wound,

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 and they're trying to staunch the bleeding,

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and some of them are just kind of standing around in shock.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And 15 seconds go by.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And in those 15 seconds, when he had people running out of the store,

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 you had people trying to help him,

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 once this maniac leaves, you have Igor on the ground, clutching his stomach,

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 everyone in the pharmacy is in a state of shock,

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 and 15 seconds pass.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And while that time is passing, while they're huddled around Igor,

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 who's right by the front door, because he was just trying to walk out

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 when this all happened, these 15 seconds pass, no one thinks,

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 "Oh, that guy might come back, that lunatic who just opened fire might come back,

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 we should lock the door."

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Because 15 seconds later, that door opens, ding-ling-ling,

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 and in comes the maniac.

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 "Where is he?" the man shouts,

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and he begins walking through the pharmacy with the shotgun,

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and he goes into the back room of the pharmacy.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 At this point, people are like, "Igor, we're out, we gotta get out of here,

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 people are running out of the pharmacy, some are trying to stay with Igor,

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 other people are trying to find hiding spaces,

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 this guy is walking around the pharmacy with the shotgun, he's screaming out,

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 "Where is he?"

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And then after he gets done searching the back rooms, he comes back out,

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 sees Igor on the ground.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 He checks to see if Igor is still alive,

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 and then realizing that Igor is still breathing,

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 shoots him multiple times in the head, point blank with the shotgun.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 [imitates shotgun shooting]

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 What's weird about this is that as he's shooting this dude in the brain,

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 killing Igor, people are cowering in fear,

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 and he's yelling out, "It's your fault! It's your fault!"

189
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 People are like, "What?"

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 "It's all your fault! It's your fault, white coats!"

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Just annihilates this dude's dome, just splatters him all over the pharmacy floor.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Multiple shotgun blasts, as this dude is lying down, you're all eating spaghettios,

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 you're like, "Damn it, Jason, you're eating spaghettios out of pharmacy right now!"

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 You're like, "I don't know why I'm doing this, but I sure am hungry, I'm gonna listen to this podcast."

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He totally lays this dude out, right?

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And he's yelling, "It's all your fault! It's all your fault, white coats!"

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 And people are like, "What the hell?"

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And he runs out again, and at this point there's a massive manhunt.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 The police feel really, really...

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It's like this dude is murdering people randomly in broad daylight.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 It's making them look like a bunch of chumps.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 They're trying to find this guy out, and they don't even know what the motive is.

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 This one, there was no robbery, like he came in with a black bag.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 But he didn't rob anyone.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 He just shot this dude, and people started thinking, "Is this some sort of like assassination?

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Is this some sort of gangland hit?"

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And he's killing random people leading up for his real target.

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Is someone actually... 'Cause now you have two classical pharmacies hit in the same city,

209
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 on the same street, Lennon Avenue.

210
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Is this some sort of grief against the owner of the classical chain?

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 They're checking out all of this stuff they can't figure it out, and...

212
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 He's never been caught.

213
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 The classical killer, or the pharmacy murderer, is what they call him.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I guess they don't want to have their brand name in it.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 But the classical killer has murdered two people at random,

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 in these classical pharmacies in 2011, and he's never been caught.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And you go, "Jason, that's weird. I mean, like, that's a local crime story, right?

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 A couple people get killed in a city.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 That's a... it's sad, right?"

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 He did ruin my spaghetti-o-meal, but is that dead rabbit radio worthy?

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Right? Well, here's the twist on it.

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Here's what I was thinking when I was reading this, right?

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So the first version, the first time he showed up at the pharmacy,

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 they said he was covered in pimples.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 He was so pimply that when he walked around with his shotgun, that's what they remembered.

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But the second time, a couple months later, so the first attack happened in May.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 This attack happened in August.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 This time, when he walks in, he's wearing the black baseball cap,

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 he's wearing the glasses and the medical mask,

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 his skin was no longer pimply.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 It was yellow.

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 His skin had turned yellow, and his face was very gaunt and thin.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And he wasn't wearing gloves.

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 So as he's walking around, he's in the store, you know, pretty briefly,

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 as opposed to doing all the robbery, but he's running back and forth, looking for people in the back.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 They could tell his hands were yellow, too.

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And one of them had this huge abscess on it.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Just like this giant open wound on his hand.

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And they said when they looked at him, they looked him in the eyes.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 He had "terrible eyes."

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So like big, big bulbous red eyes.

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 "Bleugh! Where are they?"

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 "It's all your fault, white coats!"

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 [gibberish]

245
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Running out of the place. They didn't actually have the quote of him going "Bleugh!"

246
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But here's what I was thinking, dude.

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I go, "Okay, the cops are looking for a man, a maniac."

248
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But what if?

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 This is my theory.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 That this assailant, this murderer, was a normal guy.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 This guy is slowly turning into some sort of monster.

253
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Because the first time, like, I'm assuming, I'm just kind of thinking,

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 maybe in Russia he was subjected to some sort of treatment.

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 He goes into a classic of pharmacy and he's there to pick up his Viagra.

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And they're like, "Well, you know, if you want $500, you can be a guinea pig for this new medicine."

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure. Do I still get my Viagra?"

258
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And so he's like, became some sort of guinea pig, right?

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And he's like, wakes up one day and he's like, "Ahh! My face!"

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And these pimples are just growing out of his skin.

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 He's like, "Ahh!"

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 It's like prom night all over again.

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And then, but he's like, "Oh, this totally sucks."

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And then, he, like, wears a baseball cap because he has a giant pimple on the top of his head.

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 It's like a little cone head he has.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 He has a baseball cap.

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 And then he wears the medical mask to kind of hide more pimples.

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And then he realizes, you know what?

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 This sucks.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Like, the medical establishment has turned me into this monster.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I have all these pimples.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And pimples aren't that bad.

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 You can take Claricellar and don't even worry about him and they'll go away.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 But for him, he couldn't deal with it.

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So he went and robbed these people.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 He's like, "Maybe they have the cure.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Maybe the cure is in women's purses."

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 So he goes in the classical pharmacy and he was robbing people and then he shoots that guy.

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And then whatever happened to him continued to mutate him into some sort of man beast.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 So the next time they saw him, months later, he was yellow and like his skin was falling off.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And he had terrible eyes.

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 He's like, "Ahh!"

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And he's shooting people.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And he's like a monster.

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 So they can't find him now because now he's like ripped off all his clothes and he's running through the wilderness of Russia.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And his arm is morphed into a sawed-off shotgun.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And the other hand, it's just a black bag with an open abscess on it.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 I don't know.

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Like, obviously I have no facts to back that up.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 There's no way that the Russian authorities would take me seriously.

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 But I think he was going after the classical pharmacies and I think he was probably dying and/or mutating into some sort of man beast.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Because it would take a...

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 I would assume your health isn't that good if you have pimples in May and you're yellow in August and you have giant abscesses on your hand.

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I would assume you're not in the best of health.

296
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So what if they did do some sort of mutation experiment on him and now he's getting back out of the world?

297
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And it's possible that he, after he murdered the second guy, he found a cure.

298
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He's just like, "Oh, this is where I left the cure at home."

299
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And he stopped murdering people or the Russian authorities may say, "Well, we never found him.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 It's an unself-case, but maybe they didn't get him and he's like locked in some laboratory right now."

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 He's strapped down.

302
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 He's like, "It's all your fault. White coats is there injecting him with more medicine."

303
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 They're like, "Let's see if we can make him blue."

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 "Science has proved that we can make him yellow. Let's try to make him blue."

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I'm going to say this, though.

306
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 The first, I read this article a couple of times, the first time when it said he had terrible eyes at the ending.

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I figured like his eyes were like bulging out of his head and they're like bleeding.

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And the second time I read it, I go, "Well, maybe they're not like bulging out. Maybe they're just like yellowed eyes too."

309
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And then when I read it the third time, I thought, "Well, maybe it's just because he had thick glasses."

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Maybe the term "terrible eyes" doesn't necessarily mean "monster eyes."

311
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Because then the first time they mentioned how thick his glasses were, and the second story, and they said,

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 "Well, he had terrible eyes. It could have just meant, yeah, officer, he had really thick glasses."

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But still doesn't explain turning yellow and having the abscess.

314
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 He probably was melting or dying of something.

315
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 It's all your fault. White coats.

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 You know, Igor was not a doctor. Igor was like an engineer or something like that.

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Neither of the two people were doctors, but it would make sense if the medical community was experimenting on this guy,

318
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 that he would take it out on the pharmacy.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So will they ever catch this guy? He might be a puddle of yellow ooze in the sewer long ago,

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 just decayed into a bubbling mass of protein.

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Still sentient, crawling through eating rats.

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He could be sitting in a government laboratory.

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 It's most likely that he's just a maniac, just a normal person, but who knows?

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Creepy story, right? No one likes getting shot in the stomach when they go to a pharmacy.

325
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I don't think that's anyone's fetish.

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 James, James is all blushy. He's like, "That's my fetish."

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 James Farah, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonar copter.

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 We are leaving behind Russia.

329
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 We are headed all the way out to a strip club.

330
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 [imitates strip club]

331
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 I think the idea, I've talked about this all the time on the show,

332
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 to me the scariest thing is to turn it into something I don't want to turn into.

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Like, someone injected me with something and it started turning me yellow.

334
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 That would suck, dude.

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I know there's that stuff called D&P. Have you guys ever heard of that?

336
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 It's something that fitness people use.

337
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 But even fitness, it's like, you take it.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's really popular on the fitness boards and stuff like that.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 It's like a super underground, illegal diet supplement.

340
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I think I've mentioned it before on the show, but you take it and it turns the heat up in your body.

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 It's actually like jet fuel cleaner or something like that.

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It has some industrial use.

343
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It's like used to scrape the pain off of stealth fighters or something like that.

344
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I don't remember, but D&P, if a human takes it and they are very, very clear,

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 this is not for human consumption, what it does is it raises your internal body temperature

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 so it burns off fat incredibly quickly.

347
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And it's so toxic, like when you take it, like you can't drink on it because you'll just die.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 There's a lot of stuff. If you do too much of it, you die.

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 If you do it with like anything else, you basically do it and do anything but sit in a chair,

350
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 you're going to overheat and die.

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And you'll see, they don't talk about it as much anymore.

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I think you get banned for talking about it on the fitness boards nowadays.

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 But D&P, I used to see it a lot and it's like this yellow substance and it stains.

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 It like will stain your skin. You have to be very, very careful about it.

355
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Now, I remember reading one story this guy said, this is horrible.

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 This guy said that he was taking D&P and you just lose weight, just burns your weight off, right?

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 You're just, your metabolism is so high and you just heat up.

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 He said, yeah, I was taking D&P. I don't know if this is an herbal edgern or not,

359
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 but this guy said this was real. He posted this.

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 He goes, I was on D&P and, you know, it stains everything.

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And this is going to get not family friendly for a moment.

362
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I was having sex with this girl that I just picked up from a bar and when I was done,

363
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 like before I was done, I pulled out and I ejaculated all over her.

364
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 It was yellow. It was like, he was so infused with D&P.

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 His semen was yellow and she started freaking out and he ejaculated all over her chest and her stomach.

366
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And he left, he ran out and him and the other people on the board were like, dude, she will be yellow.

367
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 She will be yellow forever. Like you won't be, it'll be like years before she's able to get out this huge yellow stain on her skin.

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Super, super toxic. So this is not, this is not an endorsement of this, but yeah, turning yellow, it's possible if you do D&P, don't do it.

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 If you have a Burt fetish, which one's the yellow one, Burt?

370
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Anyways, yeah, turning into stuff against your will is super spooky.

371
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So that's what scares me about that story. Also, you know, also getting shot randomly is pretty terrifying too.

372
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Before the break, before I went on break, we did a live Patreon livestream episode, which they get to hear the episodes first and they get to hear them as I'm recording them.

373
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 And I was having a discussion with a longtime supporter of the show, Cantillians.

374
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And we were kind of just talking, we were all talking to the group, but Cantillians brought this up and he brought up an interesting thing.

375
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He goes, you know, when we talk about tulpas, when we talk about law of attraction, that's where you believe that you already have the success and the material things you want.

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And then they come to you because the universe bends to your will. It's not the other way.

377
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 He goes, how does that fit into the world of the, or the many worlds of the multiverse?

378
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Imagine if you're using the law of attraction that's not working for you.

379
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Is it possible there is a alternate version of Jason that is getting all that you wish for? Very, very fascinating question.

380
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 How would something like the law of attraction work in a multiverse?

381
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And very, yeah, the interesting thing about law of attraction, I always say is law of attraction will work for people who don't even know they're using the law of attraction.

382
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And that's always a question like how are some people successful without using the law of attraction?

383
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Like luckily people are successful a lot of times just through hard work and grit, but some people just seem to be lucky.

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And is it possible that someone, them in an alternate universe is doing the law of attraction is bleeding over?

385
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 That's one of those questions I don't really have an answer for.

386
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And it's something that I don't think anyone has an answer for.

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 But it's an interesting question nonetheless, because when we talk about law of attraction, we talk about tulpas.

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 What we're talking about is bending the universe to our will.

389
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Tulpa, you're actually creating a construct out of nothingness.

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 You're using your own mental power to create another being, another living creature.

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 It may be a voice in your head, it may be someone walking around your room, it may be an armless and legless cartoon character like we covered on a past episode screaming in your bedroom.

392
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 But interesting question nonetheless.

393
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I was looking at the export the other day, like I said yesterday the export has been putting out some pretty cool stuff recently.

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 This one I don't know if this classifies as cool, but it was definitely a unique, very unique conspiracy theory.

395
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 We're sitting in the strip club, we're sitting at Centerfolds in Sacramento, paying $5 for a soda.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Just hanging out.

397
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And as we're sitting back watching these performers on stage,

398
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I turn to you and I say, I didn't make this up, I didn't make this up when reading this, someone else said this, but quote,

399
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 "Guys, have you noticed that nowadays girls have much bigger breasts than ten years ago?"

400
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And when I read that online, I thought now whatever comes after this statement is bound to be interesting.

401
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 There's this guy online who has this theory.

402
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 He says, "Back in 2010, boobs were flatter."

403
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 In fact, a D cup was considered a big boob.

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It wasn't considered the average.

405
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 You'd say maybe B or C was the average, but nowadays, he says nowadays, D cup would be considered average size.

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And he says, quote, "For example," and he shows a picture of an Instagram model named Coral Sharon.

407
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I don't know who she is.

408
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Coral Sharon in 2018 on the left, and here's a picture of her in 2021. Why are her boobs bigger?

409
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Now this woman is an Instagram model.

410
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 She's a professional model.

411
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 She's a bit of a mystery in and of herself.

412
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 She's a professional model.

413
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I did go to Instagram to do some additional research.

414
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 She's a model, but her account is private and she's only posted 34 pictures.

415
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 That's weird for a model, right?

416
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 But anyways, I don't know.

417
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 2018, here's a picture of her in 2021, and the links are in the show notes as well, guys, if you want to do your own research.

418
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Why is the boobs bigger?

419
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Now, obviously, a rational person, that's the end of the question, right?

420
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 A rational person would turn to this guy and go, "Booob job," right?

421
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Booob job, boob lift, right?

422
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 You don't necessarily have to have more put in there.

423
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 You don't even have to go that extreme, right?

424
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Padding, push-up bras, everything like that, right?

425
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Bras are just such an illusion, right?

426
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Whenever you take a girl home, you're like, "That's not what I expected."

427
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Everything changes when they're removed from the bras and the push-up, but whatever, at that point, you don't care.

428
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 But you would say that, if someone goes, "Here's a picture of her in 2018," I would say,

429
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 "Well, it's probably she's wearing a different bra," or if not that, she's a professional model.

430
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 She probably has gotten a tuck and a lift and-- or she's gone up a size.

431
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 His ideas are this. He has four possible options.

432
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Spoiler alert, none of them are boob job or padded bra.

433
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Number one, more chemicals in the food.

434
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 This is a really common thing.

435
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Estrogen in the water supply is causing girls boobs to get bigger.

436
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And there is-- I can't say that the science is conclusive on this stuff,

437
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 but I've seen this stuff in the mainstream corporate media, right?

438
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Estrogen in the water.

439
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Hormones in the milk, growth hormones in the cow being put into the milk and the milk going into the kids,

440
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 is causing weight gain in general and early development for young women as well from the hormones.

441
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But at this point, Coral Shannon, I don't know how old she is.

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I'm assuming she's probably in her mid to early 20s.

443
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I don't know how much milk you could drink at this point to change anything,

444
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 but is it possible that that's-- and he's using her as an example.

445
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 He does post several pictures of women saying,

446
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 "Here's a picture of the same girl 10 years ago. Look how big her boobs have gotten."

447
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 The second one was law of attraction, and I think what he means by this is,

448
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 the woman herself actually wishing her boobs get bigger

449
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 and calling upon the powers of the universe for bigger boobs

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 and spending the time and the mental effort and existing mentally in a world where her boobs are already bigger,

451
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 and then the universe rewards her with what she already believes.

452
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 That's possible, again, like the estrogen hormone argument.

453
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It's possible, again, though it's much easier to drop $3,000 and get a boob job than to just go through this.

454
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And if you're a professional model, just like you're a professional anything,

455
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 you're going to keep upping your game to stay in the industry.

456
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 But anyways, law of attraction are women mentally making their boobs bigger.

457
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Then he has the most interesting one, and the one that piqued my interest,

458
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 and the one that made me want to do this segment.

459
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 What if the collective willpower of humanity, of men in particular,

460
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 are making women's boobs get bigger?

461
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 It's not the women themselves using the law of attraction, but it's all of the men.

462
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Because he says, "What we're seeing is we're seeing normal women."

463
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He only has Instagram models, by the way. He's not posting pictures of Jackie down at the store,

464
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 which is fine. I don't want to see that. He's been stalking her for 10 years,

465
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 but he's using Instagram models, but his idea is we're now seeing normal women, everyday women,

466
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 have boobs the size of porn stars.

467
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And maybe it's because so many people are watching porn,

468
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 and they're focusing on the boobs that they've created this rift in reality.

469
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So imagine if you put on a VR headset, and don't do this, by the way.

470
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I can't imagine anything worse for your mind, body, or soul,

471
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 but imagine if you put on a VR headset and watch nothing but porn for, let's say, like a week.

472
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 You're trying to eat, you can't find your mouth, you're finding other holes,

473
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 but you're watching porn on this VR headset for a week,

474
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 and then you take them off. Your reality would be completely distorted, right?

475
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 I don't think anyone would want to be around you. You take them off, you're in a jail cell,

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 you're like, "Ah, that's what I expected. I don't know what happened in the past week.

477
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I sure did something awful."

478
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 But you take off the VR headset, and you have now warped reality so much

479
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 that the women you interact with, their boobs are bigger too.

480
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And that's an extreme example, right?

481
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 That's like if one person lived in reality where all the girls had big boobs.

482
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Would he...

483
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 This is so ridiculous. It's like one of those topics.

484
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 I had an easier time talking about furries being reincarnated werewolves yesterday.

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 You take off the headset, and you've now created a new reality.

486
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But it's not even that. That'd be for one man, but imagine every man wants bigger boobs.

487
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Every man... That's not true, but let's just say like 80% of mankind wants bigger boobs,

488
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 and they're thinking about bigger boobs, and they mentally demand bigger boobs,

489
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 and it's warping reality. It's like a global level spell.

490
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And that's what's making women's boobs increase.

491
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And the interesting thing about the law of attraction, it's not.

492
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I want to be the number one podcaster.

493
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I'm going to think about being the number one podcaster all the time.

494
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And then one day I wake up and my stats are at... I have a million downloads a day.

495
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Right? The law of attraction can work that way.

496
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But how the law of attraction really works is I want to be the number one podcaster.

497
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I want to be the number one podcaster, and I'm putting that out into the universe.

498
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And what happens is the universe puts things in motion, which allows that to happen.

499
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 They get someone to watch the show, and that person is an influencer,

500
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 and they start tweeting it, and then other influencers start doing it.

501
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And then you guys actually do go out and tell your friends and family about it.

502
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And I'm putting out my goal, but the mechanism to get to that goal could be very, very complicated.

503
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 We could all as a collective group want bigger boobs,

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 and it doesn't mean that a woman's going to wake up the next day and be like,

505
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 "What happened to these bazoonga? What happened? I got bazoongas now."

506
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 It's that the universe starts to make breasts implants cheaper,

507
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 so more women can afford them, or insurance, medical insurance starts paying for them, or something like that.

508
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 It doesn't have to be a magical bridge to that result. Does that make sense?

509
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 They don't have to magically grow.

510
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Through the law of attraction, you could want something so much that then you want a great car.

511
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 It doesn't mean one day you're going to walk outside, there's going to be a 2022 Ford Mustang convertible sitting in your friend yard.

512
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 By putting that in a chain of events has started that you will get that.

513
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Maybe you'll get a better paying job where you can afford that car.

514
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Maybe a friend of yours will buy two of them and want to give you one. Who knows?

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 But that's how the law of attraction works.

516
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 So, it wouldn't necessarily be that the boobs were growing.

517
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 It still may require, through this shape-shifting of reality, that it makes it cheaper,

518
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 or more women are willing to have their skin cut open and have silicone pushed inside.

519
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 It doesn't sound pleasant at all. Boob jobs don't sound pleasant at all.

520
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 What's interesting about this, though, is that we...

521
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 There is a little bit of...

522
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 "Proof" is a big word. "Proof" is a big word, right?

523
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I am... When I was reading this, I thought there has been a huge shift when I was growing up, no one had big butts.

524
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 No one had big butts in the 80s. No one really had big butts in the 90s, either.

525
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And now, big butts are all the rage.

526
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Models got to have big butts.

527
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Dancers and singers, they got to have the big butts, right? Female, right?

528
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 We're not worried about Michael Jackson's buttocks.

529
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 But as far as, like, that has become a thing.

530
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And again, is that because there's been a shift in the culture

531
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 and women are more proud about showing off their curves

532
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 and they're not trying to give those workout tapes by Fonda?

533
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Or is it that the collective willpower of humanity has reshaped women's buttocks?

534
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 It's very... On the face of it, it's so goofy and such a ridiculous statement,

535
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 and it can be answered very easily.

536
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Women are getting boob jobs. That's why boobs are big.

537
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 If they're bigger at all, like, there's no steadies.

538
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 He doesn't provide any steadies. He's just showing photographs, whether they're bigger at all.

539
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And on the face of it, it's just kind of an open shut case.

540
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It is an interesting question when we talk about...

541
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Because we talk about people heightening the consciousness

542
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and having these group meditations and bringing about the age of Aquarius.

543
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Why can't we also do that for big boobs?

544
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I'm not saying we should. I'm not saying that we have to.

545
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 But if we can raise the consciousness of the planet and we're able to ascend and make the green dot red

546
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 or however you want to describe it, couldn't you also reshape humans?

547
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 I love this conspiracy theory. He kind of ends it with this line.

548
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 "I think I've discovered a conspiracy that everyone accepts for obvious reasons."

549
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And if this conspiracy theory is true or this phenomenon is true, it is something.

550
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It is something that people would be like, "Okay, are you complaining? Are you complaining about this?"

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 So if it is possible that this is going on, that we've reshaped reality to have big boobs,

552
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 no one would really complain about that.

553
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 So for the women with back pains, I had a friend who had, like, I don't know, Fs or Gs or something like huge.

554
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And she had to get them reduced. They were back hurt all the time.

555
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Like, it doesn't seem like it's a pleasant thing.

556
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 But just an interesting conspiracy theory and it brings in all sorts of stuff.

557
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 He also says that it could also be the work of the devil. Like, the evil beings are making boobs bigger, but I don't know about that.

558
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 I guess when you combine pornography and the demonic influences in pornography, I can see where he's getting into that.

559
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I think boobs in them of themselves are just, um, they do serve a function, obviously.

560
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 They're nice to look at. I don't think they're demonic. I don't think that the fact that women have bigger boobs is the ultimate plan.

561
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 It's Satan. He's like, "Ah, yes. Now let the battle of Armageddon begin."

562
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 But yeah, it's just like, you could say a porn sick society, right, with like these demons coming out of this stuff and influence.

563
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 But that's, again, that's a weird end result.

564
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 I like this idea that the collective power of mankind influencing the bodies of women, and then you would also start to wonder about the opposite, right?

565
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 That if this power gets out, if the truth gets out, couldn't women and gay dudes, too, be into like, uh, big penises?

566
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And then they start imagining that all the time, which they do actually, but you know what I mean?

567
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Like, you could do the reverse. Like, what if we need to just, we do need to have a, we do need to have a global conversation where we meditate on how, like, hot we want the other people to look,

568
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 and then it's like this thing, and then we're constantly evolving to be even more, like, buff and sexy and curvy and, and like, over a short period of time, right?

569
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Ten years, we could actually reshape human society.

570
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 So men are like six foot five, and they got beautiful heads of hair, giant genitalia, tight muscles, and then women are just like these curvy Robert Crumb type drawings, just big butts and little biker shorts and just super curvy.

571
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And actually, now I see that. Now that does almost sound demonic, right?

572
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Like, we're reshaping the natural order, what the universe has given to us, these frail yet amazing bodies.

573
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 We're turning them into pure sculptures of sex and wanton lust.

574
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 We're actually like mentally distorting each other, giant boobs and firm nipples and massive penises and tight buttocks, giant eyelashes. Yeah, it sounds absolutely terrifying to think about that.

575
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 We'd become a culture so obsessed with body image that it would be unrecognizable to something just even ten years ago.

576
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 We would be these ultra sexualized beings whose only goal in life was to have sex and then the rest of the time simply meditating on how much you wanted to firm up or enlarge the body image.

577
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 The opposite sex. That does sound demonic. That sounds like we would be going down such a dark path.

578
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 No science, no art, just sex, gross sex, gross sex with giant bodies all the time.

579
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 And if you could reform bodies at will through the collective power, would you ever truly be happy with your own body?

580
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 It would be like an arms race, you would always be thinking, well I'm 6'5 but I started noticing my neighbors were 6'7.

581
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Sitting at home, you're hallucinating, trying to make yourself taller. I don't know, it does sound demonic now to think about it.

582
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 If this power got out of control, it wouldn't be about making sexy girls on Instagram even sexier.

583
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 We're talking about the possible destruction of the human body.

584
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And when we are lust filled zombies, soulless creatures looking for the next hole to slide into, we've given up everything that makes us human to become sex toys.

585
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Maybe that is when the Dark Lord would show up.

586
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 I believe a human is at their weakest when they're horny.

587
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 That is when their spirit is the most fragile.

588
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 So even though I dismissed the devil argument, if this conspiracy is true, maybe he is behind it.

589
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Maybe we should be careful what we wish for.

590
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 You know the old saying, "The path to hell is paved with big, firm boobs."
