1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 From the dark watchers of California to the gray man of Scotland

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,680
 Are their giant shadowy creatures?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,480
 That watch are every move and

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,160
 Then we take a trip to the black bamboo forest of China a

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,240
 Mountainous region almost constantly

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,020
 Surrounded by fog what lies beyond the mist nobody knows

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,960
 because everyone who goes there

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,760
 Simply disappears today on Dead Rabbit Radio

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:44,880
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,920
 I hope you're having a great day too just a few quick things that are interesting one

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,880
 I found a website where they talk about solar plexus clown gliders if you remember I did an episode on them back in

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,080
 I think it was like episode 65. It was a long time ago

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,800
 Found a website and I was like oh cool more information. This will be awesome. I went to the website and I'll be in the show notes

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,360
 I'm the information

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,400
 I'm listed as one of the known victims of the solar plexus clown glider

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,480
 It's like no one victim no one victims include Dead Rabbit podcast host Jason Carpenter. I was like what oh, yeah

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,760
 I mean, I guess that makes sense. I was a victim of it

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,000
 It was so weird to see my says self in a wiki article and then they included a bit of a transcript of that episode

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,260
 Very very odd, but it's cool. That's a good way to get the show out there

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,800
 You know, I was like I'm gonna get a couple listeners from that at least and it's in the preliminary stages right now

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,840
 but I sent off a video for a

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
 Netflix show called haunted. It's like true stories of ghosts

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,080
 But I said on my story I sent my shadow people story and in that episode

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,240
 I think that was episode like 75 or something like that

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 I said the story about the shadow people invasion and they're like, oh, that story was really scary

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,160
 Let's see a video of you. So I did I did the video and I was like hey, my name is Jason cook

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,560
 I'm from Hood River. Here's the story. It's like a quick little three-minute video sent it off to him

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,240
 I'll keep you guys informed. I put down as my occupation

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,640
 Podcast host maybe get a couple listeners from that as well. So we'll see we will see I'll keep you guys informed

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,560
 How the Netflix thing goes that would be cool though, wouldn't it? I

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,920
 And this is the plan I'm not gonna tell my mom not if I get the show

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,520
 I'm not gonna tell my mom the next time I see her. I'll just be like, hey, I know you're not really into spooky stuff

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
 But let's watch this show haunted. Let's watch this show on Netflix. I will just turn it on and she'll be like, ah

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,200
 So anyways, I'll let you guys know how that goes. Let's go and get started with the episode though

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
 First story I want to talk about is something I'd heard about a long time ago really kind of creeped me out

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 I actually have this old friend named Katie

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
 I haven't talked to her

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,360
 I think she goes by Catherine now, but I haven't talked to her in a long time, but she told me she goes to her

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,800
 the creepiest thing is

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,920
 When people just stand there staring at you. I was like really she goes

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,680
 Yeah, imagine you're late at night sitting in your house

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,760
 You look out a window and someone's just staring at you from the field or your front yard or wherever you're at

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,680
 And I go, yeah, that would be kind of creepy and she's like yeah

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,440
 Just the idea of them staring at me would be terrifying. I said, yeah, and then they like run to your front door

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,200
 She's like no no no no no they do something then it's not scary anymore to her if they try to break into the house

46
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,120
 Then it all makes sense or if they run away then it makes sense

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,720
 But just them staring at her was the scary part once they did any other action. It didn't become scary

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,440
 And I was like that's kind of weird, but it makes sense

49
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,120
 That's where we're kind of segueing into this story or the story of the dark watchers

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,400
 We're going to Santa Lucia mountains which sounds familiar to me. So I think we've been there before

51
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,320
 But the Santa Lucia mountains is in California and to get there. We're simply gonna hike

52
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,920
 We're actually not gonna use any vehicles this time

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,080
 We're gonna hike because that's how the people experience these things

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,980
 But we do have our official dead rabbit walking sticks. So we're gonna use those they're in the shape of a normal stick

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,040
 But they have a the dead rabbit logo head is on the top

56
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,840
 So it's a pretty dope looking Gandalf staff with a ceramic

57
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,700
 That's probably not very safe with a steel dead rabbit logo head on top created by ash black now

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,200
 It makes it really heavy, but we might need them for defensive tools. We're walking through a

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,240
 Chasm like a valley through the Santa Lucia mountains if you and so this is the way the story goes

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,600
 If you walk through the area the Valley of the mountains

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,880
 Either at midnight or at dawn and you look up at the mountains

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,800
 Look up the dark peaks of the range around you. You will see them

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,560
 descriptions vary

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
 Sometimes they're seven feet tall

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,160
 Sometimes they're 15 feet tall damn dude that gives big that makes bigfoot look like a normal person

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
 Makes bigfoot look like a chump

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
 15 feet tall sometimes

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,400
 Just the shadow of a human

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,280
 Sometimes they have the shadow. They're still completely engulfed in darkness

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 But they have a wide brim hat

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,280
 Sometimes they wear long flowing cloaks now shadow people have been described as wearing the hats and the cloaks before

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,920
 None of them have gotten to the size of 15 feet. That's it. That's huge

73
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,680
 That's like two Jason standing on top of each other

74
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,720
 No, that's like two and a half Jason standing on top of each other. It's quite the sight to see and sometimes

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,240
 They have walking sticks

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,320
 There were some people have said the navels in the area avoided the area that they saw the dark watchers as well

77
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,080
 But there's actually no proof that Native Americans in that area ever recorded any incidents with the dark watchers

78
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
 Where we really start to see reports of them is when Westerners showed up

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,640
 So when the Spaniards showed up way way back in time they saw them they called them this is pretty dope name

80
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,720
 They called them Los Vigilantes oscarro, which I think means Batman

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,120
 But I'm not entirely for sure, but they called them Los Vigilantes oscarro and John Steinbeck wrote a

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,560
 Wrote a collection of short stories and in one of the short stories

83
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,760
 He talks about one of the characters seen a dark watcher

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,720
 Steinbeck's son was obsessed with the dark watchers and ended up writing a book just about the dark watchers

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
 He said I grew up around them

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,240
 It's not like they were like rock in his crib or nothing like that, but he had seen them all of his childhood

87
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,560
 He was really obsessed with what the phenomenon could be and I remember reading about that a long time ago in the

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,480
 National Directory of Haunted Places. I was like oh that is creepy like the idea of looking up and something's just staring at you is

89
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,600
 Very very creepy now sometimes people have reported that the creatures will do nothing

90
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,680
 But like so you're staring at the creature and you just see it staring off into the nothingness

91
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,320
 Staring off across the mountains staring into the sky other people have seen a move other people have reported

92
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,720
 This one guy was saying that he was smoking a cigarette and when he took a puff

93
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,680
 He saw the dark watcher do a similar motion

94
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,080
 Other people have said they've taken their hats off and they've seen the dark watcher also apparently remove something from their head

95
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
 Yeah, I think you can see where this is going to this

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,080
 so phenomenon and there is a

97
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,760
 Similar phenomenon in Scotland so there's this mountain in Scotland called the bin Mac Dewey

98
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,800
 Or does he and this mountain?

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,760
 Had it's very high and a lot of people love climbing it and every so often this huge mist rolls in in climbers

100
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,220
 You were up there have reported the gray man. What's the gray man?

101
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,080
 When you're hiking through the mist in the middle of nowhere

102
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,400
 You start to hear footsteps behind you

103
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,380
 I think that's enough you get the point and anyways and these people have had an

104
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,760
 Overwhelming sense of fear like I've never been afraid of anything as much as I've been afraid of what was behind me

105
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 and they turn around and

106
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,480
 behind them in the mist

107
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:16,120
 They see a giant again like a 15 foot tall shadow of a person walking behind them

108
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,760
 Now sometimes they see it when they're going up the mountain sometimes there's reports of them seeing coming down the mountain

109
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,520
 Usually it's coming down the mountain or if it is they're very shortly coming down the mountain because they flee the area

110
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,080
 They just see this giant figure chasing them the first reported case of that was in the late

111
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
 1700s, but it wasn't until the early

112
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,740
 1900s where a guy a very famous mountain climber said he was at like this mountain climbing convention and he goes

113
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,500
 I gotta tell you guys something one day. I was up on bin Mac

114
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,060
 Bin Mac Dewey and this happened and people are like well, that's kind of weird story

115
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,060
 He's like yeah, that's why I didn't tell you that he was the one who's saying I was walking down the mountain

116
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,780
 Heard something behind me turn around saw this giant gray dude walking behind me

117
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,800
 I took off down the mountain but since then other people have reported this phenomenon as well

118
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,960
 Always comes with the mist always comes with the mist

119
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,640
 so I'm researching these stories and I at first I

120
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,820
 Heard about the dart watchers back when I read the book and then I recently discovered the gray man

121
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,600
 I was like, oh, this is great story for the podcast

122
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,760
 But it's funny because let's go back to that story that happened in the late 1700s the very first sighting of the gray man

123
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,560
 There was a sheep herder who was herding the sheep and the mist rolled in

124
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,520
 And he's like oh this sucks like it got a hurting sheep is already kind of hard and now I can't see anything

125
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,700
 There's all this mist everywhere and he turns and he looks up the mountain

126
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,180
 And he sees the gray man first reported sighting of it and he books it out of the mist

127
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,440
 He leaves his sheep there. He runs back to his house and he's like, oh my god

128
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,160
 There's the scariest thing I've ever seen something was up there. I totally swear, but he's like but I left all my sheep up there

129
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,820
 He's not like a mountain climber where he can just run down the mountain and be like I'll go climb another mountain

130
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,580
 Like that's his job his sheep are up there

131
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,520
 So the next day is like damn it. I have to go back up there

132
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,620
 He goes back up there the mist is rolling back in and he sees the gray man now standing a just quite a distance away

133
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,360
 But still in front of him and he's looking at it. He's like why is it standing exactly like me?

134
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,540
 And he takes his hat off and he sees the shadow take its hat off and he's like, oh, it's just my reflection apparently

135
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,400
 This is what these things are and this was kind of a buzzkill

136
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,160
 There's a thing called a broken specter

137
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,680
 What happens if the Sun hits it at the right angle a shadow is projected onto a cloud

138
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
 So that's what it is

139
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,800
 These people who are up especially been McDewey

140
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,620
 Because it only happens when the mist rolls in you're in the mist and the Sun

141
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,940
 You're basically projecting your shadow onto a cloud and you see a giant person who's you

142
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,620
 Walking after you because you turn around and it's your shadow

143
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:03,540
 You're basically being scared your shadow and they said the thing with the sound like footsteps behind you that can be explained a couple

144
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,780
 Different ways it's funny because I've always heard footsteps behind me all the time when I walk

145
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,280
 When my feet are hitting gravel it always sounds like there's someone two three feet behind me

146
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,840
 And there's nobody there so it could be you're walking down a mountain and every time you take a step little rocks are coming down

147
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,260
 So it's making it sound like there's other footprints. These guys are experienced mountain climbers

148
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:26,740
 So they would figure that there's also been things with the moisture in the mist is actually creating that sound as it's making rocks move

149
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,620
 Around or something weird like that. So that's what most likely is the gray man of been McDewey

150
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,240
 With the dark watchers, I think it's also probably the same thing

151
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,100
 I think that they're actually now again because it says that you can see it at twilight or

152
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:48,580
 Dawn I don't know how much Sun is really flying around during twilight because I know that's when the vampires are out

153
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,900
 But I think that's the same thing because again

154
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,620
 Basically you look up you're wearing you're walking with a walking stick and you look up on a mountain

155
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,300
 You see someone else with a walking stick

156
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,820
 You're not gonna think oh that must just be my shadow because it's super far away. You don't think shadow works like that, but

157
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,400
 That's mostly like that's most likely what the dark watchers are as well is the Brock inspector

158
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,840
 And what's funny is I imagine the Native Americans back then would walk through that valley

159
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,780
 They'd look up they'd see a dude up there and they'd be like that's just my shadow

160
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,960
 I kept on walking and it wasn't until super superstitious people came to America and started walking through that valley

161
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,960
 And they looked up and they're like oh ghost like I think the natives are like, yeah, it's probably just my shadow

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,680
 It's weird. It's kind of actually wait a second

163
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,580
 Maybe that doesn't explain the dark watchers because at least the gray man walks with you and makes it look like it's chasing you

164
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,900
 But the dark watchers just stand there

165
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,020
 And they don't walk with you

166
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,500
 Hmm

167
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,300
 Maybe the dark watchers are real

168
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,420
 Just out of that

169
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,840
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to that. I didn't plan on that little nugget

170
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,200
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here

171
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,840
 After all blew my own mind

172
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,000
 With the dark watchers. It's funny. It's people. I people complain about the show every once in a while

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 It mostly gets a lot of praise which I appreciate

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,640
 But one guy's like how come you always like act like you're shocked about this stuff. You've done research on it

175
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
 I was thinking

176
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,040
 Yeah, if you listen to the show, I think you're aware of how much research I do on stuff and two

177
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,020
 You'd be surprised how how often when you're looking at your own notes here. I've done that a quite a few times on this show

178
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,120
 I'm going through my notes the Ariana Grande episode is the best example of that

179
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,380
 Where I had my notes and I had an angle that I was going for with the story and as I started reporting it

180
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,540
 I was like I'm way off on this. I think there's something more to it

181
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,920
 So that was that I was like, oh the dark watchers are totally just an optical illusion. It's nothing scary, but yeah

182
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,160
 They don't that I think I I don't think it they might actually be something interesting

183
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,160
 I always like surprising myself, but

184
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,560
 done surprising myself

185
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,920
 For now, but that'll be in said we are done walking our legs are sore. Oh my calf muscles

186
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,080
 I need some bananas. Let's eat some bananas. Let's go get some potassium. Then let's hop in the carpenter copter, baby

187
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,240
 It's the only way to fly we are going we are going to hi zoo valley now. We can't really fly over it

188
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 Well, we can but we won't see anything

189
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,500
 the entire area is

190
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:38,320
 Almost always shrouded in fog, but we're not just going to he's you valley. We're going back in time

191
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 We're going back to the year

192
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,780
 1949

193
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,300
 so in

194
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:52,020
 1949 in China was not the best year if you weren't a communist because that's when the People's Republic of China was taking over and

195
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,840
 People who weren't communists were like we got to get out of here

196
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,920
 And especially if you were members of the army that was trying to defend the old order

197
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,880
 You definitely needed to kick bricks because they're coming after you the previous government

198
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,760
 That was there before the People's Republic of China took over was the kumon tang the kumon tang

199
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:22,040
 So 30 soldiers of the previous government were like we got to get out of here grab your guns grab your ammo grab your supplies

200
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:29,160
 We got to leave because these guys are winning the war. We're wearing the wrong uniforms. This is not going to end well for us

201
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,180
 Where do you go on a hide?

202
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,400
 Person general and the general goes I know a place that we can hide place

203
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,820
 They won't look for us and we'll figure it out pack up all their gear they head for he's you valley

204
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,660
 They move through the black bamboo forest one of the many notable sites in the area the place is beautiful

205
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,940
 It's lush

206
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,680
 Mountains valleys waterfalls full of endangered animals endangered plants plants that have died off

207
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,960
 everywhere else in China still exist in this valley and it has this constant

208
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,480
 rolling fog

209
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,680
 The troops get ready

210
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:14,120
 I like okay, let's go. They're not gonna find us in here. They pass through stones gate, which is a natural formation

211
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,880
 disappear into the fog

212
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,640
 But they weren't alone

213
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,780
 Three scouts for the People's Republic of China their military three scouts were following them

214
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,420
 They wanted to know where they were going. They're gonna hook up with a larger force

215
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,820
 What was going on?

216
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,020
 Three scouts go into the fog as well

217
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:39,780
 He's you valley like I said, it's considered China's Bermuda not just because of the mysteries the place holds

218
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:46,160
 But for its beauty it's basically has almost no human interaction. So it's just nature

219
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,760
 Unleashed in this area. There's a local tribe of people there that they believe

220
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:59,520
 That beyond stones gate is where their people originated from and now they live farther away from there

221
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,120
 But they give tours in the area you can go out to He's you valley walk through the black bamboo forest all that stuff and go through

222
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,600
 The tour pretty much everywhere you want the tour guy will lead you but once you get to stone gate they go tours over

223
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,360
 We're not going over there. We don't pass stones gate

224
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,100
 He go why not and they go well for one. It's a sacred place to our people

225
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,260
 It would be sacrilegious for us to do that and two

226
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,600
 You're not gonna come back. So tours over

227
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,860
 tours over

228
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,220
 after those army troops went into the mist and

229
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,320
 The scouts followed them a few days later

230
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,620
 One of the scouts comes out of the mist

231
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,560
 Finds a local village passes out when he starts to when he comes to he said he had a hard time remembering what happened in the

232
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,820
 Mist but as he comes to he starts to get his memory back. He said that

233
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,720
 They all walked into the mist him and his two scouts were following the 30 troops

234
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
 They all walked into the mist. He says I started to feel this weird energy surround me

235
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,340
 I started to get really dizzy and I looked for my two compatriots. They were gone

236
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,880
 All trace of them were gone

237
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
 No footprints

238
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,580
 No broken branches

239
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,060
 Nothing, they just disappeared

240
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,500
 the 30 soldiers who walked into the valley

241
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,780
 Never seen again

242
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
 ever in

243
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,120
 1950 so a year later after that

244
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,700
 other people went in for numerous reasons

245
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,220
 disappeared

246
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,120
 100 people in that year rumor to have disappeared

247
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,140
 After that

248
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,260
 We jump I think after that people got the got the message people got them out

249
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,180
 Don't go over there because it wasn't until 1962 that a geologist team was sent in by the government

250
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:57,740
 To survey the area one guy ends up coming out of the fog and says listen this this is what happened

251
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,060
 we walked in as a group into the mist past Stonesgate and

252
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,460
 Everyone lost track of everybody else

253
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,400
 Nobody knew where other people were at but the thing is the geologist said there was also this weird side effect

254
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,520
 He lost a sense of time. He could no longer tell how long he was in the fog for

255
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:26,320
 There was just no way for him to gauge that and then he said he started to hear what he described as frightening sounds and

256
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,280
 hid

257
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,840
 Until there was a break in the fog and then he ran back out of Stonegate the rest of the geologist team and they don't say how

258
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
 Many people were there, but I figure maybe three to five

259
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
 never seen again

260
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:45,580
 1976 three members of a forest prospecting team says, you know what we yeah all those people went missing but we're forest

261
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,460
 Prospectors we're gonna go in and find out what these trees are

262
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,740
 Never seen again

263
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,460
 There's been reports that planes have gone missing over it as well. I haven't really I think that was kind of a retcon

264
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,140
 I haven't been able to find anything to support that one of the articles said that planes were missing

265
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,000
 If they were that would be too surprising

266
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 I don't think they're flying at 30,000 feet

267
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,320
 Over the mountains if the planes were flying too low, they're just gonna get caught in the mist and they're gonna crash

268
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,940
 But you're definitely not getting rescued if you crash there. No one else is gonna go in so in the place

269
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,280
 You can go to the guides won't take you past Stonegate you can walk through yourself

270
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,120
 It's not restricted by the government or anything like that, but it's pretty ill advised if you want to go there

271
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,840
 So the question is is what is going on at this valley? What is going on here?

272
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,860
 Some people say it's very explainable

273
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,540
 You just walking through a mountainous region

274
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,540
 There's a lot of mist everywhere and you naturally fall off of a mountain or

275
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:50,700
 An animal gets you if you know these creatures are living in the mist all the time they've adapted to it

276
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,780
 They know how to work in it. They're hunting you in the mist. They were born by the mist

277
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,040
 They were shaped by it. You were merely adopted by it

278
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,640
 So you don't have that natural instinct of of mist based combat

279
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,200
 Some people think they're sinkholes. There's a bunch of sinkholes in the area and so people walk in and fall in them

280
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,800
 Now my pushback to that is I can understand if every show often a hiker went in there and went missing and disappeared

281
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,200
 What sinkhole is gonna fit 30 people?

282
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,400
 I mean I can understand 30 people those soldiers going in with weapons and maybe a

283
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,200
 Big angry panda bear taking out two or three of them doing kung fu on them, but

284
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:33,380
 Come on like I get that you always want to come up with the natural explanations like even high did previous like I get that idea

285
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,060
 But at a certain point after you hit a hundred people in a year

286
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,060
 I don't think you could be like, I don't know maybe maybe a hundred people are all just falling off the same mountain a

287
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,860
 Little ridiculous. So then you kind of do got to look at some of the weird stuff here

288
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,740
 Now there are some people who say that there is a mountain in the region

289
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,440
 That is shaped as a triangle IE a pyramid and

290
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:05,600
 This valley is on what's called a dead latitude the same latitude as Bermuda triangle and the pyramids of Egypt

291
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,480
 Maybe could have something to do with that. It could be some sort of like geological thing

292
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,560
 But I think for the most part Bermuda Triangle has been fairly debunked at this point

293
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,860
 They think it's just like huge storms that come out of nowhere

294
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:24,400
 They found those hexagonal clouds those huge water spouts and the fact that the Bermuda Triangle is one of the most widely

295
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,680
 Used shipping areas and boats and plane ever since GPS

296
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,600
 Stuff has come out and satellites and stuff like that stuff doesn't really go missing in the Bermuda Triangle anymore

297
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,860
 So that's kind of debunked and it could just be the fog

298
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,500
 You're walking through the fog

299
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 It's too thick to see

300
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,040
 You get lost you get disoriented

301
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,000
 You just keep you could turn around you could be walking in circles

302
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,100
 You could think you're walking back to Stone's Gate and be walking deeper and deeper and deeper into this force

303
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,840
 That would be easy to test

304
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,500
 Just tie a string to a tree outside the fog a

305
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,940
 Hardy string that can't be crotty chopped by a panda and you walk through the forest and eventually find your way out

306
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,380
 But is there something else?

307
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,740
 I mean the body count is awfully high

308
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,500
 for this area

309
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,980
 now again

310
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,020
 You maybe since we've had GPS people aren't really disappearing in that area, but I can't really find any

311
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,980
 Proof that people are still even going into that area

312
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,180
 But what else could lie in that fog?

313
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,180
 Could it be the fog itself that isn't just obscuring your vision?

314
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,500
 But obscuring your sense of time and space is

315
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,580
 It possible when you walk through that fog you're not just entering a valley, but you're entering some sort of

316
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,060
 portal

317
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,080
 You're going somewhere else, so you would never be found

318
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,940
 It's interesting because the locals believe that their race their tribe

319
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,300
 Their ethnic group came from that area and

320
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,060
 Now you are disappearing in that area

321
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
 Could there be some sort of opening

322
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,380
 Imagine a world on the other side of that portal

323
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:24,940
 beautiful and lush and green and all the beautiful species of plant life and animal life that are endangered here are

324
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,860
 Plentiful there a

325
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,080
 true Eden in that other world

326
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,860
 War those original natives who crossed over into our world and settled here as well

327
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,660
 it would be a place of pure beauty and

328
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:48,300
 If you were a lost soldier looking for a place to hide from a brutal regime

329
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,420
 You might not have found it in your native land of China

330
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,020
 You may have found it in another world

331
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,620
