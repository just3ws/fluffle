00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
 Today, we take a look at two terrifying households.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:12,660
 First off, we travel to France to meet a woman who swears that the only way to enter her

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,080
 house is to walk on your hands.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,660
 And then we travel to South Dakota to meet a young man who's moving into his new apartment.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,660
 He quickly realizes that not only is he not alone in his new abode, this creature is not

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,660
 alone.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,880
 This creature may have sinister implications for us all.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:47,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,780
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,040
 I hope you have some cool plans for this weekend coming up.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,200
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters coming into

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,080
 Dead Rabbit Command right now is Devin.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
 Woohoo!

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,560
 Come on in buddy, come on in.

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,840
 Devin, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,280
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,980
 I say it every episode, cause it's true.

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,680
 You can really help the show grow.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
 Devin aka fellow content creator.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,480
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,440
 We are headed all the way out to Old Timie, France.

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,840
 As Devin is driving us out to Old Timie, France, we're headed back to the early 1900s.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,560
 I do want to say, next week is the last week of season 17.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,200
 So next week, we're gonna have five episodes and then I'm taking a two week break.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
 I'm not gonna do the bonus episodes this week.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,920
 I gotta start those up again.

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,760
 I always talk about them.

32
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,800
 But that's just ten more episodes of work and it's really hard to do the show.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 It is a solo podcast.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,520
 I don't have anyone else helping me, except when you guys help me financially support

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
 the show and get the word out.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,200
 I don't want to minimize that, but the production of the show is just me and I get burned out

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
 and everything like that.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,040
 And I feel bad I even take two weeks off.

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,720
 But I gotta take two weeks off every 50 episodes, that seems fair.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
 So there will be no bonus episodes.

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,240
 It'll be two weeks of just Dead Silence on the Dead Rabbit Radio channel.

42
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,760
 But we will be back for season 18.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,920
 And another 50 episodes of crazy, bizarre, macabre stories.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 Like these ones.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,840
 These ones are really cool and I'm glad I was able to present these two as a pair.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,240
 Because I got an interesting hypothesis with this one.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,520
 So Devon's driving the old timey Jason Jalopy.

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,240
 We're wearing old timey clothes.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,880
 We got on like the girdles and the big old petticoats and tiny little umbrellas.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,640
 We are walking around Roux de MontrÃ©al.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
 That's in the Saint Margarita district in Paris, France.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,360
 So we're walking around and we look dapper.

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
 And we're going to court.

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
 We're going to court.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
 We stole all these clothes from some old lady.

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
 We're running down the street and we end up in court.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,520
 And as we're handcuffed sitting in the back of the courtroom, in walks Madame Burlody.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,200
 I'm almost for sure that's not a he-pronouncer name.

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,760
 If my last name was Blody, I would definitely change it.

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,080
 I don't care if my dad was very proud.

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,440
 The Blodies helped build this country.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,920
 Madame Blody.

63
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
 She's an elderly woman.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,520
 She walks into the local magistrates office.

65
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,480
 I don't know if that's the same thing as the court, but anyways, just roll with it.

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
 Just roll with it like you're a big bloaty old lady.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,480
 She walks into the local magistrates office and she says, "Listen, you need to help me,

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
 sir.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,600
 I am just a simple old woman living at home with my son and my brother.

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
 And it's fine.

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,960
 Like everything's going good there, right?

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,560
 But one thing that's super weird.

73
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,600
 Every time I walk to my house, put the key in the door, click, click, clink, clink, clink,

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,240
 and they open the door.

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
 Eeeeeee.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,840
 She's making the sound effects to the magistrates.

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
 Like, I know what a door.

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
 I know what you're doing.

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,080
 You're not doing some sort of audio podcast.

80
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
 She opens the door.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
 Eeeee.

82
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:14,600
 And then me, this old lady, I have to get down on my hands and knees, do a handstand,

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
 and hand walk into my house.

84
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,360
 And then I get back on my feet and I go about my business.

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,960
 And the magistrate is looking at this lady and thinking, "She must be seeing me."

86
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,800
 And she must be super limber if she can walk on her hands.

87
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
 And he goes, "Wait, wait, wait.

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,160
 So you're saying that they make you do that?

89
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,520
 Your son and your brothers?"

90
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,640
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

91
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640

 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

255
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,400

 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

259
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

260
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

261
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

262
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

263
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

264
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

265
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

266
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

267
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

268
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

269
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

270
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,400

271
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

272
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

273
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

274
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

275
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

276
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

277
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

278
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

279
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

280
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

281
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

282
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

283
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

284
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

285
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

286
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

287
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

288
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

289
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,400
 no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

290
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
 no, no, maybe it wasn't that.

291
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 Well, no, dude, we clearly saw something.

292
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
 I don't know, maybe we were just tired.

293
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,400
 It's weird how the human mind doesn't want to believe in this stuff,

294
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 because it's creepy, right?

295
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
 Our brains have governors built into them,

296
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,400
 so we don't see everything that we see.

297
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
 And the things we do see that we're not supposed to see,

298
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,400
 we will discard them.

299
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 It's very, very interesting.

300
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
 I've seen that happen to with friends of mine,

301
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
 and it may have even happened to me.

302
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
 I wouldn't know, obviously, right?

303
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 If my brain goes, "Ah, I was probably just made up,"

304
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 and then I stopped remembering it.

305
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 But yeah, it's super weird.

306
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 I've been on Ghost Hunts with people that were really good friends of mine,

307
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 and they would have seen something,

308
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
 and I brought it up months or a year later,

309
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 and they're like, "Ah, they'll remember the event."

310
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
 See, that's what's interesting.

311
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
 They'll remember the event, but they'll remember it as,

312
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
 "Oh, I think it was something different."

313
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
 So now that they go, "Jason, what are you talking about?

314
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
 Was that when you were doing all those binadrials?"

315
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
 No, they remember the event, and they remember seeing the thing.

316
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 They just have a new--

317
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 I was just tired.

318
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
 I just hallucinated the same thing you saw,

319
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,400
 which really is unlikely.

320
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 The thing I love about this story is,

321
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400
 it's not just that there was a phantom in the house, right?

322
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,400
 It's not just that there was the image of a man in a straight jacket

323
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
 with a terrifying grin and crazy eyes.

324
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 Right? That enough is scary,

325
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,400
 but the fact that the brother, when he walked in,

326
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,400
 became the phantom.

327
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 He walked in and instantly felt compelled

328
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
 to wrap his arms around his body,

329
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 walking to this little room,

330
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,400
 and start acting like he's in a straight jacket.

331
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
 Now, the other two people, Kevin and John,

332
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,400
 were walking throughout the apartment for a period of time

333
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 before this creature, this spirit, made itself known,

334
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 but the younger brother immediately takes on the personality of the lunatic.

335
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
 Now, he goes, "There's no history of the house."

336
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
 He said there was a hospital nearby,

337
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
 but he tried looking in the eye,

338
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
 probably when he was trying to break his lease,

339
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
 he was probably trying to prove that it was haunted or something like that.

340
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
 He goes, "He couldn't find anything in the house

341
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
 that would point to it being haunted

342
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
 or being used as an insane asylum or something like that."

343
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,400
 The implication is that little room was set up for a man in a straight jacket,

344
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 and now his spirit is free to roam.

345
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
 Again, not only that,

346
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
 it can actually not necessarily possess people,

347
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 but latch on to certain people,

348
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
 and that person takes those traits.

349
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
 Did it see the man?

350
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,400
 Just felt acting a little crazy,

351
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
 which makes you wonder,

352
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,400
 what if it was the younger brother who moved into this place, right?

353
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,400
 And he walks in there, and he sees that room,

354
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
 and he goes, "Oh, I bet you this is where a crazy person would be,"

355
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
 and he wraps his-- he's all by himself in this instance,

356
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 but he's pretending he's wrapped in a straight jacket for a bit in the room,

357
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
 and he's like, "Haha, crazy, crazy times!"

358
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
 Then he goes on and he's unpacking his stuff,

359
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 and this man is very vulnerable to this spirit,

360
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,400
 and over time, it's not just,

361
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
 "Oh, I bet you that room was used for a guy with a straight jacket."

362
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,400
 This dark psychic energy is actually infusing this young man,

363
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
 driving him crazy.

364
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 The other people had enough shielding, they could at least see it,

365
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,400
 but this young man, when he walked in, he was instantly vulnerable to this thing.

366
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,400
 And Mike and, like the story before, I mean, these are very obvious visualizations or actions from this.

367
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,400
 The first story, having to walk in on your hands,

368
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 and this story seeing this ghost, and then someone being influenced instantly by the ghost.

369
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
 I started to put together that hypothesis, like, these are obvious things,

370
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,400
 but what about all the houses that we've lived in, all the apartments we've been in over the years, right?

371
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,400
 Even just visiting someone else's apartment.

372
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
 Who's to say, and we'll wrap the episode up like this,

373
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:47,400
 with this very dark and dreary ending, how much of our personalities are us?

374
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,400
 How many of our likes and dislikes are vices and addictions?

375
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,400
 Are fears and hopes are actually us?

376
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:04,400
 And how many are psychic residue from a place we visited once?

377
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,400
 Or a home we grew up in?

378
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 Who are a young girl died in a pool back in the 70s,

379
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,400
 and you moved into that house and you just didn't like swimming.

380
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,400
 You just never really could explain it, and I'm not, you know, I'm a goat swimmer and all,

381
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,400
 I just don't enjoy swimming.

382
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,400
 Or you spend most of your life not being anti-cigarette,

383
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,400
 but not really being interested in cigarettes either.

384
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,400
 And then you're in your mid-20s and you're in a new town and you find yourself craving a cigarette.

385
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,400
 You don't know, you figure, listen, I work in this new job, I'm in this new town, I'm super stressed,

386
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,400
 and I saw the movie Joker and it made smoking look really cool,

387
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,400
 so I knew it would impress some girls, so I went and I picked up some cigarettes,

388
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,400
 and you know, I'm not addicted, I just smoke casually on the weekends.

389
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,400
 But it's just all this other stuff going on in my life,

390
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,400
 but it's actually psychic residue from your new place of residence.

391
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
 It's interesting because this is actually a belief of Scientology,

392
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,400
 that there are ingrams that are connected to you,

393
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,400
 and we have to wipe those off of ourselves,

394
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,400
 and part of being a Scientologist is building up, I'm gonna bastardize it,

395
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,400
 I've had a few Scientology friends in my life and I'm just kind of putting it together piece by piece,

396
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,400
 but it's something that you have to do this cleansing, you do like the E-meter thing,

397
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 and you relive the experience over and over again of this negative thing,

398
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,400
 and you're kind of washing these ingrams off of you until you become clear,

399
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
 I think it's the supposed to be the base level of humanity,

400
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,400
 and then if you do it more you can ascend type of thing.

401
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,400
 It kind of is aligned with that, but this leans more into just the paranormal thing.

402
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,400
 Yesterday we talked about ghosts are everywhere, this one's kind of the same thing,

403
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,400
 this psychic energy is everywhere, and how much of ourselves is actually ourselves.

404
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,400
 One thing that I find very interesting, that my appetites are not my own.

405
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:19,400
 When you fast, you very quickly realize that a lot of the stuff you love to eat

406
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,400
 is actually the stuff your gut biome needs to fuel itself.

407
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,400
 It's fascinating, your gut biome sends chemicals into your body saying,

408
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,400
 "We need sugar, we need carbs, we need sugar, we need carbs,"

409
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,400
 that's where those cravings come from, and if you can go, I think it's two or three days without consuming,

410
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,400
 sugar or carbs, all of that gut biome dies off.

411
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,400
 You'll actually be craving it even more because it's releasing more signals to your brain,

412
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
 because they will die, it's basically an entire civilization in your stomach

413
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,400
 that will die if you don't have at least a candy bar, or a donut.

414
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,400
 Come on, just eat that donut, and you have to go three days basically,

415
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,400
 and then all of that dies in your stomach, and your gut biome is now different,

416
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,400
 and your taste buds are different, and what you want to eat is different,

417
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,400
 until you start eating sugar and carbs again, and that gut biome starts to reappear,

418
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
 and then the cravings start again.

419
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,400
 Those aren't my cravings, those are cravings that are coming from within my stomach,

420
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 an alien life form that's made its home in me, but it's not me.

421
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,400
 That's explained by science, we know that from science,

422
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,400
 so the question is, when we look at the world of psychic energy,

423
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,400
 how many of our phobias, or how many of our addictions, or how many of our attractions,

424
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,400
 how many of our desires are actually natively ours,

425
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,400
 and how many are things attaching themselves to us?

426
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,400
 It's a tricky question because there is really no answer for it, right?

427
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 It just comes down to who are you as a person, what is yourself,

428
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,400
 and you may think you know you, and you may be very introspective and know you,

429
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 but whatever could be inhabiting you could also be hiding very, very well.

430
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 I used extreme examples like picking up a smoking habit, or being afraid of water,

431
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 it could be far more simple than that, far more simple than that.

432
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 It doesn't have to be walking on your hands, it doesn't have to be being crazy in a house.

433
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,400
 The world of the paranormal is so fascinating because there are so many roads we can walk down,

434
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:46,400
 and a lot of those roads are spooky, very scary and unsettling roads,

435
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
 and I think this is one of those.

436
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:59,400
 I think this really kind of makes you buy into this hypothesis that who are you?

437
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:12,400
 When you get angry, is it you, or is it some sort of rage energy that latched on to you many, many years ago?

438
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,400
 You think you're in love with a person,

439
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,400
 but you don't really understand why, it doesn't make sense to you why you love them so much?

440
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:31,400
 Maybe you don't, but some energy, some thought form attached itself to you around the same time you met them.

441
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:39,400
 Things just seemed to click, but were you really in control of those decisions?

442
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,400
 I talked about on my episode Solar Plexus Clown Gliders,

443
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,400
 how when I was in a courtroom in Sacramento, it was a college class I had to go to the courtroom,

444
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:55,400
 I saw a King Cobra on the seat next to me.

445
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:04,400
 It wasn't real, but I saw it, and I saw it uncoil and lunge at me.

446
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:21,400
 And then for the next five years, I suffered from back pain, which led me to be prescribed 240 Vicod in a month.

447
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,400
 And I always wondered, I always figured that that was some sort of psychic energy that someone had left in that courtroom,

448
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:34,400
 and it had attached itself to me and caused this pain, it was physical pain, but it was caused by some sort of psychic entity,

449
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,400
 and who knows where that is now, right?

450
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:49,400
 Other than a few bumps and bruises due to being 45 years old, my back's fine, I didn't need to be on 240 Vicod in a month.

451
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 Back in 2003, that's where they were prescribing for a little bit of back pain,

452
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,400
 and my life really started to slide.

453
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,400
 How do you function on that much narcotics, right? It's a narcotic drug.

454
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,400
 You know, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, there's a lot of people, right?

455
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,400
 There's a lot of people who didn't get out of that.

456
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,400
 There's a lot of people who got sucked deeper into that world of painkillers.

457
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,400
 I consider myself very, very lucky.

458
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,400
 Blessed, right? Blessed.

459
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
 But I do believe that there are entities out there that can latch onto us,

460
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,400
 and I do believe that it may not be the cause of all of our vices and all of our passions.

461
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,400
 I do believe that these things are out there, I've talked about it before, I call them psychic landmines.

462
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,400
 A thousand people could walk back and forth across one of these things, and it never do anything.

463
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,400
 And a hundred people could walk by and get a weird feeling, right?

464
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,400
 Something feels off in this area, they don't want to be here, it's creepy.

465
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,400
 But maybe three or four people walk across that thing, and that landmine goes off.

466
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,400
 That spirit, that demon, that archon, whatever you want to call it,

467
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,400
 springs to life, latches on, and takes you for one hell of a ride.

468
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,400
 The world of the paranormal is fascinating and terrifying.

469
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:29,400
 Because it can go from being a spooky story to a life-changing event, like that.

470
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,400
 And you never know what side you're going to be on.

471
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,400
 Are you going to be the person just listening to the story on Dead Ravra Radio?

472
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,400
 Or are you going to be the person whose life slowly descends into a living hell?

473
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,400
 Simply because you moved into the wrong apartment.
