 Move over Pluto, there's a new punk planet in the solar system. And we've all
 heard about people going missing, but what about people just appearing today on
 Dead Rabbit Radio?
 Hey everyone, my name is Jason Carpenter. Thanks for coming back to Dead Rabbit Radio.
 The fastest growing podcast in Hood River County. Last time we were the fastest
 growing podcast in this town of Hood, city of Hood River. Now we're the fastest
 growing podcast in the county. We're growing exponentially. I don't really know
 what that word means, but it means like... Anyways, anyways. So thanks for coming
 back to the show. We got a lot of cool stuff to talk about. Venus is back on the
 podcast. Venus made a previous appearance when I said that up until the age of 14
 or 15. I thought Venus was covered in lush jungles and prehistoric creatures
 and couldn't figure out why everyone was so hyped up to go to Mars. I'm like, "Why
 don't we just go to Venus? We know there's trees there. We know there's..." And no one
 ever corrected me. That was an earlier episode, but that and that was also an
 earlier episode of my childhood. But they are back in the news and then we're
 gonna talk a little bit about appearing people. I've always thought that was
 interesting. But first off, I want to talk about... Yesterday we talked about day
 dreams. Today I want to talk about day dreams. Bigger brother, dreams. You know, as
 much as I find daydreaming fascinating, and I've realized listening back to
 podcasts, I say the word "fascinating" all the time. I have to come up with a
 better word, but that was me taking off my glasses. Okay, so as much as I... like the
 idea of daydreams, like you can instantly go into your head and picture a
 perfect world down to the smallest detail and you can direct the action. You
 can do whatever. You know, yesterday I talked about daydreaming and about
 winning the talent show. Honestly, the most common daydream is the diehard
 daydream, which is funny because do those daydreams really exist before that
 movie? You're like, "Oh, I'm trapped in this single location. I'm trapped at
 Sunrise Mall. I'm trapped at a school. I'm trapped, you know, downtown and it's
 been cordoned off and it's me against terrorists." That's a very common daydream.
 I thought it was funny once a girl was telling me that one day she was
 sitting at a coffee shop and she daydreamed. Someone was talking
 loudly on their phone or something like that and she daydreamed that she put
 his head through the gated, like the spokes of a gate, a metal gate. Like she
 kicked the crap out of him and then slammed him in between that. And it's
 funny because if I remember the story correctly, no one was actually talking
 on their phone. She was just sitting there and she was daydreaming. If someone
 was talking on their phone very loudly, I would beat them up and throw them
 through a gate. And I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a girl talk
 like that, but I definitely had daydreamed like that. I think that kind of
 titters the line between daydream and fantasy. But yeah, to sit there and be
 like, "What would I do if the bank got robbed right now and you daydream out the
 whole scenario?" And of course, obviously, it's completely ridiculous. I was like, "Oh
 yeah, I'm in." Like I would stab the terrace in the neck and then take his
 gun and I'd lead people through the building. And at the time, I mean, I was
 350 pounds. I don't think I could run up a flight of stairs, let alone do a role
 and then pop up into a firing position and fire an AK-47, which I've only
 fired a few times in my life as is. So yeah, but the daydream, obviously, I'm
 like, "Yes, I will jump up and climb up to the top of the elevator and I couldn't
 do that at my healthiest." I couldn't do that at my healthiest. So, but in the daydream
 world, you can do whatever you want. The interesting thing, though, is going back
 to dreams is the idea that... And I don't know if it's just me. Again, I think anything
 that we think is just us, millions of other people do it. I've learned that, but
 when I dream, I don't... I'm in it, but it's not... It's not me physically, it's how I
 see myself. I think that's fairly typical. Going back to the being over weight
 thing, sometimes I would have dream... Very rarely would I have dreams where I was
 my actual weight. Like I said, I used to be 350. I'm down to 275 now. When I was
 350, I wouldn't have... My dreams, I would be in the body of someone who was like 240,
 220, you know, like thinner, considerably thinner. And every so often, I'd have a
 dream where I was fat in that dream. And it was because of that dream had to do
 with people like making fun of me for being fat or me having some health issue
 from being fat. But any dreamer, I was like running around writing dinosaurs,
 punching, you know, Denzel Washington in the mouth, whatever. That... I was skinny.
 You know, it's interesting too, the Denzel Washington... I have this theory.
 It's called the Denzel Washington. That just popped in my head. The theory didn't.
 The theory didn't, but it's related to dreams too. So I used to hang out with
 this girl, the time name Monique, back in Sacramento. She's a really good friend of
 mine. We worked at Best Buy Together. And she was black. She was a black girl. And I'm
 white if you haven't figured that already. And so we're sitting there one day and
 I remember we were out eating dinner or something like that. And I said, I looked
 at her and I go, I, in my dreams, I never dream about black people. And she starts
 to laugh and then she kind of freezes and she goes, I never dream about white
 people. And what I mean by that, that yes, I remember specifically back then that
 I had had dreams where I had interacted with famous black people like Denzel
 Washington or Will Smith. You would, you know, people that you had seen on
 television, you would, you would, they would be in the dream. But as far as, like,
 in a dream I went to a coffee shop or I'm walking down the street, everyone was
 white. And in Monique's dreams, everyone was black unless she was having a
 dream and Tom Cruise was in the dream or Katie Holmes or whatever. And what's
 interesting about that is this was, we lived, we both lived in Sacramento,
 California, which was very diverse city. You interacted with people of all
 different ethnic groups constantly, constantly. The workplace is full of
 different ethnic groups. Everyone, I mean, just, there were no, like, white areas and
 black areas and stuff like that. Everyone was constantly intermingling. So what
 was, and of course we were friends and we interacted with each other, what is the
 mechanism that makes it so the background characters in the dreams were all of the
 same ethnic group that we were from? If it was a specialized person in that dream,
 if it was a famous person in that dream, that person was their, their race that
 they are. But if I got on a bus in my dream, it's full of white people. As I've
 gotten older, maybe that there's been a couple instances where that hasn't been
 the case. And I remember waking up and going, "Oh, that was weird." But for the most
 part, everyone in my dreams, I'd say 99.9% of the time, unless it's a famous
 person, everyone in my dreams is the same race as I am. And that was the same
 thing for Monique. And I've talked to other people in the interim and they've
 said, "Oh yeah, no, that, like at first your first thing is you laugh and then you
 kind of get uncomfortable. But then when you think about it, go, "You're right. I don't
 really have dreams about people of other ethnicities. It's, it's really weird." And
 again, I'm talking about like the background characters that make up the
 world. Where was I going? Oh, oh, this was my point. The Den, the, not the Denzel
 thing. Denzel thing is just because I, he was, I dreamt about him or something like
 that. I didn't punch him in the mouth. Anyways, I'm getting off the point. People,
 this was the kind of what I wanted to get to and it's taking me like eight
 minutes to do this. When, so when I've dreamt and I'm overweight in real life,
 but then I'm skinny in my dreams or I'm more fit in my dreams, here's my question.
 Do people who wear glasses, I very rarely wear glasses, but people who have to
 wake up and put their glasses on and wear them all day long, when they dream,
 are they wearing, are they wearing glasses? In their dreams, do they not have
 glasses on and their vision is perfect? Or do they wear glasses in their dreams
 because they're so used to wearing glasses simply to see my weight has no
 impact on how I take in the world, take in the world at all, but vision is super
 important. Would a, because I know blind people's dream and colors or something,
 that's again off the point again. Do people who wear glasses all the time
 dream, are they wearing glasses in their dreams? I think if I was like, I don't
 know, like if I had, if I dreamt that my vision was perfect and then I woke up and
 I'm like, everything's blurry, there would kind of be disheartening all the time and
 then you got to put your glasses on. I'm curious about it. Or is the same, or is it
 the same thing? Do they only think of dreams? Do they only wear glasses in
 dreams that require glasses? I don't know, that took way too long for me to get to
 the point, but you know, sometimes it's the journey and not the destination. Is
 that the same? I don't know. So let's talk about the biggest punk of the solar
 system now, and it's Venus, and this is why. So Pluto got, the whole thing about
 Pluto not being a planet is the dumbest thing ever. If you look at the stories
 about it, it was like, there was a scientific convention and a bunch of
 scientists went to lunch and the nerds who stayed after, because they didn't
 want to go with the jock scientists, they held a vote and they said Pluto's not a
 planet anymore. Any astronomer worth their salt thinks that's the stupidest
 thing, but the pop culture gets hold of it and they go Pluto's not a planet,
 Pluto's not a planet. It is a planet, but anyways, even if it wasn't a planet, Venus
 is still a total little punk right now. So I found this out. So Venus has a weird
 rotation, the planet itself, the spin, spinning around, and scientists are always
 like, why does that, like the length of a day on Venus they can't really agree on,
 because it varies. They couldn't figure it out. And here's why. So there's a bunch
 of big old mountains on Venus, mountains and volcanoes and stuff, and that's crazy
 to think like that planet is belching up fire. But anyways, it's like, first off, a
 single revolution takes 243 Earth days, which that is lame. Like, it should, that's
 way too long to spin around. That's, they need to get to react together, Venus. But
 anyways, so the planet, the reason why it spins weird, it sometimes will spin
 faster, sometimes it'll spin slower, because there's these giant mountains, and
 the wind hits the mountains, and it like pushes the, the planet in one direction,
 and then sometimes the wind comes from the other direction and pushes it in the
 other direction. How big of a, how big of a lame, I'm just gonna say it, how big of a
 planet do you have to be to have the wind move you, to have the wind actually
 affect your rotation? That's ridiculous. I, if I was a planet, wind barely doesn't
 even move me. Like, if I'm walking on the street and like a 60 mile an hour wind
 hits me, I'm like, uh, okay, maybe not 60, but 50, 30, whatever. I'm walking on the
 street and I'm like, uh, but I'm not like flying backwards. We're talking about a
 planet that is so big and the wind moves it. That's ridiculous. Even if it's not,
 it's not necessarily like moving it across the universe, but it's enough
 force to slow you down. That is lame. If we want to talk about planetoids and
 things that aren't planets, I think Venus qualifies for that, unless there's
 dinosaurs and jungles on it, and then I will take back everything that I said
 about it in the past five minutes. I do have a question though. I thought about
 this before. Could you have, and this is, there's some things you just can't Google,
 because I typed this into Google before and it nothing, I couldn't get anything.
 Google is actually, it's kind of lame, but I typed in, "Could you have a mountain so
 big it goes into space?" And I didn't, couldn't find anything. Here's my question.
 Could there be planets where there's a mountain so big, because you know, like
 Mount St. Everest, is that Mount St. Everest or just Mount Everest? It's so
 big that you climb up it and you start to need oxygen tanks, because the
 atmosphere gets thin. Can you have a mountain that's so big it actually pierces
 the atmosphere so you could walk up the mountain and float into space and just
 float away? Is that possible, or does the height of the mountain determine the
 height of the atmosphere? Like, will the atmosphere always like be bigger than the
 mountain, because it's like circling the globe and the mountains part of the globe?
 Could you imagine though, if there was a mountain that was so tall, you could
 literally walk up and float it into space? Like, we wouldn't need our space
 program would be so advanced. We could literally have people up there just like
 throwing stuff, like climbing close to the top, and then they're like chained onto
 the planet so they don't fly away. And they could just be like, have a fire
 brigade chain, where like one guy at the bottom is like throwing up a box, and then
 you keep throwing up the box, and then you throw it up there. Or I guess what would
 be easier is just the truck. You can just drive a truck up there, that's probably
 easier than fire brigade and stuff, but imagine, that'd be awesome. If we had a
 mountain that tall, you could just like jump. That becomes like people are like,
 "Mom, I'm run mom, dad, I hate you, I'm running away from home," and you like run up
 the mountain and just jump into space. That'd be cool. I don't know if it's
 possible though, because Google has let me down. What was the other story that I...
 There was actually a lot of stories I wanted to talk about today, but I've
 realized that I can't really control what I rant about in the beginning, and then
 I go off on a side tangent. So I tried to keep it down to about two stories. What
 was the second one? Was it aliens? Oh no no no no, I have an alien story, we'll see
 that for tomorrow. This one's really cool. This one's about people who appear. And
 there's two parts to this story. The first one is the story. So in 1954, in a
 Tokyo airport, in an airport in Tokyo, the Tokyo airport, there was a passenger
 who gets off the plane, 1954, he gets off the plane and they show their passports
 because it's an international flight, and the passport is for a country called
 Torrid, T-A-U-R-E-D. And the traveler looked European. He definitely wasn't
 Japanese. And the Japanese official was like, "This passport is fake. There's no
 country called Torrid." And the passenger was like, "No, there is. Yeah, I'm from
 there." And the him and the immigration official, you know, a little
 polite at first, but they're just going back and forth. And they can't...
 They can't convince each other. The man's trying to convince them that
 Torrid, he's from a place called Torrid, and the immigration's official is like,
 "No, that's impossible." Now, what was weird is they look at the passport, it had
 been stamped before. So like, he had traveled to different countries, and
 they said, "You know, why don't you show us on a map where your country is?" They
 tell you to come aside. And now they're like, because they think, you know, is this
 guy some sort of like criminal or something like that? They take him aside,
 and they pull out a map, and they go, "Where is Torrid?" And he looks on the map,
 and it's not on the map. And at this point, the man starts to get frustrated,
 and he goes, "It's between Spain and France. There's a country here called
 Torrid, and it's been there for like a thousand years. It's an old, old country."
 Now this guy, he spoke multiple languages, and he could speak Japanese well. He was
 fluent in that, and he could fluently speak French as well, and he's like, "That's
 where that is." And yeah, they couldn't figure it out. So at this point, the
 Japanese official said, "We need to take, you know, like, this is gonna take a
 little more time than we think, so we're gonna put you up in a hotel, and we'll
 convene again tomorrow." And so they put him in a hotel, and again, they don't,
 didn't know what this guy's motives were, so they posted two guards outside of his
 hotel, and they said, "You know, have a good night's sleep. We'll meet you tomorrow."
 And there was like no, there was like a ledge, a window with no ledge, and it was
 high up. And so, the next morning, they go in there, and he's gone. The guy's
 completely gone. There's no proof that he was ever there. So I heard about that
 story, the man from Tourette, years ago, maybe like 20 years ago, and it's been
 one of my favorite stories. The idea of people appearing into our world, or
 appearing into our reality from somewhere else. I think we always hear about
 people disappearing, and it's always like, "Oh my god, what happened? It's totally
 scary." And I'm not talking about like people getting kidnapped. That's just
 tragic. Talking about like weird disappearances, like disappearances that
 could be chalked up to some sort of paranormal event, which are still
 tragic. But you know what I mean? Like a dad abducting his daughter, that's not
 necessarily paranormal. Just just terrifying. So, but this story always
 interests me, because it's the other side of that story. People just appearing in
 our reality. Imagine in this man's reality, he gets on a plane, and then he
 goes to sleep in his reality, and wakes up in ours, and when he's on the plane, he
 doesn't notice anything's different. The two realities are so closely linked. The
 plane lands in Japan, which is where he wanted to go, which where he planned to
 go, and he got off the plane like he always has, and nothing seems out
 ordinary. The two realities are so close to each other. Maybe he spots an ad for a
 product he's never heard of, but you know, nothing's really clicking for him. And
 so he goes, and he shows his passport, and then that's when people go, "That
 country doesn't exist." You know, that's, "You're not, that doesn't exist." And then I
 imagine when he's in the hotel room, kind of the same thing happens. He goes back
 to the reality where he was supposed to be, and is in a hotel room in that Japan,
 and comes out, and they're like, "Oh, hey, you know, you're, yeah, you are from
 Torred. We know Torred. We know where that's at." Interesting. Now, there's two,
 like I said, there's two parts of that story. So, I had heard that story, and I'm
 gonna post this link up, because it's fascinating. The great thing about
 conspiracy theories and paranormal stuff, and I talked about this a little bit
 when I was talking about that rapper who got shot, how conspiracies grow, how you
 take a single thread of information and have it grow. I was doing some research
 on the man from Torred today, because I wanted to talk about it. This whole story
 that I just told you comes from a single line that we know of, from a book
 called The Directory of Possibilities. It was edited by Colin Wilson, Colin
 Wilson's is one of my favorite authors of all time. He's a nonfiction author, and
 he has put together several collections of true... He wrote a book called The
 History of Crime, and it is the best nonfiction true crime book you
 will ever read. It is literally The History of Crime. We learn about the very
 first time fingerprints were used. They go all the way back to the oldest types
 of crime, and most of it's centered in England, like in Europe, and the
 Americas. But it's amazing. The book has to be like 600 pages. Please, please, if
 you're interested in true crime, pick up The History of Crime, I believe it is.
 But you look at Colin Wilson, all of his stuff is good. However, he edited a
 book back in 1981, 27 years after the 1954 event, and in a part of this book
 there, this line, it had a section on appearing people, and it said this line,
 "And in 1954, a passport check in Japan is alleged to have produced the man with
 papers issued by the nation of Toret." That was it. That was the only line in that
 book playing into that. And then back in 1999, again this is what I find
 fascinating, this is kind of... and none of this has been cited. These are kind of
 the evolution of these stories. In 1999, there was another book called Strange
 but True, the Mysterious and Bizarre People. Let me read this real quick.
 This is an excerpt from that book that was 18 years later. "There have been many
 reports of visitors from other planets dropping in on Earth. In 1954, the
 Japanese authorities detained a man trying to enter the country with the
 passport that revealed he was from an unheard country named Toret. A thorough,
 thorough check was made by custom officials to see if there was any such
 place, any such a place anywhere on Earth by the Dura Blank. The stranger refused
 to throw light on the whereabouts of mysterious nations of Toret and quickly
 left Japan." So the story that I told you originally was a story that I had
 always heard, and this is that evolution of that story. Now I'm not saying it
 didn't happen, because this is one of those mysteries that I did... I hope it
 happened. But from that single line in that Colin Wilson edited book, and then 18
 years later a little bit more, and you're starting to see how that story grows.
 You're starting to see how that paranormal story grows. And I think that is
 another level of fascinating information on the story. The initial story I find
 very fascinating and intrigues my mind, but the fact that we can watch this story
 grow, we can kind of go back and read about this. And kudos to the person who
 put this article together. I like I said I'll post the link, but it's a great...
 and this guy sources it and every... or woman I don't know. But yeah, so check out
 this link, and I'm gonna spend some more time on this website and look around. But
 you know, I think one thing about the man of Toret is cool is that what if
 that's what happens to people who go missing in the woods? They go missing in
 the woods in our reality, but then they just go to another reality where
 everything's normal, or it would be creepy if they go to a reality where
 something is totally abnormal, and they're stuck there too. I always wonder
 what happens to people who just go missing in the woods. I think everybody
 does, but yeah, it's like, is it like a wolf eating them, or is it something
 creepier? I don't know. I don't like the woods. We've been over that a hundred
 times. I would much rather get zapped away on an airplane and end up in another
 country. Another... I guess everyone gets zapped up in an airplane. It goes to another
 country, but you know what I mean? Like go to another reality, then be shifted into
 another reality in the forest. This forest should be anyways. So that's gonna be
 our episode for tonight. I hope you had fun. A research that man from Toret story.
 Again, I think that's a fascinating thing. There's other stories out there about
 people appearing, which again, it's... some of you don't hear it very often. You hear
 the disappearing, you hear the missing 411s, but appearing people, I think, isn't
 just another spin on that. And that's what I like to talk about. I like to talk
 about stuff we really haven't heard of before, so... We're gonna go ahead and
 call it a night. I am Jason Carpenter. Oh, so yes. Let's go over this again.
 DeadRabbit.com is the website. You can check out all the show notes there. The
 email address is deadrabbitradio@gmail.com. We have the YouTube channel. You
 can hit us up at @deadrabbitradio. Check that out. And then Twitter is @jasonocarpenter.
 That is my Twitter handle. We're gonna... tomorrow we are going to do ghosts. I've
 noticed this podcast has been kind of ghost light. I want to do a lot of... not
 a lot, but I want to do more ghost stuff. I was like, "Oh, we're talking about science
 and stuff like that. Boners." I think we talked about that in a previous episode.
 But I want to talk about some ghosts. So tomorrow I'm gonna give you some ghost
 news. I found some good ghost stories. We're gonna go through that. So hopefully
 you tune in for that tomorrow. I am Jason Carpenter. This is DeadRabbit Radio and
 I'm just gonna come up with a sign off right now. Let's see. I am Jason Carpenter.
 This is DeadRabbit Radio and you have just entered the rabbit hole. I'm Jason
 Carpenter. This is DeadRabbit Radio and... dude, is there any rabbit-based puns?
 Don't get bit by a dog with rabies or you'll get rabid. I could work with that.
 I might be able to... I could work with that. I don't know. There's something there.
 Have a great day guys. I will see you back tomorrow.
