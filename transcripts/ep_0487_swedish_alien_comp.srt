00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Today's episode is brought to you by the American Egg Council.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 When scientists hear that a small town in the Dominican Republic has an issue with girls turning into boys,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 they send scientists down to see if the rumors are true.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a lumberjack who was out cutting down trees one day.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Everything was going normal until a UFO crashed in front of him.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We're coming up to the weekend. I hope you guys have some cool weekend plans.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I know I'm gonna be playing a bunch of video games when I'm on vacation.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 This guy actually forgotten his name was this.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It wasn't until he was listening to the episode when he first supported the Patreon.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 He's like, "What? Oh yeah, that's my name."

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Meat Hammer, put your kids out of the room.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Meat Hammer McDickfist.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Meat Hammer, thank you so much for supporting the show.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Even though we had to get rid of a part of our audience for me to be able to say your name,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 you can bring the kids back in.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Meat Hammer, you're going to be our pilot, our El Capitan this episode.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We also have a merchandise store.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Meat Hammer, let's go ahead and fire up the Dead Rabbit Robo.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 We are headed out to the Dominican Republic.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We're going back to the 1970s, and there's a little town in the Dominican Republic known as Salinas.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Just normal life. Everyone's walking around wearing bell bottoms, shirts or half buttoned, lots of chest hair.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 It is a wild time in the 1970s.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But the reason why we're here, other than the beautiful weather,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 there's a scientist who's come down to the Dominican Republic to see if there's any truth to a rumor.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 That she's been hearing.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Dr. Julian Imparto McGinley is walking around the Dominican Republic.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Hey, do you know where Salinas is? It's that way, ma'am. Thank you.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 She's driving in her car through the beautiful town, and she's like looking through notes.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 She should be paying attention to the road, but she's a very busy woman.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 She's looking through her notes. She's an endocrinologist, and she's been hearing stories that seem impossible.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But this town seems to have an ongoing issue with girls turning into boys.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 So much so that they've actually given it a name.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 "Guevedos" means literally means, if you pronounce it right, it literally means "penis at 12".

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 What happens is, little girl's born.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 "Waaaaaahhhhhh!"

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And the doctor gives the baby to the mom, and the mom's like,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 "Oh, I'm going to name you Nancy."

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And like, "Pet-nit" or whatever you do to a baby.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Brushin' its hair.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And then, the baby's gettin' older.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's this little girl, it's runnin' around. Nancy's gettin' older.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Freddy Kruger's wading in the wings.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 "Waaaaaahhhhhh!"

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Nancy's getting older. She doesn't want to sleep.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And around 10 seems to start acting not stereotypically girl-like.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Some of the parents said, "Well, we knew our daughter had this issue."

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 She started beating up other kids.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But by 12, the transformation is complete.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 They're now a boy.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 They now, and not just identifying as a boy, they actually now have a penis and testicles.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Now, the doctor is down here to investigate this, because it sounds impossible, right?

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That you could have someone just magically grow a penis and testicles.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Seems bizarre.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But it actually happens so often down there.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 It's one out of every 90 kids in Salinas will have this happen.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 That's a huge amount.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 They say it's almost, it's more than 1%, right?

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 You guys know math.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 So, Julianne is down there studying this, and what she figures out,

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 because it was just something that was happening in the community.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Again, so much so, they had a name for it.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And some of the people, like Nancy, sometimes when she turned 12,

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 she would change her name to Ned, or Nick, or Freddy Kruger.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But sometimes they just kept the name Nancy, and they'd be like, "Ah, I'm a guy."

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And they said, other than the fact that they seemed to be a little more of a slim build

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 and had a bit of a harder time growing facial hair, there's a dude.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 They could have children totally normally.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 There's an enzyme called 5A reductase, and it basically limits the amount of testosterone

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 that is flowing through you.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So, when they're born, they look like a girl.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 There is no male sex organs down there, at all.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 But at 12, the testicles drop down.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I don't think it's right at the stroke of midnight when they turn 12.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 They're like, "Ta-da!"

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 But I think that it's like an ongoing thing.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Like parents would say, is that we would see our kids slowly changing.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 We'd start to see their chest get broader.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Basically, once puberty starts and the testosterone is really flowing through them,

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 the male sex organs will just appear over time.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And again, that sounds like a local legend.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 We have a lot of stories that come out of, like, Africa,

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 where people get their penises magically stolen and they're, like, disappearing.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 We've covered that before. This is the reverse.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 This is where penises are magically appearing.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 So, when scientists are hearing about this, they go, "I don't think that's true."

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 But it is true. They can calculate how often it will happen.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's an issue over there.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 What sucks is that the kids get teased, right?

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 You have someone who identifies as a girl, told all their life they were a girl.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 They're turning 10, 11, 12.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Now they're presenting themselves as a boy, and they get mocked at school.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 They get teased.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Which is interesting, because it happens so often.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Like, one out of 90.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 But anyway, you know, people will find any reason to make fun of you.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But scientists go, "No, this is a real thing. We can identify it. We know what causes it."

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 They also see this pop-up in regions in Turkey and New Guinea.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 So it's not even related.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You can't even say it's an environmental thing in this area.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So Dr. Imperto McGinley ends up leaving the Dominican Republic and publishing her results

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 and saying that this is 100% a thing.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Now of course, someone is sitting in the wings going, "How can we make money off of this, huh?"

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 How can we possibly make money off of this?

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And using her studies, using her studies about that enzyme, the 5A reductus enzyme,

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 they've actually been able to synthesize it and make finasteride.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Finasteride is a drug you can take to help your hair stop thinning and to make your prostate smaller.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Because one of the reasons why men go bald is excess testosterone.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That's why when people do steroids, copious amounts of steroids, they tend to lose their hair.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Because they're basically getting so much testosterone, having less hair generally means that you have more testosterone.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Same thing with an enlarged prostate.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Having thinning hair isn't really a health concern.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It's more of a beauty concern.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And some people don't care about it and some people do.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 But having an enlarged prostate is not something you want.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 You don't want any part of your body to be enlarged.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Well, I mean, for the most part.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 But let me rephrase that.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 You don't want anything inside your body to be enlarged.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 But yeah, so they've used her studies.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 They were able to identify what was going on with these kids that gave them not even delayed puberty, but delayed sex organs.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They were able to say, "This is why."

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And then a company was able to synthesize it.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Now you can pop pills with it.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 So an interesting story, almost on the fringes of science,

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 like on that border between science and superstition.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 If she had never gone out there and done that study, this obviously would still be happening.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 But I think most people would be like, "Ah, it's probably just a regional myth."

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But it does exist.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And out of it came a hair-saving medicine and a life-saving, right?

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So let's go ahead and hop, if you have an enlarged prostate.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 If you're falling off a bridge, I can't throw you a pill and you eat it and grow wings.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But that enzyme can actually help you grow your wavos.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And you know what another word for wavos is?

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Eggs.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Wait, no, that's not true.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You know what another word for egg?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Wait, what?

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Anyways, here's the ad for eggs.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Hi, my name's Jason Carpenter.

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I'm the host of Dead Rabbit Radio, the fastest-growing paranormal podcast in America.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And you know, whether I'm chasing Bigfoot, outrunning aliens, or trying to convince an old man his treasure is free.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I like to eat an egg.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 A good old-fashioned American egg hatched right out of an American chicken.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Nothing beats an egg unless you're beating it, turning it into an omelet.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So if you're looking for something to eat tonight, look no further than the egg section of your grocery store.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Or if you're lucky enough, you may own some American chickens in your very own backyard.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 What's on the menu tonight, boys?

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 American eggs.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Okay, there we go.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 American egg council.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Eat eggs.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Meat hammer, let's hop in that carpenter copter.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 We are leaving behind the Dominican Republic, and we are headed out to Sweden.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 We're flying over beautiful tropical ocean of Dominican Republic.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Is this Dominican Republic in the tropics?

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I don't know.

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Can an ocean be tropical?

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I don't think so.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But we're flying over it anyways.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It's beautiful.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 We see fish jumping out of the water trying to catch a ride on the helicopter.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Because they have a death wish, I just realized if they actually succeed, they're dead.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 We're flying.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Let's fly low.

173
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I want to pet the fish.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 We're flying over.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 We're headed to Sweden.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 We're going back to the year 1955.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Now, all of this information I got from an article written by Marcus Loth.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He's done a couple articles we've covered on this show.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 It was on the UFO Insight website, and it was called the tragic--

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Well, I don't want to give away the article.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I don't want to give away the ending, which is in the headline, but we'll get back to that.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 But thank you, Marcus, for writing this up.

 [MAKES HUMMING]

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 We're flying the helicopter.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 We find a nice little clearing in the woods.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 We land.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 We jump out.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 We're wearing lumberjack clothes.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We got a new job.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 We're lumberjacks.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 We all have axes and flannel shirts and jeans and stuff like that.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 We're walking around Sweden.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 We're outside the Gulf of Boatheena in Sweden.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And there's these three lumberjacks.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 They're chopping down trees.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Timber!

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But they're saying it in Swedish.

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000

 [MAKES HUMMING]

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 But that sound effects in Swedish.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And we don't have names for these lumberjacks.

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 So we're going to call the main lumberjack Jerry.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And then the other two people, Nick and Bob.

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So Jerry and his Nick and Bob are hanging out.

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 They're enjoying their new names.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And they're doing their job.

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And then all of a sudden, they hear a strange noise.

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Huh?

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 What's that?

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And they-- who was the main guy?

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Jerry?

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Jerry said it sounded like something big was walking through the woods.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Something just tearing through the trees, through the brush.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 He's like, oh no, my livelihood!

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I need those trees to exist so I can chop them down.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But he looks and he doesn't actually see trees getting knocked down.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He hears it.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He can't figure out what it is.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And then he sees a long cigar-shaped craft.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 There's a lot of phallic imagery in this episode.

222

 "Meat Hammer" and now this and then the previous story.

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 He sees this long cigar-shaped craft.

 Burning a line across the blue sky.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 He said that it seemed to him like a plane with no wings,

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 which would be the perfect way to describe like a cigar-shaped UFO.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Or just, you know, a cigar.

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But, you know, they look the same.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He goes, "Thought it was weird.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 It's a plane with no wings.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Maybe that's why it's crashing," he's thinking.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And he sees it go into the forest and then a super bright flash.

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 [EXHALES]

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 He said it was so bright that the sunlight disappeared.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 We've actually talked about that on previous episodes.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 UFO encounters during the daytime.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 For whatever reason, the UFO seems to be brighter than the sun,

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 which you would think was impossible.

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 When we were talking about UFOs, obviously, we're throwing physics out the window.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 But the thing is, is that I made the sound effect of the ship crashing.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 There was no noise.

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 They saw the ship go into the forest.

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Saw the light that was brighter than the sun.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 It erased the daylight.

246
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 No noise, though.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Jerry's standing there and he says,

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 "For a moment, he could see through the trees."

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 It was like looking through an x-ray.

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So you could see the outline of the trees, but you could see right through it.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And he's looking through this forest and it's x-rayed.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And then his foot starts to get dragged towards where he believes the ship crashed.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 This fills himself getting pulled.

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Then his other foot starts getting dragged too.

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And he feels his whole body, almost like someone turned on a vacuum cleaner,

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 pulling him towards this crash.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Nick and Bob are also feeling this as well.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 [imitates explosion]

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 One of them is apparently turning into a mummy, but they feel this pull.

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And they actually had to brace themselves.

261
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 They grab onto a tree.

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Good thing I didn't chop this one down.

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Jerry says as he wraps his arms around the tree.

264
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And he's seeing branches and leaves fly past him towards the impact zone.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 [imitates explosion]

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And then it's over.

267
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Not the story, not the story. That wouldn't be climatic.

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Jerry and Nick and Bob look at each other and they go,

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 "We're gonna go check that out, right?"

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 "Oh yeah, yeah, we gotta check that out, right?"

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Someone might make a podcast about this story someday.

272
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 It has to have an ending.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So the three lumberjacks go marching through the forest.

274
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 They go to where they know, just on the angle that this thing would have crashed.

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It wasn't far off. It was within walking distance.

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 They go to where it would crash. No wreckage, nothing. There's nothing there.

277
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Kind of looking around, picking up rocks.

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 "Not here boss!"

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 One of them says as he's looking into a tree hole.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 "Not over here!"

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Another guy says as he's lifting up. He's looking behind a bush.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Jerry's like, "Why do I work with those idiots?"

283
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But then Jerry looks and there's like a stream there.

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And in the stream is sitting what he describes as a dwarf.

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 There's a guy just sitting there in the water.

286
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 He's not a typical, he's not described as a typical gray alien,

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 but he's definitely not human.

288
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Four feet tall, that's not what makes him not human.

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 There's a lot of humans who are four feet tall.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But this guy's four feet tall, yellow skin, broad shoulder.

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Oh, okay, so it's a dope little dude with jaundice.

292
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 No, he has eyes where deep socketed, so he had really recessed eyes

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and they were completely black, no white visible.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 He's just sitting in the water.

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And there's this weird vibrating light surrounding this beam.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 [humming]

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 But he's just sitting there, emotionless.

298
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And Jerry's looking over at Nick and Bob.

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 [laughs]

300
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Okay, rock, paper, scissors.

301
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Who's gonna have to go touch this guy?

302
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Jerry, he walks into the stream and he reaches out to see if this thing's alive or dead,

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 or even just what it is.

304
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And all of a sudden, in Swedish, the alien speaks,

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 "Do not touch me!

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 We'll only bring you difficulties."

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Dwarf's just sitting in the water.

308
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Jerry's just staring down at it.

309
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 The little creature looks up and goes,

310
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 "Now you know who I am."

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Jerry said that he looked pretty beat up, right?

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He looked like he didn't give--

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I mean, the UFO crash will tend to do that, right?

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 He says he looked like he was injured and he was wearing like a skin tight suit.

315
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And almost like the alien could kind of sense what Jerry's next question was gonna be.

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 The alien says, "It is because of the clothing I can stay with you a while.

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Internally, I am destroyed."

318
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I'm gonna quote.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 It's interesting because think about how many UFO stories we've covered.

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 They're wearing skin tight suits.

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It's almost always like a skin tight suit.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Very rarely are they wearing some sort of bulky astronaut type gear.

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And this would make sense if the suit was as much as it looks like a thin metal material.

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 A lot of times it's described as metallic or shiny.

325
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 It could be a crash suit.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It could be something that allows them to not die immediately on impact when their UFO crashes into something.

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Because he has some stuff he has to take care of.

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And this would actually explain a lot about aliens and UFOology in general.

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 He's sitting in this river.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 "Do not touch me.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I will only bring you difficulties."

332
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And then he says, "Internally, I'm destroyed."

333
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 If it wasn't for this suit, there would be guts everywhere.

334
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 It would not be funny.

335
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 It would ruin your day.

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 It would totally ruin your day.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 "Originally, the alien would clasp his hands together."

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And he would close his eyes.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And he would sit there silently.

340
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Just a water brushing against his skin.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 What would you think if you saw a human do that?

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Clasp their hands together and close their eyes.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It obviously sounds like prayer.

344
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Very, very interesting detail in an alien story.

345
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I can't recall a time that we've seen an alien kind of take that pose.

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But I actually, now that I say that, I can't recall a time we've actually seen an alien pass away.

347
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 It's usually like an alien autopsy story, or they come across the aliens and they're dead,

348
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 or they're kidnapped.

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I didn't think about the implications of the story.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 This might be the first time we've actually seen an alien.

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Well, there's spoiler alert.

352
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The headline of the article is "The Tragic Death of an Alien Humanoid in 1955, Sweden."

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 At that point, Nick and Bob just kind of turn and walk away into the forest,

354
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and Jerry turns and he looks at them, and he gets the idea in his head

355
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 that the alien made them do that.

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 That the alien sent them away for some reason.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Jerry doesn't know the reason, or even why he feels this way,

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 but he gets the idea that they've been commanded to leave Jerry and this alien alone.

359
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And then, according to Jerry, the alien and Jerry have a conversation that lasts around two hours.

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The alien is just sitting there talking to him.

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I always find details like that suspicious, because he says that they talked for two hours,

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 and we only get a little bit of information.

363
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Think about a time you've talked to anyone for two hours.

364
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 You think you'd have a boatload of information, but what Jerry tells us is that

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 the alien says he's from a constellation known as the Eagle.

366
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Sounds like a rock station, a 1970s rock station.

367
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And he says other aliens are coming from the Eagle as well.

368
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 So I don't believe we have a constellation known as the Eagle,

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 which would be an interesting piece of information,

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 because obviously he could say we come from Orion's belt,

371
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 or we come from Alps and Tari, or something like that.

372
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 But he goes, we come from the constellation known as the Eagle,

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 but it's not necessarily a constellation in our reality.

374
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He says he's from a parallel universe that "orbits the Earth."

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 That's a weird thing, because an alternate reality or a parallel reality,

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 that kind of puts everything on its head.

377
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I guess I've always thought of realities kind of layered on top of each other,

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 or next to each other, and you can pass between the two, theoretically.

379
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 But it could be that you have the Earth warping gravity so much

380
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 that it has its own parallel reality rotating around the Earth,

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 or it's close enough to the Earth.

382
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And he says aliens travel interdimensionally.

383
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 They're a phase in and out between their home reality,

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 which in their home reality is a constellation known as the Eagle,

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 and our reality.

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Fascinating stuff.

387
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I've always been a bigger proponent of aliens being interdimensional

388
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 than coming from Orion's belt or Alpha Centauri.

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The distances are just so vast.

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 The amount of energy that we would need to go from Alpha Centauri to here is...

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's unknowable.

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Passing from one dimension to another could be something that's so simple

393
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 that we've never even stumbled across.

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's almost too simple for us to discover type of thing.

395
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 At a certain point during the conversation, the alien pulls out a little rectangle,

396
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 a little rectangular device, and Jerry says he watched the alien put in some code.

397
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 [imitates alien noises]

398
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 The alien's hiding it from Jerry. It's his pin number.

399
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I might be dying, but I don't want you having my space box.

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 He's putting this code into the box, and he tosses it.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Tosses it away from him, and he turns to Jerry, and he goes,

402
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 "That's so my colleagues won't come looking for me."

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 After about two hours of this conversation, the alien's probably super cold in this Sweden stream,

404
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 but he makes a bag up here.

405
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 He manifests this bag in some fashion.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 He gives it to Jerry, and he goes, "Here's what you need to do.

407
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Get your buddies back here."

408
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Well, I guess I can do that because I'm the one who sent them away in the first place,

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 but you and your buddies need to put me in this bag,

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and you're going to put the bag in the river, but you can't touch me.

411
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 You can't touch me while you're doing this,

412
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 because if you touch me, you're going to get sick.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 You're going to get sick.

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So Jerry uses his telepathic powers and Nick and Bob come back out of the woods just on time.

415
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Jerry's holding this bag, and the little alien guy's sitting in the river,

416
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 and the vibrating light that was around him starts to get dimmer, and dimmer, and dimmer.

417
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Earlier when he had his hands clasped and he closed his eyes,

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Jerry thought that was a... odd gesture.

419
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 But now Jerry specifically states that the alien begins to mutter what he believes is a prayer,

420
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 and then he dies.

421
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Jerry and his buddies somehow get this alien into the bag without touching him,

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 and the bag begins to burn their skin.

423
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He said the bag smelled like sulfur, and it began to burn their skin, so they had to hurry up.

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 They're like, "Hurry up, man! No, no, you hurry up!"

425
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 They're like trying to kick the dude's body in.

426
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Eventually they get the body in the bag, they put it in the water,

427
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and the next five minutes they stood there in the bag, and the body inside of it slowly dissolves until there's nothing left.

428
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Now this story is known because there was an author named John Fontaine,

429
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 who was doing this speaking circuit, and at one point he's in Sweden and he's given this speech.

430
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 This was in like the late 80s, early 90s, he's given this speech,

431
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 and a guy approached him and said, "Yeah, you know, back in 1955, I was a lumberjack."

432
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 John Fontaine's like, "I don't find it interesting."

433
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 "Not, you don't let me finish! I shouldn't have paused there!"

434
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But not only was I a lumberjack, this is my story.

435
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And he tells the story that I just told you, and John Fontaine goes,

436
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 "Like any of us would do, do you have any proof?"

437
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Lumberjack reaches in, it was pocket, pulls out a rectangular piece of metal, shows it to him.

438
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 John Fontaine looks at it and goes, "I mean, anyone can show me a rectangle."

439
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 John Fontaine doesn't say anything, I mean obviously it could just be,

440
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 you can find a rectangular piece of metal, but he did have some sort of proof.

441
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 He puts it in his back pocket, and walks away.

442
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So this was a story that was told to a UFO researcher from a lumberjack in Sweden.

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Obviously it could be made up, you know, with any of these stories it could be made up.

444
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 John Fontaine could have made it up, the lumberjack could have made it up,

445
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 somebody else could have made it up and attributed it to John Fontaine.

446
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 There's a lot of stuff that obviously can go that way.

447
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 But like we like to do, let's put on our conspiracy cap,

448
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 let's explore the story as if it's real.

449
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 It's a humdinger, isn't it? You have reason why we don't find alien bodies from crashed ships, right?

450
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 That's an interesting detail. We don't have wreckage of the ship.

451
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Now you go, "What about Roswell? I thought we had the ship crash and st-da-da-da-da."

452
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 We've talked a lot about Roswell. I personally think at this point,

453
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Roswell is a false flag, disinfo stuff.

454
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Because it took a long time for Roswell to even be a thing.

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It happened in the 1940s and nobody really talked about it until the 70s.

456
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Then you had people going, "Oh, I was there and we covered a body."

457
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And it really smacks of disinfo.

458
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 But at Roswell we had crash wreckage.

459
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But you would imagine these ships are crashing not all the time, but enough.

460
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Just like plane crashes, right? Plane crashes.

461
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Planes never crash. They never crash.

462
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But here's how often one does it. It's this huge thing.

463
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 But what if the ship was designed to simply disintegrate?

464
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 What if the ship, when it is in a crash mode, all the debris simply go to another dimension?

465
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Which I mean, if you figure why can't the whole ship go to another dimension and not crash?

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 But the big thing, obviously, with UFOs, with Bigfoot, with GOSIS proof,

467
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 and this would explain why we don't find alien bodies in Antarctica

468
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 from 10,000 years ago as spaceship crashing.

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 They simply dissolve.

470
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Obviously, this guy needed help getting into a bag.

471
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 He was pretty beat up. He wasn't moving much.

472
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 But we have that idea of why we don't find a lot of proof of UFO crashes.

473
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 The prayer, though. Isn't that an intriguing idea?

474
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I know there's two branches of people who believe in, like, UFOs and stuff like that.

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And they're that a race that is so advanced to build UFOs would be beyond the need for religion.

476
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 They would be rational people.

477
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And I look at it as you could be so advanced in your science that you know that there's something outside of the universe.

478
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Like, it can go both ways, right?

479
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I think if you're looking at a stone age religion, we can look at it and go,

480
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 "Those are superstitions that people still follow today."

481
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 But if you were able to traverse parallel universes,

482
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 who's not to say you could go into a universe where you had absolute proof of God?

483
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 In an infinite universe, anything's possible. Everything's possible.

484
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 In an infinite universe with infinite realities, every single thing is possible.

485
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I'm dating Britney Spears in at least 5,000 universes.

486
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 In an infinite amount of universes, everything is possible.

487
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So if there's an infinite amount of universes, in one of those universes,

488
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 there is a God who created that universe.

489
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Because within an infinite amount of possibilities, right?

490
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Everything is possible.

491
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Even if there were a trillion billion universes where there was no God and it was a dead place,

492
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 it only takes one of those universes for there to be a God who created things to prove that God is real.

493
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Everything is possible.

494
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And if you have the ability to fly through those dimensions, to fly through reality,

495
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 you would know everything was possible.

496
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 If everything is possible, then God can have created the universe.

497
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 So, you could go, "Did I just blow your mind?"

498
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 But it made no sound. It was that epic.

499
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Within an infinite amount, on an infinite timeline, an infinite amount of universes,

500
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 everything is possible. That means God is possible. That means God exists.

501
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 The idea of an alien praying is fascinating.

502
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 I don't think we've come across a story like that before.

503
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 We're an alien.

504
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 First off, when he's classifying his hands, even in the story, Jerry doesn't go,

505
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 "Ah, he looked like he was praying."

506
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 He just said he had his hands clasped and his eyes closed.

507
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 But at the end, when he hears him kind of mutter something, he said it sounded like a prayer.

508
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then he dies.

509
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 An interdimensional traveler crashing on Earth,

510
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 spending his last moments on the only place we know his home,

511
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 in the beautiful Swedish countryside, sitting in a babbling brook,

512
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 surrounded by humans who took care of him,

513
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 who were empathetic for his plight, and stayed with him until he died.

514
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I can't imagine a more peaceful ending than that.

515
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So, if he really was muttering a prayer in his last moments,

516
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I hope he was uttering a prayer to his God of thanks

517
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 for landing on the amazing planet Earth.

518
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 We may have our troubles, but when it comes down to it,

519
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 we open our hearts and render aid to even the most strangest of visitors.
