1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A crusty criminal, a cat that defies all odds.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a look at the life of a man who tried to blend Christianity and science

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 with hilarious results today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 We got a lot of good stuff today.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I did want to make a quick note.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I've tried recording this part on a couple different podcasts.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I always have to edit it out for time.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Let's see if we survive now.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 First episode of the podcast, I watched the trailer for Hereditary for whatever reason.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I thought it was a good idea at the time while I was recording the podcast.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 My complaint was that everyone said it was the scariest movie since The Exorcist.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And I've been fooled before with like the Babadook.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And it follows in all this new wave of artistic horror movies.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Like this millennial artistic horror movie genre, whatever you want to call it.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And I go, "Well, the trailer looks good. I'll give it a shot."

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I gave it a shot.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And my initial instincts were right.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 The movie was not scary at all.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The movie is basically about...

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I mean, this is really dumbin' it down, but it's about a demon with a nut allergy.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 What?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 A demon possesses a girl.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Either the demon has the nut allergy or the demon possesses a girl with a nut allergy.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 The girl eats nuts.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Then she can't breathe, so she sticks her head out a car window.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And the driver goes too close to a power line and knocks her head off.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And then the next 40 minutes, there's people crying over this poor girl who got her head knocked off.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And then at the end of the day, a bunch of old naked people show up.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And the demon's trying to get into the girl's brother.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And the old naked people are standing in like all the corners of their house.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Full frontal, by the way.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 If you ever want to see what a 70-year-old naked man looks like, watch her at a terry.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Teenager jumps out the window, which was the most believable part,

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 because that's how most people would get away from a bunch of old naked people.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And then the demon possesses him and he goes into a tree house and they give him a crown.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 The end.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Two hours long, by the way.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Two hour long movie.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Beautifully shot, but very schlocky plot with a lot of like drama put into it to make it feel like a heavy movie.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So here's my recommendation.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 If you're looking for a movie that has a schlocky basic plot but wants something more,

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 there's an independent film that came out a couple years ago called Resolution.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Two brothers go into the woods, one has a heroin addiction,

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 the other one is there to help him kick the heroin addiction.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 They're in a cabin in the woods and there's something out there.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Very schlocky basic plot, but the way that it's handled, it's a really good, tense, fun horror movie.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And it makes you think afterwards, it's one of those movies that you're like,

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 "Hmm, you kind of think about for a couple days."

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So Resolution, if you're in the mood for something that I think is far superior to Hereditary.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Okay, so now that that book's been sealed on that movie, let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So we have a couple stories today.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Two of them are from New News.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Now I know people are probably like, "Yes, you sold that from PewDiePie."

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And I have to say, I don't know who PewDiePie is, so I do actually.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I watch this channel all the time, but anyways, it works.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 It works.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 So, oh yes.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 First off, we're going to talk about, now you know, I've had this issue before where let's,

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 hypothetically, hypothetically speaking, let's say that I'm a criminal.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, if I was a criminal in the 1970s, I would be like, "Oh, I just got to wear these gloves.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Can't leave fingerprints.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 That's how they're going to catch me."

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And if you were a criminal in the 1700s, you'd be like,

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 "Better not stand here at this crime scene so they don't catch me."

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So it's like crime detection has changed over the centuries, basically.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 First they did blood typing.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 They'd find the blood and they'd be like, "Hmm, this guy has A negative blood."

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Round up everyone who has A negative blood.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And then it became fingerprints.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Well, maybe the fingerprints came first, actually, but I mean, they had these progression of techniques.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And it's his arms race where the criminals commit crimes and they don't ever really know.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 When you commit the crime, you're doing it on the basis of the evidence-gathering techniques they have then.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You don't know what's coming down the pipe.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You're a serial killer back in the 80s. You're not really thinking about DNA.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 In 1983, there was an arm bra-

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Okay, and actually here, let me back up again.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I know that was an exciting beginning.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I think this story takes place in Britain because these articles, again, are from 2004.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 The reason why I think it takes place in Britain because they refer to an armored car as a caravan company, whatever that is.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I'm assuming it's an armored car.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And the reason why I'm assuming that is because it had 38,000 pounds in it.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So that's like, I don't know, 30,000 bucks.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But anyways, back to our action scene.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Shootin' out with this caravan.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I just think of Lawrence of Arabia, but...

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Give me the gold! Give me the gold!

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Put it all in there.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Apparently, leprechaun. They're stealing from leprechauns.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But so these criminals, they rob this caravan in 1983, and they get away with 38,000 pounds.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And the dude's running away, and at one point, he takes off.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 He had a stalking, which, you know, like a pantyhose over his face to disguise his face.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Again, it's 1983. They weren't really thinkin' that much.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 But pantyhose over his face to disguise it, and at one point, he pulls the pantyhose off of his face.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He probably left the ones on his leg still, but he pulled the pantyhose off of his face and kept running.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Now we're in the year 2004, which is where my new news folder comes from.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And the detectives... I can imagine a single detective has been staring at this piece of pantyhose for the past 20 years,

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 but he's looking at it, and he goes, "Dude, this thing's full of dandruff. Let's see if we can get some DNA."

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And they did.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 The guy had, I guess, bad dandruff. Enough dandruff that's noticeable.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And they pulled some of the dandruff off, which is, you know, skin flakes.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So it would have DNA in it. They tested it.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 20 years later, he got arrested for this crime, for this main robbery.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And you know that at that point, he's probably like, "I've already spent the money,"

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 and he was doing whatever else, and he's sitting there, and he's like,

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 "Man, I really should have bought some head and shoulders."

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 That thing popped in his head for a second. "I really should have bought some dandruff shampoo," but I didn't.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Why am I having that thought right now?

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 All of a sudden, army guys, or probably more likely police, break into his house and arrest him.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Convicted because he had dandruff.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So, and... I mean, so he never could have predicted that.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He never could have predicted that.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 If he did, he probably should have worn two pantyhoses, one to keep all of his dandruff in,

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 and the other one to disguise his face.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Or simply don't take your mask off until you get home.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 That's another pro tip.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Interestingly enough, this happened in 2004.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 He got sentenced to 15 years in prison, so you know what that means.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 He gets free next year!

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 That's a great thing about doing news from decades ago,

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 because it seems oddly relevant sometimes.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Okay, next, new news.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Very short one. I just thought this one was adorable.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 2004, if you could have guessed.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 There was this family in Russia, and they're like,

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 "You know what? We should do... Let's go on a vacation."

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 The family's like, "Yay, where are we going?" And they're like, "Siberia?"

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 So, for whatever reason, they go to Siberia to visit.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 What is there? It's huts and caribou,

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 and a giant impact crater from an airburst meteorite,

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 and gulags.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Siberia.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 If you lived here, you'd already be home.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Like, who wants to go there?

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Anyways, they vacation to Siberia.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 They go sit at the side of a frozen lake.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It's a wasteland.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But anyways, so they're in Siberia.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Maybe they like skiing. I guess it's probably good for skiing.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I imagine it's flat, though.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Siberia was just a continent-wide plain.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Are there mountains over there? I don't know.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Anyways, this family from Russia decides to go further east.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 They go to Siberia, and they bring their little cat.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 They bring Kuzya.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 "Hey, Kuzya. Let's go on this vacation to this horrid wasteland

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 that we used to send political prisoners to."

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 So they're there, and it's sucked.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 The people were fine with it.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 They stayed there for about three weeks.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But Kuzya was like, "I'm out, dude. This place totally blows."

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's like super cold, and it's dry.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And I'm pretty sure there's a house made out of toothpaste over there.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But they just heard him go, "Rawr!"

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And he jumped off their lap, and he ran away.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So they looked for him for the three weeks.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 They're like, "Kuzya, Kuzya!"

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And he didn't come, and they're like, all sad.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 They're like, "Well, that sucks."

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I mean, again, lesson learned, don't go to Siberia for your vacation.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 But eventually their time ended, and they had to go home.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 They were like, "Well, our vacation's over.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 We have to go back home to the West Russia."

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So they leave, and they leave little Kuzya there.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Three months later after they leave, they hear it meow.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Meow.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 They're door, and they're like, "What? What?

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Did you buy a new cat? No.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I'm still getting over Kuzya, disappearing in the wilderness."

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 They open the door. It's Kuzya.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Kuzya walked 1,300 miles across Siberia to get back home.

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 That's how much he hated Siberia.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 He could have just been like, "Eh, I'm just gonna lay here,

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 or I'll build a new home here, or meet like a nice cute cat woman."

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 No, he's like, "Screw this. I'm going home."

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Walks through Siberia.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 When they get him, they notice that he had lost weight.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 His claws were basically turned to little nubs.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 They had been completely filed down.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 He had meat, animal meat in his teeth.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Supposedly animal meat.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I don't think they took it to the DNA lab,

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 but the article said he had flesh in his teeth,

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 and he had a couple bite marks on him.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But other than that, he was totally fine.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Little Kuzya.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Imagine hating some place that much

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 that you would walk 1,300 miles to get out of it.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I don't even think I would do that.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I'd probably walk 10 and be like, "You know what?

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Maybe I can start a new life here."

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I'd probably walk two and do that.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Sad ending to the story, though.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 The story is from 2004, so little Kuzya

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 most likely has passed away by now.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 But the year in heaven, Kuzya,

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I hope it's warm and sunny

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 and is opposite of Siberia as you can get.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Meow.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 That was an EVP.

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Kuzya's contacting us from beyond the grave.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Okay.

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 The next story I want to talk about,

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I was going to talk about yesterday,

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 but I ran out of time.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And I think it's an interesting story

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 because it kind of hinges on that conflict

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 between religion and science.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Now, the conflict's been going on

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 since the first nerd picked up a textbook.

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 We're going to look at the life and times

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 of a man named Thomas Dick.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Now, I will say this.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I found out about this guy

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 because I was prepping another story.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And I was like, "Oh, that's interesting.

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 A Christian philosopher/scientist."

223
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And I was like, "Oh, I'm going to look into this guy."

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I'm kind of scrolling through my phone,

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 looking at it at work.

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And then I just started laughing.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 First off, let's address his last name.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Now, I'm not so immature that when I see a guy

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 with the last name of Dick,

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I immediately think of penises.

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I saw his name.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 I'm like, "Thomas Dick."

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 It didn't even occur to me.

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I'm like, "Oh, you know."

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I started reading the article.

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And it's like, on Wikipedia,

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 it was like, "You know, Thomas Dick was born

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 in this year."

239
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And he was doing this.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And then it said,

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 "He worked at his father's linen shop.

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 His father made like,

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 wove clothes or something like that."

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I guess I should preface this.

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 This starts off in the 1700s.

246
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 This is mostly late 1700s, early 1800s.

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's like, the father had this...

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 had this...

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 had this linen shop where he made clothes.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 His father's name, this great Christian philosopher,

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 would go on to be this author, this influential author.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 His father's name is Mungo Dick.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Mungo Dick.

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And I laughed out loud when I saw that.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Now, that's when I was like,

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 "Okay, let's break down Mungo Dick here for a second.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 One, it makes it sound like he has a huge dick."

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 If you go, "Dude, that's a Mungo Dick."

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 You don't think, "Oh, that must be a Scottish name."

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 You're like, "No, that means dude has a big dick."

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Now, to be fair,

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 when these guys were around in the late 17, early 1800s,

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Dick, what, didn't mean penis yet.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But it does now.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So when I'm reading an article and there's a guy named Mungo Dick in it,

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'm gonna laugh out loud.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Secondly, and again, I know that Mungo is...

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Oh, and by the way, Mungo means "beloved" in Scottish.

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So basically his name is "beloved dick."

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 But...

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 I get that Mungo is a Scottish name,

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 and it's like, probably a little racist for me to make fun of it,

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 but when I think of Mungo,

274
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I think of a eight-foot-tall, brute, golem-esque,

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 not golem from Lord of the Rings,

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 but like big stone dude, Solomon Grundy dude.

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 That's who you think of. You think of a henchman.

278
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You think of a lunk, guy named Mungo.

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Imagine growing up in a house with a guy named Mungo.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Again, you guys are like, "Jason, this is..."

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So I'm trying to read this article now,

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 after having this vision of this lurching henchman

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 just standing behind this young boy,

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 and I just couldn't focus anymore.

285
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So, Thomas Dick was...

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I just imagined this giant like...

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Mungo...

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Mungo no likes science.

289
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Mungo likes God.

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And then Thomas Dick's like,

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 "But Dad, you have to understand,

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 God made science!"

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And Mungo's like, "Wooah, head hurt."

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And I imagine that was pretty much his childhood life.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And you go, "Well, that might be an exaggeration,

296
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 but it's not really, because he wanted to be a scientist,

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 because he saw a meteor one day."

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 And so he's reading all the books he could,

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 even when he was in the linen shop.

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Mungo's like crashing through the shop,

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 throwing books around, "Make yarn, make yarn!"

302
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And so, anyways, so Thomas Dick,

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 because he had no support from his parents early on,

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 he actually made his own telescope.

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 He got like some eyeglasses and ground down the lenses.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I think that story is probably a bit apocryphal.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 I don't think that story actually happened.

308
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 But it would be awesome if it did,

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 just to give something for Mungo to destroy.

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 He's like, "No, I think!"

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 He's like, "Dad, no, I worked on that!"

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "Ugh, only see with real God eyes."

313
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Anyways, by the time he was 16,

314
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 his parents kind of started to warm up to the end,

315
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 because I guess I should have said this before,

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Mungo destroyed the shop.

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They were Christian.

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They were like, not like super crazy Westboro Baptist Church Christian,

319
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 but they were devout.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 So when their son was like, "Oh, look at shiny stars!

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Maybe that's like a rock from another galaxy."

322
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Mungo's like smashing through the wall.

323
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 So anyways, but by the time they're 16,

324
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 they're like, "Uh, I mean, uh, science may be okay."

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And then Thomas is like, "Yay!"

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Anyways, so he starts to like really get into the science stuff.

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Now what's okay?

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 He becomes a teacher.

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He becomes a writer.

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And he starts writing articles for a magazine.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And I thought this was another just bizarre...

332
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Okay, you have a magazine.

333
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He starts, okay, so he starts...

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 I'm reading this article on thing, and who wrote this?

335
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Mad Libs on a board afternoon.

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 We got Mungo Dick running around,

337
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 and he writes for a magazine called "Monthly Magazine."

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 That is the most...

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I mean, I thought about it afterwards,

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 and I thought, yes, there are newspapers called

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 like "The Daily Star" or "The Daily Tribune,"

342
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 but I don't know if I've ever seen a newspaper called "Daily Paper."

343
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 That's just it.

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 But anyways, he wrote for a magazine that came out every month

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 called "Monthly Magazine."

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 It should have been, actually, now that I think about it,

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 it should have been Mungo's "Monthly Magazine."

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 That would have been much better.

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It was... That would be a better plot.

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Mungo actually has a "Monthly Magazine,"

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 not a linen shop.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I'm glad I'm rewriting this guy's life history.

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And then there's a magazine dedicated to religious topics

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 and sports.

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And Mungo's like, "Me put religion in for soul,

356
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 but sports is what makes me feel alive."

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And it's all like rugby stuff, 'cause they're in Europe.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And the sun's trying to like sneak in science articles.

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And so as Mungo's like proofreading,

360
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 he has his little glasses on on his giant monster head.

361
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 As he's trying to proofread the magazine,

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 he notices like in the sports article,

363
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 'cause the sports articles would say stuff like,

364
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 "Ball smashed through goal, team win."

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And then he starts to notice like equations sneaking in.

366
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 They're like, "The ball arched 90 degrees."

367
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And then Mungo's just like smashing the printing press.

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 "Son, what you do? Where these numbers come from?"

369
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Okay, let's get back to the real story here.

370
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 So, Thomas Dick ends up writing these books,

371
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 and he writes a bunch of books about Christian philosophy.

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 One of them, his big book was The Christian Philosopher,

373
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 or The Connection of Science and Philosophy with Religion.

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And that was a huge book,

375
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 and it was about him trying to merge the two ideas together.

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And from then on out, he was known as The Christian Philosopher,

377
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and he was highly regarded as like a well thought out guy

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 who actually did a good blend of science and religion.

379
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But where he started to go wrong,

380
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 because that's all just thought experiments

381
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 where I could say, "Here's science, here's religion,

382
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 and these are the ways we can look at them."

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 What started to go wrong other than Mungo,

384
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 then smashing through the city of London,

385
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 that was actually a big incident.

386
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 They had to take Mungo down because he was attacking a bunch of Bobbys.

387
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 So, but the big problem he made was that he started to basically formulate

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 scientific theories himself, and he was a smart guy.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And people have looked back and said, "It's interesting because he used data."

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He actually like, he thought like a scientist,

391
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 but his conclusions were wildly off.

392
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And he came to this calculation that there's 250 people per square mile in Britain,

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 and there's millions and millions of square miles in the solar system.

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 God would not create an empty universe,

395
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 therefore to extrapolate all that information in our solar system alone,

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 22 trillion living creatures from little ant monsters to full humanoids.

397
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And our solar system alone 22 trillion people.

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 On the moon, he believed there were 4 billion people.

399
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Now, of course, this caught the attention of millions of people,

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 very controversial in the scientific community,

401
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 but it excited the imagination of the public who read the book.

402
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 They're like, "Whoa, we're surrounded by, we're in a living universe."

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 In 1837, Thomas Dick came up with the idea to draw a giant triangle in the middle of Siberia.

404
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So that way other aliens would go, "Hey look, there's life down there."

405
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And it's funny because that's a stupid idea now,

406
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 but back then they didn't have cities illuminated with lights.

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Like really the only way that you could look at a planet in passing

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 to see if there was life on it back then would to have a continent-sized drawing on it.

409
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And he's like, "Listen, I know that's gonna take a lot of work,

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 but my dad and a plow, that triangle is done in a day."

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 He can easily walk across Siberia in a day.

412
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 "Hey, I didn't realize that, Siberia and Kuzya."

413
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Anyway, so the cat, the cat meow.

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Mungo like cat, he's like petting the cat,

415
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 and they're like, "No Mungo, no, no, you've threatened it too hard."

416
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 "Oh Mungo, so sad."

417
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So anyways, what happened was, of course, as scientific advancements get better,

418
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 his theories start to fall further and further out of favor.

419
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And a story that we're gonna be covering tomorrow,

420
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 let's consider this a little bit a part one,

421
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 he plays a minor role in that story, and that's why I'm talking about it now.

422
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He plays a minor role in that story,

423
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 but that story also helped lead to his downfall in a way,

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 because it was a hoax that he got caught up in unknowingly.

425
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 He didn't know he was getting caught up in it, but...

426
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And then, you know, so he was this great writer and philosopher and stuff like that,

427
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 but in the end, he died pretty much penniless.

428
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 He didn't make a lot of good deals with his publishers, and he died.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 His books, other people, David Livingston,

430
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 the dude who was like in the jungles, and they're like, "Livingston, I presume."

431
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 He got lost in the jungle or something.

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I don't know why you're famous for getting lost in the jungle,

433
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 but anyways, he went out there and did a bunch of nature work and other jungle stuff,

434
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and he's famous, he's famous, but...

435
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So he's just not nobody, but I guess he's famous just for being lost.

436
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Anyways, I guess his review doesn't matter now that I just realized

437
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 he's just a guy who doesn't know directions.

438
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 He said that the books that Thomas Dick wrote were on the level of the Bible.

439
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Like, that's the level of esteem he had in his lifetime.

440
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 People looked to him for a way to bridge those two things,

441
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 and he ended up dying pretty much penniless.

442
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Mungo actually had to dig his grave with his bare hands, crying the whole time,

443
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 going, "Why God takes son? No God! Only science!"

444
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And then like, lightning.

445
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So that didn't happen, obviously.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 That didn't happen, obviously.

447
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It is interesting, though, to note that, again, the word "dick" did not mean "penis" when he was young,

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 but by the time Thomas Dick died, the word "dick" definitely was slang for penis.

449
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So I'm sure he had to hear a lot of jokes before his last five years of life

450
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 about having a dad named Mungo Dick.

451
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 But that's a life in times of Thomas Dick.

452
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I wanted to talk about that.

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I think the story is interesting, and I think it's interesting how they've still

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 never really been able to combine those two paths.

455
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 So maybe they're not compatible, science and religion.

456
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 But again, I think science doesn't care whether or not they're compatible,

457
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and religion does want them to be compatible, does kind of go on to it,

458
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and that's really what that story exemplifies.

459
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Thomas Dick was really trying to say, "Hey, listen, give me some of that science.

460
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Give me some of that knowledge.

461
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I'm with you."

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Yeah, we've never been able to really find that gap.

463
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 You hear a lot of paranormal investigators saying, "Hey, let's get a scientist over here.

464
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Let's use this equipment to see if we can scientifically prove ghosts exist."

465
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 You never hear a scientist ghost.

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 You know what we really need to figure out how the Higgs boson works?

467
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 We need a bunch of psychics.

468
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Let's get some remote viewers over to CERN and find out what's going on.

469
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Weird divide.

470
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It's a weird little break.

471
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
