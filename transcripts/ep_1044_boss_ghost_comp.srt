1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 What would you do if you walked into your grandma's house and found her sprawled out on the floor?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Like Jason, that's one of my nightmare scenarios. Don't talk about that.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then, hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 However, this particular job has a boss from hell.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We got an awesome episode for you today so let's get started walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Finn.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Woohoo, yeah, woohoo, yeah, walk on in. He's doing cartwheels, walking on in to Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Finn has been a man with a mission. He's currently traveling all over his city.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I'm not going to give it away because I don't know, maybe the feds are looking for him.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 He has been posting up custom made Dead Rabbit Radio flyers all over the city and sending me photographs.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So Finn, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I tell you guys all the time if you can't support the Patreon, help get the word out about Dead Rabbit Radio

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 and Finn is going above and beyond on that mission. So Finn, you are our captain and our pilot today.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Finn, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We're going to start off by leaving Dead Rabbit Command.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Fly us all the way out to Grandma's house.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 [Durgible sound]

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Nice leisurely view from the beautiful skies from the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're looking down.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And there it is. I'm pointing. There it is. There's Grandma's house.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You're going to miss it. I don't know why I waited so long. I waited so long so we were directly over at Finn.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Finn, come on, turn this thing around. It takes an hour just to turn, just to make it a short turn.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Eventually we do land and we get to Grandma's house and we're about to meet Grandma. We'll call her Grandma May.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Oh, I know. That's the character from Spider-Man. We'll call her Grandma Lucy.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And she is being visited by her granddaughter, Monica. Now these are made up names.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You don't have the actual names of the people in this story or the location.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Monica is spending some time at Grandma's house and she also goes to the beach.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Grandma, Grandma's not walking around in her bikini. She's like, "Hey guys, I heard it's spring break next week."

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And she may do that. I don't know. I don't know. Grandma's today are much different than the Grandma's I had.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But Monica is spending like a couple of days, apparently, with Grandma.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And on this particular day, Monica goes, "I'm going to go to the beach." Grandma can Finn for herself. She's made it this long.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm going to go spend some time on the beach. So Monica's down there on the beach. She's like, "Hey guys, spring break's coming up soon."

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 They're like, "Hey, yeah, is your grandma showing up?" She's like, "What? What are you talking about?"

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Monica spent some time at the beach. Julie, she comes back to Grandma's house and the door's unlocked.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Which is odd, right? Even if you do some people go, "I love leaving the door unlocked." That's dumb.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 It's stupid when people say that. I have always thought, like, "Are you proud of that? Are you proud of the fact?"

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 You're like, "Yeah, I also leave my keys in my car and the engine running all night."

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I meet people when they say, "Oh, no, I never lock my doors." They always say it like they're proud of that.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 No, that's a dumb decision. Just lock them. Just lock them. You're not doing anyone any favors.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Only know you're doing burglars and maniacs favors. But I find that so weird. I never lock my doors.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Why are you bragging about that? Also, what's your address? And what time are you usually asleep?

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Are you a deep sleeper? Grandma, Grandma Lucy does lock her doors, normally.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So Monica finds this very unnerving when she gets to the door and the door is unlocked.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 She walks in and normally Grandma Lucy is sitting on the couch watching her stories.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 But Monica walks into an empty living room. No Grandma Lucy. She's like, "That's weird."

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Then Monica walks into the kitchen. She goes, "Well, I know Grandma Lucy. She's not watching television.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 She's eating an entire apple pie by herself. We probably should have an intervention."

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Monica walks into the kitchen. It's empty. Monica looks down at the kitchen table. There's nothing on the kitchen table.

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 There's no one in the room. There's no Grandma. And then she goes, "Grandma must be in the bathroom."

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 This is an appellation of state. It's a grandma's house, right? It's not that huge.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 We have a living room. We have a kitchen. We have a bathroom and a bedroom.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 She's walking towards the bathroom. Monica's walking towards the bathroom to find her grandma and begins calling out,

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 "Grandma Lucy! Grandma! Grandma Lucy!"

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And the reason why is because she doesn't want Grandma to be scared.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 This adult female that is related to her is walking through this house unannounced.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It may give Grandma a quick heart attack or something like that.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So she's calling out for Grandma, but she's not getting any response.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And then all of a sudden, Monica walks into Grandma's bedroom and sees Grandma laying on the floor.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And the way that she was laying was it was like in between the bed and the wall.

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So not all beds are pushed right up against the wall. Some people have them in the middle of the room, which that's fine.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 But there's like that gap. There's a perfect grandma sized gap between the wall and the bed.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And this grandma is laying in that, she's laying in that gap.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Monica looks and she sees her grandma and she said her grandma was wearing jeans and a blue sweatshirt.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And she's just laying there on the ground. But she's not dead.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 She actually has this interesting look on her face. Monica said it looked like she had just fallen.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And the look on her face was between laughing like, "Oopsie, I fell down. Look at me, silly grandma."

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And pain, which would be pretty realistic, right?

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 When you fall down, you don't know the extent of the injury yet and you kind of feel, "Oh, look at me. I'm so foolish."

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Does that make sense? She looks down, she's using her grandma in pain and kind of like, struggling not to laugh.

73
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Well, Monica takes a couple steps towards her grandma and her grandma disappears.

74
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Monica's like, "Wait, what in the world?" And she's looking around the bedroom and her grandma's completely gone.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And she knows that she saw her grandma there. What she saw was so detailed, right?

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 She saw the clothes, she saw the look on her face, she saw her grandma, she saw all this stuff.

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 She starts to panic. And it's interesting because this is what I've been in situations where panic sets in.

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Not just like, "Oh, where did I leave my keys?" You don't think correctly.

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 You don't think correctly. Monica goes, "Oh my God, grandma just disappeared. Maybe she's in the bathroom."

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 So she went and she checked the bathroom because that doesn't make sense, right?

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 If you saw someone dematerialize in front of you, you're not like, "Maybe, maybe they're actually peeing."

82
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 But your mind's not working right. You're in a panicked mode. She sees your grandma just vanish before her eyes.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 First place she looks is the bathroom. And then she starts walking around the house looking for grandma.

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Because it doesn't make sense. People don't just disappear. Like what she saw didn't happen, but her...

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 She knows her grandma's there, but what she saw didn't happen.

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But the reason why she knows her grandma's there is because she saw her laying on the floor

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 and her brain's trying to connect all these things. And Monica's walking through the house and she gets to the kitchen.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And there on the previously empty kitchen table was a note written on bright neon paper, like a bright sticky note.

89
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 It was a note from grandma saying, "I'm going to be at the neighbor's house. I'll be gone for a couple hours."

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And Monica was like, "What in the world's going on? Like this just doesn't make any sense."

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 This is more than it doesn't make sense. Grandma dematerializing. She did a lot of that in the 60s.

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But this note on this previously empty table, what is going on, she ended up calling her grandma's cell phone number

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 and her grandma picks up and is like, "Yeah, I'm over in the neighbor's house. I'll be back in a couple hours."

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Did you see the note?

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Monica just kind of continued on with her day, kind of scratching her head over what the whole thing was

96
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 until grandma Lucy finally came home from the neighbor's house

97
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 and grandma was wearing a blue sweatshirt and jeans.

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 The exact same outfit that Monica saw her grandma wearing when she was laying on the ground.

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 This is one of those interesting, paranormal stories again that doesn't fit anywhere.

100
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It doesn't fit anywhere in the lore. I think at first, when you're first reading it, you think ghosts, right?

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I think that's where I was going when I was reading the story was she walks into the bedroom, she sees her grandma laying on the floor.

102
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Grandma disappears and then she gets a call and they go, "Oh, grandma was at the roller rink."

103
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And she had a terrible accident. She was skating and she fell down and died.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I guess it's not an accident, right? She died. I guess it's still an accident, right?

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 You would call up and say, "Yeah, grandma's had an accident."

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 She got killed in a horrible roller skating rink, but don't worry, Monica.

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 She had a look of laughing on her face as a hundred school kids ran over her with their skates.

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And then you have like, "Oh, that was her ghost appearing." That's kind of what it feels like.

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It kind of feels like a set up for a ghost story, right? She finds that out.

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 She was killed in her favorite blue sweater. Don't worry, Monica. We'll bury her in it.

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 We'll have to wash off the roller skate tread marks.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But no, this almost plays into...

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 The person who wrote it, wrote, they go by the name "pebkak."

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 They titled it "Slipped into a Parallel World." A little bit of a pun there.

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 A little bit of wordplay. "Slipped into a Parallel World." The question is, is who's moving where?

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 That's the interesting part of it. And an old... I don't know, you know, grandma's nowadays,

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 you can be 40 and be a grandma, right?

118
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But falling... I'll tell you this. As a man who is held in my... I'm 46 years old, I believe.

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 46, 47, somewhere around there. Falling as someone who's older than 40 is a tricky situation.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 If you're planning right now, you're like, "Oh, I have to listen to this podcast."

121
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I'm gonna go do that falling thing the kids have been talking about. Don't.

122
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Don't. It's way trickier. Like, everything works differently.

123
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Now again, the excess weight probably complicates things.

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 If you are a fit man, fit is a fiddle, and you decided to start parkouring at the age of 52, go nuts. Go for it.

125
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 But be careful. I guess that kind of goes without saying, but be careful.

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Because how do you... Falling is hard, the older you get is what I'm trying to say.

127
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I don't know why. People are like, "Dodge, Ace!" You could have just said that.

128
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You need to break out like a medical journal and be like, "Let's look at these studies."

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Falling is difficult, the older you get.

130
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And for an old person to fall down and hurt something seriously, that can completely impact the rest of their life, right?

131
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 If you're 22 and you break a hip, yeah, your rugby career is gonna be over, but you'll be fine.

132
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 You're like, "That's not true. Where are you getting your medical facts from?

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 A hip injury when you're 22? Your hip broke. Your entire hip just falls off.

134
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Oh, you'll be fine. My point is, that was a bad example here.

135
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 If your hip shattered, you're gonna have a bad time for a while.

136
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 But I would rather my hip shatter at the age of 22 than my hip shatter at 70.

137
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I don't have anything to back that up. Okay, I don't know why. Why am I even talking about this?

138
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Oh, this is my theory.

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Grandma slipped in the original reality and got seriously injured, and that changed the trajectory of her life.

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And maybe even the trajectory of Monica's life. Maybe she was like, "Now I'm... since I'm the one who found you, Grandma, I am now legally your caregiver.

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 I must stay here and take care of you forever."

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And maybe that wasn't the life Monica was supposed to live.

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 So when she walked in and saw grandma slip, it was not grandma slipping into an alternate reality,

144
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 but Monica slipping into an alternate reality where her grandma didn't fall.

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Like her grandma still laying on the floor.

146
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Her grandma's like laying there and she's like, "Oh man, I'm gonna lay on this floor. No one's gonna help me until my granddaughter Monica comes home."

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And then Monica comes home, she hears her walk and asks, "Grandma?"

148
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Grandma and Grandma Lucy's like, "Finally." And then Monica walks in the room, and Grandma Lucy goes, "Oopsie, I fell."

149
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And then Monica just vanished, just disappeared, and Grandma Lucy's like, "Oh no! That was my only hope.

150
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I'm gonna be laying here for the next two months before my next relative shows up."

151
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Who knows what happened here.

152
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But it does seem more of like a parallel universe story than a ghost story, right?

153
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Because she's still alive.

154
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But what was the phenomenon? Where would you classify this?

155
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Who slipped where?

156
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And you could go, "Well, Jason was just like a delusion or something like that."

157
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 She hallucinated Grandma. First off, it's possible the story's made up.

158
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But let's say that the events are true. She might have hallucinated it, but then she would have also had to hallucinate the clothes correctly and not hallucinate the notes.

159
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Like, look at the table and hallucinate an empty table.

160
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 There's a lot of hallucinations going on here.

161
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It's not like she looked at it and she saw a beetle walking around and tipping a little hat to her.

162
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 She'd have to look at a normal table and see a normal table, but then hallucinate her Grandma in such an odd predicament.

163
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Fascinating story. Alternate dimensions. Who slipped who and where did they go?

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 We will never know.

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But somewhere out there, there may be Grandma Lucy still trapped.

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 She's in an infinite void. Time never passes past that moment of her laying in between the wall and the bed.

167
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 That is truly her Twilight Zone.

168
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Finn, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbonar copter we are leaving behind this-

169
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 She's still like, "No, no, you can help me. I'm not really in the Twilight Zone.

170
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I'm an old woman trapped between a bed we're all walking out.

171
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 We're like, "I don't know. It's kind of Twilight Zone in there."

172
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 She's trapped there forever.

173
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Finn calling that carbonar copter we're leaving behind this old lady trapped behind her bed.

174
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Fly us all the way out to a warehouse.

175
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 [imitates the sound of the car]

176
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 This story happened just last month. It was about the third week of February, 2023.

177
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 We're about to meet a young man named Tommy. It's not his real name.

178
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Tommy is hard at work. We're sitting back eating sandwiches and we're watching this kid work.

179
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And he has this pallet jack. You know those things. If you guys work retail or warehouse, you guys know what they are.

180
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 They're the giant metal fork things on the ground.

181
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You're like, "Jace, I use a pallet jack. I have no idea."

182
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 What? What does that even mean?

183
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You know, it's like the giant fork with the wheels on it and you roll it underneath a pallet, a pallet of wood,

184
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 and then you squeeze it a couple of times.

185
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 And it lifts the pallet, the wooden pallet up a couple of inches off the ground, and then you wheel it around.

186
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 You're going, "Wee!" all over the store until you get fired.

187
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I have a personal relationship with the pallet jack.

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I ran over my own foot with one a long time ago.

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I don't think I've ever told this story on the podcast. I was using a pallet jack. I worked for a company called...

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I don't even think they're around anymore. Was it Bed Bath and Beyond? What was the other one?

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Home furnishings or something like that?

192
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Bed Bath and Beyond and then there was the other company that sold similar stuff.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Beyond Baths or whatever. I don't remember where it was. They said, "Hey, use this pallet jack and load this truck up."

194
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And I go, "I've never used the pallet jack before." And they go, "You'll figure it out."

195
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And I ran over my own foot.

196
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 This is a totally true story.

197
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I ran over my own foot and severed a nerve in my foot and sued them for not training.

198
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I don't think it was an actual like, "Sue, sue" thing. What happened was, I got on workman's comp.

199
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And for whatever reason throughout my life, I just know lawyers. It's the weirdest thing.

200
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I'll be hanging out with someone. I'll go to a work party and I'll meet someone.

201
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Someone's boyfriend will be like, "What are you doing?" He goes, "Oh, I'm a workman's comp lawyer."

202
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I knew this guy. I ran over my own foot with a pallet jack and I didn't even have to make any calls.

203
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Someone's like, "Hey, dude, what happened to you?" Because I had this boot on and I ran over my own foot.

204
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And basically my friend jumped out from behind the bushes. I think he called me and was like,

205
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 "Dude, this is what we're going to do."

206
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So I ended up getting workman's comp because I ran over my own foot and I severed a nerve and it hurt.

207
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It totally hurt, right? And they sent me to this doctor who every three months would look at my foot and be like,

208
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 "Oh, it's in bad shape. You're not going to be able to work for another three months and take this medicine.

209
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 This is just the new stuff that we're giving you."

210
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And I was like, "Okay, so I'm taking this medicine and then I go back three months later and he's like,

211
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 "Oh, your foot's still looking bad. Here's some more medicine."

212
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And I remember the second or third visit, the medicine he was prescribing me was called Vioxx.

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And he wrote out, this note's again, this whole history, he wrote out on his medical pad like notes, like prescription notes.

214
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And it was a Vioxx branded medical pad. And he used the Vioxx branded like ballpoint pen.

215
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I didn't know anything about payoffs. I didn't know anything that Vioxx was actually, a lot of medical companies do this.

216
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 They send out salespeople, two doctors, and say, "Perscribe our stuff and you can win like in a room of vacation."

217
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I think that's too illegal, but they can go, "We'll just fill your office full of free stuff."

218
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And so Vioxx, I was on Vioxx. It was an anti-inflammatory. I was on it for about two years and then I stopped getting it.

219
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I stopped seeing that doctor and it turns out that I was later involved in a class section lawsuit against Vioxx.

220
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Because it was super dangerous drug. Like so I had a class section lawsuit against Vioxx at some point.

221
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I got like four or five hundred dollars. I bought like an external hard drive. I was like, "Oh, this is dope."

222
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 That's my heart stops. That's my heart stops. I'm all full of blood clots.

223
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Vioxx was bad. I ran over my own foot with the Palatjack. They didn't train me how to use one.

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I ended up getting a workman's comp suit against...Lennon's and things. That was the name of the company.

225
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I got a workman's comp suit against it. I couldn't work. I couldn't stand up. My foot got severed.

226
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 No, no, that's an exaggeration. I severed and nerve-in-it in my foot.

227
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And this was so great because like I just haven't known this workman's comp lawyer. He's like, "Dude, like the foot is the worst thing."

228
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Right? If you had to like nick your arm or something like that, yeah, we'd give you all the Vioxx you wanted, but you wouldn't like...

229
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 We wouldn't be able to load you up. And what happened was I got...this was like 20 years ago.

230
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I got like seven thousand dollars from Lennon's and things. And they paid for me to go to college.

231
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Because they're like, "You need this guy. This man will never be able to walk again, your honor. This man...

232
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 I'm all in a full-body mess. I'm all laying around in the courtroom. They bring it to bed and I'm laying in between the bed and the wall in the courtroom.

233
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They're like, "Sir, this man will never walk again. He, me, and California, they have this thing. It was like retraining."

234
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 They're like, "This man will never be able to sell another Lennon or thing again, your honor."

235
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 So they paid for...because I was in community college, they paid for me to go to community college.

236
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And they paid me every single month. It was insane. It was so insane. I got seven thousand dollars cash.

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 They paid me, I think, maybe a thousand or twelve hundred dollars a month on top of the seven thousand dollar payout.

238
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And they paid for all of my schooling. Well, all my community college schooling.

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Everyone, I was like, "I'm time to go to Vassar." And they're like, "Oh, okay. We're holding on. That Vioxx has gone to your brain, sir, if you think we're paying for that school."

240
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 But yeah, all the cut, and they did not train me, and people would laugh. They'd go, "Jason, what training do you need to run a pallet jack?"

241
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And I go, "Obviously some." Because I ran over my foot and I severed a nerve in the side. It still acts up.

242
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Like, obviously I still have...I'm on jobs, I'm on my feet and stuff like that. But just the other day I was walking on the street and I can still feel it.

243
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I can still feel it. I still wanted something still around me if I were going to have to see them again.

244
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Anyways, yeah, I ran over my own foot with a pallet jack. What happened was I was walking with it and I stopped.

245
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And the way it's designed that the rollers keep moving when you stop, because I was pulling it behind me or to the side of me or something,

246
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I stopped probably to talk to a girl and it ran over my foot. It kept rolling. And just like, you know, this thing just, I mean, it...

247
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I ran over my own foot. I ran over my own foot. Got a lot of money. I mean, I was on a work for like three or four years. It was insane.

248
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But it got paid. Anyways, that's not what this story is about. This story is about another man, a guy who's competent with the pallet jack, knows how to use him.

249
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 He's loading up this container. Job well done. He sees all the pallets in there. He's like, "Yes, I've done my job. It's time to go to the break room and have a soda."

250
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 What happens is Tommy walks out of the trailer and then he turns around to do one more glance, make sure like everything is still packed well.

251
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Probably just wanted to remind her job well done, right? People who use pallet jacks, they're very proud. Those things are quite complicated to use.

252
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 He turns around and he looks into the trailer and he sees his boss standing in the trailer.

253
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And he thought that was weird. I mean, obviously, listen, this boss will check on his work. That's what bosses are there for.

254
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 But he immediately thinks, "Wait a second. I just walked out of the trailer. Alex wasn't in the trailer. The trailer's mostly full at this point. How did Alex get in there?"

255
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And his boss, Alex, then turns around. He was standing there with his back to Tommy, kind of also looking at how everything was packed in.

256
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And Tommy goes, "Alex turns around and he... Something was wrong with him. Forget the fact that I just loaded this thing full of pallets. I was in and out of this container multiple times, never saw my boss.

257
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Forget the fact that I had just walked out of there and somehow unknowingly my boss snuck past me and then got into the container right when I walked out. Forget all that stuff."

258
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 The dude was gray. His face just looked so pale and sickly that there was something obviously wrong about him. Forget everything else. He's sick.

259
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And not just that. He said, "He turned and he looked and he looked very ashy and pale and he looked scary."

260
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 So not like when you go to work and you see someone and it looks like they're a little under the weather, you're like, "Dude, are you okay? You look really sick. You're like super pale."

261
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Alex's appearance actually scared Tommy. And Tommy goes, "Hey, hey, how'd you get in there? Are you okay, bud?" He's asking him all these questions. He's concerned. He's curious. He's like, "Why is he so scary, bro? Why are you scaring me, man?"

262
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And Alex completely ignores Tommy. Doesn't answer any of his questions. Just walks past Tommy out of the trailer and leaves that section of the warehouse.

263
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 He sees him just walk away and Tommy's like, "What in the world was that? Super creepy." And Alex never ignores me. Something's wrong. Something's totally wrong. So Alex figures, "I'm just going to go to his office and see what's up."

264
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 He walks to Alex's office, the lights off. What's going on?

265
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 He finds a coworker and goes, "Hey, have you seen Alex? Something's really wrong. He looks sick. He looks really sickly and he's ignoring me." He walked right past me. He was standing in the container I was working on. And then I was talking to him. He just walked away left of the warehouse. He's not acting right.

266
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And the coworker goes, "He's not here, Tommy. Alex left on an errand about 20 minutes ago. He's not here." And at this point, Tommy's like to, again, like in the first story, you're starting to panic. You know what you saw.

267
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 He hasn't been gone for 20 minutes. It's just impossible. So Tommy goes out to the parking lot. Alex's car is gone.

268
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Tommy says at this point he starts to get a full-on panic attack. Like, he knows what he saw, but he's being given information that is making that impossible. And even if Alex was in the building, that was enough.

269
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Like, something's wrong. Something was scary when he looked at Alex. And he needed an answer to that, but now he's finding that Alex has been gone for 20 minutes. And Tommy goes, "I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. Like, I felt full-on like I was just going to die. Like, probably maybe the first panic attack he's ever had, because that's what it feels like.

270
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I felt like I was going to die. And the creepiest part of the story was I was sitting there, and for whatever reason, the thing I was hung up on the most was what he looked like. He goes, "Because I cannot get the image out of my head of Alex standing in the shipping container.

271
00:27:44,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 He goes, "I can't get it out of my head. When I close my eyes, I see him standing there in the container looking at me. And I just remember how terrified I was. And I can't get that image out of my head. I just can't."

272
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Later, and this is interesting, we don't know if it was the same night. It might have been the next day, but it was announced at the workplace that Alex had died the previous night in a car accident. When he was out running errands, he was killed in a traffic collision.

273
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 So this goes back to that story of, like we talked about in the first one, the traditional ghost story. You're seeing the ghost, you're seeing what you, it looks like a real human. You don't know they're dead yet.

274
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And then later on you find out that they had died at the time you'd seen them. But this story has a twist. This is a super, super interesting way to look at this. This was originally posted online by someone going by the name Lonelyad9225.

275
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Remember this story just happened in the third week of February. We're recording this on the first, second week of March. He's like, "I don't want to go back to work. I don't want to go back to work. This was terrifying, but I have to go to work."

276
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And this story is so recent that this is an ongoing thing. It's not something that he can look back on and go, "Man, you won't believe what happened when I was 25 working at a warehouse, but now I'm 45. It's happening now and the events are still rolling out."

277
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And he goes, "I don't want to go back. I'm terrified." But imagine if, like it's one thing if your house is haunted. I mean that would be the worst because that's where you're supposed to go rest. But I think the second worst place would be your job, right?

278
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 If you could pass 100 haunted graveyards on the way to work, as long as your work and your home are fine, whatever, you see little ghost girls dancing on the street and all sorts of crazy stuff.

279
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Don't pick up any hitchhikers on your carpool, but imagine at work having a ghost. And you go, "That's fine. I work at, you know, KB Toy Store and there's a little ghost kid walking around the hallway."

280
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 That's fine. I mean, that'd be super terrifying. They're like, "Hey, you got to work the night shift." You're like, "I get it. I'm not a kid, man. Come on."

281
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 They have video cameras set up. You don't know. They actually have a YouTube show of you just being terrified late at night at this KB Toy Store.

282
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 It's one thing to work at a haunted location. It's completely different to work at a place that's haunted by your boss.

283
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Because remember, this ghost, this gross-looking ghost, this scary ghost, was checking Tommy's work.

284
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And if you didn't think that was the case at first, you thought maybe he was like, "Ah, before I go into the afterlife, I want to look at one more truck full of pellets. That's all I want."

285
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 No. After this happened, another co-worker said, "I was in the break room a couple days ago and I was the only one in the break room."

286
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 And all of a sudden, I wasn't the only one in the break room. I turned and I looked around and there was no one else in there, but I felt like there was someone else in there.

287
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And then I felt that unmistakable sensation of someone just staring at me.

288
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I turned and I looked around in the empty break room and there was no one in there, but I can tell someone is staring at me. And then I realized that whoever is staring at me is standing right behind me.

289
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Now, this employee did not say, "But I only took a 15-minute break. If she's the only one in the break room, it could have easily been a 20-minute long break."

290
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And imagine having a ghost boss.

291
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Right? Now, all of a sudden, every single rule has to be followed. 15-minute breaks or 15 minutes?

292
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 No running over your own foot with a ballot jack?

293
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 You have to do everything according to it. You're trying to fib on your time sheet. You're going into the fridge to eat someone else's lunch.

294
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 All of this stuff. Human raccoons is what I used to call those people because people did that to me all the time. They'd sneak any rabbit lunch.

295
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Human raccoons, but you have all of these little rules. That's a big rule. I hate it when people steal other people's food, but other than that, other than work theft or whatever, you're stealing a couple ballot jacks.

296
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 You're like, "Ah, they're not going to notice these missing." That's fine. But imagine having a ghost boss that is constantly keeping an eye on you at work.

297
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I mean, a real boss is whatever, but a ghost boss would be the worst, right? You're going to the bathroom and then you pull out your phone and you hear like a knock on the stall.

298
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 You're like, "Ah, okay, okay, boss. I'll put the phone back in my pocket." The ghost is like, "Nope, drop it in the toilet."

299
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Drop it in the toilet so you'll learn your lesson. You're like, "Okay, boss ghost."

300
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Like a real ghost, I mean, a real boss couldn't follow you into the bathroom and be like, "I've noticed that you stopped defecating five minutes ago. Get back to work."

301
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 But a ghost could. A ghost could. That would be terrible.

302
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So having a ghost boss would be the worst and you don't have any control over it. It's not like you can even report him, right? He's doing all this illegal stuff.

303
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 He's stuffing merchandise in your pockets. He's been trying to get you fired for years, but now that he's a ghost, you're like, "What? No, I didn't... I came in with these pallets. I came in with these big woods that have the company name stamped on them."

304
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 And they're like, "Well, look at this footage. We don't see you carrying them in." He was like, "Oh, he's manipulating the footage. Oh, you actually did steal those."

305
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 That's a bad example. Why would you bring your own pallets to work? You're like, "Yeah, they're very comfortable."

306
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 You know what I mean? Like, he could frame you. I guess he could just scare you. I guess I don't know why he turned him into a villain.

307
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 He would just be the boss from hell, right? He would be a boss that you can never complain about. You can never report.

308
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 And you would have to follow every rule. Every single rule. And what are you going to do about it?

309
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I mean, I guess you could also say, "Well, what's he going to do about it, right? He can't fire me."

310
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 He can't fire me. He's a ghost. It's not like a pin is going to magically start writing out a disciplinary form.

311
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 But what if? What if you're like, "You're sitting there in your office and you're getting written up and you're like...

312
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 You turn to your living boss. You're like, "I don't have to take... Look, there's clearly not a human writing that up. It's clearly my dead boss."

313
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And the real boss is like, "Listen, man, I don't agree with the dead boss either, but that is the legal document he's filling out.

314
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 You are now legally written up. You're like, "Oh, man. But come on."

315
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So, would you work at a haunted workplace? That's been a question that we've asked over the years, I think, on this show.

316
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 The answer is yes, but I never thought about having the boss be the ghost. That would be the worst.

317
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 Like a customer floating around. I mean, listen, ghosts in and of themselves are depressing because you don't have ghosts without people dying.

318
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 But if you have a couple of ghosts floating around your local pharmacy, the line was too long to...

319
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 "Sir, sir, can I be treated first? I'm about to die of my illness in line."

320
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 And they're like, "Oh, no, you got to take a number. You got to stand in line."

321
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 People are like, "Eh." And then a ghost is floating around.

322
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Anyways, a couple of ghosts, customers. That'd be fine.

323
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 But a ghost boss would be awful. And I think even if they were a cool boss, I don't think they'd be a cool ghost.

324
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 I think they would just kind of be maybe more of a stickler because they'd be disappointed.

325
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 They're like, "Oh, man, I thought I was going to be like a Casper ghost and solve mysteries with a bunch of other ghosts."

326
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And I'm stuck at the CVS pharmacy for eternity and then they'll be like, "I might as well become a bad boss.

327
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 I might as well become what I never was in life, a terrible boss."

328
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 So I think that would be the worst. I think that would be one of the worst places to have a haunting because at the end of the day, you can't leave.

329
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 You could probably get another job somewhere. They're like, "Can we call your old boss to get a recommendation?"

330
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 And you're like, "Oh, no. Yes, his number is 666-H-E-L-L."

331
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 And they're like, "What?" "Yeah, you got to bring a Ouija board to all your interviews."

332
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 And you're like, "Listen, you want to talk to my old boss to get a recommendation here? Let's both put our fingers on this planchette."

333
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And the guy's like, "What? I'm not doing that. What? You let my old boss as a ghost, bro? He's haunting me. He's standing behind you right now."

334
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 I brought him to this interview. He's your problem now, and then you run out. They're like, "What? What's going on?"

335
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And then the interviewer feels eyes on the back of his head. He's like, "Ah."
