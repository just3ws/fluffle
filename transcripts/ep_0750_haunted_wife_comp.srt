1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 An old mystery finally has an answer.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,560
 Then we take a look at two cases of matrimony gone wrong.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,560
 First off, what would happen if your spouse suddenly gained the ability to read your mind?

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,720
 And then we travel to Louisiana to meet a young couple finally buying their very first

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
 home.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,860
 It's a fixer-upper, but they truly believe they can turn this into the home of their

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,640
 dreams.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,520
 That is, until it showed up.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm your host Jason Carbner, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,520
 I hope you guys have some exciting stuff on the horizon.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,080
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our newest Patreon supporters coming into

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
 Dead Rabbit Command right now.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,560
 He's edible, he's large and in charge.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,520
 It's pizza party, everyone give a big round of applause to pizza party.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,440
 Take a big bite out of them.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,480
 Pizza you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,120
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,640
 Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,080
 Talk about it online, we have flyers you can print out in the show notes, post those

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,840
 up around town.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,640
 Anything helps and the flyers actually do attract a lot of new listeners.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,560
 Pizza party, get those greasy hands cleaned off.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,060
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys so that Jason Jalopy, we are leaving behind

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,720
 Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed out to the local library.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,200
 The reason why we're headed to the library is because we're looking for a book.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,160
 A book called Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared by Jean Baudrillard.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,840
 I tried reading the synopsis of the book, it didn't make any sense.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,040
 So then I tried reading like a Wikipedia page from the student and that made less sense.

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
 Like who is this guy?

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,460
 French author apparently.

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,920
 And he wrote a book called Simulacra and Simulation.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,060
 That book is best known for being in the matrix.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,680
 In the matrix he uses that, like a hollowed out version of that book to hide like his

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,260
 keys and his credit card or his like data disks or whatever he was using.

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,900
 And you see, it was a simulation of a book, it was very very deep and it turns out that

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,480
 the Wachowskis based the matrix kind of, this book was kind of an influence for the matrix.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,580
 Like what is real, what is reality, are the symbols what's real, are the symbols represent

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
 something else?

42
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
 I don't know.

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,760
 I couldn't figure out what that book was about either.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,840
 But I'm assuming it has something to do with people dodging bullets and mass shooting.

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,520
 So anyways he writes this stuff and he wrote this book called Why Hasn't Everything Already

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,840
 Disappeared and from what I could gather it's about things to think about.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,580
 It's appearing like things vanishing and the ethereal nature of information and images

48
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,600
 and stories and things just eventually go away and then we don't know what it is.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,780
 I think that's what he was saying in this book.

50
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,980
 Now the reason why I'm learning about this is I got an email from Symbiogenesis69 and

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,060
 they were letting me know they were reading this book.

52
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,500
 They didn't tell me what the book was about by the way.

53
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,900
 They go, Jason's smart enough.

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,860
 He'll figure it out.

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,100
 This is breaking news.

56
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,800
 In this book, right now you're going to see a photo of it, in this book Why Hasn't Everything

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,200
 Already Disappeared is a photo of a solar plexus clown glider.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,680
 There's little asterisks next to that.

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,600
 The photo you're looking at, assuming you're not lifting weights, you're not trying to set

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,320
 a personal best and you can look over at your phone, is an image that is constantly connected

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,600
 to the idea of the solar plexus clown gliders.

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,180
 We did an episode 69 I covered these guys.

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,420
 It's a creepypasta or is it?

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,660
 It's a really interesting episode.

65
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,460
 I kind of state that there could be something like this, but I didn't think it had anything

66
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,460
 to do with this photo.

67
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,020
 But a lot of times when you see something about the solar plexus clown gliders, this

68
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,700
 photo will be next to it.

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,020
 Is this a photo or is this an illustration of a solar plexus clown glider?

70
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,860
 Nobody knew the source of the photo or if they did, they didn't go on the paranormal

71
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,860
 boards.

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,900
 They weren't talking about it.

73
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,720
 This has been around for years.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 And Symbiogenesis69 was reading this book and goes, "Oh, this is the origin of this

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
 photo."

76
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
 So they sent me a photograph of them.

77
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,360
 That's the photo you're looking at now.

78
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,680
 Holding up the book.

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,240
 And then Hootscheech on the Patreon Discord actually got another image.

80
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
 I'll put that up here.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
 Thank you very much.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
 It's a clearer one.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,280
 You can see the writing on the book.

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
 You can see what the page is about.

85
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,680
 It makes no sense.

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
 But so that's it.

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
 We now know.

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,100
 I think that's what we all figured, right?

89
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,740
 That it was just a photo shop that someone had made.

90
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,660
 But it's so fascinating that now we know where that photo came from.

91
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,980
 It's always been linked to the creepypasta.

92
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,900
 It came from this book and the book is about the nature of things just kind of vanishing.

93
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,660
 The origin of things just disappearing.

94
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,740
 And it's so fascinating that a photo in a book about things disappearing, its entire

95
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,820
 backstory disappears.

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,260
 Its source disappears and it's linked to the solar plexus clown glider thing.

97
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,000
 And one of the listeners of this show just happened to be flipping through the book.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,960
 Going "I don't understand it either, but I have a book report due tomorrow.

99
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
 Oh no.

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
 I'll just look at the pictures."

101
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,200
 And so the origin disappeared of the photo, just like the book would have predicted.

102
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,040
 And I'm wondering if it was intentional, honestly.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,360
 I'm curious about that.

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,400
 And I have these images linked in the show notes as well, so if you want to take another

105
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
 look.

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,440
 Or if the next time you see people talking about solar plexus clown gliders, you can

107
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,800
 share this bit of information.

108
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,360
 Over the weekend I posted this on X.

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
 Like I couldn't wait to tell the story.

110
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,860
 I posted this on the X board.

111
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,620
 And we had a pretty good discussion out of it, because we'd been wondering what this

112
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,180
 photo or drawing was this whole time.

113
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,340
 And it was from this book.

114
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,540
 So really, really cool symbiogenesis 69 for finding that.

115
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,900
 Really, really appreciate having one more piece of that mystery.

116
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,100
 What is a solar plexus clown glider?

117
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
 Pizza party.

118
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,500
 I'm going to go and entach you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,460
 We're leaving behind the local library.

120
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,860
 We are headed all the way out to any town, USA.

121
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,680
 I mean, free imagination could be the same town at the local library.

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,160
 This could actually be your neighbor.

123
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,360
 There's a person online who goes by the name Leia Cares.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,200
 So we'll just say that her name's Leia.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,320
 And she posted this online.

126
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,840
 She said, "I can read my boyfriend's mind."

127
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
 You go, "Jason, that's weird."

128
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
 One, that she can read her boyfriend's mind.

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 Two, in the intro, you said they were married.

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,520
 What type of quality control do you have on this show?

131
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,900
 And I tell you, yeah, that is weird that she can read her boyfriend's mind, right?

132
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,140
 So she posts this.

133
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,580
 She goes, "I can read my boyfriend's mind."

134
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,700
 Which is creepy, right?

135
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,500
 Everyone wants to read other people's minds, but no one wants to have their mind read.

136
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,380
 And imagine if it was your significant other.

137
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,260
 There's actual stakes there.

138
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,180
 Some random stranger read your mind and you're, who cares, right?

139
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,140
 But if your significant other sitting next to you knows what you're thinking at all

140
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,720
 times, knows when you start daydreaming when she's droning on and on about something or

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,200
 she's talking about that stupid show she's watching or whatever.

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,760
 But what if she knew for a fact that you were thinking about anything but her 99% of the

143
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 time?

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,400
 It would be awful.

145
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,640
 You go, "Jason, maybe you should spend more time thinking about her."

146
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 Well, no.

147
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,200
 I think the onus is still on her.

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,480
 She shouldn't be a telepath.

149
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,160
 Well, Leia here says that she's a telepath.

150
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,900
 And really, I'm focusing on why you want to want your girlfriend to be a telepath.

151
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
 I guess I've kind of buried the lead.

152
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,380
 There's a human who can read minds.

153
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,540
 There's a human who has the ability to read another human's brain.

154
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,300
 And this is, you want proof of this, right?

155
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
 You want proof of this.

156
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,060
 So she gives some proof on this post.

157
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,060
 She says sometimes she's sitting next to her boyfriend and she thinks, "Put your arm

158
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,860
 around me."

159
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,340
 And he puts his arm around her.

160
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,600
 Now you go, "Jason, that's what good boyfriends do, right?

161
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,840
 They put their arms around their girlfriends."

162
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,560
 Yes, but the power of thought, you're ignoring that.

163
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,600
 See before this, all he would ever do was hold her hand.

164
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,160
 But this particular time, she thought, "Put your arm around me.

165
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
 Put your arm around me.

166
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
 Put your arm...

167
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 She did that.

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,280
 She did that for 15 minutes."

169
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,480
 And then finally he put his arm around her.

170
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,860
 I'm starting to think that he might be the telepath.

171
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,240
 He's like, "Oh my God, if you think that one word...

172
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,340
 Fine, I'll just put my arm around you."

173
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
 You got disgusting sweaty shoulders, but...

174
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,820
 Otherwise you're just going to drive me crazy with your chance for 15 minutes.

175
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
 Put your arm around me.

176
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
 Put your arm around me.

177
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,180
 So, but it works, right?

178
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,940
 And then once that's not proof, bro.

179
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,940
 Come on, man.

180
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
 Why are you even listening to this?

181
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,180
 Why are you even listening to this podcast?

182
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,060
 Well, you don't believe in the paranormal?

183
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
 That's total proof.

184
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,180
 But sure, I'll give you more.

185
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,800
 This woman was out with her boyfriend and they're with a bunch of other friends and

186
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,160
 everyone's talking.

187
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,320
 Everyone's talking to each other.

188
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,720
 And she's standing there silently and she thinks, "Can you hear me?"

189
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
 And right when she thinks that, her boyfriend nods, "Yes."

190
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
 How...

191
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,560
 Is it possible he was nodding, "Yes?"

192
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
 To someone...

193
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,360
 Something else, somebody else said, "There's a group of people."

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,560
 Maybe one of them said, "Have you already eaten dinner or did you like that movie or

195
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,180
 why is your girlfriend slowly going insane?"

196
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,620
 Well, her eyeball is like little spirals.

197
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,420
 Like she's trying to hypnotize you.

198
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,780
 He nods, "Yes, so that was him confirming he can hear her."

199
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
 Fine, you want more proof?

200
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,980
 Well, once she thought, "I wish my boyfriend was home.

201
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,460
 I wonder how long it's going to take for him to get home."

202
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,020
 And then she heard a voice in her head.

203
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,620
 That's always the best way for these stories to evolve.

204
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,460
 First she's putting random actions and trying to find some order in the universe.

205
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:00,320
 Now there's voices in her head and the voice goes, "Five minutes."

206
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,600
 And will you believe this five minutes later?

207
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,480
 Five minutes after an alien voice appeared in her brain and spoke in a voice not her

208
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,520
 own, her boyfriend showed up five minutes later.

209
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,600
 And one time she includes this in her story, she has really, really bad back pain.

210
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,440
 And so she's laying there, her back hurts, and then the boyfriend starts holding his

211
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,120
 hand over her back.

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,380
 Like he's not touching her, he's doing like the hover hand thing.

213
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,860
 And the pain went away.

214
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,260
 So that has nothing to do with telepathy.

215
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,340
 And that actually makes him also this miracle worker.

216
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,260
 But using his hand, he was able to put some energy in her that made her back pain, her

217
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,180
 chronic back pain go away.

218
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,980
 And finally, finally you guys are like, "Okay, good.

219
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
 This is wrapping up.

220
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,420
 This is insanity is wrapping up."

221
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,220
 She started waving her hand over his forehead.

222
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,060
 This is some really weird foreplay.

223
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,060
 She started waving her hand over his forehead and he fell asleep.

224
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,680
 I'm sure he's just, he's like, "I'll just pretend to be asleep as long as this madness

225
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,360
 ends."

226
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,040
 So she writes this whole post and this is, the reason why I'm talking about this is not

227
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,400
 necessarily because I've just confirmed that telepathy does exist in the human species.

228
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,240
 And I've presented several pieces of factual based evidence to support that argument.

229
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
 That's not the reason why I covered that.

230
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,680
 The reason why I'm covering this is after this whole post, this is so genius.

231
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
 I'm kind of mad.

232
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,720
 I didn't think of this.

233
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,420
 I'm so mad I didn't think about this.

234
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,340
 Leia writes this whole post about how she's getting into spirituality and she's aligning

235
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,180
 her chakras and then she can read her boyfriend's mind and healing and putting him to sleep

236
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,100
 and all this stuff.

237
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,180
 She ends it with this.

238
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,140
 This is genius.

239
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,860
 After telling this whole story, here is a great resource if you want to learn more.

240
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,300
 And it's a link to the Gaia app.

241
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,040
 Now Gaia, if you don't know, I often call it Oprah level metaphysics.

242
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,640
 It's just really, really to the masses, bored, wine, housewife, spirituality.

243
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,140
 At best.

244
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,140
 At best.

245
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,320
 A lot of times they have people who say that they are ancient Atlantean warriors reincarnated

246
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,680
 and they have this like, the equivalent of like an animated series on there about how

247
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,720
 cool Atlantis used to be if only you were there as well.

248
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,380
 They do a lot of just flat out things of dubious factual origin, right?

249
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,380
 I don't want to come out because I've been wracking up a lot of enemies lately.

250
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,380
 I've been wracking up a lot of enemies lately.

251
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,940
 I don't want to come out and straight up call them fraud and hucksters.

252
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,740
 But let's just say dubious factual material on Gaia at worst.

253
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,420
 Sometimes it's just completely harmless.

254
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,820
 Breathe in, breathe out, orbs floating around you, energy, stuff like that.

255
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,800
 That's what Gaia is.

256
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,480
 And I read this and it was like a punchline to a story because I'm reading this and I'm

257
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,000
 laughing because I'm like, these are the most ridiculous pieces of proof that you're telepathic.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,740
 And I get to that and I thought, this is genius.

259
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,820
 This has to be on purpose.

260
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,340
 What a awesome way to promote your product.

261
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,380
 Now I went through her post history and she's really big into like gangstalking.

262
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,680
 So that makes sense where she's starting to see these weird connections.

263
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,680
 Like, I'm thinking something, I'm thinking something and then something happens.

264
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,180
 Like that does, we do see that in gangstalking community.

265
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,000
 Looking for patterns where there are none.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,140
 So I don't personally think that this is a Gaia employee, right?

267
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,900
 Could you imagine having your marketing department, have your marketing department run by much

268
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,700
 people who think they're being gangstalked.

269
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,620
 You're like, Willis, where's your report from Tuesday?

270
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,740
 They're like, they're hiding under their desk.

271
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,140
 They would assume you were the gangster, the boss.

272
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,060
 Of course you have to keep track of them.

273
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,860
 How come you didn't punch out the other day, Jones?

274
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,540
 Yeah, how do you know everything about me?

275
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,720
 Because you have a time card because you work here.

276
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,880
 Because I have your social security number.

277
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
 Ah, like you wouldn't want to have that.

278
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,040
 But she may not work for Gaia.

279
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,760
 Again, I would hope not.

280
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,280
 I hope she's, I'm sure she's a lovely person.

281
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 And I wish her the best.

282
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,320
 I'm not trying to say that she's a lunatic who believes everyone's stalking her.

283
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,360
 However, I would not probably want to hire her, right?

284
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,600
 If she thought that people were coming after her.

285
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,400
 But again, I don't want to lambast the woman too much.

286
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,780
 My point is, is that this is, if this is a perfect marketing tactic.

287
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,540
 Tell a spooky story with product placement.

288
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,500
 How have, how have no one ever thought about this before?

289
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,780
 You have to be careful about it, but you could do it.

290
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,820
 What if, because think about it, you scoff at that idea.

291
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,140
 But Squidward Suicide, it promotes SpongeBob.

292
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,060
 Nobody watches.

293
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,580
 Nobody reads Squidward Suicide, which is a creepypasta that actually unnerved me back

294
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,820
 in the day when I first read it.

295
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,860
 I was like, huh?

296
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,760
 No one reads Squidward Suicide and then goes checks out SpongeBob.

297
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,000
 But it reminds you of SpongeBob, right?

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
 Brand awareness.

299
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,840
 I'm not saying that you need to have a slender man walking around drinking Pepsi and eating

300
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,840
 Doritos, but I'm also saying there's no reason why you shouldn't.

301
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,280
 When you're making up these creepypastas, you could easily fit in product placement.

302
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,280
 You could just have the story start off at a McDonald's.

303
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 And then they're like getting on the bikes.

304
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,840
 The kids are investigating Slender Man.

305
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,720
 They get on their bikes and they go out to the forest and they're like, oh man, my shoes

306
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,720
 are wet.

307
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,980
 The other kids are like, I have Nikes.

308
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
 They don't get wet at all.

309
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,540
 And you wouldn't even think that it was an ad.

310
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,380
 And then the kids are getting his guts ripped out by Slender Man.

311
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,140
 He's like getting just his clothes ripped to shreds and these long talons are digging

312
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,260
 into young flesh and pulling out intestines.

313
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,820
 This other guy goes, maybe if he had to leave eyes, if he had durable leave-on jeans on,

314
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,300
 it wouldn't have been able to get to his tasty, tasty abdomen.

315
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,780
 And he's like, oh, save me, save me.

316
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,420
 You could work this in.

317
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,660
 And it would make more sense with stuff like this.

318
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,000
 You could easily write these.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,760
 I think my house is haunted, but I got rid of it.

320
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,960
 And the way I got rid of it was I went to use this service.

321
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,000
 Because the fact is someone posted on No Sleep, someone posted on a fictional Reddit board

322
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,720
 the story of staircases being found in the middle of nowhere.

323
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,760
 Two weeks ago, I watched a movie based on that premise.

324
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,120
 That was something that someone wrote as a fictional story and it became such a meme.

325
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,280
 People believe that it's real.

326
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,800
 People think that those stories are actually real.

327
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,580
 And it's so part of the horror consciousness they made a movie about it.

328
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,860
 So these things can be marketed and if it can be marketed, put marketing in it.

329
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
 This is genius.

330
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
 This is genius level marketing.

331
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,620
 Now, I don't know how many people subscribe to Gaia from this post, but it's probably

332
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,620
 more than one.

333
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,860
 The post got someone to click on that link and to someone to download the free Gaia app.

334
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,260
 See if they can also read their boyfriend's mind.

335
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,700
 It's fascinating marketing.

336
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,000
 I don't necessarily think this person works for Gaia, but I think we're going to see

337
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 more of this in the future, honestly.

338
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,160
 Because this is super, super smart.

339
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,000
 These stories go viral so quickly and if one really catches on, I mean you can have it

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 backfired too, right?

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 With Wayfair.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Wayfair forever is going to be associated with child trafficking on the conspiracy theory

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 side of things.

344
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,440
 They'll never shake that.

345
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,880
 They'll never shake that.

346
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,540
 But imagine if that was a good thing.

347
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,640
 Imagine if the conspiracy theory was somehow that Wayfair stopped child trafficking.

348
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,680
 Like the conspiracy was different.

349
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,320
 And when you read the conspiracy theory about child traffickers coming over from Nairobi

350
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,480
 and they have this big shipment and then there were some Wayfair employees who stopped

351
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,120
 them, it turns out that they have a group of people.

352
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,400
 And that was the conspiracy theory, how they're waging a secret war against a deep state.

353
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,940
 It'd be perfect marketing for them.

354
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,840
 And it would have gone viral and they would have come out and denied it if people had

355
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,360
 been like, "Well, of course they have to deny it.

356
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
 They're fighting pedophiles."

357
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
 Fascinating.

358
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,860
 You could really, really use this to your advantage.

359
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,980
 If I can figure out a way to do it, we will see.

360
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,980
 But for now, pizza party, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbon

361
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
 decopter.

362
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,900
 We are leaving behind a local town.

363
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:56,460
 We are headed all the way out to Louisiana.

364
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,020
 In Louisiana, we don't have this guy's real name, but we're going to call him Kevin.

365
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,780
 That's his real name, that's just a guess.

366
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,640
 We're in Louisiana, it's March 2021.

367
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,720
 And Kevin's driving his car, sitting next to him is this beautiful young wife, Julie.

368
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,200
 She's looking out at the trees, changing color.

369
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,360
 They drive through their neighborhood.

370
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,400
 They are on their way to enter their first home.

371
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,960
 They've been married for five years and they, of course, they'd obviously seen this house,

372
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
 they picked it up.

373
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
 But this is the first time they're going to be going into this home as home owners.

374
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,440
 It's this magical moment for this young couple.

375
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,120
 And as Kevin is taking in the silence of this house, he goes, "Man, what a crazy journey

376
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 it's been."

377
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,980
 Like, both of them had fairly rough childhoods, but they found each other and they fell in

378
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
 love.

379
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,980
 Everything is good.

380
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,620
 They're not drinkers, they're not drug users, they have no underlying mental illnesses.

381
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,460
 The future looks bright.

382
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,860
 The reason why they're in Louisiana was he just got a new job that took them to the

383
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,100
 area and they have this home.

384
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,900
 And it's a fixer upper, but a month after they move in, Julie starts to have horrific

385
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 nightmares.

386
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,440
 "Are you okay, Julie?"

387
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
 Kevin said.

388
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,760
 "I'm fine, but the nightmares are getting worse."

389
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,000
 Kevin said that his wife started to have such bad nightmares.

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,880
 Some nights she would just stay up.

391
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,720
 "Hey honey, it's time for bed, aren't you ready to go to bed?"

392
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,960
 "I don't know.

393
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
 The nightmares.

394
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,080
 I don't want to have the nightmares again."

395
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:33,500
 They were so intense she wouldn't sleep.

396
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,260
 But of course that's not sustainable.

397
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,860
 So she would eventually fall asleep and be plagued with terrifying dreams.

398
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,180
 At one point they end up meeting someone who knew the reputation of the house.

399
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,860
 And they go, "Oh, you live in that house?

400
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,420
 Well, yeah, that house has its stories.

401
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
 You know it's haunted, right?"

402
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,100
 And Kevin and Julie, they don't believe in ghosts.

403
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,540
 And it just doesn't really, "Oh, you know, that's something that kids talk about and

404
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,920
 spooky Halloween stuff, right?

405
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
 Ghosts don't really exist."

406
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,000
 But the person they're talking to goes, "Oh no, no, no, that house is haunted."

407
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
 Actually knew the old man who used to live there, previous to you guys moving into like,

408
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,760
 he was the tenant right before you guys.

409
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,720
 And he was an old man and he would always complain about the ghosts.

410
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,640
 He would always complain about not feeling comfortable there, but he was old and stubborn

411
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
 and he didn't want to move.

412
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,040
 So he just dealt with it.

413
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,760
 But again, they just kind of laugh off the story.

414
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,540
 That's something that the kids in the neighborhood are talking about.

415
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,940
 Maybe the old man was losing it, right?

416
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,180
 Maybe he had a bit of dementia.

417
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,420
 Over time, Kevin starts to become concerned for his wife.

418
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,540
 Now, the nightmares are less frequent, but sometimes in the middle of the night, he'll

419
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:51,300
 just wake up and she'll be standing at the edge of the bed, staring off at a wall, staring

420
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,340
 out towards the window.

421
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,080
 Just standing there silently.

422
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
 And he would always ask, "Julie, what are you doing?"

423
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,760
 Just thinking.

424
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,280
 She'd reply.

425
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,920
 Something seemed off about her during the day as well.

426
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,080
 Sometimes he would catch her talking to herself, muttering to herself.

427
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,800
 Now that's something that people do, but he had never witnessed her kind of just talking

428
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,680
 to herself while she's in the kitchen or talking to herself while she's sitting in the living

429
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,760
 room.

430
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,240
 It's odd to him.

431
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,900
 It's an odd escalation.

432
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,740
 One day he comes home from work.

433
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,300
 What didn't show up early was a normal day for him to be coming home.

434
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
 Begins walking through the house.

435
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,540
 Now, one of the rooms they were working on, they were planning on painting, so they had

436
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,300
 moved nothing into this room.

437
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,860
 They wanted to paint the walls.

438
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,900
 And while he was at work, his wife was doing that.

439
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,020
 His wife was painting this room.

440
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,300
 And he comes in the front door and he begins walking through the house and he hears his

441
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,740
 wife talking.

442
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,160
 Her voice is coming from the empty room that she's painting and he begins to walk through

443
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,800
 the house and he can hear her talking.

444
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:07,040
 And then the hair on the back of his neck sticks up when he hears another voice coming

445
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
 from the room.

446
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,760
 He doesn't recognize the voice, but he can tell it's a male voice.

447
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,120
 It's deep.

448
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,080
 He begins walking towards the door and he can hear this conversation continue.

449
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,940
 His hand reaches for the door knob and then he hears clear his day.

450
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,340
 He's coming.

451
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,940
 Kevin flings the door open.

452
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:38,780
 And there in the empty room saved for a few drop cloths and paint cans stands his wife

453
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,820
 all alone.

454
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,380
 She looks pissed off at him.

455
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,340
 And when he asks who she was talking to, she simply responds.

456
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,920
 Nobody.

457
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,640
 And goes back to painting the walls.

458
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,280
 This post ends with him saying I don't know what to do.

459
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,440
 I don't believe in ghosts.

460
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,400
 So I went the route of maybe there's some sort of leak.

461
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
 Set up a carbon monoxide detector, nothing.

462
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,280
 Had the house checked for radon, nothing.

463
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,440
 It has to be something real, right?

464
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,840
 Is my wife losing her mind?

465
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
 Am I?

466
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,080
 Is there some sort of medical problem?

467
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,820
 It can't be ghosts.

468
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,700
 It can't be ghosts.

469
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,940
 What is happening to my wife?

470
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:35,260
 It's super interesting because this was originally posted on Reddit in the relationship subreddit.

471
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,700
 And this was the title of it.

472
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,140
 Worried about my wife and I don't know who to talk to about my bizarre situation.

473
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,460
 He was posted to this relationship subreddit and it's like, is anyone else experienced

474
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
 this?

475
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,300
 How many years does your wife just go nuts?

476
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,580
 Is this one thing I missed in all the manuals?

477
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,580
 And then it got reposted to the ghosts subreddit.

478
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,660
 I think it was ghost subreddit.

479
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,420
 It's irrelevant now because they've both been deleted.

480
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,620
 I had to archive this.

481
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,020
 I've learned my lesson with Reddit.

482
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,060
 A lot of times people would post something super interesting and then Reddit goes, "Nope.

483
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,820
 We don't like that cool interesting story someone posted so they just wipe it out."

484
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,640
 So I have it archived.

485
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,980
 But it's gone from the relationship board and it's gone from the ghost board.

486
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,340
 This was a throwaway account.

487
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
 And I emailed him.

488
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,820
 I haven't heard anything back because I had some other questions about stuff.

489
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
 But it's a fascinating story.

490
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,540
 Now obviously it could be fake.

491
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,420
 It could just be some sort of fake viral marketing thing, right?

492
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,220
 It does sound a lot like paranormal activity.

493
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,420
 So we have to address that.

494
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,100
 But it's a fascinating story and he ends it when he says, "I'm creeped out by both my

495
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,180
 house and my wife."

496
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,820
 And when we think about haunted houses, when we think about these locations we go to that

497
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
 are haunted.

498
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,540
 In the back of any paranormal investigator's mind is the fear of possession.

499
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,860
 So you do think about that.

500
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,700
 But just like the story before, if someone is a telepath but you have nothing to lose

501
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,420
 if they like you or don't like you or whatever, that's fine.

502
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,500
 But if it's your significant other, if it's someone close to you who you have a vested

503
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,660
 interest in putting on a good face and that you're attentive and stuff like that, it's

504
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,740
 the end.

505
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,100
 Because no one is that perfect of a loved one.

506
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,700
 You will always be like, "Oh, not again."

507
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
 And she would hear that.

508
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,820
 She would totally hear that.

509
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,780
 This is the same type of situation.

510
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,700
 If your house is haunted you could leave, which this house most likely is haunted based on

511
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
 this story.

512
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,620
 I mean, you could leave but the wife's fine with it.

513
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,500
 Would she want to leave?

514
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,660
 If both people were being tormented, they could easily leave the house.

515
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,620
 But if one person is under the thrall of this thing, "We've already spent so much money

516
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,180
 on this house, it's in a good area, this is where your job is," and stuff like that, they'll

517
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,740
 find other reason not to be like, "I must be here to serve the Dark Lord Gammigan.

518
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,420
 This is his portal to our realm."

519
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,620
 They're not going to give you that excuse.

520
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,900
 But that's really what the creatures in her brain are telling her.

521
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,180
 They're controlling her.

522
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,500
 They've broken her down mentally and spiritually by plaguing her in nightmares, by making it

523
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,860
 so she can't sleep, to getting her to a weakened state where now they are gaining ownership

524
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,820
 over her body.

525
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,100
 Your loved one, your wife.

526
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,660
 This isn't a simple "let's leave and take a loss on the haunted house, we'll sell it

527
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
 at a loss."

528
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
 This isn't that.

529
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,580
 This is their relationship.

530
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,180
 She won't leave now.

531
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,820
 Obviously, there are stories like that in the past where like a little kid in the family

532
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,980
 gets possessed or Amityville, the son gets possessed.

533
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,260
 However it is, you'll have family members get possessed.

534
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,980
 But we always approach those stories from the end.

535
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,500
 We always see like at the end of the infield haunting where the girl's communicating with

536
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 the demon.

537
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,780
 We see how it all worked out.

538
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,260
 This story is going on right now.

539
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,700
 We don't know how it's going to end.

540
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,740
 We may never get another update because this was posted and scrubbed within a day or two

541
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,900
 from Reddit.

542
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,460
 So he's going to look at it and go, "well obviously where do I post this?

543
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,940
 It's just going to keep getting taken down."

544
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,340
 He may never update it.

545
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,100
 It may simply resolve by itself and it's just this weird moment in time where you know that

546
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,900
 time in life where you get possessed by a maniac, a ghost in your house, it makes you

547
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,980
 talk to yourself.

548
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,380
 We don't know how this story is going to end.

549
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:17,980
 It could end with one day us finding a true crime story somewhere in Louisiana.

550
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,620
 A man kills his wife saying she was a demon.

551
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,140
 She came at me.

552
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,620
 It was my life or hers.

553
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,460
 Or the true crime story could be a crazed woman brutally butchers her husband in his

554
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
 sleep.

555
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,180
 They'd been married for five years and no one knows why she took that knife to his throat.

556
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,020
 But she did.

557
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,420
 You can leave a haunted house but can you leave a haunted marriage?

558
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:51,460
 If you truly loved the person they once were, how long would you stick around?

559
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,660
 How many warning signs would you ignore?

560
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:02,420
 How many sleepless nights, laying in the darkness, pretending to slumber?

561
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:10,540
 As you hear your wife crawl out of bed and then stand in the darkened room.

562
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,260
 How long could you live in such madness?

563
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:24,980
 I think Kevin is about to find out.

564
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,420
