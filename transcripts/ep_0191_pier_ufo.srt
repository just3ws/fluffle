1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The search for lizard people under the streets of LA.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 A form of witchcraft that only men can use.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at the story of Piers Zanfreda.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 An Italian night watchman who claimed he was abducted by aliens multiple times over the course of two years.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Why him? What did they want?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And were they telling the truth when they said they'd come back in large numbers today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm a freak down. Actually, I'm a walk freak down.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And we're having a better day if I didn't eat a bunch of carbs.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I feel super gross and super tired and ugh.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 That's the one drawback to the keto diet when you go out with your friends and they're like, "Hey, let's go to Lake Taco."

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Which is a really nice taco place if you're ever in Hood River and can find it.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 It's like in someone's backyard, but there's nothing there that I can really eat.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So I go, "Oh, you know, I'll just get the burrito." And then I've just felt grody all day long.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Plus, I also gave up caffeine a couple days ago just because it was giving me really bad anxiety attacks.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Like, really bad anxiety attacks.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So I think it's the combination of all that bread in my stomach or tortilla, to be exact.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And the lack of caffeine, but I'm starting this episode like three or four hours later than I normally would.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I've just been like, "Blah."

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I also went to Wikipedia and read every single-- well, I shouldn't say read.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I browsed every single entry on missing people in the decade of the 2000s.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So we're gonna have some-- I mean, there was probably like 40 or 50 there.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I picked out five that were actually interesting.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Sorry, families of other missing people.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I'm not saying that your loss sucks, but there are certain traits that I look for

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 when I'm looking for a good story to tell here.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 So again, sorry, guys, if you're a missing loved one, does not get selected for Dead Rabbit Radio.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 There's some really weird ones out there.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Now, our first story really is just a blurb.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We're headed to Zimbabwe.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Let's take the rabbit rowboat.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's been a long time since you broke this dude out.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I grab an ore, you grab an ore, and I know it's a long way and we're headed across the wrong ocean.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 But let's row all the way from Los Angeles to Zimbabwe.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I think Zimbabwe might be landlocked, I'm not for sure.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But we can always carry the canoe.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's pretty light.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 We're rowing across the ocean.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I read a bunch of stories about people disappearing at sea too, so I'm a little more cautious.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But we make it there.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 We make it there totally fine.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 We're now in Zimbabwe.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So the year is 2011.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 A woman is taking a shower.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Just a normal thing you do every day, hopefully.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 But she starts to feel something weird.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 She starts to feel like someone's in the shower with her, but nobody is.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Nobody is in the shower with her.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But she can feel movement around her body.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It's not soap suds, it's something in the shower with her.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And she starts to panic a bit.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 She can't figure it out.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And then she begins to realize that somehow she's being violated.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 At that point, she looks out the window and there was a man masturbating outside of her window.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 She calls the cops.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 The man runs away.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now when the cops show up, they're talking to the woman and she's like,

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "Listen, it was really weird.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I was taking a shower.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 This dude was outside my window jacking off."

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 The cops are all right in this town.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And she goes, "That was gross enough, but I don't know what happened.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I had the weirdest sensation that he was actually in the shower with me."

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 The two cops look at each other and they're like, "Oh, no, no, no.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We know exactly what you're talking about.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 That's not weird at all."

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And the woman's like, "What?

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 What do you mean that's not weird at all?"

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 The cops are like, "Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 You haven't heard about that?

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 You must be new in town."

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 It's called "Mubobobo."

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 The cops just totally unfazed, writing it down.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 "Mubobobo, what are you talking about?"

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 They're like, "Don't worry, we'll catch the guy."

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So what Mubobobo is?

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 It's basically a form of witchcraft or magic that is practiced by men in Zimbabwe,

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 where they can basically sexually assault a woman without touching her.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Now, whether or not this exists, I don't know.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 But there's been reports of it.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 That was one of them.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 The next year, also in Zimbabwe, and you may go,

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 "The dude was just being creepy.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 She just had a sixth sense, and she just kind of, her imagination ran wild."

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Possibly.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Possibly.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 In 2012 in Zimbabwe, there was a civic building.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 This woman was waiting for her passport.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 So it was a populated building.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 They have people working on the counters.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 You have little kids eating candy out of the little dish bowl.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 You have a dog that just kind of wandered in,

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 but it also needs a passport so it figures it stays.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It was a populated building.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So this woman is just standing in line, middle of the day, public place,

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 full of people waiting to get her passport renewed, passes out.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And when she wakes up, she's in a room full of people,

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 she tells them, "I've been raped."

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And everyone's like, "What?"

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Like, "No, we just saw you fall down."

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And she's like, "No, I've been raped."

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 So they call the cops.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 They call the ambulance too, because this woman just passed out for no reason.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 But they get the investigators down there, and the investigators are like,

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 she's saying the story, she was like, "Stand in line.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I was just waiting here to get my passport renewed to pass out."

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I think someone raped me, and the cops are like, "Right, right in their notes."

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Look at each other, and I'm like, "Yeah."

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 She's like, "So who did it? Which one of these people did it?"

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And they're like, "Nobody did it."

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 It was Mubobobo.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 What?

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Mubobobo.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 You got psychically raped.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 You might have felt like you were being raped,

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 but it was all magic.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And they start a full-blown investigation into the Mubobobo.

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 They're like, totally aware that it's a real thing.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 There's no skepticism.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 They're like, "No, we know what we're dealing with.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It's some sort of witchcraft.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 We're sorry that this happened to you.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 We're going to investigate it."

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So just like they would any sex crime, which I'm not mocking them.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 I mean, if it's a real thing, they definitely do need to investigate it.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I find it so bizarre that it's just so readily accepted,

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 but it's a cultural thing.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 But anyways, so these cops, they open an investigation into what happened.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 It turns out other women at that building, the same thing that happened to them,

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 they just never reported it.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And there's been reports of an old man walking by the building every once in a while.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And so the cops eventually say, "You know what?

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 This old man keeps walking by the building."

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 These women are reporting that they're being attacked with magic,

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 magically getting sexually assaulted.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Let's go question him.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 They go question him, the six-year-old man.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 He admits, "Yes, I've been walking by jacking off and raping these women psychically.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 He goes to jail."

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And they're like, "Case closed.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So bizarre."

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Now, what's, what, I'm kind of incredulous about this whole story,

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 because on the one hand, I don't think it's possible to do,

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 but on the other hand, the authorities in this area know what it is

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 to the point that they know how to investigate it.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 At no point were the police thinking, "Ah, she's just making it up.

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 She's just making it up."

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 The cops knew what to zone in on.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 The cops are like, "Oh, no, no, no.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 We're totally aware of this is a crime.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's psychic sexual assault.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 They shouldn't be doing this.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 People go arrest them for jacking off 20 feet away from you

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 and you not seeing it, and then then magically like molesting you.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Super bizarre."

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 But over there, they're like, "Nope, we know, we know what it is

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 and how to deal with it."

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Again, I don't, I have a hard time believing that that is real,

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 but if it is, how many times has that happened in other countries?

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And the police just wrote it off as hysteria or some weird fantasy or a delusion.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And if it's true, what's to stop someone who's a practitioner of it

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 from going to another country where they have no idea what it is

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 and just becoming a psychic sexual predator?

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 If someone told me that story,

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 if someone told me that they were walking around in their bathroom

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 and then all of a sudden they felt like they were psychically assaulted,

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I would think that there was something going on, like depression-wise

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 or anxiety-wise or something like that.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 At least that's what I would use to think.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But now, I may think there may be a moobo-bo-bo practitioner

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 and it's completely bizarre for me to even think that that's a possibility

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 because I don't think it's possible,

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 but there's a lot of people in law enforcement in Zimbabwe who do.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 But let's go ahead and move on to our last story here.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Now, our last story is a weird one.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And again, I have some mixed feelings about this one as well.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 But we're going to Italy.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We're going to the boot-shaped country known as Italy.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And we're going to join a night watchman on his nightly routines.

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 A young man, probably in his 30s, named Pierre Zanfreda.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 I guess 30s is still young.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Kind of ruined my own intro with that.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Pierre Zanfreda.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Everything's young when you're 42, actually.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But anyway, so Pierre Zanfreda is out on his night watch.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The year is 1978.

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It's December 6th, 6th with a TH.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 He's out on his nightly routine.

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He's doing his watch job and he's driving through the countryside

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 and he sees a house.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It's abandoned, but it is part of his duties to check on.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 He's driving all in his little car, wrong side of the road,

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 he's on the wrong side of the car.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 So it's lucky that he's even able to make it to their destination.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But he does.

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 He hops out of the car because he sees lights in the front yard of the house.

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And he goes, "Well, the house is supposed to be abandoned."

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It says on my list here, "Abandoned spooky house, lot 79."

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 He's like, "Oh yeah, I gotta check that out."

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I'm so glad I'm done with the rape story so I can start making jokes again.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 He jumps out of his car and he goes to confront whatever burglars or teenagers

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 or mafiosos are running around this house late at night.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And instead, he finds an alien.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But not just an alien, not a little weakling gray alien

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 that you could just like break in half.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You know, this guy, 10 feet tall.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And he described it as having undulating skin.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So its skin was like, "Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo."

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And he either described it as either wearing a loose tunic,

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 a big loose clothing, or extremely fat.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Which, I mean, dude, I hit 350 pounds at my highest.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I'm down to 270 now, but when I was 350 pounds, I wasn't undulating.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Maybe if I was running downhill, but I don't think even then.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 But anyways, this guy was like, "Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo."

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 That's not the noise he was making, that was his flesh.

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He was also hairy. He was greenish.

218
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 I wasn't completely green, but he was greenish.

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 He had large, yellow, triangular eyes, which to me would make me think

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 it's wearing some sort of helmet.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 The easiest way, I think, whenever we talk about aliens,

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 this is something a lot of people forget if they're making up aliens.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 As far as we know, there's basically two main places where eyes should be.

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Predators have their eyes in the front of their head,

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and prey have their eyes on the sides of their head.

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Which technically should tell you that a gray alien is much as like,

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 supposed to be like these hippy-dippy, peaceful earth-changing aliens.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 They're predators if their eyes are on the front of their head.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 But anyways, if it has large, triangular eyes,

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I would assume it's wearing some sort of helmet.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Red veins on its forehead are that kind of bulge,

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 and it had a device to help it breathe Earth's atmosphere,

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 which again makes me think the whole head may have been some sort of plating.

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But anyways, that's not what Pierre said.

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Pierre said it was just this giant alien dude hanging out in the front yard.

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 He totally freaks out, obviously.

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 He runs to his car and sees a triangle-shaped UFO hovering above his car.

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And he feels it like blast him and his car with a wave of heat.

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 He radios in to his coworkers.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And a bunch of his coworkers, also night watchmen, come out.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 The UFO beats feet. It totally gets out of there.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 But his coworkers show up, and they report that the top of the car was steaming,

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 because it was so cold outside, but all of a sudden it was hit with this heat blast.

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And they even said Pierre's clothes were warm to the touch.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Why are they touching him?

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Do they all show up and give him hugs and high fives?

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Like, when's the last time you've walked up to your male coworker and rubbed their clothing?

248
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Even if they were in a traumatic event, I don't think I'd be like,

249
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 "Oh yeah, let me fill your shirt. Oh yeah, you know, you're doing fine, buddy. You're doing good."

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And apparently they all rubbed his clothes and said, "It's quite warm, buddy."

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 But anyways, this becomes a huge news story. Huge news story in Italy.

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And during the course of the investigation, they find out that 50 other people in the area reported seeing UFO activity.

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 No one else saw what he saw. No one saw the alien.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 But up to 50 people in the area said they also saw lights in the sky that night.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Because a huge news story, people don't believe him. You know, the standard stuff, especially back in the 70s and 80s and 60s and 50s, really,

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 and 40s, they didn't believe you when you talked about aliens. Nowadays, you know, you'd probably get more credibility.

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But back then, it just wasn't the case.

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 He ended up volunteering to go under hypnosis. He volunteered to take a truth serum,

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 and under Bo- which is sodium penethol, which a lot of people debate whether or not that's actually a truth serum,

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 in other countries, it can be used in court cases. So they used it over there.

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 He underwent hypnosis, and both times, he pretty much repeated the same story.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But people still had a hard time believing that actually happened.

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 But that was on December 6th.

264
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 On December 23rd, so what is that, like, two, three weeks later?

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Pierre Zanfreda driving his car late at night at work.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 I'm surprised he went back to work, but apparently this guy really needed the money.

267
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I would just say, can you switch him to the day shift? But anyways, he's driving his car late at night, doing his job.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Car gets hit with a beam of light.

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Next thing, Pierre Zanfreda knows, he's just sitting in his car.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Doesn't know what happened. Calls in for backup.

271
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So at this point, his buddies come back out there, they're rubbing his clothes again,

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 and they notice something. His gun has been fired and five rounds are missing from his gun.

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And then, he remembers, I believe he remembers this through hypnosis as well,

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 when the beam of light hit his car, he went up to the UFO, fired five shots into the alien spacecraft,

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 and was told at that time the aliens wanted to keep him.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 But he says, "You can't keep me. You're not human. I have a family. You have to let me go."

277
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And then he's back in the car.

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And again, when his co-workers show up, the top of his car is steaming again,

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 and they did notice that five rounds were fired out of his gun.

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It's not like that's the first thing they checked, but you know, when they're doing the investigation,

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 they realize that the gun has five spent shells in it.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So, again, people are like, "Oh my God, this happened to you twice? Like, what's going on here?"

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And he's like, "I know, man. It's so crazy. And this time I like opened fire,

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 but they couldn't do nothing because I have my gun and they wanted to keep me."

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And people are like, "It's kind of weird, Pierre, that this keeps happening to you."

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, it's crazy world, isn't it?"

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 But he goes on with his job. He goes on with his life.

288
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 1979, July 23rd. He's driving a motorcycle now.

289
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He's learned his lesson. Don't be driving cars because aliens want to get you.

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He's driving his motorcycle through a remote area in Italy. It's nighttime.

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 He goes missing. Never radios in. People can't figure out where he's at.

292
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Vanishes.

293
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Two hours later, he's found towards this place called Mount Fashy,

294
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 which I would recommend changing the name of that mountain.

295
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 But anyways, he's found that, or I could be pronouncing it wrong,

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 but Mount Fashy is in Italy, apparently, and he's found near that.

297
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And people, and people are like, "How'd you get there?" And he's like, "I don't know."

298
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 I was driving my motorcycle in this totally unrelated area,

299
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 and then I ended up at Mount Fashy. And they're like, "Don't say that name."

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And he's like, "Sorry."

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 But people in the area, because Mount Fashy was in another remote area

302
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 and people who lived out there said, "We would have heard the motorcycle coming down the road."

303
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Somehow he got here without making a noise.

304
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 People are like, "Did you think you got abducted by aliens again?"

305
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 He's like, "I don't know. I don't know. I just was here."

306
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I just disappeared for a couple hours.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So now it's December 2nd, 1979, and you might start picking up on a pattern here,

308
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 and I kind of did when I was researching this, but it's December 1979, December 2nd.

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 He goes missing again. He's out on the job. He just vanishes.

310
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And so his boss is like, "Oh, great. Let me guess. Pierre's taken by the aliens again."

311
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 People are like, "I don't know. You want us to go search for him?"

312
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 The boss is like, "Yeah, go."

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 He'll probably show up in some inappropriately named mountain.

314
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 That'll be the end of it. He'll say aliens or ghosts or whatever.

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Just go. Go, go, go, go, go. Go get him.

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 So four of his coworkers go driving out there to see him.

317
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Find him, hopefully.

318
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And a giant light flies over their car.

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 [Maniacal laughter]

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And one dude gets out of the car and starts shooting at the UFO, which I have to admit,

321
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 these guys are acting fairly appropriately as far as alien abduction goes.

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I would open fire as well.

323
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 But they end up firing him. The UFO flies away after the gunshots.

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They're like, "Oh, man. We didn't know this was a bad sight of Italy."

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 They fly off.

326
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And they end up finding Pierre. And Pierre's like, "Groggy's like, 'I don't know what happened, guys.

327
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I just went missing from my job for a while.'"

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 They're like, "Dude, the UFO showed up."

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, get used to it."

330
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But that story has a bit of a sad ending, because apparently,

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 according to the reports I read, one of the four guards in the car killed himself a few months later.

332
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Now, the article said he couldn't deal with what had happened that night with the UFOs who had killed himself.

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He may have been having other underlying issues as well.

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 That's kind of a leapologic.

335
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But one of the four guards that did encounter that UFO, one of them did kill themselves.

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 But I don't know if it was related to the UFO. It may have been. I don't know.

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Maybe he was the one who fired the gun. It wasn't too specific.

338
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But, again, Pierre disappeared and found again pretty much the same set of circumstances.

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That was December 2nd, 1979.

340
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 The very next night, December 3rd, the very next night,

341
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Pierre is filling up his car at a gas station.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And if this story is true, this dude cannot get a moment's rest.

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Imagine the night before alien aircraft not only abducting you and wiping your memory clean,

344
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 but harassing your coworkers.

345
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And then the next night, you're pumping your gas, and you look up and there is an alien,

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 which he describes as having an - it was a smaller alien - an egg-shaped head wearing a checkered suit,

347
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 like body armor, standing across the street being like, "Hey, come here. Come here. Come here. Pierre. Pierre. Come here.

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you."

349
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And you're like trying to pump your gas, and you see this weirdo in the bushes being like, "Come on, come on, come on."

350
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And Pierre said that he couldn't resist it. He couldn't resist the egg man.

351
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 But for so, he wanted to go over and talk to him, but for some reason he gets into his car.

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Maybe he was far across the road. He had a driver. Maybe Pierre is just incredibly lazy.

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But he gets in his car, he drives, he drives into a cloud, and then the whole car gets abducted.

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 So now Pierre is standing in a UFO or sitting in his car in a UFO, and all these aliens are walking around.

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 It's at that time that he remembers this. They go, "We're going to give you a tour. We're going to let you know a little bit about us now."

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 These aliens come from the planet Tetonia in the third galaxy.

357
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Pierre is like, "That sounds totally made up." The aliens are like, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I didn't name the planet, but that's what it's called, Tetonia in the third galaxy."

358
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 There was a giant vat, like a sci-fi vat, which is what you would expect on a UFO. You wouldn't expect like a mason jar, but there's a sci-fi vat.

359
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And in it is this frog humanoid just kind of floating in the water, like a formaldehyde thumb or something like that.

360
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And the Tetonian alien says, "That..." See that frog monster in there floating around in that formaldehyde?

361
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Pierre's like, "Yeah, that's really disgusting." He's like, "Yeah, I know. Those are our most hated enemies. Those are who we are at war with."

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And Pierre's like, "That?" And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, that ugly little man."

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 So apparently these ten-foot-tall dudes with triangular eyes are scared of a bunch of like little frog people? Even a human-sized frog person. It's still a frog. It's not super scary.

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 But anyways, and then he's like, "Yeah, come on, come on." He could tell Pierre wasn't too impressed with the frog monster in the vat.

365
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 He goes, "Here, I want to give you this." So the alien then hands Pierre a pyramid and says, "Take this.

366
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 This relic will let you know everything you want to know about everything." Pierre's like, "That's kind of general." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, I know. I kind of trailed off there."

367
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But it's a device that will open your mind so you will finally understand your guys' place in the universe and all this stuff.

368
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 And we want you to give it to someone specific. His name is Dr. Alan Hynek.

369
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Now, Dr. Alan Hynek was an astronomer and a huge UFOologist back in the time.

370
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It's kind of lame for an alien to give you a device saying that it's going to open your mind to new pathways and then ask you to deliver it to somebody else.

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Because basically they're saying, "Yeah, you're cool enough to abduct, but you're not cool enough to use this pyramid power."

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 So could you give it to someone smarter than you? But anyways, so then they basically tell Pierre that.

373
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 "You'd be awesome if you came with us, but we asked you to do that once and you said no, you have a family."

374
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 So is that still the deal? And he's like, "Yeah, I'm still married. I'm still happily married. Got kids and stuff."

375
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And the alien's like, "Okay, I want to let you know something. We're here to stay. We're actually bringing more members of our species here."

376
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Pierre is back on Earth. His whole car apparently, because he didn't report the car stolen.

377
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So he's sitting back on Earth in his car holding this alien artifact, this pyramid, that he's supposed to deliver to Dr. Alan Hynek.

378
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 So he tells this tale, this time that he got abducted. He's like, "Guys, I got a story for you and everyone at work is so bored of this stuff."

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 They're like, "Dude, just last night we bailed you out of one of these nonsense events."

380
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 He's like, "I know man, but I was pumping gas. This little egg-shaped guy was whispering from across the street. They're like, "Pier, come on man, I'm tired."

381
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And he's like, "This time they gave me a magical pyramid that will open our minds. The cops are like, "Really?"

382
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Well, show it to me and he's like, "No, I buried it." Buried it in the middle of nowhere.

383
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Weren't you supposed to give it to someone? He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was supposed to give it to this ufologist, but I figured I'd bury it."

384
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And they're like, "Oh, Pierre, whatever." People are super tired of his nonsense, whether or not it's true. This guy keeps getting abducted.

385
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Now he's given proof from aliens. And that's what he said. People have asked him, "Hey, what happened to the pyramid?"

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And he goes, "Oh no, no, I buried it in the middle of nowhere." So anyways, that should be the end of the story of Pierre, but the next year, it's Valentine's Day.

387
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 He goes missing again. He just shows back up a couple hours later. "Oh man, I got abducted by aliens. It's been two months since the last time I was able to tell this story."

388
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Now listen, I think you can tell from my glibness that I... yeah.

389
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Either one of two things happened. He made the whole thing up. 100% of it. He made it all up.

390
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And I think there's an interesting pattern to the events. Most of them take place in December. So the first one takes place two days before Christmas.

391
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Three of them take place the first week of December. Then we have one in July 23rd, and then we have one on Valentine's Day.

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 I think this guy was skipping out on events. I think this guy was forgetting his anniversary, and this was his excuse.

393
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 That might sound ridiculous, but that is Occam's razor. That is the most plausible answer.

394
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 That this guy was... he either had a problem he was hiding, alcoholism, and he would just be laying among a bunch of bottles and they'd be like,

395
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "Hey, Pierre, where are you at?" And he's like, "Oh, man, I just got abducted. Don't give me the breathalyzer."

396
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 He was having an affair. Would it be another reason to disappear for hours at a time?

397
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Skipping out on important holidays, or your wife's anniversary, or Valentine's Day. Those are all possibilities as well.

398
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 So it's possible that the whole thing is made up. Hypnosis and truth serums can be faked, and they can be led on by the investigators.

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 There's a possibility that the first event was true, and that the publicity got to him.

400
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 All of a sudden he went from being this night watchman to being interviewed for all these newspapers,

401
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 and then he had to prove the story, and then he kept the story going, and introduced other characters and subplots and stuff like that in magical devices.

402
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 As the season went on, he had to keep up in the ante. That's possible.

403
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I've seen some articles saying this guy was a normal man, and he actually hid from the publicity. He didn't want the publicity, but he kept doing interviews,

404
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 and he submitted to the hypnosis, and he submitted to the truth serum and stuff like that, so obviously he wanted to prove himself.

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He could have just said, "Yeah, you know, I don't know what happened. I don't want to talk about it and go on."

406
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Because it's how a lot of people deal with UFO abduction stuff. It happens to them, it really happens to them,

407
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and they either don't tell anyone, or they just tell a few people, and they leave it at that.

408
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 What I think is weird, what my read on it is, is I think he was faking it, but the four other guards who shot at this spacecraft weren't.

409
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Get this, think about this. You're running a scam. You come up with the perfect fraud.

410
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You're going to cash in on all this UFO nonsense, and you know the perfect way to do it.

411
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 You're a night watchman. You're out in the middle of nowhere all by yourself.

412
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You go out, you disappear, you call up your buddies and say, "Oh my God, I just got abducted by aliens."

413
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It becomes a big news story, and you get addicted to the fame, and you do it again.

414
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Oh my God, you won't believe what just happened. Aliens. You get more of that fame, more of that publicity.

415
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And you keep this scam going. You're fooling everyone, your spouse, your kids, the media, your coworkers, your boss.

416
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And then one night when you're in the middle of a field laughing because you know you're going to pull another one of these scams.

417
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 You got your car pulled to the side of the road, you're hiding.

418
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And you see your coworkers' car coming down that abandoned road where you know they're going to start looking for you.

419
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And you're sitting there in the dark, just having a good laugh, drinking some Italian wine.

420
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And all of a sudden you see a beam appear above their car, and you hear a gunshot.

421
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 It's interesting because his explanation really for what happened on October 2nd when his coworkers saw the UFO and fired at it,

422
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 was really, I don't remember what happened. And then the very next night he has this super detailed story about the egg alien,

423
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and the whole car getting abducted in the cloud, and the evil alien empire, and this magical device, and all this stuff.

424
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 The very next night after his coworkers go, "Dude, we saw it, and Billy over here opened fire on it."

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And I think he made it up, and I think he kept that scam going, and going, and going, until his lies became true for his coworkers.

426
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I don't think he was ever abducted by aliens. But I think one of his coworkers put a bullet hole in a UFO.

427
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
