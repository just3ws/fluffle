1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 Hawaii, a tropical paradise, a place where people go to get away from it all.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,920
 But at night, a phenomenon happens that makes you pee yourself, literally.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,560
 And then, we travel back in time, not literally as great as that would be, we travel back in

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,840
 time to investigate a string of attacks in 1890s Nebraska.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,560
 God was killing cattle and men alike, some say it was America's first vampire, today

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,440
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:46,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio, I'm your host Jason

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,880
 Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,480
 Today's episode might be a little short, we're having some technical issues, so I kinda gotta

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,560
 get everything done and get it edited, but I hope it still is a one-two punch of good

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,720
 stuff for you, and you enjoy it.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,080
 I hope you enjoy every episode, but let's go ahead and get started here, we're going

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,560
 to sunny, sunny Hawaii, the island that never sleeps.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,600
 Islands are all islands volcanoes, technically, I guess no, I guess most islands are just

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
 mountains poking up out of the ocean, but anyways, Hawaii, bunch of volcanoes, and Dog

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:32,440
 the Bounty Hunter lives there, and Hulu skirts, and Lilo and Stitch, I have now exhausted

17
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,760
 all of my Hawaii knowledge, I've never been there, I'm not a big fan of flying over oceans,

18
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,320
 but there are people who are born there and they don't have to worry about that, they

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,200
 just have to worry about Lilo and Stitch running around, blowing stuff up.

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:55,000
 So in Hawaii, Hawaii has a rich, rich, like a legacy of tribal warfare and cultures and

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,080
 stuff like that, before the settlers showed up, and you have this community where you

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,520
 have both of those pretty much colliding, where you have modern culture and then you

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
 have these old spiritual beliefs.

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,960
 You have that in a lot of places around the world, I think just Hawaii seems to be more

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,480
 rich and magical because it's far away and you need a plane to get there.

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,640
 You know I had a question the other day, why don't dogs bark at planes?

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
 Why don't animals freak out when they see planes flying overhead?

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,120
 You think that would be the weirdest thing in the world for them to see?

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,360
 A dog hates fireworks, but a jet can fly through the neighborhood and they'd just be like eating

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
 their soup.

31
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
 They don't eat soup, but they could be eating whatever they're eating.

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
 So bizarre.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
 So much for having a short episode.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
 Hawaii.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,480
 Civilization and spiritualism collide.

36
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,120
 So in Hawaii they have a particular, some could call it a superstition, a skeptic could

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,480
 call it a superstition, paranormal investigator could call it an actual event, but over there

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,280
 they call it the night marchers.

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 The night marchers.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,460
 And what it is, is they have this thing that supposedly has been going on since the dawn

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,080
 of their culture, where you have these high ranking chieftains who have died and they're

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,640
 now in the spirit world.

43
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,760
 But they still gotta get from point A to point B. They just don't sit in the grave.

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,080
 They want to go visit this place.

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,080
 They want to go through this particular portal on this island.

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,840
 They want to go visit their great great grand chieftain, get some advice.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
 So they have to be able to move through the landscape of Hawaii.

48
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,880
 But these great chieftains aren't going to do it alone because they're the most powerful

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,100
 people in their history, in their culture.

50
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,260
 So they have surrounding them what's known as the night marchers.

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,500
 These are basically spirit warriors who create a convoy.

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,300
 So you'll see these, it's interesting, it's not just a ghost with chains rattling.

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,900
 It's like basically a regimen of ghosts just marching through the street.

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,220
 And you know that this is the way that you know that you're running into a group of

55
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,120
 night marchers as opposed to just a random gang of ghosts marching in a straight line.

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,840
 They usually march at night because they don't want to be seen.

57
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,520
 When they march you hear the sound of thunderous drums.

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,020
 The Metallica Blarin.

59
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,760
 They carry torches so if you can't hear them right away you can see them and you can go

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 uh oh there's the night marchers.

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,220
 I want to get out of the way because their goal is to intimidate you so you don't look

62
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,520
 at the chieftain.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,340
 They also blow a big ol' conch shell.

64
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,420
 And you hear it and you're like okay dude that's enough.

65
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,380
 I heard the thunderous drums and saw the torches.

66
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,100
 You don't have to blow a conch shell in my ear.

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,940
 I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

68
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,980
 If you can't get away from these guys, if they have, if you're walking down an alley

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,260
 and you turn and you see them like a marching band start walking down the alley, you have

70
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,060
 to show them fear or reverence.

71
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,780
 You have to show like oh my god you guys are so spooky please don't kill me.

72
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,280
 You either can strip all your clothes off and lay flat on the ground and the night marchers

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,000
 will be like yes we are your superiors and they'll walk right past you.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,920
 Which actually is a great cover story if you were like a peeping tom in Hawaii you'd be

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,520
 like no officer, no officer, night marchers are coming after me.

76
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,080
 That's why I'm totally naked running through the neighborhood.

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,040
 Officers are like oh have a good day then.

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,440
 Oh and you're like see you hear the conch shell and cops are like yeah go go go put your clothes

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,980
 on or if you can't take all your clothes off you're supposed to pee all over yourself to

80
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,580
 show how scared you are.

81
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,100
 And then night marchers go oh look at that person is in fear of us.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
 We'll let him go.

83
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,580
 You're just still just peeing.

84
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,020
 Again a great excuse if you ever wet your pants in Hawaii just be like woo.

85
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,580
 I'm gonna have a ringtone that's just a conch shell in my pocket.

86
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,100
 I'm gonna go to Hawaii.

87
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,020
 Walk around naked covered in pee.

88
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,180
 A perfect, perfect alibi.

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,020
 Now the problem is that they have had, oh oh and I guess I should say this, if you don't

90
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,520
 pee on yourself or take all your clothes off and lay down bowing in front of them they

91
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,280
 kill you but it's even worse than that.

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,260
 Getting killed by a regimented ghost would be kind of cool thing to have on your tombstone.

93
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,440
 You become a night marcher if you don't do one of these things.

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:15,000
 They do kill you and then you're sucked into their nightly voyages.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,220
 Is it voyage if they're walking?

96
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
 They're nightly walks.

97
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,180
 That makes it sound like they're just walking around the park.

98
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,460
 But anyways expeditions you're now trapped as a night marcher for the rest of eternity.

99
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,220
 Now the thing is is like they've been doing these walks forever but as cities have grown

100
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,340
 they've actually started to grow onto paths where these night marchers are.

101
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,420
 And you're thinking okay Jason this is just like folklore right?

102
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,500
 Like obviously this isn't a provable thing.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,220
 It's one of those things that I'm sure people have tried investigating it like paranormal

104
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,460
 investigators and things like that.

105
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,740
 Actually I know that for a fact because let me get to that part.

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:02,040
 So in 2012 there is a guy, okay his name is Lopaka Kapanui and he's a night marcher expert.

107
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,200
 You're like oh so he's like a ghost hunter slash storyteller.

108
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,960
 So you're kind of like he may be making this part up but anyways we're just going to keep

109
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
 going.

110
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
 So people have investigated this stuff.

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,260
 He's a night marcher expert.

112
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,180
 So in 2012 a bunch of lawyers call up Lopakaka.

113
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,580
 Wait that's not his name.

114
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
 Lopaka.

115
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
 Lopaka.

116
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,740
 Okay he's all "What'd you call me?"

117
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,220
 That's not all my name hangs up.

118
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
 They call him back.

119
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,740
 They're like "Sorry sir we missed your name."

120
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,660
 But we need you to come to our corporate office building in a shiny shiny building in the

121
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,220
 middle of Hawaii because we want to talk to you about something.

122
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,060
 We know you're a night marcher expert and he's like "I am."

123
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,780
 So he shows up and he goes and he's thinking well these guys probably must have seen some

124
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,780
 night marchers right?

125
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,480
 They're checking their pants to make sure that they didn't wet themselves.

126
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 He's like "Oh."

127
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,580
 And they say this is the story they've been hearing going on in their building.

128
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,880
 There's a rumor going around in our building that the night marchers walked through our

129
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,680
 lobby one day.

130
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,560
 Blown conch shells, torches, everything.

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
 And it was freaking people out.

132
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,720
 And they apparently showed Lopaka, they're very careful pronouncing his name now, showed

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
 him a surveillance footage and go look it.

134
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,280
 Here you can see it and he sees like these night marchers walking through the lobby and

135
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,380
 he's like "Oh that is quite interesting."

136
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,060
 I apparently got a Nairush accent all of a sudden and he goes "So yeah, that's what

137
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,060
 happens is places have been built over these particular trails and every so often the night

138
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,580
 marchers will kind of take this trail and they'll walk through downtown Honolulu."

139
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,020
 Lawyers go in unison because I don't know which one said this but they all said at once

140
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,220
 there's another part of the story.

141
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,120
 There was a young maid, a member of a maintenance staff, I guess they're not called maids if

142
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,800
 they work at a law office.

143
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,080
 You sit in their janitors dressed up in a cute little French maid outfit.

144
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,000
 Anyways, there is a female maintenance worker working at this law firm in this building

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,900
 and she was in the lobby.

146
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,880
 She saw the night marchers walk through.

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,820
 She didn't do any of the steps.

148
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,880
 She didn't take her clothes off.

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,140
 It's really hard to get out of a sexy maid costume.

150
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
 So I understand that.

151
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,240
 She didn't pee herself either.

152
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
 And so you don't want to ruin that costume.

153
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,520
 So the night marchers walked by her and she told people the night marchers, these dudes

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,000
 walked through the lobby and I was like totally freaked down.

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,440
 People were like "Did you take your clothes off?"

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,560
 And then she filed sexual harassment forms against them.

157
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,840
 No, what happened was she said she saw it.

158
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,320
 She didn't do anything like that.

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,000
 She died the next day.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,940
 And then in a future march where the night marchers ended up marching through that building,

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:50,900
 one of her coworkers saw her as a night marcher marching through the lobby late at night.

162
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,180
 I think that's a really interesting story and it scares me more.

163
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,460
 People being sucked into some sort of hell dimension than people just getting like dying.

164
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,460
 I think the idea of someone watching this and not going through the proper steps and

165
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,240
 then getting sucked into this reality were for the rest of eternity they're just marching,

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
 which would have to be terrible for your feet.

167
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
 You'd have like planter fasciitis and all sorts of stuff.

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,160
 I doubt the medical care for being a night marcher is great.

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,920
 You'd have foot problems always.

170
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,560
 So I think that is more scary than just the ghost killing you.

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,700
 I'm assuming the witness who saw her marching did pee himself because one, he knows the

172
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,480
 steps and then two, he sees the actual ramifications of someone who didn't follow the steps.

173
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,540
 Now that ending by Lopika may be a bit of a storytelling flourish to it all because he

174
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:48,180
 is a professional storyteller, but the story of the night marchers has marched on through

175
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,700
 Hawaiian history for centuries.

176
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,940
 And I think it's just a fascinating look at what happens when you have like this paranormal

177
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,940
 superstitious world that for the longest time we're just marching through these trails throughout

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,520
 the islands of Hawaii.

179
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,760
 But as civilization grew and grew and grew and grew, it basically encroached on those

180
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,800
 borders between the real and the unreal.

181
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,400
 And now these marchers aren't going to change their patterns.

182
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,800
 They're just going to continue to march through these cities and people who just happen to

183
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,640
 be visiting, people who don't know any of these legends are sitting drinking coffee at

184
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,640
 Starbucks one day and they hear a conch shell blow and they look out the window.

185
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,060
 And while everyone else is pissing themselves, they're like, "Man, what's going on here?

186
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,260
 Some sort of biological agent making everyone's bladder lose?"

187
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,900
 They're opening themselves up to becoming a night marcher themselves.

188
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,780
 This is a brief overview of the night marchers.

189
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,780
 There's tons of identified trails throughout Hawaii where people are like, "Hey, this trail

190
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,340
 is closed after sunset."

191
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,780
 And you're like, "Oh, because of the vandals?"

192
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,740
 And they're like, "No, because the night marchers will get you."

193
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,220
 So basically the moral of the story is don't go to Hawaii.

194
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,280
 If you do to go to Hawaii, either bring extra pair of underwear or be prepared to be naked

195
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,880
 at any given point at night.

196
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
 And that's just living an exciting life.

197
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,680
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

198
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,320
 Now our next story is really kind of, it kind of falls into the same category where there's

199
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,120
 some official confirmation of it, but you have to go off a lot of like, I'm going to tell

200
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
 you the story and you go, "That's an interesting story."

201
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,020
 But and it would just be a typical ghost story if there weren't some interesting details

202
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,180
 in it.

203
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,740
 Let's go back in time.

204
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
 Let's go back in time.

205
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,500
 Let's go to 1895 Nebraska.

206
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,260
 Dawes County to be specific.

207
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,660
 Little county in the middle of Nebraska.

208
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,100
 I don't know any Nebraska stereotypes or accents.

209
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,460
 So you guys are going to look out on that.

210
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:49,660
 I guess I just imagine Nebraska is just a big flat state full of flat people wearing flat

211
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
 hats.

212
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,800
 And but not back in 1895 because it was populated by cowboys.

213
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,080
 So they had big hats.

214
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
 They're probably still flat.

215
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,360
 But anyways, in Nebraska, Dawes County, you had a rancher come out one day.

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,880
 He has a cow ripped to pieces.

217
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,960
 He's like, "Dag, now that was my favorite cow.

218
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,640
 That was my lovin' cow.

219
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,040
 Bessie, why'd you leave me?"

220
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,160
 He's petting it.

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
 All the blood is drained out of the cow.

222
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,200
 You're like, "Ooh, alien abduction."

223
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,100
 I already gave it away when it is in the intro of the vampire.

224
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,980
 But anyways, he's like, "Ahh, Bessie."

225
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,780
 He can't figure out what it is.

226
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,540
 He starts talking to other people in the area.

227
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,220
 He's like, "Hey, is anything wrong with your cows?"

228
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,860
 And they're like, "It's funny that you say that."

229
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,180
 I was sleeping with my cow last night.

230
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,580
 I mean, I was milking my cow last night.

231
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
 Everything was fine.

232
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,220
 And when I woke up this morning, torn of shreds.

233
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,780
 Completely torn of shreds.

234
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,460
 Other ranchers in the area are like, "Same things happen to me."

235
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,060
 Now it didn't all happen on the same night, but they were having this ongoing thing.

236
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,640
 That'd be a very busy vampire.

237
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,760
 That'd be like the fattest vampire ever.

238
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,080
 He's like, "Must eat 10 cows a night."

239
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,040
 People started reporting a humanoid-like creature in the area.

240
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,080
 And people would be like, "What do you mean?

241
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 Like, is it a human?"

242
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,640
 And they're like, "Well, it kind of looked like a human, but it didn't act like a human."

243
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,680
 And I was like, "Dun dun dun."

244
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
 They can't figure it out.

245
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,920
 Search parties, though, at this point, are really looking for the culprit, the cow killer

246
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,600
 that's doing all this stuff.

247
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,140
 And one night, moon long on the horizon, there's a guy walking around with his gun, looking

248
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,380
 for this cow killer.

249
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,540
 And he sees a dead cow out in the field.

250
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
 And he's like, "Aha."

251
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,580
 Actually, that's not a clue.

252
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,700
 They've seen dead cows all over town.

253
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,500
 But a clue is he sees some beast leaning over the cow.

254
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 And he goes, "Aha.

255
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 There's a clue."

256
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,580
 That's an actual clue.

257
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,100
 And he realizes it's a human and a creature.

258
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
 Well, it's not a human.

259
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
 It's a creature.

260
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,380
 I mean, it's human.

261
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,360
 And he's lapping up the cow's blood right out of an open wound.

262
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,200
 Dude's like, "That's creepy."

263
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,920
 And he runs away.

264
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,960
 He didn't-- there's no report that he shot him or anything like that.

265
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
 But he runs away.

266
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,880
 And so now they kind of have something to go off of.

267
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,800
 Yes, it is a human who likes to drink cow's blood.

268
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 Still can't figure out how it's ripping these cows to pieces.

269
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,080
 I guess they could just use a bunch of knives and Wolverine chopping people up.

270
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,800
 Wolverine was around back then.

271
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,300
 I mean, Wolverine's fictional, but in the fiction, I think he was like eight in 1895

272
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
 or something like that.

273
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,300
 So it could have been Wolverine.

274
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:28,700
 Anyways, there is now we step in our hero of the story, a young man known as Jack Lewis.

275
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,140
 He is a cowboy.

276
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,860
 And he's doing his wranglin' thing.

277
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,980
 He's out with wranglers throwing cows-- I mean, throwing ropes around cows' necks and

278
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,020
 pulling them in and making them go places.

279
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,140
 They wrangle up cows.

280
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,700
 They wrangle them.

281
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,360
 What dusk is setting this night?

282
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,560
 Sun going over the horizon.

283
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,200
 Oh, I should tell you all these attacks took place at night too.

284
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,640
 It's not a surprise that it's a vampire, but we'll get into some surprising stuff in a

285
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
 second.

286
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,520
 Sun's going over the horizon.

287
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:06,840
 Big fiery fireball that gives the Earth life disappears and is replaced by twilight Jack

288
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,800
 Lewis is hanging out with his buddies and he goes away for some quote "personal time."

289
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,300
 That's actually what the articles kept saying.

290
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,580
 He's stepped aside for personal time.

291
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,300
 So you can imagine what a cowboy does with his personal time.

292
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,180
 I guess most people would probably think he was going to the bathroom.

293
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,620
 I immediately assumed he was masturbating on the other side of a hill.

294
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,740
 But whatever he was doing, he was by himself.

295
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,100
 Hopefully he was just like reading a book.

296
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,180
 Because what happens is as he's pleasing himself, he's most likely masturbating on the other

297
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
 side of the hill.

298
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,680
 He's very focused.

299
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,860
 He's thinking whatever cowboys think of, whatever cowboys think of, I don't want to know.

300
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,500
 Leather, they're probably into leather.

301
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,180
 They're probably into some rugged stuff.

302
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,260
 Dusty women, women just covered in dust.

303
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,900
 They might have just been attracted to normal women.

304
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,380
 But anyways, as this cowboy is pleasing himself on the other side of this prairie, on the

305
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,220
 other side of this hill, we see from the point of view of the vampire, it's thermal vision.

306
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,120
 Vampire's like, "What's he doing?"

307
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,880
 "No, that's a little embarrassing."

308
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,360
 "Guys, masturbating."

309
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,680
 "Yeah, I'll let him finish first.

310
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,400
 I don't want to wait until he washes his hands."

311
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,120
 "Vampire, cross his eyes in the bushes.

312
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,880
 Jack Lewis finishes off."

313
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,040
 Vampire sees him kind of wipe his hands off.

314
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,800
 Vampire, that part of the story, there's no verification for it.

315
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,640
 All we know is that Jack Lewis was spending some personal time alone.

316
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,580
 And while he was doing that, vampire jumps out of the bushes and lands on him.

317
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,020
 And Jack Lewis, he's trying to pull his pants up.

318
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,700
 He's like, "Oh no, oh no."

319
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,420
 But at the same time, he's trying to fight this thing off.

320
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,220
 And the first thing he does is he feels it try to bite into his neck and at the same

321
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,580
 time strangle him.

322
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,780
 So it's basically like a frenzied attack.

323
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,580
 He's feeling two hands around his throat and then he's getting bit as well, really

324
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,140
 deep bites.

325
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,580
 And Jack is freaking out.

326
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,440
 He grabs his gun and starts firing off shots.

327
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,280
 Basically there's no chance he's going to hit a guy on his back with a rifle.

328
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
 Maybe he had a pistol.

329
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,320
 But even then, you're shooting bullets right by your head.

330
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,040
 What he really needed to do was alert his friends on the other side of the prairie.

331
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,840
 They come over the prairie and the creature sees them and jumps off and starts running.

332
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,680
 And they all get on their horses and they're like, "Jack, what were you doing over there

333
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
 by yourself in the first place?"

334
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,520
 And he's like, "I was reading a book."

335
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,040
 They're like, "Where's the book?"

336
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
 He's like, "Charge!"

337
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,620
 And they all go off on their horses.

338
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,700
 They chase this guy off into the night and he gets darker and darker and darker and

339
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,300
 eventually they lose him.

340
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:45,660
 Twilight has now turned to night and they lose track of this man who's out running horses.

341
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,780
 Jack Lewis wasn't doing too well.

342
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,460
 He had facial wounds like he was all cut up and he had neck wounds his all bit.

343
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,940
 But he did survive.

344
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,980
 Now there's a couple interesting things about that and you go, "Jason, okay, so that's

345
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,540
 like a local legend."

346
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
 And it kind of is.

347
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,600
 We have no news articles that this event ever took place.

348
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,880
 That ends up red flag number one.

349
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,060
 But here's some interesting tidbits.

350
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,560
 This story is found on Nebraska's...

351
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,720
 Let me find the actual website.

352
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,760
 This story is found on history.nebraska.gov.

353
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,400
 So it's on their official website.

354
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,560
 Now they do have a section for folklore, but there's maybe only four stories on this whole

355
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,580
 folklore section of this website.

356
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,860
 And they're usually like a mild ghost story.

357
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,300
 So this one sticks out of place as far as that goes.

358
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,100
 Most stories like this have some sort of conclusion.

359
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,340
 Most folklore like this has some sort of conclusion.

360
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,980
 Where when we talked about Bunny Man a couple days ago, you had, when we look at the urban

361
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,100
 legend of it, you had the inmates escape from the prison and then one kills the other one

362
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,660
 and then he hangs himself and now his ghost haunts Honey Man...

363
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
 Bunny Man bridge!

364
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,640
 Not Honey Man bridge, which sounds delicious.

365
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,720
 I wouldn't mind dying there.

366
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 You're all like...

367
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,080
 It had a beginning, middle and end.

368
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,680
 This one is basically the end is this creature is still out there.

369
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
 Whatever it was, they were never able to identify it.

370
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,600
 He never turned around and said, "I defied the Christian God and I have been cursed."

371
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,680
 There's no moral to this story in any way, shape or form.

372
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
 It's a series of events that happen.

373
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,840
 A final confrontation, only final because the guy took off.

374
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,940
 Now there are some urban legends that do end like that, but for the most part, they tend

375
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,380
 to have some sort of satisfying wrap up even if the wrap up is and now he's a ghost.

376
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,020
 This one is just a guy was eating cows and we shot at him and we chased him and we never

377
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,020
 saw him again.

378
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,500
 And there's no saying and then on the 18th night of every February, he shows up to eat

379
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 more cow.

380
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,660
 There's nothing like that.

381
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:55,820
 If we take into account that this story actually happened in 1895, there's a very, very interesting.

382
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,120
 So let's assume that elements of the story are real or the story itself is real.

383
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,920
 This is something that was very fascinating to me.

384
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,680
 You could have had real cows getting killed in Nebraska.

385
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,400
 From whatever there was some maniac walking around knives stabbing cows.

386
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,720
 They were a bunch of unexplained cow deaths and someone created the ending of the story

387
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,320
 to explain for the cows.

388
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,040
 It's possible that the cows actually were dying and there was a human killing them and

389
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,660
 he was drinking their blood and the story is for the most part true except for the frenzied

390
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,240
 vampire attack on Jack Lewis at the ending.

391
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,980
 That might have been made up or could have all been true.

392
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,060
 So we have this attack in 1895 that if somebody was going to make up a story about a vampire

393
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,780
 attack, you would just pick the things that you know from Dracula because those are the

394
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,260
 most commonly things known about vampires.

395
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,960
 In 1895 the book Dracula didn't exist.

396
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
 It wasn't written.

397
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
 It came out in 1897.

398
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,280
 So it's not like these attacks were happening and people go "Oh this is just like that book

399
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,720
 Dracula" and they started adding details onto it.

400
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,800
 It's almost like these events happened before anyone had ever heard that name unless you

401
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,200
 lived in Yugoslavia or Transylvania or something like that.

402
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,580
 Like for an American rancher in 1895 to have ever heard about that type of vampire, they

403
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,060
 may have heard of an Irish vampire coming from their homeland or a German vampire when

404
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,620
 they came over and stuff like that.

405
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,740
 But this is basically like a vampire boiled down to its roots.

406
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,380
 A beast creature that drinks blood that hunts at night that is incredibly strong and tries

407
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,220
 to tear your throat out.

408
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,260
 That's like if you took all the different versions of vampirism or vampires from around

409
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,520
 the world and boiled them down to their one core identifier, that's it.

410
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,280
 The Irish one is like "Oh but he also likes to do this" and the Spanish one is like "Well

411
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,340
 you gotta like put a rock in his mouth."

412
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,480
 Every other country has their own little take on the details but if you boil them all down

413
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,440
 to their pure essence, that was this attack.

414
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,000
 And that's the book Dracula.

415
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,680
 But this attack took place before these farmers would have ever read that book.

416
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,000
 So that's another detail that makes it more plausible.

417
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,980
 Was there really a vampire running around Nebraska?

418
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,720
 Eating cows?

419
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,860
 Was there a creature who avoided humans for the longest time?

420
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,420
 It could have been killing these ranchers the whole time.

421
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,060
 It wasn't killing them.

422
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,780
 It was killing the cattle.

423
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,860
 But one night when it saw a man out there alone, it attacked him and that man survived.

424
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,100
 Now when I say too it wasn't killing other ranchers, it may have been killing people

425
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,360
 that weren't from around there.

426
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,040
 Settlers moving through the area and so forth.

427
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,400
 Because someone who goes missing in your area, you will know the next day.

428
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,960
 But if someone's traveling from New York to California goes missing, it's a little bit

429
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,240
 harder to find out where they went wrong.

430
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
 What happened to them?

431
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,560
 They don't have cell phones unless they sent to telegram saying "I'm in the middle of Nebraska.

432
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 I'm in Dahls County today."

433
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,320
 And then you don't get a telegram the next day, you're never gonna know where those people

434
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,660
 disappeared at.

435
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,980
 The frontier of America would have been prime vampire hunting ground.

436
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:26,460
 You would have people traveling across this giant country in small groups, in pairs, maybe

437
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,460
 even alone, not in pairs, they're driving around fruit.

438
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,060
 But in pairs or even alone if they were very like if they were on the run from the law or

439
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,060
 something like that.

440
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,580
 These huge stretches of nothing but wilderness.

441
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,440
 America would have been a prime hunting ground for vampires.

442
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,480
 It's kind of an interesting way to look at that.

443
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,760
 Because you would have had, let's put on our paranormal caps here for a second.

444
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,440
 You have these old world vampire alcoves throughout Europe.

445
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,200
 You have some in Japan and things like that.

446
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,760
 And as these expeditions are being sent over these explorations and things like that, basically

447
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,360
 it would be the equivalent of if in your hometown they opened up a brand new fast food restaurant

448
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,620
 but it was the biggest fast food restaurant ever.

449
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,060
 That's how a vampire would have seen America.

450
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,040
 Because everyone you have families that have lived in Germany for a hundred years, if they

451
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,820
 go missing people are going to notice.

452
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,180
 But when you start to have hundreds of thousands of people travel a perilous ocean to get to

453
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,100
 a wasteland or a wild land is a better term for it.

454
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:39,060
 And begin settling across it, people go missing all the time on the boat voyage over.

455
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,640
 When they first reach and the weather gets really bad that year, even another hundred,

456
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:50,760
 two hundred years, we're in the 1770s, we're in the 1800s, we're in the early 1900s, you

457
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,560
 still have huge stretches of land people are traveling across.

458
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:02,480
 And you have mixed in with these groups of settlers, just one vampire could be responsible

459
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,600
 for the disappearance of an entire colony like Roanoke or something like that.

460
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,580
 America would have been a prime hunting ground for age old vampires.

461
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:21,660
 Nobody knew who they were, nobody knew their weaknesses and they could hunt without regard

462
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,300
 to being caught.

463
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,860
 Because if you found a family slaughtered in the middle of nowhere you would assume Indians,

464
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,780
 bear attack, bad luck.

465
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,380
 But most likely we just never find the bodies at all.

466
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:42,440
 And it could be like the Hawaii story, where they could be out in the wilderness hunting

467
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,120
 the way they have hunted for the past three, four hundred years in America.

468
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,600
 And as our cities again are encroaching on the hunting grounds of these creatures that

469
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,760
 may be killing people one by one, hitchhikers, broken down motorists, things like that.

470
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,840
 As our cities just like the Hawaii story, as our cities get bigger and encroach on their

471
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,020
 hunting grounds they've been hunting for three, four hundred years in America, they

472
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,060
 don't have a choice but to start hunting in the cities.

473
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,300
 If they aren't already.

474
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,340
 In the early days of America there was no social safety net.

475
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,900
 If you came here you had to work as hard as you could or you failed and died.

476
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,460
 And people from all over the world came over to try their luck at the American Dream.

477
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,500
 But more than just people may have come over on those boats.

478
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,800
 Come over to give it their best shot to try to make a life in America, even if that meant

479
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,280
 killing us in the process.
