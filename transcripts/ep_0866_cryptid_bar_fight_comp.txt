 What would you do if you were having a nice fun time at a summer camp?
 making wallets going for hikes enjoying nature and
 Then the aliens decided to join you
 and
 Then what would you do if one night you were kicking back a few Bruce keys down at the local pub and
 in walked

 Quamquat, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider
 We're gonna jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and we're gonna glide all the way out to Russia
 It's a long it's a long glide. I hope you guys brought some granola bars. I brought mine
 And as you're slowly starving by the time we get there you're all emaciated
 Luckily we get there eventually it's September 22nd 1980
 Specifically we're in the
 Sidar region of Russia and it's evening the sun has set the birds are going to bed the owls are waking up getting ready to
 do their job being spooky and
 In the Sidar region here in Russia. There's a Russian summer camp actually since September these kids
 They're a little late you guys need to get back to school. It's fall right?
 Sometimes maybe it's a fall camp maybe things are different over in Russia
 But anyways, there's this camp and it's mostly these young teenagers most of the campers are like 14 to 15 years old and
 You have camp counselors obviously you have adults there watching the whole situation now
 I've never been to camp my family was too poor to afford camp and watch a lot of documentaries about camps like me
 Balls I watched the meatballs movies the one or the alien showed up. I think that was meatballs for obviously I also watched
 salute your shorts
 Winning documentary about camp life. I've never been to a summer camp. I've watched camp rock multiple times though
 This is what I would think camp would be like right you'd go you'd sing a song you'd kiss a girl
 You'd meet an alien and you'd get in a boxing match the alien would levity to you around
 Dead rabbit recommends meatballs for whatever meatballs movie that's doing aliens in I don't know how many times I watch that as a kid a lot
 But I assume summer camp is like that. Maybe you make a couple wallets. You're like sewing stuff
 Maybe maybe a zombie named Jason Voorhees kills you but something like that
 Apparently in Russia none of that stuff happens. You don't get to kiss a girl. You don't get to make a wallet
 You don't even get killed by Jason Voorhees on this particular day
 In Russia, this is what apparently they do in the camp. They were washing their dishes in a ditch
 In 1980 I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure Russia had indoor plumbing
 They had a ditch they had like this trench dug and these kids are washing their dishes, right?
 Grabbing more mud. They're like washy washy washy. They're like, uh, this is why we're still in summer camp in September guys
 Learn to wash your dishes, but these kids are washing ditches in a ditch and then all of a sudden
 Aliens showed up just like we both for this UFO shows up and it's hovering over the camp area
 It's actually a bit farther off
 But it's close enough that they can see it. They said it was 50 feet in diameter
 It was this massive object and it lands in a nearby field
 So the kids start running they're like we can do the dishes later. We've been watching them for hours
 They're still money the kids leave the dishes in the ditch and they start running to their cabins
 Which specifically in Russia, they're not called camp cabins
 They're called barracks. So I don't know what type of camp this was it might have been a prison labor camp
 But these kids are running from the ditch
 Which would be your natural reaction, right? I think if you saw like a UFO you'd be like, oh dude
 Look at that. Look at that unidentified flying object way up in the sky. What is that?
 But if you watched it land nearby like I think part of me would want to go check it out
 but I'm 14 years old and
 So dumb watching watching dishes in a ditch. Obviously not really thinking things through I'm out of there
 So these kids are running back to their cabins and they tell the camp counselors and they're like, oh do watch out
 Like this big old thing it landed over in that field and camp counselors are smart enough
 They go get in the cabins get in the cabins
 They're like they're not cabins. They're barracks. They're like these old stone brick buildings. Whatever just get in them
 They're all in these cabins that is when all of the cabin windows just kind of just kind of blow open
 And they're like the shutters right it wasn't like glass flying everywhere
 But like the shutters on the windows just kind of blew open and they were saying that there was no wind the previous to this
 There's no wind at all and now this violent force is thrust open the cabin shutters and
 You have I think they're all in one barrack at this point. I don't think someone's like, oh, no, this isn't where I sleep
 I need to go to my bed. They're like, no Billy. No, he's running over to his own cabin
 I think everyone from way this story sold everyone is in one building
 And the shutters are thrown open and at this point
 Like everyone the camp counselors believe in something weird is going on there in there
 The kids are in there and one of the kids will call him Joe
 Joe starts walking towards the door
 Opens it up and runs outside and he's just running through this now empty camp ground as you have this mysterious force
 blowing the shutters open and
 One of the camp counselors sees this and she takes off after him and she's running luckily
 She's faster than him and she's able to grab him before he's halfway towards
 Where they believe this UFO landed
 So she grabs this kid and she's dragging him back and while she's dragging him back
 He's kicking and screaming. He's saying quote. I want to be with them. I want to be with them
 I want to be with them and she's dragging him back
 And then he breaks free. Oh, I want to be with them. I want to be with them
 Oh, and she's like she gets up and she starts running back after him
 Tackles him again is now finally able to drag him all the way
 I don't know what the other camp counselors are doing at this point
 They're like making bets you're like you think she's strong enough to take that kid down
 And so anyways, they bring the kid back once she finally gets close enough to the door and the other counselors are like
 Oh, look at here. Let me help you. They had to tie the boy down with bed sheets
 Because he wanted to run out to the UFO so badly that a time down and
 He was sitting there struggling against the sheets begging pleading to be let go so he could be with them and
 Then after a period of time
 That didn't sound like you
 That didn't sound like it was from another world
 It's not like I ran out of breath during the UFO effect after a period of time the UFO begins to leave
 *Makes weird noises*
 *Bing*
 And then the young boy Joe
 *Sigh*
 Such a pleasurable moan
 I don't think it sounded like that my notes actually just said that he stopped he calmed down
 It didn't say that he went oh my what it what what an erotic adventure it just said he calmed down
 *Laughs*
 That weird noise anyways that
 Is from I got that from thinkaboutadox.com. They got it from a source called x library
 UFO Russia and we've talked so much about Russian UFO encounters
 They were covered up for years and years and years
 They were never getting out from behind the iron curtain and a lot of these stories weren't even reported because the KGB like you know in America
 We had the FBI and the CIA
 Looking into all sorts of people saying that they're seeing these UFOs some of them
 They knew was test equipment you know stuff we were testing and some of it
 They didn't know what it was and then you have the stories of the men in black a
 Ultra secret government agency or maybe not even of this world also investigating this stuff
 Russia you have the KGB and if you're like hey, I saw something weird in the sky
 *Laughs*
 Basically got punched in the stomach for a couple days until you
 Until you either said you didn't see something in the sky because it was part of their secret
 Warfare their weapon testing stuff or they wanted to know if you were a
 US spy or you know you were crazy or whatever like people were not people were not openly admitting they saw UFOs
 But once the iron curtain fell once the KGB became they just changed the letters in their name. They're still
 Anyways, I want to get beat up. Who are they now grew? I think it is GRU
 But yeah, they they stopped punching so much. I think nowadays now
 I think they only just go with a right hook for a while and then they let you go
 But you would now that the iron curtain has fallen the Soviet Union has fallen. We're getting a ton of stories out of the
 Russia region, which is cool for us, but let's take a look at this one in particular
 When I read this I thought
 You we covered a story recently about a guy who went crazy during a UFO encounter and wanted to like join the aliens
 I'll try to find that episode in the show notes. It was late last season
 I'm trying to remember what what the exact details was but I think it was two friends and one of them wanted to stay and he had
 To be like forced or one of them wanted to go with the aliens and he had to be forced to stay
 Something like that and then I had this story as well and I thought how stressful must this be?
 Like how the situation of already being confronted with something
 That yeah, sure
 I believe in aliens and I think the recent poll was like 52% of Americans believe that
 Extraterrestrials exist, but a big amount of those numbers are sure. Yeah, somewhere in the universe. There's alien life
 Like that's a huge chunk of that to actually the people actually believe were regularly being visited by aliens the numbers much smaller
 So even if you I you know, I believe in aliens, but if all of a sudden I'm confronted with an alien life form
 I would imagine it'd be very very stressful. You notice on a lot of these alien stories
 We just covered one yesterday the first the alien say is be calm
 Calm down that is almost always the first thing the aliens say even the ones that appear in human form say hey chill
 Okay, be cool
 Because it would be extremely stressful to meet an alien because all of a sudden you have your whole paradigm shift
 Even if you believe in aliens now, it's proof and if you mildly believe in aliens
 It's proof of something that you kind of considered and if you don't believe in aliens at all this world shattering
 It could destroy your entire way you look at reality
 So that's already stressful enough now imagine
 Experiencing it with total strangers or people you know kind of well these campers
 They forged friendships along the way camp counselors
 They might not even like some of these kids. They're just doing the job. It's just kind of a regular assemblage of people and
 Then this happens
 And you're thrust into this life-changing event that you don't know how it's gonna end
 I mean we're reading the story later and it's just something that I'm talking about in a haunted closet
 But it's a moment in time. They have no idea how it's going to end
 Is this the first wave of an invasion? Is everyone gonna get nuked off the area? Is everyone gonna get abducted?
 You don't know so there's that level of stress
 You're being confronted with the unknown in front of a bunch of people that you barely know which would make it even worse
 And then one of the one of these Nimrods decides to make the situation worse by running towards them
 Like there's all just such a level of stress to this story that I find fascinating and that young
 Woman running out after him grabbing him and dragging him back. Like I don't know if I would
 I mean, I guess it is her job to keep him safe. She's a camp counselor, but
 So you have all of that you have all of that stress on there, right?
 Someone trying to actually go towards this unknown force and then really the ultimate question is what was prompting him to do that
 It could have been two things. It could have been
 The idea that the aliens were communicating with him, which again is very common in UFO lore
 You have aliens sending telepathic messages and selecting people
 A lot of times they say aliens only appear to you if you are chosen. That's why not everyone sees UFOs and then
 There's even a time we've covered couple stories like this where the aliens
 Choose you and then they run a test on you and say no, you're not going to meet our needs and they leave you
 So there does seem to be some sort of selection process was he selected
 But then also you got to wonder if his brain just broke
 Like if he wasn't selected the aliens were there for some other reason and this kid confronted with something
 1980 Russia even in America in the 1980s
 Like we were aware of little green men and it was more of a jokey thing with aliens
 Like people who believed in aliens when I was a kid were considered cuckoo
 cuckoo like total wackadoodle they'd write these books and stuff like that in tinfoil hats
 And that and that was in a place where you had freedom of press and people were putting out these books like chariots of the gods
 And you were able to watch these shows
 Like in search of Leonard Nimoy's
 Documentary and all that stuff
 Imagine in a repressive government where information is completely controlled and you didn't have that stuff
 You probably didn't even have star trek. You were vaguely aware of aliens. Maybe
 in 1980s Russia
 And you're being confronted with this if we saw a giant
 Vehicle descend from the sky at least we can put it into context mean like oh that might be aliens
 But if you had no concept of aliens you're 14 15 years old growing up in this area, it would totally break your brain
 I think you wouldn't be able to I think I think it would break your brain
 Even if you didn't know about aliens if you're a valiant. I've seen a couple episodes of the x-files
 Great alien watch your room. You're not gonna be like hey, what's up? How's molder doing?
 It's still gonna affect you but imagine if you didn't have any context for it and you saw that happening
 So was this kid actually being contacted by the aliens or did was the event so traumatic?
 He broke
 I think I lean more towards the telepathic thing because when the vehicle left he seemed to return to normal but
 My thing is if the aliens we've seen their power level before if they wanted him they would have marched right into that camp and taken him
 They would have frozen everyone in the camp the kid would have been gone missing
 Right right from the bedsheets. We've seen the power level of these things. So maybe he just went nuts
 Which is again a very terrifying answer because how can you really
 How do we know how we're really going to react to when we're placed in a situation such a stressful situation like that?
 Will we be able to kind of keep our wits about us or will we find ourselves running towards?
 the unknown because
 At this point everything's unknown everything you ever thought about the world is
 wrong
 You see this giant ship land and you realize that
 everything you've been told that rationally
 Happens and rationally exists just doesn't the rules of the universe has changed creepy telepathic communication or did the kid go insane?
 We don't know
 But an interesting story and i'm glad I could share it with you the last kwam kwat
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonic copter. We're leaving behind russia
 We are heading all the way out to
 a small town
 On the edge of the woods
 I found this story on the export so as much as I love the export it does have the limitations of
 Everyone they're post anonymously
 We don't have names. We don't have dates. We don't even have a location for this story, but that's fine
 Right, it's still I think a very very interesting tale
 But I from what I can put together there's a key detail that makes me think this story takes place somewhere in
 Western europe it could be totally wrong about that it doesn't affect the story too much but just
 Because kwam kwat's flying the carbonic copter. I think we're going to be somewhere in western europe
 Because we're going to be visiting a bar
 That is centuries old
 In america america is only about 200 and some odd years old
 So I don't think it takes place in america. I think it takes place somewhere in britain or france or something like that
 So just fly the carbonic copter and we're just going to jump up jump out of the carbonic copter somewhere around this region
 And we're going to meet a young man named mark. That's your real name just a guess
 but mark
 Is at a crossroads in his life when the story takes place. He's 23 years old. He's in between jobs
 He doesn't seem like he's had a very pleasant experience
 in life
 He says that his dad was kind of a jerk
 And taught him, you know never back down from a fight never turn your back on someone
 Always got them fist raised if someone's challenging you and those while those may be good lessons in context
 They can also serve you very very poorly if your boss is like mark where's your reports?
 Come on. Don't make me fire you and you're like what'd you say to me?
 I'm like there are certain times where you have to be like, uh
 But mark does have a caveat to that because again you sometimes do have to back down from fights
 One thing he also learned
 Because this kid seems like he goes out a lot to a lot of clubs a lot of drinking and he's been in a lot of fights
 Mark said one thing that I've learned is I take my social cues
 From my friends. So if we go out to a club and some guys talk in trash
 And all my friends are like, let's just get out of here. Whatever this club sucks. Anyways, he goes all go with my friends
 He goes if we're there and they want to square up and fight i'm down
 I'll be the first one to fight but he's not going to put his friends in a situation where
 They don't want to be in basically he goes if they're ready to go. He's ready to go if they're ready to fight
 He's ready to fight but
 If he's not getting those social cues
 It's almost like his dad is whispering in his ear. Don't back down
 Mark he's in between jobs and in his best friend
 He says mark, you know what, you know, you're not doing anything right now
 Why don't you come and hang out with my family for a couple weeks? I'm gonna go back visit my family
 We live out on the outskirts of the forest
 Some sort of fairy tale gingerbread village. We live out in the boonies
 But once you come to hang out with us, my family's really cool. They'd love to have you
 And so mark and his friend we'll call his friend peter
 Mark and peter go out to see peter's family and mark is impressed. His family is super cool
 He's exactly kind of what he needed right now. He just kind of didn't need
 some chill time
 But peter's grandpa while seeming like a cool guy is
 quiet
 But not quiet in the way that he's shy before he says something you can tell he
 Thinks about what he's going to say. He considers
 the phrases he uses
 Doesn't speak all the time, but when he speaks it means something
 And when that first night they're all hanging out grandpa turns to mark and says, you know, you're a city boy
 so
 Make sure you're in the house
 before nightfall
 mark thinks this comment's kind of weird, but he understands he is coming from a city and here's this old man
 Who's lived his entire life in this region?
 mark says, you know
 That's nice. That's nice that you're warning me and all but don't worry about me. I'm not just a city boy
 I've actually been hunting. I've spent some time in the woods
 And the grandpa looked at mark and said
 Not these woods
 And mark thought this comment was kind of odd
 And it made him really curious, right? Here's this old man
 Doesn't speak of things lightly. All right. This is just the presence that this grandpa gives and mark asked
 What do you mean about that?
 And as the grandpa begins to mention
 Something about the woods something being in the woods
 The rest of peters family kind of cuts off grandpa changes the subject
 And the grandpa just drops it
 One night all the men in the family go out to this local bar
 So you got mark you got peter you got grandpa
 And then you have peter's dad and peter's uncle and they're going out to this bar
 And they make sure to tell mark thought this was another odd thing as they're going to the bar they kept
 Making sure that mark knew how old this bar was. They said the bar we're about to go to is older than your great
 great grandpa
 This bar is centuries old
 Mark's like, yeah, okay, you know, I don't know if like you're warning me the plumbing doesn't work or anything
 He goes they really really kept emphasizing how old this bar was
 Mark didn't really think anything of it a neat piece of trivia. Sure, but you only got to say it once you don't got to keep
 reemphasizing it
 Walks into normal bar
 Right. I mean it is old
 But you know barkeep
 patrons tables and most importantly alcohol kind of what you need for a bar
 So mark's sitting there with peter's family. They're sitting around drinking
 Talking having a good time
 And then at one point in the night
 Mark is drinking his beer and he looks over at peter and peter
 Is nervous
 He's giving off this energy right now
 That he doesn't want to be here anymore and mark picks up on it right away and he looks and sees what
 Peter's looking at and then peter immediately looks down at the table
 But mark is now looking across the bar
 and what he realizes is
 Everyone is gone. The bar is empty now save for this group of men
 And a dude sitting by the door
 Even the bartender is gone
 Mark looks at this figure sitting by the door and he sees kind of a
 He looks like a big guy not overly large, but
 And before he can really take in any more detail he feels
 grandpa's hand dig into
 his bicep
 Grandpa has mark's arm in a death grip
 And he turns and he looks back at grandpa
 And grandpa while holding mark's arm squeezing it is staring down at the table
 Mark is looking at the table that he's at and everyone is just staring down at the table
 No one is moving the room
 is tense
 And mark thinks maybe this guy's like some super high level criminal in the area right?
 He's not familiar with this area. This could be some big drug runner. It could be
 No one hit man in the area some sort of organized crime guy, but
 This feels different
 Sure people may be deferential towards a crime lord and their area are just scared
 But something is different here
 And he turns to get another look at the man
 And grandpa squeezes mark's arm even harder so hard now
 It's hurting him
 And that is when peter nudges
 mark
 And hisses don't
 look
 And right when peter says that
 The man at the door gets up out of his chair
 And begins walking towards the table
 Mark is sitting there and he looks up at this guy
 As he's walking towards him and he gets a better look at him. He has
 Shockingly red hair
 He's young ish. He's a youngish man broad-shouldered
 But normal looking
 Not covered in these crazy tattoos doesn't look like he's been in a thousand bar fights. Doesn't look like some sort of crazy criminal
 Just a normal looking guy
 walking towards them
 And mark is drunk at this point
 And he's looking at the table of his compatriots and he's wondering what do I do?
 He's looking for that social cue
 Now if everyone at the table said let's get up and leave he would have got up and left with him
 And he can tell that there is obviously something going on at this table. They're scared of him
 But what do I do?
 This guy's walking towards us now
 Do I look down at my drink like that doesn't make sense to me? He's walking towards us
 Mark is sitting there at the table. He makes direct eye contact with the man
 And the man stops in the center of the bar
 Mark looks deep into the stranger's eyes and says
 What are you looking at?
 When he says that
 grandpa lets go of mark's arm
 And everyone at that table is just pretending that none of this is happening. They're just silently staring
 down at the table trying to ignore
 Reality
 Mark gets up
 He's holding his beer in one hand. He walks over to the stranger and says we got a problem
 Stranger's just staring at mark
 And now for the first time this evening
 Mark feels it
 He feels like he's
 tapped into this energy that everyone else
 was feeling
 Something is wrong here
 Mark is staring at this young man and mark starts to wonder
 Is this guy even human?
 He's terrified
 He's petrified in a way. He's never been scared like this before
 But he doesn't know how to back down. He's almost too terrified to even move
 So what he does is the same bombastic
 Comments that you always make in a club when you're getting ready to fight
 It's time for you to leave buddy
 Trying to
 Bluff his way out of this trying to get the guy to turn around and walk away
 But all mark wants to do
 is walk away
 He feels like he's going to piss his pants right there his pride
 And his fear are colliding in this moment
 He can't back down
 But he just wants to disappear
 And when pride and fear collide it makes you make dumb decisions and mark raises his right fist
 He's just going to do what he always does. He's going to knock this stranger out
 And as he raises his fist to throw a punch
 The stranger catches his hand
 And immediately mark's skin begins to burn
 He said the guy got a hold of his right wrist. He just grabbed it
 Mid punch and this guy's grip is holding right onto him and he goes it felt like his skin was acid
 I could feel it burning my skin
 I didn't know what this dude was. I didn't know I couldn't even comprehend what could actually be happening
 Was this guy was this guy like a chemical worker? Was he secreting some sort of caustic fluid?
 and almost
 The the pain was so intense
 My brain was just kind of not working. I'm screaming in pain
 And I also remember at this point. I'm holding a beer in my left hand and I smash it against this guy's face
 I let out this deep roar and I just lay a left right into this dude's face
 And the dude let me go
 When that beer smashed into the stranger's face
 He released my right wrist
 turned
 silently walked away
 And then he left the bar
 But my wrist continued to burn
 I'm looking down at my wrist
 Trying to figure out how he did that trying to figure out when this pain would go away when the bar keep walks back in from a back room
 Pretending like none of this ever happened
 Peter's family gets up from the booth
 They're immediately asking is everything okay. How's everything going? Are you fine?
 And I bluff yeah
 Yeah, I'm fine. Just need another drink is all
 But I'm terrified
 And they know I'm terrified
 We go back to Peter's family's house
 drinking
 playing cards
 Just talking
 We stay up
 until the sun rises even grandpa
 stayed up
 till the morning
 Which is good because I didn't want to go to sleep
 And we drank and we played cards and we talked
 But we never talked
 about what happened in that bar
 Life goes on, you know, I was just visiting for a couple weeks
 I go back to the city
 Start looking for work just continue my life
 but
 To this day
 Mark's wrist
 Is numb
 He says right where that guy touched me. I have no feeling in that part of my wrist. It's completely numb
 He said I went to the doctor get a check down and he had this little pin
 And he kept poking it. He says he poked it 10 times. I can't feel anything and the doctor goes
 Based on your symptoms. I think you had a mild stroke
 But you definitely have no feeling you definitely cannot feel anything in your wrist
 And he's told this story. He was talking about one of his girlfriends. He said that she was just a weirdo
 When she would bite it she would bite his wrist as hard as she could
 He wouldn't feel it
 And he told her about what happened at the bar, but she just said I think the doctor is right
 I think he just had a mild stroke. I don't believe anyone could be carrying acid on their skin or whatever
 Maybe another bite on your wrist will persuade me
 And he says
 When I look back on that situation, I think that I came out of it on sheer luck
 This thing could have taken me apart
 But I escaped
 Just out of
 luck
 He didn't overwhelm it with physical force. He didn't scare it away
 The thing
 Decided not to kill him. It wasn't because of anything
 That mark did his life was literally in this stranger's hands
 And he says he's asked his friend because obviously his friend was familiar with this person
 Right friend was nervous the second he realized this guy was in the bar. He asked his friend
 He's asked him a couple times. Hey, what was that?
 You know now that he's safely at home and life has returned normal
 What was up with that guy at the bar and his friend?
 Responds when he asked this question his friend responds quote
 It doesn't matter now
 And it's better you don't know
 Unquote
 It's fascinating story obviously the idea of cryptids being in the woods being on the outskirts that is as old as humanity the werewolf in between towns
 But when you it would make sense that you would have some of these beings interacting with us in our
 infrastructure in our big cities would be perfect for cryptids to hunt
 sewage sewage systems
 Obviously subways things like that
 But bars as well
 Right and you think this was a some sort of cryptid that came out of the woods something old and ancient that the people in this area knew of
 And they knew to avoid
 And I keep using the word cryptid but I actually have another theory for what this could be
 Recently, I think it was a week or two ago. I did an episode the missing 411
 multidimensional man-bear demons versus the us army and in that one we were talking about the nephilim
 We were talking about giants living up at where was it mount sin helens mount shasta one of the two
 giant
 red-headed
 nephilim
 right
 And the idea of the red hair being connected to the nephilim is very very common in
 Modern nephilim lore. I don't think it's actually in the bible where it's specified. They have red hair
 But on a lot of modern accounts that are connected to giants or to the nephilim the nephilim are when an angel and a human woman have a child
 It's
 known as the nephilim red hair is very commonly connected to we did an episode about
 Do the nephilim look like clowns? Is that why people find clowns so terrifying because they have pale skin and red hair?
 And i'm wondering if that's what this could have been as well
 Now nephilim they're usually these giant eight foot tall people
 But again, that's kind of a misnomer in the bible. It says the nephilim these men were giants heroes of renown
 um, and it may be not necessarily a giant physical stature
 But a giant reputation a character like hercules for example
 Was not physically eight nine feet tall, but he was giant in the sense that
 Everyone knew who he was. He was a hero
 So is that what he faced down?
 This man this human looking person with red hair, but the heart
 of a corrupted angel
 A creature something not of this world or of heaven or of hell, but something else
 All of them and nothing at the same time
 That operates in this area
 And the people in town know well enough that when he walks into this bar or when he walks anywhere in town
 That part of town shuts down and you just pretend that he's not there
 But he is
 A terrifying story because it could have gone either way whether this guy was ecripted
 Whether this guy was a nephilim or just some lunatic drug lord who happened to shoot acid out of his hands
 Uh mark could have easily just disappeared right and the fact that this town was so terrified to even acknowledge the sky's existence
 Had this guy ripped mark apart in front of all these witnesses and then left the bar
 Mark would have just disappeared
 They would have cleaned up the area and they would have kept a code of silence like they already keep a code of silence
 This is a town of secrets
 And whoever this individual was
 His identity was known to the people in the town or at least his reputation was
 They knew this guy was not
 from around here
 And they kept this secret
 They hoped when they took mark out to the bar that they would never even meet this guy, right?
 But he did show up and an outsider had an encounter with him
 He didn't know the rules. He didn't know how you're supposed to deal with the stranger, but
 To everyone else in town. This wasn't a stranger. It was
 A phenomenon they knew
 to avoid
 One of the things that I think's easy to forget about stories like this is they are told by survivors
 And there are countless stories where people go missing or people die
 And we are left wondering what happened
 And we never know
 We don't know if it was a natural death or a natural disappearance falling down a crevasse or something like that
 Because the only time we know that it's paranormal when someone survives it and says man, you won't believe what happened
 I was out at a russian summer camp and the ufo showed up
 Or I went to a bar and I ran into someone who wasn't quite human because this town was so good at keeping secrets was so good at following
 the rules
 To avoid these things that had mark lost this fight had this creature completely
 decimated mark
 They would have just cleaned up the mess
 and gone on with their lives
 peter would have a horrible secret
 He invited his best friend to hang out with him
 And he got his best friend killed
 But the world would never know this story
 It would just be one more secret
 In a town full of secrets
 But we know about this story because mark survived
 The world of the paranormal is only known
 Because of people who make it back alive
 So think about that
 Before you hope to someday see proof
 That aliens or ghosts or cryptids exist
 Because you may find proof but
 You may not be lucky enough to live to tell the tale
