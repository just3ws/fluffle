1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 How easy is it to haunt your own life?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,720
 What would you do if your dream girl turned out to be a real nightmare?

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,760
 Now I take a look at the story of a young man who was sleeping on a couch one night

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,200
 when a shadow man walked down the hallway.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,640
 And this time, the shadow man brought some friends.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a good day.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,880
 I hope you guys are having a good day too and I hope you guys have some cool Halloween

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
 plans.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,560
 Someone who I can always count on having cool Halloween plans.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,200
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command dressed up as Baby Yoda in the Squid Games, it's Alexander

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,360
 Ribbaum, everyone give a round of applause to Alexander walking in in the two most popular

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,640
 Halloween costumes this year.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,080
 Alexander, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,080
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,520
 Just help spread the word about the show.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,200
 That really means a lot.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
 That is how shows like this grow.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,520
 So please let your friends and your family know how much fun you have listening to Dead

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,520
 Rabbit Radio.

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,600
 Speaking of fun, look at this fan art for Fan Art Friday made by Lord Cute Things.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 Look at that.

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 Look at that little, you're like, "Dude, I'm driving a car."

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,640
 Quit telling me to look at my podcast.

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,560
 If you can't see it right now, it's a picture of a little bunny with a radio in him.

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
 And now people are pulling over their cars, they're like, "Okay, I gotta find out.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,720
 Is this a drawing or is this like some maniac took a photo of this?"

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 It's a picture of a, it's a drawing of a radio in a bunny and although the bunny looks

30
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,080
 sad and although the bunny looks sad, that is deceiving.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,680
 He's happy because he's part of the fluffle because he also listens to Dead Rabbit Radio.

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,840
 Alexander, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,440
 We got this little bunny with us.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,120
 We are headed all the way out to Poland.

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
 And while we're headed out to Poland, I wanted to share this with you.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,560
 I have been having, for the first time in like 10, 15 years maybe, I have been having

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,600
 some legitimate paranormal phenomenon happen to me.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,720
 And you go, "Jason, you did a live stream recently where you said you thought you saw

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,560
 shadow people running around a house you were house sitting."

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,880
 So how does it, well, that's true.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,840
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,360
 That was a live stream when we did, but.

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,440
 I'm not saying that I haven't seen things here and there.

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,760
 I did that episode where I saw a cryptid when I was walking through town here.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
 Twice.

47
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 I saw it twice.

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
 I didn't know it was a cryptid at the time.

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,120
 I have no idea what it was, but I found out later it was called a crawler.

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
 So that popped up and I saw those shadow people and I had my haunted apartment for a while

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,320
 where I see the old man in my closet.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,160
 The closet that I'm currently sitting in the dark recording this episode.

53
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
 Creepy.

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,880
 And then the bloated dead man on my couch.

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
 I remember looking over at him.

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,360
 I'll put all these episodes in the show notes, but those were all singular events.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,080
 What's been happening this past week, I woke up.

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,520
 This is, this actually has never happened to me.

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,360
 And you read about this all the time in spooky things.

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,800
 I woke up in the middle of the night for whatever reason.

61
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,880
 And when I got up out of bed, I heard music playing in the other room.

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,720
 But I went into the other room and my cell phone, which I normally listen to Pandora

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,240
 with was playing just started.

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,760
 Like I had not interacted with it at all for hours, right?

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,080
 I go to bed, it's not playing.

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
 There's no alarms set on it because that phone is only for my music.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
 That's all that.

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
 It's like a phone that I don't pay monthly service for.

69
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,840
 So I have one cell phone for music and then one cell phone for an actual phone.

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,520
 And I thought that's weird, but as a singular event, nothing huge, right?

71
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,120
 And then a couple odd things happened.

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,560
 Yesterday, the day before I was a half hour late getting home because a dog was just running

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
 around my house.

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,760
 It was like running across the street.

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,000
 That's not paranormal, right?

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,480
 That's just more irritating because I'm not going to let the dog get as I'm standing in

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 the middle of the road.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,000
 I don't like nervous dogs.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,880
 I do not like nervous dogs.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,480
 One story I have not told on this podcast is that time I had to fight in a keto.

81
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,920
 It's not fun and I don't like nervous dogs and I don't like big dogs walking down the

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,480
 street, but I don't want to see it get hurt.

83
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
 And so I'm like, oh great, I'm standing in the road.

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 I'm calling the police.

85
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
 I have a little bat I carry with me.

86
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,000
 I had that out.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,680
 And luckily it looks like a flashlight so I don't look like a bobby from the 1800s.

88
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,520
 But anyways, that's not paranormal.

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
 That was just annoying.

90
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,640
 But then last night, I was over at my friend's house and we were watching Squid Game.

91
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,200
 Now her house is the house that I live streamed from and it, she says, yeah, I didn't want

92
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,680
 to tell you this because I know you're a big old spook baby, but my house is hot.

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,680
 She told me this after I did the episode about seeing the shadowman there.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,000
 She goes, she kind of kept your mouth shut.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,400
 And then later she goes, yeah, my house is haunted.

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
 It's totally haunted.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,840
 Yeah, it's been haunted for years.

98
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,160
 And she goes, when I'm alone, she can hear people walk in the front door and walk through

99
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
 the kitchen.

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 She goes, I hear it constant.

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,280
 Sometimes it's noisier than other times, but it's constant.

102
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,120
 And that house that she lives in used to be a church.

103
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,240
 And she said once when they were doing work under the house, under where the altar area

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:12,680
 is, which is where the bedroom is now, they found a cat skull and a wand.

105
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,280
 So I mean, if you just found a cat skull under the bed, you know, that's Jerry finally won.

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,840
 But the fact that they found the cat skull and a homemade wand made them think something

107
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,760
 else was going on and that was under where the Christian altar was.

108
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,160
 So she told me that and I was like, yeah, you know, I figured I saw this weird shadowman.

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
 But that livestream was a couple of months ago.

110
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,140
 Well, I was watching Squid Game with her the other day and you curious about my review

111
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
 of Squid Game, right?

112
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,320
 I brought it up a couple of times.

113
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,280
 The ending was awful.

114
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,280
 What a waste of time.

115
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,760
 What a waste of time.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
 I was so disappointed.

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,600
 I was so disappointed that I'm glad this ghost story happened.

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,880
 Otherwise, I would have been a total waste of my time to even go over there.

119
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
 We're sitting there watching that awful ending awful.

120
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,200
 We're sitting there watching Squid Game.

121
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,560
 And without really comprehending it, this is so weird.

122
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,000
 This was so weird because I've seen shadowmen full on.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,480
 I've seen these shadow dogs full on.

124
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,760
 I've had things mimic my voice.

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,600
 I've had all these weird experiences.

126
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:36,280
 I'm sitting there with this girl and I hear the front door open.

127
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,240
 Someone walk in.

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,400
 Someone walk in behind them.

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,600
 And a set of keys thrown onto the kitchen counter.

130
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:59,040
 And I turned not in fear because I knew no one was coming over.

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,760
 I turned as if I expected to see some long lost friends.

132
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,760
 Like so many times when I've been at parties in the past or friends houses in the past

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,320
 and you're sitting there and you're having a good time and you're waiting for

134
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,280
 more of your friends to show up, you hear the door open.

135
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
 I heard distinct.

136
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,000
 I couldn't tell you what they were saying, but it sounded like two people talking.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,080
 One coming in a couple steps behind.

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,640
 You can hear that it was fascinating.

139
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,720
 You could hear the distance in their voices because one's a little bit more around the

140
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
 corner.

141
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,600
 And as one of them is walking into the kitchen, they throw their keys on the counter and makes

142
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,160
 that unmistakable sound.

143
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,080
 When I said that sound, you guys all knew what that sounded like.

144
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,480
 Keys on a kitchen counter.

145
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,080
 We've all done it our entire adult life.

146
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,880
 And we've heard other people do it.

147
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:53,720
 And it was such an instinctual sound that I turned and expected to see Josh Moore,

148
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,840
 Meyer and Jason Campbell walking into the kitchen or Steve Daimwood and Jacob Camp.

149
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,680
 It was fascinating.

150
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,160
 And when I turned and I looked, I halfway was wondering if the girl was going to turn

151
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
 and look too.

152
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:16,120
 It was clearly that we both heard it and it's clear that we were both awaiting more friends.

153
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,080
 But I turned and looked and no one was there.

154
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,760
 And as I was turning my head back to watch Squid Game, I realized that was that was a

155
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,600
 ghost walking in.

156
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,280
 That was that.

157
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,400
 Listen, it could have been a bunch of different things.

158
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,500
 There could have been a bunch of mice running in.

159
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,120
 It could have been Tom's revenge over his fallen ancestor.

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
 It could have been my imagination.

161
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,880
 It could have been the thrilling, gripping conclusion of Squid Game being so disappointing

162
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,480
 my mind manufactured this to have something interesting to talk about.

163
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,040
 But it's I think it was a ghost.

164
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
 And I think that's what she was hearing.

165
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,720
 And she might be hearing something inner in that's more of her experience.

166
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,220
 And to me, all the times I've been at parties and all the times I've been over at Friends

167
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,100
 House and friends have been over at my house.

168
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,380
 That unmistakable sound of people walking in and throwing their keys on the counter.

169
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,780
 That is clearly what I heard.

170
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,100
 And it made me feel like home.

171
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,060
 Made me feel like fun times in the past.

172
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,220
 Fascinating haunting.

173
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,860
 I go over there quite a lot.

174
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
 So I don't know, will this just be a one off thing?

175
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
 I don't know.

176
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,980
 But in the past week, I have had some, all of that's happened in a week.

177
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,420
 You can remove the dog thing if you want.

178
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,720
 And there was just weird that again, again with the dog thing, you don't want to go

179
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,600
 too much into coincidences.

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,360
 But I show up and there's probably four other people following the stalk.

181
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,480
 Some people are going to restaurants.

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,320
 Some people are no one else had a cell phone on them.

183
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
 I go, have you called the police yet?

184
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
 They're, I don't have my cell phone.

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,520
 I left it in the car.

186
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,200
 Oh, yeah, no.

187
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,880
 So I had to stay there.

188
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,280
 I'm on the phone with the cops and blocking traffic.

189
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,480
 And okay, maybe that's not fair.

190
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,480
 Normal.

191
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,900
 Maybe I just want to complain about people letting their dog loose because he wasn't

192
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,380
 like a stray dog.

193
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,420
 But anyways, that's my other podcast.

194
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,860
 I forgot live dog radio.

195
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,340
 Keep those dogs alive, but take better care of them.

196
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,940
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead and toss you.

197
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,460
 We're driving the dead rabbit, dirgeable to Poland.

198
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,180
 I'm actually going to skip the Poland story right now.

199
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,180
 We're going to move on.

200
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
 We'll save that for later.

201
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,180
 He's like, damn it.

202
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,780
 I've wanted to go to Poland.

203
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,220
 Well, look down there.

204
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,220
 You see that?

205
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,220
 That's Poland.

206
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,800
 That should be good enough for your Patreon money.

207
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 Thank you.

208
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
 Alexander, I'm going to go ahead.

209
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,160
 We're going to skydive out of the dead rabbit, dirgeable.

210
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,880
 We're not even landing this bad boy.

211
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,400
 We're going to skydive right into the carpenter copter and I'm going to throw you those keys.

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,520
 We are leaving behind Poland.

213
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:55,720
 We are headed all the way out to North Carolina.

214
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,040
 Squid games was so disappointing.

215
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 It was bad.

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,980
 It was a waste of my time.

217
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,860
 The second episode was probably my favorite episode.

218
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,980
 I think episodes one and two, they alone told a great story.

219
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,740
 But dude, boo, episode whatever that was, nine.

220
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,700
 You know what else I'm watching though is I'm watching Chucky.

221
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,620
 I'm watching the Chucky TV series.

222
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,180
 You're like, Jason, hold on.

223
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,940
 Are you about to tell me that the Chucky TV series is better than Squid Game?

224
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,060
 It is, dude.

225
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,580
 Alexander is flying us all the way out to North Carolina.

226
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,920
 It's November 1982.

227
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,360
 There's a young man, let's call him Steve.

228
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
 It's nighttime.

229
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,560
 The lights are off.

230
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,200
 The raccoons are out.

231
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,480
 There's probably a pigeon taking a nap.

232
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:51,040
 But in Steve's girlfriend's house, he is as snug as a bug in a rug.

233
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,080
 It was nice and warm here because his girlfriend's stove was still emanating heat.

234
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:04,900
 One was on Warp Corps for Star Trek, but it's keeping him warm.

235
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,740
 You know, one of those heater stoves, one of those stoves where it's heating the room.

236
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,940
 It's one of those.

237
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,780
 And in the middle of the night though, he wakes up.

238
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,220
 His eyes are kind of adjusting to the pitch black room.

239
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:26,900
 He's looking around and everything seems normal, but his eyes are drawn to a long hallway.

240
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:35,080
 And when he's looking down this pitch black hallway, he sees something.

241
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,200
 Against all logic, he sees something.

242
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,000
 Because while there is no light to make out any definition of what's going on down that

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,280
 hallway, he sees a man standing there.

244
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,000
 A shadow man.

245
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,840
 A shadow so black.

246
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,420
 So impossibly black.

247
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,820
 It stands out in the darkness.

248
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,940
 The shadow man that I've seen have that same detail.

249
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:17,860
 You shouldn't be able to see pitch black in pitch black.

250
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:26,820
 Which makes you realize that this is something outside of our physics, outside of our reality.

251
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,640
 And you're looking at this thing and your brain triggers something.

252
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,440
 This is real, but this is impossible.

253
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 The shadow man that Steve is looking at in the hallway is so tall.

254
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,840
 He has to bend his head forward to fit.

255
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,380
 Steve's looking at this thing and this thing is looking at Steve.

256
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,220
 And Steve's mind is going wild.

257
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
 He can't comprehend what he's looking at.

258
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,680
 He tries to speak.

259
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,180
 Nothing comes out.

260
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,860
 And the panic rises and he starts to scream, barely a whisper.

261
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,340
 The room grows colder, almost freezing.

262
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:30,380
 And he watches this shadow man begin to glide down the hallway.

263
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:37,400
 He said once it got into the room and made a curious path, it walked along the wall.

264
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,960
 It didn't make a beeline straight towards the couch.

265
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,460
 It seemed to move around the room and it passed through solid objects.

266
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,520
 The physics of our world do not apply to the shadow men.

267
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,360
 As the shadow man is standing over Steve, Steve comes to the conclusion that this thing

268
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,140
 is pure, unredeemable evil.

269
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,380
 It's not a guardian spirit.

270
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,100
 It's not a wandering soul.

271
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,440
 It is something that redefines the word demonic.

272
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,300
 It is nothing but the horrors of the universe.

273
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,140
 Personified.

274
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:29,740
 In the presence of such raw negative energy, Steve feels his mind go numb.

275
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,180
 He can't even comprehend what's standing there.

276
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:44,300
 And that's when he hears, faintly, like it's miles away somewhere.

277
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,440
 Laughter.

278
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,360
 Evil laughter.

279
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,000
 And he hears the sound grow.

280
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,680
 He hears it getting closer.

281
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 And he hears this laughter and it's laughter, not of this world.

282
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,320
 It's something that doesn't belong here, but he recognizes it as laughter and it grows.

283
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:21,220
 And he hears the conversations of several people, groups of people, like he's at a party.

284
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,300
 And then he hears a high-pitched woman's voice say, "Peerce above all the other noise of

285
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,360
 this ethereal celebration."

286
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,620
 We scared him to death.

287
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,660
 He begins to pray in his mind.

288
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:44,840
 It's the only thing he can think of. Whatever is going on is about to win.

289
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,720
 And as he's praying in his mind, he's finally able to yell out, "God help me!"

290
00:17:51,720 --> 00:18:00,260
 And the coldness of the room is instantly replaced with the heat emanating from the

291
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,760
 stove.

292
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:09,100
 It's funny, fascinating story.

293
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,460
 I didn't think of that.

294
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,000
 This is one of the things that's true.

295
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,360
 I had just decided today to tell the story about the ghost thing that happened last night.

296
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,860
 And oh, I was thinking about saving it for another episode and I just know this is super

297
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
 intriguing.

298
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,060
 Who knows what else is going to happen.

299
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,640
 And that was not my intended first story.

300
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,700
 It was the one about the dream girl.

301
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,040
 And then I'm doing this story and there's the party.

302
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,360
 And I didn't even think about that.

303
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,840
 I heard people coming into the room as if almost there was a celebration going on and

304
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,280
 this dude, this dude did not want to be at that party.

305
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,040
 So now I'm a little more sus about what was going on in that house to be honest.

306
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,320
 But looking at this story, looking at this story alone, it's very so creepy, right?

307
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,680
 Shadowmen have just a tendency to be probably one of the creepiest figures you can run into.

308
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,140
 Mostly it's the demon, like the actual horned or snake or like three headed one heads a

309
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,940
 dog, one heads a frog, one heads Tom.

310
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,860
 You know, you have this stuff.

311
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,900
 That type of stuff is creepy.

312
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,500
 But Shadowmen, because it's like something that imitates a human.

313
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,140
 It does have that uncanny valley thing.

314
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,460
 You're looking at someone, when you see a Shadowman, you're looking at someone and it's

315
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,860
 the outline of a human.

316
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,740
 It's the mimicry of a human.

317
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,000
 This is a ghost, which is we know what a ghost is.

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,520
 It's like there was a French maid who got her head chopped off during the French Revolution

319
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,240
 and now her sexy ghost is walking around somehow in Vermont for some reason.

320
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
 They took a cursed comb or something like that.

321
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,360
 We get that, right?

322
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,520
 It's like, oh, if I end up a ghost, I want to be like a cool ghost, right?

323
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,240
 I want to be haunting someplace cool.

324
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,480
 I don't want to be.

325
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,160
 That's why I only work in cool places.

326
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,460
 You know, in case I get to the capitated at work, I want to like haunt a Chuck E. Cheese.

327
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,660
 That would be dope.

328
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,380
 I don't think, could you imagine haunting a department store?

329
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,860
 You're walking through Macy's.

330
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,740
 You happen to take a shortcut.

331
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,900
 You're going through the lingerie department.

332
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
 Wait a second.

333
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,460
 I'd love to be a ghost in the lingerie department.

334
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,940
 But let's say I was in the hardware department.

335
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
 Right?

336
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,980
 Because I hate hardware.

337
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,820
 And I'm walking through and a saw falls on my head and chops me in half.

338
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,700
 It was a very, very poorly maintained store and a very, very sharp saw.

339
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,000
 And he goes, "Ew!"

340
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And cuts me in half.

341
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And now for the rest of eternity, I'm walking around the Lowe's.

342
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,640
 I'm hanging out at a home depot.

343
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,120
 That is hell for me.

344
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,440
 That would honestly doubt it.

345
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,640
 The only worst place I could die would be like a stadium.

346
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,880
 Well, I actually know that would be actually pretty dope too.

347
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
 Because I'd constantly be like, flowing around like kicking balls.

348
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,760
 You know, if you're in with all the games, you're like, we can no longer come to this

349
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
 arena.

350
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,480
 Apparently, apparently the ghost hates sports.

351
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 And he messes everything up.

352
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,660
 I'm a ghost in a NASCAR track while driving cars late at night.

353
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,900
 Like, ah, you used all of our gas in the races tomorrow.

354
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,860
 What are we going to do?

355
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,740
 But you'd want to be a ghost in a cool place.

356
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
 So that, whatever.

357
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,380
 I don't know how I got on that.

358
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,620
 But anyways, the other thing I want to talk about, this poor sap, right?

359
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,180
 And this guy sleeping on his couch.

360
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,620
 We don't know how he ended up on his girlfriend's couch.

361
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,660
 I'm assuming, I'm assuming that wasn't by choice.

362
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,280
 I'm assuming they got in a fight and she's dating the shadow man he found out.

363
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,640
 He's like, oh, if you keep cheating on me with that shadow man, she's like, what are

364
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
 you going to do?

365
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
 It's a shadow man.

366
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,040
 Like, what, what really are you going to do?

367
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,540
 You going to beat him up?

368
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,800
 We don't know why I was sleeping on the couch.

369
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,380
 We probably didn't have the best night anyways.

370
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,440
 And then, okay, that's a bad relationship thing.

371
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,720
 The other thing is this horrible monster coming at him down the hallway.

372
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,200
 That's a spooky image.

373
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,520
 Nobody likes looking down hallways.

374
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,740
 I'm sure hallway architects hate their job.

375
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,300
 And then you got like something floating at you from it.

376
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,380
 It's pure evil.

377
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,300
 But the way, all of that stuff alone is a really cool.

378
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,860
 That's a dead rabbit radio story.

379
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,980
 Spooky and it allows me to go off in a long tangent of where I want to hunt.

380
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:14,300
 But the party, that's, that's the, that's the thing that sets it apart from an average

381
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,340
 like spooky shadow man story.

382
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:23,180
 And I read it and I thought that, okay, with shadow man, I do believe that is some sort

383
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,720
 of interdimensional thing.

384
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,480
 And the idea of that, there's like a gathering, there's a party of these spirits of these

385
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
 demons of these shadow people, whatever you want to call them.

386
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,920
 And it's like, I imagine it like a real fancy party with like champagne glasses clinking.

387
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,480
 You hear a butler going, more champagne.

388
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 Would you like some?

389
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
 I phrased that weird.

390
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,700
 Would you like some more champagne?

391
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,140
 The butler just became, he just got hired.

392
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,660
 So don't, don't take it out on him.

393
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,540
 I imagine like a fancy dress party like squid game with all those fancy guys.

394
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,620
 That was so dumb.

395
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,800
 But anyways, you know, like a fancy party, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink,

396
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:19,240
 clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink,
